Optimal control in clinical practice often requires the use of therapy at varying doses. Availability of treatments at multiple strengths is therefore essential. These are results from a 6-month trial of combined mometasone furoate/formoterol (MF/F) 100/10 &#x003bc;g administered via a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) as treatment for asthma deterioration (ie, severe asthma exacerbation) and bronchoconstriction in asthmatics previously treated with low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in asthma subjects (&#x02265;12 years) on ICS with/without a long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist (LABA), subjects were assigned to 2 to 3 weeks of open-label MF 100 twice daily (BID), followed by 26 weeks of MF/F 100/10 &#x003bc;g, MF 100 F 10 or placebo (all BID). Co-primary endpoints were time to first asthma deterioration across the 26-week treatment period (MF/F versus F) and change from baseline to week 12 in serial (0&#x02212;12 hours) forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) (MF/F vs MF). Adverse events (AEs) were monitored.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>746 subjects (mean: age = 38.3 years, asthma duration = 14.77 years, FEV<sub>1</sub> % predicted = 75.08, reversibility = 18.69%, Asthma Control Questionnaire = 1.31) were randomized to 1 of the 4 treatment groups. MF/F increased the time to first asthma deterioration thus decreasing the proportion of subjects experiencing asthma deterioration during the study (MF/F = 16.5%; versus MF = 28.2% [<italic>P</italic> = 0.006]; versus F = 44.7% [<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001]; and vs placebo = 45.7% [<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001]). Mean FEV<sub>1</sub> AUC<sub>0&#x02013;12h</sub> over baseline at week 12 were MF/F = 4.00 L &#x000d7; h; MF = 2.53 L &#x000d7; h; F = 3.83 L &#x000d7; h; and placebo = 1.11 L &#x000d7; h. Low rates of AEs were observed and were similar between treatment arms.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In asthmatics previously treated with low-dose ICS with or without a LABA, MF/F 100/10 &#x003bc;g BID was more effective than placebo, MF, or F (all administered by MDI) in reducing asthma deteriorations and improving lung function.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
