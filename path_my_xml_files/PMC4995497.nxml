multimorbid patients from the deprived areas, voluntary organisations, general

important. Most participants welcomed the idea of additional self-management support,
though some practitioners were dubious about whether patients would use it. The pilot
study led to changes including a revised care plan, the inclusion of mindfulness-based
stress reduction techniques in the support of practitioners and patients, and the
stream-lining of the written self-management support material for patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We have co-designed and optimised an augmented primary care intervention involving a

within an individual, and is increasing common in populations across the world.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1742395316644304" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> In a large nationally
representative study of the epidemiology of multimorbidity in Scotland, we found that
multimorbidity was present in almost 25% of the population.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1742395316644304" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> In the 10% most deprived areas,
multimorbidity occurred 10&#x02013;15 years earlier than in the 10% least deprived areas.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1742395316644304" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> A similar social gradient
has also been found in several other studies.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1742395316644304" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-1742395316644304" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The burden of multimorbidity is higher in those living in more deprived
areas in terms of effect on quality of life.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1742395316644304" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> The combination of mental and physical
conditions (mental&#x02013;physical multimorbidity) is 2&#x02013;3 fold higher in the most deprived compared
with the least deprived areas<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1742395316644304" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and this is most pronounced in younger patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1742395316644304" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Mental&#x02013;physical
multimorbidity is associated with high levels of unplanned hospital admissions in the
deprived areas.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1742395316644304" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>
Primary care staff recognise the &#x02018;endless struggle&#x02019; that multimorbid patients living in the
deprived areas face in terms of managing daily life.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1742395316644304" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Patients have described in detail the
burdens that managing the &#x02018;everyday life work&#x02019; and living with complex social, psychological
and physical problems can create.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1742395316644304" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>The evidence-base for how best to manage patients with multimorbidity in primary care is
very limited, especially in the context of deprivation.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1742395316644304" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> In view of this, we established the &#x02018;Living
Well with Multimorbidity&#x02019; research programme in Scotland to develop a primary care-based
complex intervention for patients with multimorbidity in areas of high deprivation, using
the MRC guidance on developing complex interventions.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1742395316644304" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> We defined the scale of the problem and
the target population<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1742395316644304" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>
and carried out qualitative research with primary care practitioners working in the deprived
areas and with multimorbid patients living in such areas<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1742395316644304" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-1742395316644304" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> in order to explore the challenges of &#x02018;living well&#x02019; and how primary care
might better respond. From this baseline work, plus consideration of the wider literature on
patient-centred care and self-management support, and input and discussion with an
international advisory panel consisting of experts in the field of complex intervention
design, we identified the possible components of a whole systems approach. These were:</p><list list-type="alpha-lower" id="list1-1742395316644304"><list-item><p>System changes to allow longer consultations and relational continuity (seeing the

on qualitative focus group discussions with patients, patient representatives and primary
care providers working in areas of very high deprivation, and its optimisation following
piloting in two practices located in the high deprivation areas.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2-1742395316644304"><title>Methods</title><p>Separate approvals were obtained from the NHS Local Research Ethics Committee and NHS
Research &#x00026; Development for each phase of the study. Written informed consent was
obtained from all the study participants before data collection commenced.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-1742395316644304"><title>Defining and developing the intervention</title><p>Possible components of the proposed intervention were identified from the literature and by
expert consensus, and provided material for six group discussions with 32 participants in
all. These took the form of interactive workshops in which participants were first given a
summary of what was already known by SWM, and then took part in a group discussion which
provided the data reported in this paper. Two of the workshops were with patients; one with
5 participants and the other with 3 participants, each from one of two different practices
in the deprived areas of Glasgow. Four of the patients had taken part in previous
interviews<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1742395316644304" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and had
consented to future interviews, and four were recruited by the practices based on
eligibility criteria (two or more long-term conditions, and aged 30&#x02013;65 years). The ages of
those who took part ranged from 42 to 65 years (mean 54 years), and six out of the eight
were female. All had multimorbidity including conditions such as stroke, heart disease,
chronic back pain, arthritis, depression, asthma, cancer and hypertension.</p><p>Two of the workshops were with general practitioners (GPs) working in the deprived areas;
one with 3 participants and the other with 9 participants, all representing different
practices. One workshop was with practice nurses (PNs) working in the deprived areas; 4
participants representing different practices. The remaining workshop was with members of
different third sector organisations; 8 participants representing charitable organisations
concerned with a range of long-term conditions brought together by the Alliance for Health
and Social Care (formerly the Long-Term Conditions Alliance Scotland).</p><p>In each workshop, SWM presented the background to the study and the evidence to date,
including the epidemiological<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1742395316644304" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and qualitative &#x02018;baseline&#x02019; studies<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1742395316644304" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-1742395316644304" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> completed in the first phase of the Living Well with Multimorbidity
Programme. He then outlined the proposed intervention and its components. This information
was conveyed by means of a power-point talk lasting 15&#x02013;20&#x02009;min at the start of each group
together with printed hand-outs of the slides. In the GP and PN focus groups, he also
presented two models that could be used in the longer consultations to help structure them;
the 5 A&#x02019;s approach,<sup><xref rid="bibr11-1742395316644304" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>
which is a tool to support practitioners in delivering self-management support, and the CARE
Approach<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1742395316644304" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-1742395316644304" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> which is a holistic
approach to empathic, patient-centred care.</p><p>One qualitative researcher attended the meetings in addition to SWM and observed responses
to the presentations, took field notes and led the subsequent group discussions; RO attended
one meeting, and MH attended the others. The discussions were audio recorded with permission
and transcribed verbatim. The transcripts were subsequently coded and analysed by BF using
the framework approach.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1742395316644304" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Coding focused on participants&#x02019; views on each component of the
whole-system intervention: time and relational continuity, practitioner training and support
and self-management support. A sub-sample of the transcripts was double coded and
discrepancies were settled following discussion between the two coders (BF and SWM).
Findings were then discussed by the research team and formed the basis of the second
iteration of the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-1742395316644304"><title>Piloting and optimising the intervention</title><p>The second iteration of the proposed intervention was then piloted in two high deprivation
practices over a 3-month period. Practice A had 3500 patients registered, with 7 GP Partners
(most working part-time) and 2 PNs. Practice B had 4000 patients, 4 GP partners and 1 PN. In
Practice A, all the GP Partners and PNs participated in the study and in Practice B, 3 GPs
and the PN participated. Each participating practitioner was asked to identify 2 or 3
patients meeting the study inclusion criteria and offer them the opportunity to participate
in the study. The inclusion criteria were that patients should be aged between 30 and 65
years, and have at least two long-term conditions. The type of condition was not specified
and could be mental or physical. Exclusion criteria were (a) unable to give informed consent
including those with severe learning disability, severe active mental health problems
(active psychosis, schizophrenia, bipolar illness, psychotic depression, severe depression
including active suicidal ideation), severe dementia or other severe cognitive impairments,
(b) terminally ill or considered by their GP as likely to die within next 12 months, and (c)
unable to understand spoken and written English.</p><p>The focus of the pilot study was to explore patient selection, recruitment rates, and the
delivery of the intervention in relation to system changes, training and delivery of support
to practitioners, and the feasibility of data collection.</p><p>Following feedback from our work to develop the intervention, participating Practices were
presented with the core &#x02018;ingredients&#x02019; of the intervention but were allowed to adopt flexible
approaches as to how they operationalised it. For example, it was left to the practice to
decide who (GP or PNs) should deliver the longer consultations and provide continuity.
Practitioners offering longer consultations were given a bespoke CARE Plus care plan in
which to record the details of the consultations in relation to the pre-defined core
ingredients and as an aid to providing the CARE Approach (available from corresponding
author). They were also given a range of additional tools that they could use as they saw
fit in navigating the consultation (available from corresponding author). Finally, they were
also provided with copies of eight different self-management booklets, developed and
published by Professor Chris Williams (Glasgow University), which they could give patients
as they felt was appropriate. These booklets cover self-management of low mood, anger
management, low motivation, alcohol problems, smoking cessation, weight loss, and coping
with illness and disability, based on a cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) approach (see
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.llttf.com">www.llttf.com</ext-link>).</p><p>Qualitative data on practitioners&#x02019; views and experiences were obtained throughout the pilot
study in group discussions: 5 in Practice A and 2 in practice B. Data were also collected
from the Care Plan. Discussions with practice staff were often done at routine practice
meetings and were conversational in tone and at times included both facilitators (usually
RO, on occasion SWM) as members of the group (more closely aligned to &#x02018;action research&#x02019; than
focus group interviews). This approach, therefore, was quite distinct from facilitation of a
focus group interview, although it resulted in valuable data (field notes and interviews).
These were mainly conducted in Practice A, as Practice B had problems with staff shortages
during the pilot period and the GPs and PNs were often unavailable to attend meetings. With
participating patients, qualitative data were obtained at the end of the study in six
individual face-to-face interviews conducted by RO (three patients from each practice).
These six patients had agreed to interview during the initial recruitment of patients to the
pilot study. The qualitative data collection, management and analysis followed the same
process as above.</p><p>Quantitative data (patient completed questionnaires) were collected from all participating
patients but are not reported in this paper, which focuses on the qualitative data findings.
However, we do report response rates to the baseline and follow-up questionnaire.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec5-1742395316644304"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec6-1742395316644304"><title>Defining and developing the intervention</title><sec id="sec7-1742395316644304"><title>System changes: Time and relational continuity</title><p>The suggested system level changes involving longer consultations and enhanced
relational continuity (seeing the same practitioner) was endorsed by all participants in
the patient, patient representative and PN groups and by the majority of participants in
the GP groups. The importance of relational continuity and a whole person-centred
approach to care was also strongly endorsed by participants in all groups.</p><p>Views differed across and within groups as to who should provide the proposed longer
consultations; GPs, PNs, Health Care Assistants, Support Workers or some combination of
these practitioners were all suggested. There was also a range of views regarding how
long the extended consultations needed to be. Several of the GPs suggested
&#x02018;double-appointments&#x02019; (20&#x02009;min rather than the usual 10&#x02009;min). PNs felt that substantially
longer would be required to conduct a comprehensive holistic assessment. Patients and
their representatives also felt that more than 20&#x02009;min would be required to let them
really &#x02018;tell their story.&#x02019; In terms of how many extended consultations would be needed
per patient, participants felt this would depend entirely on the individual case.</p></sec><sec id="sec8-1742395316644304"><title>Practitioner training and support</title><p>Practitioner support was considered important in all groups. Practitioners had mixed
views on how best to deliver this; some believed that training and support should be
delivered at the individual practice level for all team members, whereas others
highlighted the value of training across practices. The GPs and PNs found it hard to
predict exactly <italic>what</italic> would be most helpful but identified the potential
value of training that focused on how best to engage and motivate patients.</p><p>Both patient groups suggested that practitioners might benefit from training in
listening skills.</p><p>Support in structuring the consultation was also recognised as important by many
practitioners. The 5As model suggested in the original proposal was generally not
popular; indeed the use of &#x02018;toolkits&#x02019; generally were not favoured by the GPs who saw
them as a &#x02018;tick-box&#x02019; exercise. However, the CARE Approach
(Connect&#x02013;Assess&#x02013;Respond&#x02013;Empower) was, however, deemed to be a useful and simple model
which could be used to guide the consultation and structure a care plan.</p><p>Whilst all groups identified the potential value of practitioner training to help
patients self manage a range of problems including stress, the patient groups also
expressed the view that practitioners themselves might benefit from stress
management.</p></sec><sec id="sec9-1742395316644304"><title>Self-management support</title><p>Changes at patient level, whereby self management was promoted through the use of
simple materials and community resources, were generally considered important. However
some scepticism about the ability of patients to use such material in the context of
their social circumstances was expressed in the GP and PN groups. The idea of using
mindfulness-based approaches to stress management with patients was popular among all
participants, especially in the form of a CD for patients to listen to and practice at
home. It was felt important to make any material simple and accessible to those with
literacy problems.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec10-1742395316644304"><title>Overall</title><p>The findings of this study supported the view that the intervention should be
comprehensive and take a whole-person approach. The essential structure of the
practitioner/patient consultations to be utilised in such an approach were defined as
comprising four key elements, which we framed within the CARE Approach: <list list-type="order" id="list2-1742395316644304"><list-item><p>Establishing and maintaining therapeutic relationships with patients
(<underline>C</underline>onnect),</p></list-item><list-item><p>Focusing on the &#x02018;whole person&#x02019; in assessing health problems in terms of their
individual personal and social contexts (<underline>A</underline>ssess),</p></list-item><list-item><p>Responding in an empathic and validating way to problems
(<underline>R</underline>espond), and</p></list-item><list-item><p>Empowering patients by helping them achieve realistic goals and improve
self-management (<underline>E</underline>mpower).</p></list-item></list>To support this, the key components of the intervention were defined as system
changes to allow longer consultation time with relational continuity; training in the use
of CARE Approach and support for practitioners, and self-management support for patients.
On this basis we termed the intervention CARE Plus, which was then piloted in the two
practices in the deprived areas.</p></sec><sec id="sec11-1742395316644304"><title>Piloting</title><p>The two practices identified 30 suitable patients for the pilot of the CARE Plus
intervention, and 20 patients agreed to participate (14 from practice A and six from
practice B). These comprised 12 females and 8 males, with a mean age of 50 years. From
these 20, three (15%) did not attend any CARE Plus consultations, seven attended only one
(35%) and ten attended two or more (50%). The mean number of CARE Plus consultations was
1.6 per patient. All patients who attended two or more CARE Plus consultations saw the
same practitioner on each occasion.</p><sec id="sec12-1742395316644304"><title>Choosing the patients</title><p>There was similarity in patient selection by the different participating practitioners
in terms of the mix of medical, social and psychological problems, although there were

to explore patients&#x02019; backgrounds (e.g. family history), their current circumstances
(e.g. relationships, housing, etc) as well as their medical problems (physical and
psychological). Practitioners generally felt that the CARE Plus consultations had
provided the opportunity to gain a new perspective on patients. Most were surprised at
the length of time that the first CARE Plus consultation required (30&#x02013;40 min). The value
of having extra time, and how it was anticipated to be of benefit to patients, was
frequently contrasted with the constraints practitioners experienced within their normal
consultations. Recording the details of the intervention consultations in the care plan
was also perceived to be time consuming and, consequently, the CARE Plus care plans were
not consistently completed by all practitioners. Nevertheless, practitioners valued them
as a &#x02018;<italic>record of progress</italic>&#x02019; that were motivating to review at follow-up
consultations.</p></sec><sec id="sec14-1742395316644304"><title>Practitioner&#x02019; experience of the CARE Plus goal setting</title><p>The CARE Plus care plan guided practitioners to help the patients develop their own
&#x02018;plan of action&#x02019;. Some of the approaches used to help patients identify or clarify their
goals are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1742395316644304">Box

were common. Setting too many goals, and/or unattainable goals could demotivate
patients. There was a perceived risk of using goal setting with some patients who were
particularly sensitive to &#x02018;pressure&#x02019;. However, others felt that there was potential with
some patients to use an &#x02018;action plan&#x02019; to help them feel less overwhelmed and pressured
to tackle everything at once:<disp-quote><p>He&#x02019;s been struggling to kind of put together an idea of how he can actually achieve

view, was the opportunity and importance of providing continuity to patients:<disp-quote><p>Without wanting to sound too arrogant we are quite often the only person that
brings consistency and continuity and sometimes it&#x02019;s this engaging, coming back, and
being proud of something and we take over this paternal role in praising them&#x02009;&#x02026;If
you have a life where there is not a lot of positive items if you then can go to
your doctor who says &#x02018;you have done really well you should be proud of yourself&#x02019;
it&#x02019;s powerful. It gets lost if you don&#x02019;t have any continuity<italic>.</italic></p><p>Practice A, Meeting 2, GP Participant 1</p></disp-quote>Relationship continuity also had rewards for the GPs as they were able to
closely follow-up, and receive feedback about improvements in self-management. One GP
describes the feedback she got from one of her CARE Plus patients who had set herself a
goal to give up smoking:<disp-quote><p>She said &#x02018;this is the first time in sixty years I&#x02019;ve done something for myself&#x02019; and
to be quite honest I mean that has just mind blowing I find&#x02009;&#x02026;&#x02009;that just puts it in a
completely different dimension and shows how worthwhile it is what we are
doing<italic>.</italic></p><p>Practice A, Meeting 2, GP Participant 1</p></disp-quote>However, it was not uncommon for patients in this setting to have
difficulties keeping appointments, with consequences for the practice in terms of time
and appointment management. This seemed to raise more issues for the PNs than GPs who
were able to find other tasks to do, such as administrative ones, during these gaps.</p></sec><sec id="sec16-1742395316644304"><title>Practitioners&#x02019; experience on the CARE Plus peer support and training
meeting</title><p>Due to time constraints, only one meeting was held during the pilot study, during which
peer support was provided in sharing views and experiences in relation to the
implementation of the CARE Plus intervention. During the meeting two specialist
consultants in mental health attended, one delivering a talk and discussion on
motivational interviewing, and the other on mindfulness-based approaches. Feedback from
the meeting suggested that the practitioners valued the peer support and the mindfulness
stress management technique, which they thought would be helpful for themselves as well
as for the patients, but were less enthusiastic about motivational interviewing as a
consultation technique.</p></sec><sec id="sec17-1742395316644304"><title>Patients&#x02019; experiences of CARE Plus consultations</title><p>The CARE Plus consultations were generally very popular with patients. Most of the
interviewed patients had no experience of being given time purely devoted to thinking
about their problems and circumstances. One patient described how she usually felt
rushed within consultations and, consequently, often forgot to raise some of her
concerns, and how relaxed she felt knowing she was being given more time:<disp-quote><p>We were talking slowly. It didnae feel&#x02009;&#x02026;&#x02009;See not feeling rushed that was the
best&#x02009;&#x02026;she would ask me something else, which would lead to me asking her something
else&#x02009;&#x02026; When I went in I took my jacket off because I knew I was there for thirty
minutes&#x02009;&#x02026; I got comfortable, I kinda just I knew I wasn&#x02019;t in a rush and I knew she
wasn&#x02019;t typing out the prescription. So that&#x02019;s it just made it feel more comfortable
more relaxed.</p><p>Practice A, Patient Participant 4</p></disp-quote>Another patient who had a number of medical conditions explained how longer
appointments had made it possible for him to talk about all his medical problems within
one appointment, enabling his GP to &#x02018;make connections&#x02019; never made before:<disp-quote><p>He knows my other problems but we&#x02019;ve never really had time to discuss them up until
that last visit [CARE Plus consultation] which was really good. I was in there I
think for about fifty minutes&#x02009;&#x02026; There were things that I&#x02019;m having problems with and
he&#x02019;s saying &#x02018;well look it could be this&#x02019;&#x02026;&#x02009;things that hadn&#x02019;t even occurred to me
(e.g. sleep apnoea)&#x02009;&#x02026;When you go for an emergency appointment you can only talk to
him about why you&#x02019;re there. You cannae go into other detail.&#x02009;&#x02026; That was a great
session that I had with him you know. So I was really pleased about
that<italic>.</italic></p><p>Practice A, Patient Participant 1</p></disp-quote>Another benefit of having more time, that two patients raised, was being
able to disclose problems they were ordinarily reluctant to talk about. One man
explained that he had been worrying for a long time that he might have prostate cancer
because of his urinary symptoms and despite his reluctance, he was able to raise this
during his Care Plus appointment. Another patient felt the time he had spent with his GP
had also made it easier for him to talk about his mental health issues.</p></sec><sec id="sec18-1742395316644304"><title>Patients&#x02019; experiences of relational continuity in the CARE Plus
consultations</title><p>Patients spontaneously raised the issue of continuity and how much they valued being
able to see the same doctor each time they visited the practice for their CARE Plus
consultations. All participants reported previous difficulties arranging appointments
with a particular doctor of choice. By contrast, patients were able to plan their CARE
Plus appointments in advance, ensuring they could return to see the same GP or PN again.
The development of the relationship between doctor and patient, and what this meant in
terms of supporting self management, was also highlighted within patient&#x02019;s accounts.
There were repeated references to the &#x02018;mutual understanding&#x02019; developed within CARE Plus
consultations, emphasising the time spent by the practitioner in getting to know them as
people.</p></sec><sec id="sec19-1742395316644304"><title>Patients&#x02019; experiences of the CARE Plus consultation goal setting</title><p>Some patients found goal setting, used during consultations to support self-management,
particularly helpful. One patient described how she had felt &#x02018;<italic>stuck</italic>&#x02019;
and that setting a goal had been a &#x02018;<italic>push in the right direction</italic>&#x02019; and
had motivated her:<disp-quote><p>The anti-depressants definitely [helped]. But I think the fact that she's working

excessively long.</p></sec><sec id="sec22-1742395316644304"><title>Optimisation</title><p>The findings of the pilot study were used to further optimise the intervention, at all
three levels (system; patient&#x02013;practitioner interaction; self-management support). At
system level, the length of time required in the first CARE Plus consultation was
generally longer than many GPs envisaged, and averaged 30&#x02013;40&#x02009;min, with 20&#x02013;30&#x02009;min at
follow-up consultations (although this varied according to the patient). The need for
relational continuity was reinforced. The CARE Approach as the framework for the longer
consultations was adopted and the associated CARE Plan was shortened (available from
corresponding author). The training and support of practitioners was refined to combine
peer support, personal and group goals for each training session, and a 30-min period of
mindfulness-based stress reduction in each session. The self-management support material
for patients was stream-lined to one self-help booklet written for people with long-term
conditions, one short booklet about the mindfulness approach, and CDs explaining these and
CDs providing guided mindfulness practices (spoken by a male and a female clinical
psychologist). These changes are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1742395316644304">Table 1</xref>, which draws on the TIDier

and gathered important &#x02018;baseline&#x02019; views and suggestions of practitioners and patients

relational continuity), patient&#x02013;practitioner interaction change (an empathic
patient-centred structured approach), training and support for staff to deliver this and
support for patient self-management. We have also revised the patient questionnaire and
standard operating procedures to try to ensure higher response rates in the future. The
intervention is now ready to be evaluated in a phase 2 cluster-randomised trial to
establish proof of concept, establish broader feasibility, and estimate intervention
impact to inform power calculations for a phase 3 cluster-randomised trial.</p></sec><sec id="sec25-1742395316644304"><title>Strengths and weaknesses</title><p>An important feature of the intervention development was its &#x02018;co-design&#x02019; with
practitioners, patients, and patients representatives. The fact that this co-design was
planned from the very start was, on reflection, a very important factor in the programme,
and the duration of the programme meant that meaningful relationships and discussion could
be held with all the key stakeholders. Similar to our earlier findings,<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1742395316644304" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-1742395316644304" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> participants readily recognised the
complex problems associated with living with multimorbidity in the deprived areas and the
challenges these raised for patients and their primary care practitioners. Patients and
their representatives fully endorsed the need for longer consultations and relational
continuity of care. They also recognised the pressures on health care staff and supported
the case for support and training of primary care staff. The GPs and PNs also saw the need
for targeted longer consultations and a holistic approach to the care of multimorbid
patients, again in line with our previous findings<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1742395316644304" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and agreed that training and support was
required. Most participants also welcomed the idea of additional self-management support,
though stressed the need to make such material accessible and relevant to the needs of
multimorbid patients in the context of deprivation, and poor literacy.</p><p>The pilot study showed that the intervention could be implemented in practice in terms of
the practices identifying eligible patients and providing them with longer consultations
and using the care plan, and trying out a variety of patient self-help materials. However,
due to delayed time-lines in the programme, we were only able to run the pilots for 3
months (we had originally envisaged much longer than this) and thus were not able to
assess patient qualitative outcomes longitudinally. Perhaps due to this shortened
time-frame, not all patients received a second CARE Plus consultation, although relational
continuity was achieved for those who did. In addition, only one practice (Practice A) had
a training and support session for the practitioners even though we had originally
envisaged having more than this. Practice B, due to staff shortages within the practice at
the time were not able to fully participate in the pilot, as it proved very difficult to
arrange meetings between the GPs and the researchers. It was also not possible to arrange
any training and support sessions. However, generally the intervention was well received
in both practices. The pilot work was also helpful as it also highlighted the need for
flexibility and led to several relatively small but important changes including a revised
CARE Plan, the inclusion of mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques in the support
of practitioners and patients, and the stream-lining of the written self-management
support (SMS) material for patients. It was also an important opportunity to test and
modify the patient CARE Plan and the patient questionnaire, and to devise a strategy to
ensure higher response rates to patient questionnaires in the future phase 2 trial.</p></sec><sec id="sec26-1742395316644304"><title>Relationship with published literature</title><p>The rationale for the components of this whole-system approach was supported by direct or
indirect evidence as far as possible, as well as the views of the participants. The
increased prevalence and burden of multimorbidity in the deprived populations need to be
considered in the context of the &#x02018;inverse care law,&#x02019; which states that the availability of
good medical care tends to vary inversely with the need for it in the population
served.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-1742395316644304" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bibr17-1742395316644304" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Primary care has a
central role in the management of multimorbidity, but the continuing existence of the
&#x02018;inverse care law&#x02019; limits this potential in the deprived areas due to the mismatch between
patients needs and primary care capacity.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-1742395316644304" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-1742395316644304" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Consultations in the deprived areas are

high deprivation areas in Scotland we have previously found in a single practice that
extended consultation length was associated with more enablement for complex patients and

include longer consultation time with the GPs. The CARE Plus intervention, if effective,
may be cost-effective (if it improves quality of life above usual care) as it does not
involve the employment of new staff or therapists but builds on the generalist skills of
existing primary care staff.<sup><xref rid="bibr33-1742395316644304" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="sec27-1742395316644304"><title>Implications</title><p>In line with guidelines on the development of complex interventions,<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1742395316644304" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> we have developed and
