Betrixaban is a novel oral factor Xa inhibitor administered once daily, mostly excreted unchanged in the bile and with low (17%) renal excretion.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and results</title><p>Patients with AF and more than one risk factor for stroke were randomized to one of three blinded doses of betrixaban (40, 60, or 80 mg once daily) or unblinded warfarin, adjusted to an international normalized ratio of 2.0&#x02013;3.0. The primary outcome was major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding. The mean follow-up was 147 days. Among 508 patients randomized, the mean CHADS<sub>2</sub> score was 2.2; 87% of patients had previously received vitamin K antagonist therapy. The time in therapeutic range on warfarin was 63.4%. There were one, five, five, and seven patients with a primary outcome on betrixaban 40, 60, 80 mg daily, or warfarin, respectively. The rate of the primary outcome was lowest on betrixaban 40 mg (hazard ratio compared with warfarin = 0.14, exact stratified log-rank <italic>P</italic>-value 0.04, unadjusted for multiple testing). Rates of the primary outcome with betrixaban 60 or 80 mg were more similar to those of wafarin. Two ischaemic strokes occurred, one each on betrixaban 60 and 80 mg daily. There were two vascular deaths, one each on betrixaban 40 mg and warfarin. Betrixaban was associated with higher rates of diarrhoea than warfarin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Betrixaban was well tolerated and had similar or lower rates of bleeding compared with well-controlled warfarin in patients with AF at risk for stroke.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Betrixaban</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Atrial fibrillation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an arrhythmia that affects an estimated 7 million people in the USA and the European Union with a median age of 75 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT039C1">1</xref></sup> The greatest risk associated with AF is ischaemic stroke resulting from embolism of thrombus from the left atrium. Guidelines recommend treatment with a vitamin K antagonist for stroke prevention in patients with AF based on the results of randomized, controlled trials comparing warfarin with placebo or no warfarin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT039C1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT039C6">6</xref></sup> The use of warfarin is challenging because it has an unpredictable anticoagulant effect, a high propensity for food and drug interactions, and a risk of significant bleeding. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis of contemporary randomized clinical trials comprising over 50 000 patient-years on warfarin revealed major bleeding rates ranging from 1.4 to 3.4% per year, and are likely higher outside the confines of a clinical trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT039C7">7</xref></sup> Routine coagulation monitoring is required, which is inconvenient for patients and costly for the health care system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT039C2">2</xref></sup></p><p>Thrombin plays a key role in arterial and venous thromboses by activating platelets and facilitating the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Recently, dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, has been shown to be superior to warfarin for the prevention of stroke with improved ease of use; and is available in many countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT039C8">8</xref></sup> Factor Xa is also an attractive target for anticoagulant therapy as it is the enzyme responsible for the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. Rivaroxaban and apixaban, factor Xa inhibitors, have been shown to be effective for stroke prevention in AF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT039C9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT039C11">11</xref></sup></p><p>Betrixaban is an oral, once-daily, direct factor Xa inhibitor. It is rapidly absorbed with mean peak concentrations occurring 3 to 4 h after oral administration, a pharmacodynamic half-life of 20 h and a low peak-to-trough concentration ratio over each 24 h dosing period. Oral bioavailability of an 80 mg dose is 34% and protein binding is &#x0223c;60%. Betrixaban is mostly excreted unchanged in bile, with low (17%) renal excretion. When administered immediately after a high-fat, high-calorie breakfast, <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC were reduced by &#x0223c;50% compared with the fasting state. Betrixaban is a substrate for efflux proteins, including P-glycoprotein; however, it is not a substrate for major CYP enzymes.</p><p>Betrixaban has been studied in 215 patients in a phase II venous thrombo-embolism (VTE) prevention study (EXPERT) in patients undergoing total knee replacement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT039C12">12</xref></sup> Doses of 15 and 40 mg administered twice daily were compared with enoxaparin 30 mg twice daily for 10&#x02013;14 days. Similar efficacy and safety were observed in all three groups, with a favourable safety profile. The present study was designed to assess the safety and tolerability of betrixaban at three different doses given orally once daily, compared with dose-adjusted [inter-quartile range (INR) 2.0&#x02013;3.0] warfarin in patients with AF at risk of stroke.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>Patients with new or existing non-valvular AF were recruited from outpatient clinics. They were eligible for enrolment if they fulfilled the following criteria: male or female aged &#x02265;18 years, in AF or atrial flutter at the time of enrolment or documented within the previous year by Holter, ECG, rhythm strip, pacemaker, or other intracardiac recording, and with one or more risk factor(s) for stroke, resulting in an indication for anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist. Subjects on warfarin were required to have an INR &#x02264;2.2 at the time of randomization. Major exclusion criteria included: body weight of &#x0003c;40 kg, need for either haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, AF due to reversible causes, active bleeding; history of congenital or acquired bleeding disorders or vascular malformation; history of intracranial, retroperitoneal, or intraocular bleeding within the last 6 months; high risk of bleeding for other reasons including from significant liver disease; conditions other than AF that required chronic anticoagulation; persistent uncontrolled hypertension. Patients on verapamil were excluded pending a formal drug interaction study. Patients with renal insufficiency were not excluded unless they were on dialysis.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome was the time to occurrence of major or clinically relevant non&#x02013;major (CRNM) bleeding. The secondary outcomes were any bleeding (including major, CRNM, and any other reported bleeding) and the time to occurrence of death, ischaemic or non&#x02013;ischaemic stroke, MI, or other systemic embolism. An independent adjudicator, blinded to treatment groups, adjudicated all major bleeds, CRNM bleeds, strokes, MI, other systemic embolism, and deaths.</p><p>Major bleeding was defined as clinically overt bleeding that was associated with a reduction in haemoglobin of &#x02265;20 g/L or transfusion of &#x02265;2 units of blood or packed cells, or symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ: intraocular, intracranial, intraspinal, retroperitoneal, intra-articular, pericardial, or intramuscular with compartment syndrome or a fatal outcome. Clinically relevant non-major bleeding was defined as overt bleeding not meeting the criteria for major bleeding but associated with medical intervention, unscheduled contact (visit or telephone call) with a physician, (temporary) cessation of study treatment, or discomfort for the patient such as pain or impairment of activities of daily life. All other overt bleeding episodes were classified as minimal bleeding events, and were not adjudicated. Diagnosis of stroke required acute onset of a focal neurological deficit of presumed vascular origin that lasted for &#x02265;24 h or resulted in death. A stroke was categorized as ischaemic, haemorrhagic, or unknown, based on CT or MR scanning or autopsy. Deaths were classified as vascular (including bleeding), non-vascular, due to other specific causes (e.g. malignancy), or unknown. Vascular death was considered to occur when there was no obvious non-vascular event to explain death, such as cancer, trauma, or respiratory failure. Sudden or un-witnessed deaths were considered vascular.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Safety monitoring</title><p>A data safety monitoring committee was appointed to independently review all safety and efficacy data at regular intervals during the study and make recommendations, as appropriate. No formal analyses of efficacy were performed.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Randomization and follow-up</title><p>Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1 allocation) to betrixaban 40, 60, 80 mg orally, once daily, or warfarin (target INR of 2.0&#x02013;3.0). Assignment to betrixaban or warfarin was not blinded, but the betrixaban dose was double-blinded. Subjects assigned to betrixaban were instructed to take the drug at bedtime, preferably at least 2 h after the evening meal. A dynamic randomization was used to assign and balance patients by country, concurrent aspirin use, and antecedent warfarin. Aspirin (up to 162 mg daily), clopidogrel, ticlopidine, and any concomitant medications or treatments deemed necessary by the investigator to provide adequate supportive care were allowed during the study. Verapamil use was not allowed, as a drug interaction study had not been performed. The study was conducted according to ethical standards, local laws, and GCPs in the USA, Canada, and Germany. Subjects were assessed at screening, and at weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 and then every 2 months thereafter for a maximum of 1 year.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Laboratory analyses</title><p>Study measurements included plasma betrixaban concentrations, D-dimer concentrations, and thrombin generation (TG). Inhibition of tissue factor-initiated TG was measured as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT039C12">12</xref></sup> D-dimer levels were assessed in both warfarin naive (13%) and experienced patients (87%) at baseline and at 12 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Under the assumptions that the event rate for the composite of major and CRNM bleeding would be 5.7% in the warfarin group at 3 months, the enrolment period would be 8 months, and the total study duration would be 11 months, enrolment of 500 patients was planned to provide 80% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.27 in the primary endpoint for an individual betrixaban dose vs. warfarin using a two-sided log-rank test at the 0.05 significance level. Continuous parameters were summarized by <italic>n</italic> (number of non-missing observations), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, and the first and third quartiles. Categorical parameters were summarized by count and per cent. Time in therapeutic range (TTR) of the INR was calculated by linear interpolation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT039C13">13</xref></sup> Survival estimates were computed using the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method. Differences in the primary and other outcomes, between treatment groups, were formally tested using individual exact log-rank tests and stratified by country and concurrent aspirin use. Secondary analyses used Cox proportional hazards models. There was no adjustment for testing multiplicity. Significance testing was two-sided. Adverse event rates were compared using Fisher's exact tests. Statistical analyses were performed on an intent-to-treat population basis, using the SAS&#x000ae; software version 9.1.3 or StatXact&#x000ae; PROCS for SAS version 8.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Patient disposition</title><p>There were 561 patients screened, and 508 were randomized to the four treatment groups (<italic>Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="EHT039F1">1</xref></italic>). All patients received at least one dose of study medication and the rate of premature withdrawal from study medication was similar between betrixaban 40, 60, and 80 mg per day and warfarin (8.7, 9.4, 8.7, 6.3%, respectively). There were 113, 119, 117, and 113 patients who completed a minimum follow-up of 90 days for betrixaban 40, 60, and 80 mg per day and warfarin, respectively. The maximum follow-up duration was 329 days and the median follow-up was 150 days. There were 127 patients enrolled from Canada, 369 from the USA, and 12 from Germany.

A dose ranging study in 215 patients at risk for VTE events after orthopedic surgery reported that betrixaban demonstrated clinical antithrombotic activity comparable with that of enoxaparin 30 mg s.c. given every 12 h.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT039C12">12</xref></sup> Patients with AF have an increased risk of stroke, and vitamin K antagonist therapy is recommended in those at moderate or high risk of stroke.</p><p>The EXPLORE-Xa study was designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of betrixaban compared with warfarin in patients with AF who are receiving or are eligible for vitamin K antagonist therapy. Patients enrolled were typical of AF patients who would typically receive warfarin for the prevention of stroke. Unlike other similar studies with novel factor Xa inhibitors, patients with renal insufficiency were allowed to be enrolled unless they were on dialysis. The main findings of the study are the rates of the primary outcome (major or CRNM bleeding) were numerically lower with all three doses of betrixaban compared with warfarin; and betrixaban 40 mg daily has a statistically significant lower rate than with warfarin. These findings suggest that there may be a dose&#x02013;response relationship for bleeding with betrixaban. Thus, all three doses of betrixaban studied, 40, 60, and 80 mg once daily, appear to have an acceptable safety profile in comparison with warfarin.</p><p>The effectiveness of warfarin and its safety have been shown to be associated with the control of the INR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT039C14">14</xref></sup> This is often measured by the TTR, which can be calculated by linear interpolation of the INR values over time. The average TTR reported in a recent meta-analysis of surveys of clinical practice in the USA is 55%, with somewhat high levels achieved using anticoagulation clinics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT039C15">15</xref></sup> In the EXPLORE Xa study, most patients were experienced with warfarin and would therefore be expected to have a somewhat higher TTR than na&#x000ef;ve patients. The INR control achieved in this study was good, and was similar to that achieved in recent randomized trials of warfarin therapy in AF patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT039C8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT039C10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT039C11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT039C16">16</xref></sup> Therefore, one would have expected a rate of major bleeding on warfarin similar to rates recently reported in these trials. However, the rate of major bleeding on warfarin in this study was 10.3% per year which is unexpectedly higher.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT039C8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT039C10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT039C11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT039C16">16</xref></sup></p><p>Rates of ischaemic stroke would be expected to be low on warfarin in patients with a mean CHADS<sub>2</sub> score of 2 and with good INR control. There were two ischaemic strokes observed in the study and no systemic embolic events, myocardial infarctions, or pulmonary emboli. One stroke occurred in each of the betrixaban 60 and 80 mg arms; no strokes occurred on betrixaban 40 mg or on warfarin. Given the mean duration of follow-up (0.4 years), risk profile of the patients, and the INR control achieved, one would expect about 0&#x02013;1 strokes in such well-managed warfarin patients, consistent with the overall stroke rate observed in this study.</p><p>The evaluation of the TG data indicates that betrixaban has an anticoagulant effect at the concentrations achieved by the doses used in this study and that this effect is comparable with that of warfarin. This supports the clinical findings and suggests that at the same level of TG as therapeutic warfarin, betrixaban may have a lower risk of bleeding than warfarin. However, this will need to be evaluated in an adequately powered study. Warfarin suppresses D-dimer concentrations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT039C17">17</xref></sup> Patients enrolled in this study who were treated with a vitamin K antagonist at baseline had lower D-dimer levels than na&#x000ef;ve patients. In vitamin K antagonist-na&#x000ef;ve patients, the three doses of betrixaban and warfarin reduced D-dimer levels, thus demonstrating anticoagulant activity of the betrixaban doses tested. Of particular importance, the reduction in D-dimer for betrixaban patients on 60 and 80 mg resulted in levels within the 0.5 &#x000b5;g/mL concentration, which has been shown to correlate with a reduction in thrombo-embolic, cardiovascular, and bleeding events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT039C18">18</xref></sup></p><p>Betrixaban was well tolerated in this relatively short-term study. Patients in this study had mostly used warfarin before enrolment, which would be expected to result in a low rate of intolerance to warfarin. Nonetheless, betrixaban was as well tolerated as warfarin with similar rates of serious adverse effects. Betrixaban was associated with reports of gastro-intestinal symptoms in some patients, especially diarrhoea. These symptoms were mild and did not result in discontinuation of therapy.</p><p>The main limitation of this study is its small size. Hence, it was statistically underpowered to provide definitive conclusions regarding the safety or efficacy of any particular betrixaban dose vs. warfarin. For example, no statistical adjustment was made for multiple comparisons (each dose vs. warfarin) in the primary endpoint. Nevertheless, this study provides some guidance regarding dose of betrixaban for evaluation in larger clinical trials. The lowest rate of bleeding was seen with betrixaban 40 mg. The pharmacodynamic and kinetic data indicated that all betrixaban doses tested reduce TG and that the 80 mg daily had a similar reduction in TG as would be expected with therapeutic warfarin (INR 2.0&#x02013;3.0). All three betrixaban doses reduced D-dimer to levels expected to be associated with clinical benefit using warfarin therapy.</p><p>In conclusion, betrixaban at doses of 40&#x02013;80 mg per day was well tolerated in AF patients at risk for stroke with a risk of bleeding that was similar to, or lower than, that of well-managed warfarin. A larger and definitive phase 3 trial of betrixaban is indicated.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Funding</title><p>The trial was funded by Portola Pharmaceuticals, South San Francisco, CA, USA.</p><p><bold>Conflict of interest:</bold> S.J.C.: grant&#x02014;Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol Myers Squibb, Bayer; consulting fee or honorarium&#x02014;Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol Myers Squibb, Bayer, Portola.
