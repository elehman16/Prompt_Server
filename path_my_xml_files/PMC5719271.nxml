Incidence rates have quadrupled over the last 30 years and continue to rise, especially among younger people. As routine screening of the general population is not currently recommended in the UK, a focus on secondary prevention through early detection and prompt treatment in individuals at increased risk of melanoma could make an important contribution to improve melanoma outcomes. This paper describes the protocol for a phase II, multisite, randomised controlled trial, in the primary care setting, for patients at increased risk of melanoma. A skin self-monitoring (SSM) smartphone &#x02018;App&#x02019; was used to improve symptom appraisal and encourage help seeking in primary care, thereby promoting early presentation with skin changes suspicious of melanoma.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>We aim to recruit 200 participants from general practice waiting rooms in the East of England. Eligible patients are those identified at higher melanoma risk (using a real-time risk assessment tool), without a personal history of melanoma, aged 18 to 75 years. Participants will be invited to a primary care nurse consultation, and randomised to the intervention group (standard written advice on skin cancer detection and sun protection, loading of an SSM &#x02018;App&#x02019; onto the participant&#x02019;s smartphone and instructions on use including self-monitoring reminders) or control group (standard written advice alone). The primary outcomes are consultation rates for changes to a pigmented skin lesion, and the patient interval (time from first noticing a skin change to consultation). Secondary outcomes include patient sun protection behaviours, psychosocial outcomes, and measures of trial feasibility and acceptability.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>NHS ethical approval has been obtained from Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire research ethics committee (REC reference 16/EE/0248). The findings from the MelaTools SSM Trial will be disseminated widely through peer-reviewed publications and scientific conferences.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>

Melanoma is associated with significant morbidity, and the thickness of the lesion at diagnosis is the most important prognostic factor: stage 1 disease has 5-year survival rates of over 95%, compared with &#x0003c;25% for stage 4 disease.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The UK has lower 1-year and 5-year melanoma survival rates than comparable countries in Europe.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Diagnostic delays are thought to contribute to this, and there is evidence of avoidable delay.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Evidence from the SCREEN project in Germany, conducted between 2003 and 2004, suggested that population screening may have an impact on melanoma incidence and 5-year mortality.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> However, this evidence is controversial, and routine screening of the general population is not currently recommended anywhere worldwide, although some countries (Australia, New Zealand, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK) recommend regular skin checks and/or self-examination for certain subsets of patients at increased risk of melanoma.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Therefore, a focus on targeted population screening could make an important contribution to melanoma outcomes through early, timely detection and prompt treatment.</p><p>Patient pathways to presentation and management in primary care are key determinants in cancer outcomes. When compared with people diagnosed with other cancers, those diagnosed with melanoma have the second longest median time between first noticing a symptom and presenting to primary care (patient interval).<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> The patient interval could potentially be reduced by providing patients with clear information on the signs and symptoms of melanoma and guidance on monitoring skin changes,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> through community campaigns such as the Be Clear on Cancer skin cancer campaign.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> More targeted approaches could focus on individuals at higher risk.</p><p>Smartphones offer considerable potential to promote earlier presentation by people with cancer, including melanoma.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> More than 70% of the UK adult population now own a smartphone (Techtracker), and there are many smartphone applications (&#x02018;Apps&#x02019;) focusing on health issues, presenting new opportunities for risk assessment, symptom appraisal, monitoring symptoms and signs over time, and cues to seek professional advice. Furthermore, up to 75% of melanomas are detected by people or their family/friends, rather than healthcare professionals. To maximise the effectiveness of skin self-monitoring (SSM), the person performing the examination should be able to identify skin changes and features of skin lesions which could indicate melanoma, yet recent studies have demonstrated that suspicious signs of skin cancer may not be widely known.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 16</xref> Important international evidence has shown that it is possible to educate patients and the public: newly diagnosed Italian melanoma patients who performed self-skin examination were found to have thinner tumours,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and Australian patients with melanoma were found to adhere to medical advice on skin self-examination during follow-up care.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> A recent Scottish study has demonstrated that patients with melanoma are prepared to use digital technology to support them in conducting SSM during follow-up.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> We therefore set out to explore using mobile technology for SSM among people at higher risk of melanoma in the primary care setting to encourage timely consultation for possible melanoma.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Preliminary phase I research</title><p>Guided by the Medical Research Council framework on developing and evaluating complex interventions,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> three phase I studies were conducted to (1) assess the feasibility and acceptability of defining a population at higher risk of melanoma from UK general practice; (2) review the availability of suitable smartphone SSM Apps and (3) pilot the intervention.</p><sec id="s1a1"><title>Assessing the feasibility and acceptability of defining a population at higher risk of melanoma from UK general practice</title><p>The MelaTools-Q Study findings have already been reported.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Briefly, 7742 patients (86% of those approached) were recruited from the waiting rooms of 22 general practices in three UK regions: Eastern England, Northeast Scotland and North Wales. Using tablet computers, they completed an electronic questionnaire incorporating the Williams melanoma risk prediction model,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> including items relating to seven risk factors: gender, age, natural hair colour at age 15, number of severe sunburns aged 2&#x02013;18, prior non-melanoma skin cancer, number of raised moles on both arms and density of freckles on both arms before age 20. The study showed that, after weighting to the age and sex distribution, the lower and upper quartile cut-offs used by Williams <italic>et al</italic>, 25 and 34, would allow between 4% and 20% of the population to be identified as higher risk, and those groups would contain 30% and 60%, respectively of individuals who would develop melanoma. Therefore, real-time risk assessment for melanoma in UK primary care is both feasible and acceptable.</p></sec><sec id="s1a2"><title>Reviewing the availability of suitable smartphone SSM Apps</title><p>Our initial review, conducted in July 2014, identified 39 smartphone Apps available from Apple and Android App online stores.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> However, when the same search strategy was re-run in September 2015, eight new SSM Apps were identified, while eight of the previously identified SSM Apps were no longer available. Among the 39 newly&#x000a0;identified SSM Apps, 11 were not available in both Apple and Android App stores; 10 did not include a monitoring function; 5 did not include photography of skin lesions; 5 had poor functionality; 2 were not available in England; 2 were classified as medical devices; 1 was under development, 1 one had no reminder feature, deemed vital for monitoring functionality.

Thematic analysis<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> showed that, overall, participants in all four groups and at all strata of increased risk of melanoma felt that using a SSM App would be helpful and achievable. Many felt that using a SSM App would enhance their current SSM habits: <italic>&#x02018;</italic>I look at the moles and I just keep an eye on them<italic>&#x02019; (Male, above-population risk, group 3).</italic> Many also felt that using a SSM App could help reduce their worry about developing skin cancer: <italic>&#x02018;</italic>cos my dad had cancer recently so&#x000a0;[my mother]&#x000a0;says we&#x02019;re at a higher risk, so she goes on about that<italic>&#x02019; (Female, above-population risk, group 4).</italic> Some felt that using a SSM App would guide their help-seeking behaviour for skin changes or moles:&#x000a0;&#x02018;It&#x02019;s that knowledge, if it&#x02019;s, you know, three&#x02009;months, whatever it is, if you can actually say look there is a visible change then you&#x02019;re getting a bit of information that they probably could do with&#x02026;you&#x02019;ve got physical evidence, and then the confidence to go to&#x02026;&#x02019; (Male, above-population risk, group 4). Several also commented on additional features on smartphones which might help prevent development of future melanomas: &#x02018;I&#x02019;ve got a UV index on my phone so I can always check what that is, so putting sun cream on.&#x02019; (Male, high risk, group 2).</p><p>The five participants recruited via primary care were invited to complete a diary 1&#x000a0;and 2&#x02009;months later, and then participate in a telephone interview after the third month. Diary records and thematic analysis of the interviews (as above) confirmed that participants used many features of both SSM Apps, including taking photographs, mapping these to body parts, comparing photographs over time and using the analysis function (available in only one of the Apps). There was unanimous agreement between participants about the App which was easier to use (MySkinPal), and most reported that they would continue to use it after the study, particularly as they found the App&#x02019;s notifications the most efficient method to prompt them to complete future SSM. Despite this, several also reported that they found taking photographs quite challenging, and that they had to recruit a family member to assist them in taking photographs to compare skin changes over time. Furthermore, while regularly self-monitoring their skin during the study, most participants reported worrying about skin cancer &#x02018;sometimes&#x02019;, seeking further information about skin changes or moles via the internet, speaking to friends and family, and visiting their general practice.</p><p>In conclusion, this preliminary phase I work enabled consumer choice of the more user-friendly SSM App, resulted in modifications to the language used in the trial consultation and led to the development of the MelaTools SSM Trial.</p><p>The trial aims to assess the effect of using an SSM App compared with standard information about detecting skin cancer on consultation rates and the patient interval (the time from first noticing a skin change/mole to consultation with a primary care healthcare professional) among patients at increased risk of melanoma, identified via primary care. In addition, to obtain preliminary estimates of effect across a range of outcome measures to inform selection of the primary outcome for a definitive phase III trial. We hypothesise that primary care patients at higher risk of melanoma will seek help more rapidly after noticing skin changes when using an SSM App compared with using standard written information.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>The phase II trial is a multisite randomised controlled trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>), set in 11 general practices across Eastern England.

As this is a phase II trial, fully describing and characterising the extent and nature of the missing data is an important part of the analysis. For the outcome analysis, appropriate methods for dealing with missing endpoint data will be informed by a blinded review of the data; however, assuming that this is appropriate, we plan a series of extreme case-sensitivity analyses, where missing data will be replaced with the 2.5th and 97.5th centiles of the non-missing measured outcomes to assess the maximum potential impact on the results of the trial. The baseline characteristics of the two arms will be described using summary statistics. Possible consent bias will be assessed by comparing demographic and clinical variables of participants with those who declined participation, and possible differential attrition will be assessed by comparing baseline characteristics of those who withdraw or die with those who remain in the trial. In addition, we will analyse the missing data to understand the potential impact on the required sample size, and to assess whether and where possible bias may arise, and therefore be minimised, in the future design for the efficacy phase III trial. We will describe the amount (percentage) of missing data in all outcome measures at baseline and follow-up, and evaluate the relationship between missing data and treatment assignment using unadjusted &#x003a7;<sup>2</sup> tests. We will describe whether missing data occur differentially between outcomes. These comparisons will be performed using a two sample t&#x000a0;test (or non-parametric equivalent) for continuous variables and &#x003a7;<sup>2</sup> test for categorical variables.</p><p>The primary analysis will be a comparison between the two groups on the consultation rate for skin changes/pigmented skin lesion using a Poisson regression model. Comparisons between groups on binary secondary endpoints will be performed using logistic regression. Comparisons between groups on continuous secondary endpoints will be undertaken using a linear model that includes the baseline value where applicable. A linear model may not be appropriate for the secondary outcome patient interval, as this is expected to be right skewed.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> We will explore the nature and extent of the skewness and analyse patient interval using a linear model if possible, adopting other approaches as appropriate, including transformation or categorisation of the patient interval, or methods for statistical inference based on bootstrap resampling. The analyses performed on the primary and secondary endpoints will be repeated adjusting for additional baseline covariates as part of a sensitivity analysis. Point estimates of the intervention effect will be presented with 95% CIs and two-sided P&#x000a0;values. Unadjusted P&#x000a0;values from secondary analyses will be interpreted in proper context and be clearly labelled.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><sec id="s2h1"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>This trial is sponsored by the School of Clinical Medicine at the University of Cambridge.
