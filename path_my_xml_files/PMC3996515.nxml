The primary endpoints are anatomic and clinical success at a one-year follow-up, and post-procedural pain. The secondary endpoints are technical success, complications, operation time, procedural pain, disease-specific quality of life, time taken to return to daily activities and/or work, and cost-efficiency analyses after RFA or MOCA.

Epidemiological studies show that 21% of adults have some form of varicose veins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], with women being more affected than men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The incidence of varicose veins increases steadily with age and is among the top ten complaints for which people visit their general practitioner. The main risk factors include: prolonged standing or sitting, pregnancy, sex and age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The symptoms of varicose veins range from cosmetic complaints to venous ulcers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>High ligation and stripping of the great saphenous vein (GSV) has been the gold standard for GSV incompetence for more than 100&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Surgery is performed under general or spinal anesthesia and is related to a high recurrence rate of 18 to 40% after five years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In addition, surgery may lead to significant postoperative symptoms (particularly pain and hematoma) and carries a risk of injury to the saphenous nerve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Endovenous techniques have been developed for the treatment of varicose veins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are now widely accepted techniques and are frequently used in practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. They are related to less hematoma, pain, and superior cosmetics and earlier resumption of normal activities and work when compared to traditional surgical stripping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Thermal ablative modalities, however, carry the risk of damaging the surrounding tissues of the vein. For this reason, patients are treated with tumescence anesthesia, which requires multiple punctures around the vein. Despite the use of tumescence anesthesia there are still a subset of patients who have postoperative pain, which can last for weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Mechanochemical endovenous ablation (MOCA), using the ClariVein&#x000ae; device (Vascular Insights, Madison, CT, United States), uses a rotating wire in a catheter to create mechanical damage to the endothelium of the vessel. At the same time, a sclerosant is infused at the end of the catheter, causing chemical damage to the vein wall. With MOCA, the vein wall is not heated and tumescence anesthesia is redundant. Subsequently complications that occur in thermal ablative modalities such as pain, hematoma, induration and nerve injury could be reduced.</p><p>The safety and efficacy of MOCA was shown in the first human study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In this study, 30 patients with primary GSV insufficiency were treated using sodium tetradecyl sulfate (Sotradecol). At six months the anatomical success was 97% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. After a follow-up period of two years, 27 of the 28 (anatomical success 96%) treated GSV were occluded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Several reports have confirmed the efficacy of MOCA, with occlusion rates varying from 94 to 97% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. No major complications such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism or nerve injury were observed in all previous studies. Moreover, MOCA was associated with lower post-procedural pain and faster recovery than RFA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. To date, no studies have been performed to compare MOCA with other endovenous techniques in the treatment of varicose veins. The current study has been designed to compare MOCA for the treatment of GSV insufficiency to RFA in a multicenter randomized controlled trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>A prospective multicenter randomized clinical trial was designed to compare RFA and MOCA in the treatment of GSV incompetence. Patients will be included at the outpatient departments of the participating hospitals. The procedures are performed or supervised by dedicated vascular surgeons, who have performed more than 20 procedures of both treatment modalities.</p></sec><sec><title>Study objectives</title><p>The aim of the study is to show that MOCA is associated with less post-procedural pain than RFA, with comparable anatomical and clinical success rates.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>The assumption has been made that MOCA will have a similar anatomical and clinical success rate at one year when compared to RFA. For a non-inferiority trial with an effect size (anatomical success) of 93% and a margin of 7%, 210 patients per group are needed (alpha 5%, power 80%). The effect size of 93% refers to an estimated anatomical success rate at a one year follow-up period for both groups. Taking into account 10% dropouts in each arm, 230 patients need to be included in each study arm.</p><p>A sample size calculation will also be performed for the second primary endpoint on the hypothesis that MOCA will have lower post-procedural pain, as measured by a 100-point VAS (Visual Analog Scale) score during the first two weeks after surgery. To evaluate a 30% reduction in post-procedural pain, 58 patients per group are needed (alpha 5%, power 80%). This analysis will be performed after the inclusion and randomization of at least all 58 patients in each group.</p></sec><sec><title>Setting</title><p>Patients will be recruited from the following Dutch centers: Rijnstate Hospital, Arnhem; Antonius Hospital, Nieuwegein; Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis, Amsterdam; BovenIJ Hospital, Amsterdam; University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands. In all of the participating centers, each surgeon performing the procedures must have treated at least 20 patients with each technique prior to treating patients who participate in the MARADONA trial to prevent a learning curve bias.</p><p>The total study duration will be seven years: the recruitment period will take two years and thereafter patients will be evaluated for a period of five years post-procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary endpoints</title><p>The primary endpoints are anatomic and clinical success and post-procedural pain after treatment for GSV incompetence with RFA or MOCA. Anatomic success will be measured one year after treatment using duplex ultrasonography. Clinical success will be measured using the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS). Post-procedural pain will be evaluated using a 100-point VAS during the first two weeks after the treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary endpoints</title><p>The secondary endpoints are technical success, complications, operation time, pain during treatment, disease-specific quality of life, time to return to daily activities and/or work, and cost-efficiency analyses after RFA or MOCA.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>A patient who meets the entry criteria is fully informed about the trial and provided with a patient information and consent form.

Randomization will be performed by blocks with stratification for participating centers.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment details</title><sec><title>Radiofrequency ablation (RFA)</title><p>During RFA, radiofrequent energy is used to heat the vein wall of the GSV. The catheter is inserted into the vein and direct energy is delivered to the endothelium with the result of collapsing and sealing the vein. During the MARADONA study, all participating centers are using the VNUS ClosureFAST&#x02122; catheter (VNUS Medical Technologies, San Jose, California, United States). The VNUS ClosureFAST&#x02122; catheter contains a 7&#x000a0;cm long heating element at the end of the catheter, used for 'segmental&#x02019; ablation. A temperature of 120&#x000b0;C is generated in the heating element during a 20&#x000a0;second treatment cycle.</p><p>The insufficient GSV is punctured, ultrasound-guided, and a guidewire inserted. An introducer sheath is placed over the guidewire. The catheter is then introduced and positioned 2&#x000a0;cm distal to the saphenofemoral junction using ultrasound guidance. The tumescence anesthesia is delivered along the entire segment to be treated. An approximate volume of 10&#x000a0;mL per centimeter-treated vein is used. The patient is placed in a horizontal position and the catheter is activated. Every 20&#x000a0;seconds a new 7&#x000a0;cm segment of the GSV is treated after withdrawal. The most proximal segment of the GSV is treated with two cycles as recommended by the manufacturer. This process is repeated until the entire incompetent vein is ablated. After treatment, the deep venous system is controlled by ultrasound.</p><p>A compression stocking (20 to 30&#x000a0;mmHg) will be applied continuously for 24&#x000a0;hours and then daily for two weeks. Patients may resume normal activities immediately after the procedure. No concomitant phlebectomies or additional sclerotherapy is performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanochemical endovenous ablation (MOCA)</title><p>During MOCA, the ClariVein&#x000ae; device is used to induce a combination of mechanical and chemical damage to the vein wall. The ClariVein&#x000ae; device is an infusion catheter which is designed to administer a sclerosant in the incompetent vein through an opening at the end of the catheter. An iron wire extends through the whole catheter, with a small iron ball at the end. The purpose of the rotating wirer is fourfold: (1) promoting the coagulation activation by minimal mechanical damage to the endothelium, (2) inducing a vasospasm which reduces the diameter of the vein, (3) increasing the action of sclerosant by an increase in surface, (4) ensuring an even distribution of the sclerosant at the endothelium. The catheter together with the iron wire is connected to a motorized handle that allows for the rotation of the metal wire.</p><p>The insufficient GSV is punctured, ultrasound-guided and a guidewire inserted. A 4 Fr introduction sheath is introduced and subsequently the ClariVein&#x000ae; catheter is inserted and the tip of the iron wire is placed near the saphenofemoral junction, 0.5&#x000a0;cm below the superficial epigastric vein, as verified by ultrasound. The patient is treated in a horizontal position. The wire is then activated for 10&#x000a0;seconds in order to induce vasospasm. The device is slowly withdrawn with a speed of about 7&#x000a0;seconds per centimeter, while the sclerosant is continuously injected using 2&#x000a0;mL 3% polidocanol for the first 10 to 15&#x000a0;cm and 1.5% polidocanol for the remainder of the GSV. After treatment, the deep venous system is controlled with ultrasound. A compression stocking (20 to 30&#x000a0;mmHg) will be applied continuously for 24&#x000a0;hours and then daily for two weeks. Patients may resume normal activities immediately after the procedure. No concomitant phlebectomies or additional sclerotherapy is performed.</p><p>Polidocanol (Aethoxysklerol) is used as sclerosant, which is the only registered sclerosant in the Netherlands and is regularly used for sclerotherapy of reticular veins. The maximum amount of polidocanol depends on the weight of the patient, and will always be less than 2&#x000a0;mg/kg. Prior to treatment, the maximum allowable amount of polidocanol is determined for each patient. Then the length of the treated vein is measured. Both values are listed on the case report forms.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Follow-up treatment periods</title><p>After four weeks, one, two and five years, patients are seen at the outpatient clinic to observe anatomical and clinical success (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

While most techniques constantly report anatomical success rates over 90% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], more emphasis is on secondary treatment outcomes such as post-procedural pain, hematoma, quality of life and returning to normal activities. Therefore, the optimal treatment for GSV incompetence is unclear.</p><p>The aim of the present randomized trial is two-fold. First, it aims to compare anatomical and clinical success at one year after MOCA, with RFA. Several randomized trials have compared RFA with conventional surgery, endovenous laser ablation and foam sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. These studies showed the superiority of EVLA in terms of anatomical success at one to five years after surgery, although newer radiofrequency devices have similar results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Second, it aims to demonstrate that MOCA is associated with a significant reduction in post-procedural pain after treatment. Pain after endothermal ablation is considerable and probably an underreported complication in the literature. Recent studies have shown less post-procedural pain after RFA comparing with EVLA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Therefore, accompanied with similar occlusion rates with the newer RFA devices, we have assumed RFA to be one of the 'gold standard&#x02019; techniques in minimal invasive treatment for GSV incompetence. In order to have sufficient power, the trial was designed using a non-inferiority principle.</p><p>In conclusion, the MARADONA trial is multicenter randomized controlled trial that aims for a reduction in post-procedural pain after MOCA compared with RFA, with a similar anatomical and clinical success.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>The MARADONA trial started with inclusion of patients in July 2013.
