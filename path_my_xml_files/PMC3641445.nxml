Suboptimal prescribing may lead to poor pain control and other adverse patient outcomes. One study found that the most common medications involved in adverse drug reaction-related emergency admissions involved non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> which are commonly used to manage pain. Improved prescribing could result in better outcomes and remove the need for more costly, scarce, alternatives.</p><p>Pharmacists working in UK general practices are well-placed to improve pain pharmacotherapy because of their expertise in therapeutics, understanding of the polypharmacy regimens<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> frequently used in chronic pain management and established relationships with other primary care colleagues. In the UK National Health Service (NHS), recent regulatory changes now allow accredited pharmacists (as well as some other healthcare professionals such as nurses) to prescribe prescription-only medicines.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> Pharmacists can either be qualified as supplementary prescribers, in which case they operate within an agreed clinical management plan (CMP) in partnership with the doctor and patient, or as an independent prescriber, in which case they can either prescribe completely independently or within a CMP.</p><p>However, despite the increasing number of non-medical prescribers, including pharmacists, there has been no rigourous comparisons of the outcomes of non-medical versus general practitioner (GP) prescribing. This information is needed to assess the clinical effectiveness of different care models.</p><p>This paper reports findings from an exploratory randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing pharmacist medication review, with or without pharmacist prescribing, with standard care for patients with chronic pain.

Prior to the consultation, pharmacists completed a paper-based medication review of each patient's medical record and patients were asked to complete a pain diary to inform the consultation. A pharmaceutical care plan was agreed between the pharmacist and the patient. The plan assessed and documented relevant medical history and current conditions; known allergies and adverse drug reactions; relevant laboratory results; pain-related medications prescribed in the previous 10&#x02005;years; current pain-related prescription medications; current symptoms; lifestyle issues, including units of alcohol consumed per week; recommendations for changes to medication (if any); whether non-pharmaceutical treatments had been considered; and any other relevant issues. Copies of the pain diary and pharmaceutical care plan are available from the authors on request. At the end of the consultation any required prescriptions for medicines were issued by the pharmacist. Owing to Controlled Drug (CD) regulations in place at the time, prescribing for CDs was performed using a supplementary prescribing CMP,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> rather than independent prescribing.

In the Current Controlled Trials Registration (ISRCTNO6131530) we specified both primary and secondary outcome measures (primary: SF12, Health Utilities Index (HUI); secondary: chronic pain grade (CPG), HADS) based on our judgement following the earlier feasibility study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> However in practice, all outcomes were considered equal and no single measure was defined as the primary outcome, for example, for the purpose of a sample size calculation (see below). These four outcome measures are described below. Inclusion of both pain-specific and generic outcome measures was based on Initiative on Methods, Measurement and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) recommendations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> and an earlier feasibility study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></p><p>The SF-12v2 is a generic health and functioning scale,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> previously used in population-based studies of pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> A Physical (PCS) and Mental Component Score (MCS) were calculated, ranging from 0 to 100; a higher score indicates better functioning.</p><p>The HUI3 is a preference-based system for measuring comprehensive health status and health-related quality of life (HRQL).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> It provides descriptive evidence and a score for each dimension of health (vision, hearing, speech, ambulation/mobility, pain, dexterity, self-care, emotion and cognition) and an HRQL score for overall health. Each dimension has 3&#x02013;6 levels. Owing to the cost of the additional license fee to score data from this measure, this instrument was not subsequently analysed.</p><p>The CPG<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> is a seven-item scale which assesses pain severity on two dimensions: disability and intensity. The scale classifies pain according to the level of intensity and disability (I (low disability&#x02013;low intensity) to IV (high disability&#x02013;severely limiting)).</p><p>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> is a 14-item screening instrument which identifies the possible and probable caseness of anxiety (7 items (HADS-A)) and depression (7 items (HADS-D)); each item scored from 0 (not present) to 3 (highly present). Standard thresholds and previously used labels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> were applied: no depression/anxiety (0&#x02013;7), mild (8&#x02013;10), moderate (11&#x02013;15) or severe (&#x0003e;15)).</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Data collection</title><sec id="s2h1"><title>Participant questionnaires</title><p>Questionnaires were posted to participants at baseline (pre-randomisation) and 3 and 6&#x02005;months post-randomisation (follow-up was conducted between July 2010 and January 2011). Up to two reminders were sent. Questionnaire content included the outcome measures described earlier together with items on: demographic status (baseline only); screening items to confirm eligibility (baseline only); duration of pain condition (baseline only); location of pain; Morisky Medication Adherence Scale 4 (MMAS-4);<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> participant satisfaction (11 statements derived from the feasibility study for the prescribing arm (3&#x02005;months only)) and additional comments by participants.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> in line with MRC framework for development and evaluation of complex interventions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> A range of validated outcome measures was included, as well as a parallel qualitative process evaluation which assessed satisfaction and acceptability. The inclusion of six practices and their associated pharmacists from both Scotland and England increased the generalisability of the findings. Pharmacists received formal training and agreed and used a common treatment algorithm which should have increased standardisation of treatment. The preponderance of women (overall 62%) and average age of 65&#x02005;years reflects the wider chronic pain population<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> as does the distribution of pain site.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></p><p>There were, however limitations. Although high follow-up response rates were achieved at both 3 (86%) and 6&#x02005;months (85%) only 25% of eligible patients entered the trial. This low initial consent rate is in line with other studies,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref> but may cause unknown biases including problems of generalisability, as does the solely Caucasian ethnicity. Concerns identified by participants during the formal feedback, for example, having too many people involved in one's care may have contributed to poor response rates and rewording of participant recruitment documentation to reassure participants of the role of the pharmacist could address this. More participants withdrew in the prescribing arm compared with the other two arms, which might be attributed to the need for an additional practice visit. The study was an exploratory trial so no formal power calculation was undertaken. However, because there were no published MIDs available to estimate effect size for the outcomes in this population, it was important to present the actual clinical magnitude of change in outcome at 6&#x02005;months alongside a statistical assessment of this change (p value). This allows an assessment of both clinical and statistical significance simultaneously with the caveat that this is an exploratory study. With around 50 patients per arm, this was deemed sufficient numbers to examine the change in outcome measures with appropriate within-group and between-group univariate statistical tests. Owing to the nature of the intervention, no participants were blind to their group allocation, and so some outcomes, especially the qualitative components, may have been affected by social desirability bias.</p><p>Our outcome measures were self-reported, but this is the norm in pain studies as pain is a subjective experience.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> Furthermore we do not know how important the observed differences were to participants. Following precedents set in previous research,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> and because there is no consensus on an alternative measure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref> we used the HADS as a tool to classify people by severity of depression and anxiety. However it is strictly a screening tool, and the four levels of severity have not been formally validated. We therefore also compared outcomes using it as a continuous scale.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Relationship with other studies</title><p>This study is important because no other RCT has evaluated pharmacist prescribing and few studies, and importantly no RCTs, have evaluated pharmacist interventions for pain. In pharmacist prescribing most research has focused on reported experiences of professionals and patients, and not used validated outcome measures. Yet pharmacist prescribing is now widely practised. For pain, there have been a few small studies. Briggs <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref> conducted a small before-and-after evaluation (involving 65 patients) of a nurse and pharmacist-led chronic pain clinic in primary care. Pain intensity visual analogue scale scores reduced significantly over 6&#x02005;months. Another evaluation of 26 patients using a medication review service provided jointly by a physiotherapist and pharmacist in the UK, reported improvement in pain control for 88% of patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></p><p>The CPG was found to show a graded effect across the three arms, showing discrimination with both direction and strength of improvement, suggesting maximum benefit for those in the pharmacist prescribing arm. However, the reduction in overall score appears to be mediated by a change in the intensity of pain subscale rather than in pain-related disability. The effect size of 0.45 suggests this could be an important difference. In contrast, the SF-12, a measure of general health and functionality showed no significant difference between intervention arms, reflecting either no effect or or lack of power to detect an effect.</p><p>While most participants in this study were already within the normal range on the HADS scale, and therefore had minimal chance of improvement, there were nonetheless suggestions of better ourcomes in participants in the prescribing arm. Including a range of instruments is in line with IMMPACT recommendations,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref> which state that focus should be on the whole person, not just about pain. However, this needs to be balanced with minimising participant burden.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Explanations, implications and future research</title><p>The number of pharmacist&#x02019;s recommendations per participant was higher in the review arm than in the prescribing arm. This might seem contradictory to the possible greater benefit found in the prescribing arm. However, in the prescribing arm pharmacists met the participant and may have more readily identified and dismissed suggestions previously tried. The interview feedback highlighted that some recommendations for change, while sensible, had been tried already. This might also be the reason why there were only 60% of pharmacist recommendations with which the GP fully agreed. Self-reported adherence to medication at baseline was good. Despite this, the pharmacists still improved pain outcomes in the prescribing arm. This could have been due to changes in medications and/or participant education about optimal timing for administration of analgesic medicines. Further research is needed to confirm the beneficial effect of pharmacist prescribing and its sustainability.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results suggest that pharmacist prescribing (and possibly pharmacist review alone) for patients with chronic pain is feasible, acceptable and may lead to improvements in pain and other measures. A larger fully powered trial is now needed to confirm these findings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e286" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-002361.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e288" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-002361.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the participating patients, practices and pharmacists.
