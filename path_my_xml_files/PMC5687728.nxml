Whilst the value of observing an expert model is well established in a wide range of contexts [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], there is increasing support for the benefits of observing error-strewn performance [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Given the role of observational learning in effective and economical surgical training [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], this study aimed to determine the style of visual information leading to the most effective early acquisition of surgical skills on a robotic system.</p><p>Robotically-assisted devices are now widely used in minimally invasive surgery due to their benefits for patient outcomes and increased levels of surgeon satisfaction [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. There is, however, limited research on how best to instruct trainees during robotic surgical training, when the user must establish a new range of sensorimotor contingencies [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Observational learning, the process of observing an actor perform a task prior to physical practice, provides a way of accelerating this type of motor learning [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Modelling of actions is an effective method for transmitting information, particularly when complex movements are hard to verbalise. While observation is unlikely to lead to optimal learning on its own [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], it is particularly effective as a supplement to physical practice [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This benefit is often attributed to the observer developing a model of the coordination patterns required, or a &#x02018;perceptual blueprint&#x02019; [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], that serves as a standard of reference. This may occur through overlapping neural circuits for action observation and action production [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The efficacy of observational learning has previously been demonstrated for surgical skill acquisition [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. For example, in a minimally invasive surgical task, Snyder et al. [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] found simply observing an instance of expert performance to benefit medical students already trained to proficiency on a virtual reality (VR) simulator. Growing evidence, however, suggests that the observed model need not be an expert, and that in fact, viewing errors may contribute to the development of mechanisms for error detection and correction [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For instance, Buckingham et al. [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] found object lifting errors to be reduced in observers who viewed the lifting errors of others. Evidence for the benefit of error observation in a more complex task has also been found in simulated orthopaedic surgery [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Following baseline assessment, participants observed either an expert surgeon or an untrained novice perform a simple localization task, where the novice model displayed more erratic instrument control, slower task progression and poorer target visualisation. LeBel et al. found that the two groups improved to a similar degree in the majority of metrics immediately post-observation, but at a one-week follow-up the novice observation group showed significant improvements over their expert-observing counterparts. Given that observing expertise is suggested to promote a model of coordination patterns, and that observing errors may enable models of error detection and correction, the combined benefits of the two approaches could maximise this style of learning. The efficacy of viewing a &#x02018;learning model&#x02019;, developing from high-error to low-error performance, indicates a mix of performance may aid learning [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Indeed, in a sequential timing task Rohbanfard and Proteau [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] found a mixed novice/expert schedule to be most effective for learning [see also [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Nonetheless, there is only preliminary evidence for the benefits of mixed model observation. Therefore we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of a mixed model in comparison to novice and expert models alone.</p><p>In summary, prior research indicates that learning from errors may provide significant benefits for skill acquisition over sole observation of expertise [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In order to examine observational learning in the context of the acquisition of early robotic-surgical skill learning, we examined performance on a daVinci surgical system (Intuitive Surgical Ltd.) before and after observing novice, expert and mixed models. Furthermore, in order to determine the role played by attention in facilitating improvement, participants&#x02019; eye movements were recorded during model observation. It is expected, following LeBel et al. [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], that observing errors will be as beneficial as observing expertise immediately post-intervention, but will facilitate improved retention at a one week follow-up.</p><sec id="sec006"><title>Hypotheses</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>All observational learning groups will outperform the control group post-intervention and at a retention test.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Participants viewing the error-strewn model will outperform the expert model at retention.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The mixed observation model (novice then expert) will outperform either model alone at retention.</p></list-item></list></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Participants</title><p>120 undergraduate medical students (48 males) with no previous experience of robotically-assisted surgery were recruited through advertisement during lectures (mean age = 20.2 years, standard deviation = 2.5).

The primary task (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188233.g002">Fig 2a</xref>) was a &#x02018;ring-carrying&#x02019; exercise adapted from the Fundamentals of Robotic Surgery curriculum [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A plastic ring is transported along a 15cm curved wire, with the aim of moving the ring from the base to the end of the wire with the right hand, transferring to the left hand and then returning to the starting position without touching the wire. This task is designed to assess proficiency of instrument control. The first transfer task was a &#x02018;ball pick up and drop&#x02019; (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188233.g002">Fig 2b</xref>), adapted from the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery curriculum [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and used previously to assess robotic and laparoscopic skills [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

Visit two, which occurred seven days after the first visit (as in [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]), assessed retention of learning on the primary task followed by two transfer tasks.</p><p>At the start of testing participants were assessed for stereoscopic acuity using the Randot stereoacuity test (Stereo Optical Co, Inc., Chicago, IL). The test measures participants&#x02019; ability to discriminate a stereogram circle from two distractors across increasing levels of difficulty (from 400 to 20 seconds of arc), using a 1&#x02013;10 scoring system. Participants then watched a short introductory video explaining the experimental procedures. Participants were then given one minute to familiarise themselves with the console controls prior to the baseline test (as in [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]). Task performance was recorded with a GoPro Hero 3+ camera set to the side of the stimuli (out of view), for later offline analysis. Instrument movement parameters were recorded with a pair of GENEActiv accelerometers attached to each of the robot arms, which recorded tri-axial accelerations at 100 Hz.</p><p>Following the baseline ring-carrying test, participants were randomly assigned to one of the four observation conditions using random number generation. During the three observational learning conditions (novice, expert and mixed) participants watched a video of the ring-carrying task, whilst the control group were given a word search task for the mean duration of the videos. Participants in the video observation groups had point of gaze recorded using SMI ETG 2.0 eye-tracking glasses (SensoMotoric Instruments, Boston MA) that record onto a customized Samsung Galaxy smartphone. The glasses are lightweight (76 g) and record binocular eye movements and the visual scene at 30 Hz to a spatial resolution of 0.5&#x000b0;. During the videos, participants placed their head in a chin rest to minimise head movement and ensure attention was appropriately focused on the content of the videos. All videos were presented on an HD 24 inch Acer monitor placed 48 cm from the participant.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Performance scores on the three experimental tasks were obtained from video analysis following testing. For the ring-carrying task, time to completion was obtained from the recording, then errors were manually coded (number and type of error). A small touch of the wire scored one point and a drag along the wire or dropping the ring scored two points. The number of errors was divided by the time to completion to create an <italic>errors per second</italic> score. For the knot tying task, time to completion was similarly recorded, with a performance score obtained from a scoring system for surgical knots adapted from Tytherleigh et al. [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Points were assigned for completing the subsections of the knot correctly, without fumbling or making repeated attempts. For the ball drop transfer task, time to completion was recorded and errors coded using one point for a missed grab of the ball and two points for dropping the ball.</p><p>Surgical instrument proficiency was assessed using movement parameters obtained from accelerometry. Tracking of implement movement is widely used for assessing surgical skill, with path length and number of movements particularly linked to expertise [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Two movement variables were chosen to assess performance in this task. Firstly, jerk, a measure of change in acceleration over time, has previously been linked to surgical performance [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and indicates smooth instrument movements [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Secondly, entropy, a measure of randomness/complexity, has been linked to skill learning and automaticity [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and has previously been used to quantify surgical performance [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Accelerometry data was collated and synchronised using GENEActiv PCSoftware, and then analysed using Matlab. Raw data was filtered using a 2<sup>nd</sup> order, 3Hz Butterworth low pass filter to reduce noise [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], before converting to the Euclidean Norm Minus One [ENMO], which integrates x, y, and z plane accelerations and removes the net effect of gravity [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The ENMO provides a measure of total acceleration in any direction. Matlab was also used to calculate jerk [derivative of accelerations with respect to time] from the ENMO, using the formula Jerk = &#x00394;Acc/&#x00394;Time. Sample entropy of accelerations, which is robust to varying sample lengths, was calculated using the natural logarithm of the conditional probability that a series similar for <italic>n</italic> points remains similar at the next point [see [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]].</p><p>Allocation of attention has been linked to effective observational learning [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], which can be assessed through point of gaze [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Gaze behaviour has previously been used to discriminate attentional strategies of novice and expert surgeons [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and can indicate which areas of the task observers pay attention to [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Gaze data was analysed using SMI BeGaze 3.6 software, which provides automatic fixation detection, and allows user defined areas of interest (AOIs) to be assigned to the visual scene. Dynamic AOIs were assigned to the ring and robot end effectors to determine the proportion of time spent fixating relevant/irrelevant information and the frequency of switches between areas. Data that displayed a poor calibration was removed from the analysis (n = 8).</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using JASP [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Outliers (+/- 3 standard deviations from the mean) in performance (n = 5) and accelerometry (n = 3) were removed. Dependent variables were analysed using 3 (trial) x 4 (group) mixed ANOVAs, with one-way ANOVA used to examine interactions and Bonferroni-Holm corrected post-hoc tests where appropriate. Violations of sphericity were corrected for using a Greenhouse-Geisser correction factor. In order to determine equivalence of null effects, Bayes Factors (BF<sub>10</sub>) for main effects and paired comparisons were also obtained using a symmetric Cauchy prior. In addition, to evaluate the extent to which visual attention relates to subsequent learning, Spearman&#x02019;s correlation coefficients were computed between gaze metrics and performance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec012"><title>Results</title><p>One way ANOVA indicated there to be no group differences in age (p = .51, BF<sub>10</sub> = 0.10) or stereovision (p = .40, BF<sub>10</sub> = 0.14), showing the groups to be well matched (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188233.t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="pone.0188233.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0188233.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Participants&#x02019; demographic information.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0188233.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0188233.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Novice (n = 30)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Expert (n = 30)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mixed (n = 30)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control (n = 30)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t001fn001">&#x02020;</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.57(2.54)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.43(3.05)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.03(2.31)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19.67(2.19)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stereoscore<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t001fn001">&#x02020;</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.30(2.52)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.37(2.16)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.20(2.46)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.10(2.50)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male/Female<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t001fn001">&#x02020;</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15/15</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11/19</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11/19</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12/18</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Left/Right handers<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t001fn001">&#x02020;</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3/27</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3/27</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4/26</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3/27</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="t001fn001"><p><sup>&#x02020;</sup> No difference across groups, all p values &#x0003e;.40</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>To determine the relationship between our objective measures of instrument movement and the subjective coding of error performance, correlational analysis was used across the four groups.

The acquisition of motor skill in robotic surgery is strongly related to volume of physical practice [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Research has shown that observational learning activates the same cortical motor regions as physical practice [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and allows complex skills to be learnt more quickly [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In addition, action observation can contribute to skill learning when physical practice is not possible due to limited training resources, or during online or simulated training programmes. Therefore, this study aimed to build on recent evidence promoting the benefits of observing error-strewn performance [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] to determine whether viewing errors provided an effective model in a robotically-assisted surgical training task.</p><p>Overall, although we observed consistent performance benefits of observation across all of our video-watching groups, the content of what was observed had limited impact. As hypothesised, and in line with previous evidence [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], observing error-strewn performance provided an immediate learning benefit compared to a non-observation control. This was seen through a reduction in errors per second from baseline to post-intervention. However, unlike Buckingham et al. [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and Brown et al. [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] there was no benefit of observing errors above that of observing expertise. Comparable learning from novice and expert models has been found previously [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and LeBel et al. [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] only found group differences after a one-week interval, indicating novice/expert differences may take time to develop in a complex task.</p><p>It was also predicted that a mixed observation schedule would afford the greatest learning benefit, as it would provide the &#x02018;perceptual blueprint&#x02019; from the expert and the benefits for error detection from the novice. However the results of the mixed group were inconclusive, providing no evidence for the benefit of a mixed schedule over and above the other observation groups, immediately after viewing the videos. Furthermore, there was no difference between the mixed group and the non-observation control groups one week after the intervention, suggesting that observation of a combination of expert and novice performance might impair retention of skills compared to viewing either model in isolation. This finding is in contrast to those of Rohbanfard and Proteau [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] who found a mixed expert/novice model to be more beneficial than observing either model alone. This difference may be partly explained by the very simple sequential timing task used by Rohbanfard and Proteau [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], as findings from simple tasks may not relate well to the acquisition of complex sensorimotor skills [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The benefit of a mixed model has also been demonstrated by Domuraki et al. [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] in a central line insertion task. Domuracki et al. [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] found a performance benefit for a mixed model over the expert only model, but only when it was accompanied by specific feedback relating to observed errors. The authors concluded that errors are of benefit when observers know them to be errors, although the results could also be a more general effect of receiving additional feedback. In essence, the present findings may diverge from previous studies due to these task and feedback differences, although the inconclusive benefit of the mixed observation does suggest that there was no additive effect from seeing both novice and expert performance.</p><p>Additionally, the current findings differ from the results of LeBel et al. [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] in terms of performance of the task at a one-week follow up retention test. While LeBel et al. found group differences at retention, our results were less clear showing no obvious difference in terms of performance between the novice and expert groups. This apparent similarity between the groups was also evident in terms of performance in either transfer task. As no observation condition outperformed controls at transfer, benefits for learning were likely related to specifics of the ring-carrying task rather than a more general acquisition of skill on the daVinci system.</p><p>Our findings may diverge from similar previous studies due to additional factors influencing the mapping of observation to action [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For one, unlike the present study, participants in LeBel et al. (20) observed the operator&#x02019;s hand movements. Hence they saw not only the movement effects [the surgical instruments] but also the effector [the hands of the operator]. Mattar and Gribble [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] suggest that in learning from errors, observers model not only <italic>what</italic> movements to make, but <italic>how</italic> to make them. Therefore the benefit of error observation may have been greater in LeBel et al. as observers not only received information of <italic>what</italic> errors to avoid, but <italic>how</italic> to avoid them. This is supported by unpublished data from LeBlanc et al. [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], who recorded gaze behaviour whilst untrained participants observed the novice and expert video models used by LeBel et al. LeBlanc and colleagues found that time spent observing the model&#x02019;s hands was related to reduced task completion time and efficient movement in the subsequent simulated arthroscopic task. This effect was driven by the novice observation group, who showed strong relationships between observing the hands and probe distance, time to completion and a global performance score. These relationships did not hold in the expert-observing group, suggesting that when learning from errors, how the error is made provides crucial information.</p><p>Another difference between the current study and previous work might relate to the feedback available to the operator. In the surgical simulator used by LeBel et al. [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], participants received haptic feedback of contact with anatomical structures provided by robotic force-feedback devices. In the current study, by contrast, participants received no haptic feedback from the end-effector. While touch feedback is crucial for completion of many basic manual tasks [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], the evidence for the benefits of haptics in robotic surgical performance is not unanimous [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. A meta-analysis by Van der Meijden and Schijven [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] shows mixed results for the importance of haptic feedback in surgical performance, but a generally positive effect for early phase skill acquisition. Mattar and Gribble [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] describe how simulation is required when adapting information about movement kinematics from visual information, which is likely supported by haptic information given the benefit of haptic feedback for motor skill learning [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. As such, viewing the hands and receiving haptic feedback may have influenced the way errors were simulated, through increased knowledge of <italic>how</italic> the errors were made. Future studies may wish to examine whether the effectiveness of learning from errors depends, in part, on receiving information about <italic>how</italic> to avoid them [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>Consistent with previous work showing that attention can modulate effective observational learning [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], we found increased time directing gaze to irrelevant areas of the task (i.e., not on the ring or instruments) was found to be related to increased movement entropy immediately post task, and poorer performance at retention. This relationship illustrates how inattention can be detrimental to learning. Interestingly, there was no obvious benefit of viewing the ring versus the instrument end effectors, in contrast to previous work which has demonstrated benefits of attending to the target of the action in surgical skill learning [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Thus, although paying attention to relevant aspects of the task is crucial [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], here, attending to the instruments or the ring was equally informative.</p><p>An additional outcome of this study is the utility of accelerometry measures for assessing performance in a surgical task. Wrist-worn accelerometers have previously been used for the tracking of gait kinematics [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], but had not been examined in a surgical setting. Motion tracking from surgical simulators has been used previously to calculate measures like path length, force exertion and jerk [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] that have clear relevance for surgical performance. The current findings, however, suggest that wrist worn accelerometers can provide a simple and cost effective alternative for assessing movement parameters and can contribute to objective assessment of surgical skill. Here, and in line with previous research [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], improved performance was related to reduced instrument jerk. It has been found previously that novices differ from experts in force parameters within laparoscopic surgery, exerting greater force with larger accelerations and jerk [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Trejos et al. [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] found force based metrics like jerk and acceleration to be a better predictor of experience level than task completion time. Assessment of jerk has strong face validity, given that large erratic movements can lead to tissue damage and poor patient outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. However, the same relationship was not found for acceleration entropy, a measure of randomness, despite a strong reduction in entropy across trials. While participants&#x02019; movements may have become less random with experience and growing confidence [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], absolute measures of force, like jerk, may have more direct relevance for surgical performance.</p><p>A limitation of this study may be the restricted physical practice undertaken by participants. Participants may have still obtained major benefits from extra practice that meant group differences were more difficult to observe. Additionally Andrieux and Proteau [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] suggest that the benefits of error-observation are maximised through accompanying physical practice. Future research may wish to intersperse multiple retention tests with periods of physical practice to assess whether group differences emerge. Also, given the differences found between the present study and LeBel et al. [<xref rid="pone.0188233.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], future studies could usefully assess the benefit of seeing the kinematics of the operator&#x02019;s hands for understanding <italic>how</italic> to avoid errors. Further work shall aim to incorporate these findings to evaluate how the use of varied models and different styles of information might enhance the efficacy of training curricula.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0188233.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Gorman</surname><given-names>PJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Meier</surname><given-names>AH</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Rawn</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Krummel</surname><given-names>TM</given-names></name>. <article-title>The future of medical education is no longer blood and guts, it is bits and bytes</article-title>. <source>Am J Surg</source>. <year>2000</year>
