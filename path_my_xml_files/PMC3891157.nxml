Then, the patients were randomly allocated to receive CY 4 g/m<sup>2</sup> (arm A) or 1.5 g/m<sup>2</sup> (arm B) in combination with lenograstim.

Chemotherapy and hematopoietic growth factor (HGF), either alone or in combination, increases the number of circulating progenitor cells. A few randomized trials that have compared mobilization approaches have been reported on<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5)</xref>, but a variety of methods has been shown to effectively increase the PBPC yield while decreasing the number of required apheresis procedures. There are numerous studies that have strongly suggested that the addition of HGF, such as G-CSF and GM-CSF, to the myelosuppressive chemotherapy enhances the mobilization while it reduces the myelotoxicity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7)</xref>. A combination of chemotherapy and HGF is currently the most frequently used protocol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8)</xref>.</p><p>Many different myelosuppressive chemotherapy protocols have been used for mobilization in conjunction with HGF. Although the best protocol is not yet known, high-dose cyclophosphamide (CY) (3-7 g/m<sup>2</sup>) is the most commonly reported protocol because it is active against most tumors and it can be justifiably given even for diseases when the conventional treatment is not sufficiently myelosuppressive<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9)</xref>. However, the main limitations at this dosage of CY are neutropenic sepsis and bleeding even with the addition of HGF. Another emerging impression is that adequate mobilization with less morbidity may occur even with the chemotherapy regimen that is only mildly myelotoxic, such as CY at 1-2 g/m<sup>2</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11)</xref>.</p><p>In this randomized trial, we evaluated the PBPC mobilizing effect of high-dose CY (4 g/m<sup>2</sup>) versus low-dose CY (1.5 g/m<sup>2</sup>) that was given in combination with lenograstim (glycosylated G-CSF). We compared the kinetics of the progenitor mobilization, the number of apheresis sessions that were required to obtain the target cell dose, the hematological recovery after SCT and the toxicities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Patient eligibility</title><p>Patients with high-risk non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) or high-risk breast cancer (BC) who were scheduled to undergo PBPC mobilization for autologous SCT were enrolled. The patients ranged in age from 16 to 60 years, and the patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2 were included in the study. High-risk NHL patients were defined as those who had a histologic subtype of diffuse mixed, diffuse large or immunoblastic lymphoma according to NCI Working Formulation, and they were placed in the high-intermediate or high risk group according to the age-adjusted International Prognostic Index. The patients had to have a complete or partial response to induction chemotherapy. High-risk BC patients were defined as those who had received radical mastectomy and had involvement of 10 or more axillary lymph nodes. Those patients who had inflammatory BC or who had received post-operative radiation therapy were excluded from the study. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of each participating medical center, and all the patients gave us their written informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Mobilization of PBPC</title><p>The high-risk NHL patients received induction chemotherapy that consisted of 4 cycles of CHOP (CY 750 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV on day 1; doxorubicin 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV on day 1; vincristine 1.4 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV on day 1; prednisolone 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per oral on days 1 through 5). The high-risk BC patients received adjuvant chemotherapy with 2-3 cycles of FEC or FAC (5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV on day 1; epirubicin 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> or doxorubicin 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV on day 1; CY 600 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV on day 1). After this, the patients were randomized to either the A or B arms of the study. Randomization was done by the coordinating center, and the patients were stratified as NHL or BC. The patients who were randomized to arm A and arm B received CY 4 g/m<sup>2</sup> and 1.5 g/m<sup>2</sup> IV on day 1, respectively. Lenograstim (250 &#x000b5;g/day) was given subcutaneously at around 9 PM from the third day until the day before the final leukapheresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>PBPC harvest and cryopreservation</title><p>Leukapheresis was begun when the WBC count reached above 3&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>/L after the nadir, and it was continued daily until the target cell dose of 3&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup> MNC/kg or 2&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> CD34+ cells/kg was reached. However, if the WBC count did not fall below 3&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>/L, leukapheresis was commenced when the WBC count began to increase after the nadir. The PBPCs were harvested by large volume leukapheresis by processing approximately 3 blood volumes. All the collected samples were cryopreserved using 10% dimethylsulfoxide as a cryoprotectant, and the samples were stored in liquid nitrogen until further use.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of CD34+ cells and CFU-GM</title><p>To evaluate the PBPC kinetics, CD34+cell measurement and CFU-GM assay in the PB was done every other day from the first day of CY administration until the first leukapheresis, and then it was daily thereafter until the final leukapheresis. The measurements were also done in every apheresis product. All the samples from each participating center were transported to the Seoul National University Hospital in fresh state for the CD34+ cell measurement and the CFU-GM assay. CD34+ cell measurement was done by using a ProCOUNT kit (Becton Dickens, USA) and a CFU-GM assay by MethoCult H4531 (StemCell Technologies, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>High-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation</title><p>The high-risk NHL patients received high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) with the BEAM protocol (BCNU 300 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV on day 7; etoposide 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/d IV on days 6 through 3; cytarabine 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV on days 6 through 3; melphaln 140 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV on day 1). The high-risk BC patients received HDC with the CBP protocol (BCNU 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV on day 6; CY 2 g/m<sup>2</sup> IV on days 5 through 3, cisplatin 55 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV on days 5 through 3). At 48 hours after the last dose of chemotherapy, the autologous PBPCs were rapidly thawed in a 37&#x02103; water-bath and then they were infused via a central venous catheter without filtering. Lenograstim was administered until the recovery of the patients' marrow function.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>This study was originally designed as an open, randomized, multi-center, parallel-group phase III trial for comparing the two doses of CY for their ability to mobilize PBPCs in combination with lenograstim. The primary endpoint of the study was the number of leukapheresis sessions that was required to obtain the target cell number. We assumed that the clinically significant difference between the two groups was 1 and the standard deviation was 1.2. The number of patients that needed to be recruited was estimated to be 20 in each arm with a significance level of 5 percent and a power of 80 percent when assuming a dropout rate of 15 percent. The secondary endpoints were the kinetics of the PBPCs' mobilization, the toxicity of the two different mobilization methods and the patients' hematological recovery after transplantation. The time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment were, respectively, defined as the number of days needed after the infusion of PBPC to achieve an ANC&#x02265;0.5&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>/L and a platelet count&#x02265;20&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>/L, and this was independent of platelet transfusions that were done for more than 3 consecutive days.</p><p>Descriptive statistics are presented as the median and the range, unless otherwise specified. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for analyzing the continuous variables. Comparison of the categorical variables was performed using Fisher's exact test or the chi-square test. The relationship between the different hematological parameters of the PB and the leukapheresis products was estimated by using non-parametric Spearman rank correlation. All the statistical tests were two-sided, and the differences were considered significant if the <italic>p</italic> values were &#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Patient characteristics</title><p>The study was prematurely closed due to the poor patient accrual. Twenty-seven patients were enrolled and randomized between June 1999 and January 2002. Fifteen patients received high-dose CY (arm A), and 12 patients received low-dose CY (arm B) for the PBPCs' mobilization. The median age of the patients was 44.5 years (range: 19-58) in arm A and 40 years (range: 24-59) in arm B. The male-to-female ratio was 7:8 in arm A, and it was 5:7 in arm B.

The number of CD34+ cells/kg that were infused correlated with a more rapid neutrophil recovery (r=-0.6, <italic>p</italic>=0.009).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>For all the categories of the mobilization protocols, the amount of previous chemoradiotherapy is one of the most significant determinants of the progenitor cell yield<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9)</xref>. To evaluate the efficacy of the mobilization protocols, it may be reasonable to enroll the patients who were exposed to only a small amount of chemoradiotherapy. So, we performed this study with enrolling the newly diagnosed high-risk NHL or BC patients who were planning to undergo HDC with autologous SCT after only 3-4 cycles of induction or adjuvant chemotherapy. When the study was first designed in 1998, there were several promising phase II studies being done on autologous SCT for high-risk NHL or BC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16)</xref>. However, the patient accrual was gradually reduced and the study was prematurely closed, in part because the popularity for autologous SCT in these settings has subsided.</p><p>Many investigators have used disease-specific chemotherapy for mobilization, although this may not be universally applicable to all patients. High-dose CY (3-7 g/m<sup>2</sup>) has also been extensively used. The major problem with CY-induced mobilization at this dosage is the drug-related toxicity. Patients who were treated with 4 g/m<sup>2</sup> CY had a 50% hospitalization rate for febrile neutropenia and the rate was 100% for patients treated with 7 g/m<sup>2</sup> CY<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17)</xref>. We also observed that 40% of the patients mobilized with 4 g/m<sup>2</sup> CY developed neutropenic fever and they needed treatment with antibiotics. However, only 8% of the patients mobilized with 1.5 g/m<sup>2</sup> CY developed neutropenic fever. There were actually no cases of severe thrombocytopenia and the other toxicities were also milder in the low-dose CY arm. Low-dose CY was very safe from the viewpoint of toxicity, and the cost was lower due to reduced use of antibiotics and transfusions. Adequate PBPC mobilization is expected to be possible on an outpatient basis and this could further reduce the cost of the procedure.</p><p>All the patients in the high-dose CY arm whose CD34+ cell counts were measured needed a single leukapheresis session to get the targeted collection, whereas 33% of the patients in the low-dose CY arm needed two sessions. However, most of the participating clinicians carried out at least 2 leukapheresis sessions even though the targeted cell dose was obtained in one leukapheresis session. Thus, low-dose CY practically appears to be similar to the high-dose CY for the number of apheresis sessions required for the targeted collection.</p><p>High-dose CY increased the number of PB CD34+ cells and the CFU-GM about 5-fold and 8-fold over the baseline, respectively. The corresponding figures in the low-dose CY arm were 2.5-fold and a 7-fold increase over the baseline, respectively. A greater increase of the PB CD34+ cell count in the high-dose CY arm resulted in a significantly greater CD34+ cell yield of the apheresis products. The mean number of CD34+ cells collected in the high-dose CY arm was about 2 times higher than that in the low-dose CY arm. On the other hand, the increase of the CFU-GM in the PB was comparable for the two groups, and the yields of the CFU-GM in the apheresis products were similar. This discrepancy may be due to the heterogeneity of the CD34+ cell population. Although CD34+ cells have been used as the best phenotypic marker of the hematopoietic stem cells used for transplantation, this population is not homogeneous. Only about 1% or less of the CD34+ cells represents the hematopoietic stem cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18)</xref>. The heterogeneous CD34+ cell populations represent different CD34+ subsets such as the primitive stem cells, the early myeloid cells, the late myeloid cells and the late erythroid cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19)</xref>.</p><p>The timing of PBPC collection has not yet been established, but most medical groups start apheresis when the leukocyte count is 2 to 5&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>/L during the chemotherapy and the hematopoietic growth factor mobilization. We started apheresis when the WBC count reached above 3&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>/L after the nadir. The CD34+ cell counts in the PB at this point were mostly over 30&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup>/L in the high-dose CY arm, and this enabled us to collect the targeted cells with a single apheresis session<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20)</xref>. In the low-dose CY arm, the WBC count did not fall below 3&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>/L except for one patient, and we started apheresis when the WBC count began to increase after the nadir. The CD34+ cell counts in the PB at this point were lower than those in the high-dose CY arm, but they were in accord with one of the highest points. Thus, the timing of the PBPC collection in both arms seemed to be adequate.</p><p>Engraftment after transplantation was similar in the two mobilization groups. Although the CD34+ cell content has been correlated with the time to engraftment, there is a threshold effect beyond which the cell number does not appear to make a difference<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22)</xref>. Thus, it may be unnecessary to collect PBPCs above a certain level. However, high-dose CY may be beneficial if the primary goal is to collect the CD34+ cells for manipulation, such as for gene therapy or for in vitro expansion or selection.</p><p>In conclusion, mobilization with low-dose CY plus lenograstim is an effective regimen with very mild toxicity in comparison to high-dose CY. These results will translate into more effective cost control and better resource utilization. However, high-dose CY plus lenograstim may be beneficial when a high number of CD34+ cells is required.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation
