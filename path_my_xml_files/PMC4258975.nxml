Regional anesthesia, most commonly subarachnoid block (SAB) is preferred in elderly patients to avoid the various complications and the postoperative disruption of mental functioning with general anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] However, the associated hypotension has a reported incidence of 25-80% in the elderly.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>The maintenance of perioperative hemodynamics during spinal anesthesia has been attracting the attention of researchers since decades; with crystalloid loading being the most favored regime. However, this regime may be unsuitable for the elderly population for the fear of fluid overload. Various colloid solutions have also been added to crystalloids by various researchers, but their effectivity and safety may not cover the in elderly population.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] This is due to progressive and universal attrition of complex integrated autonomic reflexes responsible for failure of cardiovascular homeostasis in aged population.</p><p>Among the vasopressors, ephedrine has been a commonly used agent for managing spinal hypotension since 1927. However, its use in elderly has not attained clear consensus due to fear of tachycardia and hypertension associated with its use.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>The purpose of our study was to compare the efficacy of the two alternative regimens as prophylaxis for the prevention of SAB induced hypotension. Injection ephedrine 30 mg and colloid preloading was achieved with polygeline 3.5% for this purpose.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted on 100 patients of age more than 50 years and weight between 55 and 65 kg undergoing orthopedic surgeries on lower limb under SAB after approval from institutional review board. The patients were comparable with respect to age, height, type of anesthesia, cardiac risk index, and preoperative parameters. They were allocated randomly to either of the regime groups after written informed consent and due approval from the Hospital Ethics Committee [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Consort diagram showing the selection and randomization of patients</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-8-334-g001"/></fig><p>All patients were assessed clinically and only American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), I, II and III selected for the study. Patients with severe respiratory or cardiac disease (cardiac arrhythmias, abnormal cardiac anatomy or congestive cardiac failure), on medications such as digoxin or &#x003b2;-blockers that could alter the normal response to our treatment, uncontrolled hypertension, significant dehydration, any contraindication to SAB and a hemoglobin &#x0003c;10 g% were excluded.</p><p>Patients were classified as hypertensive if they had a baseline SAP of &#x0003e;150 mmHg or if they were receiving regular treatment for it. The antihypertensive medications were taken note of and continued preoperatively.</p><p>Routine investigations such as hemoglobin, blood sugar, blood urea, Rh typing, coagulation profile, X-ray chest and electrocardiogram (ECG) were carried out. Additional investigations were conducted as per individual requirements. As per institutional policy, all the patients received tab diazepam 5 mg on the night before the surgery to allay anxiety and fasted overnight.</p><p>On arrival to the operating room, an 18-gauge intravenous (i.v.) cannula was inserted and routine cardiovascular monitoring equipment attached to record baseline parameters like noninvasive arterial blood pressure, heart rate (HR), ECG and pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>).</p><p>In Group I, injection ephedrine 30 mg (intramuscular [i.m.]) was administered 10 min before induction of SAB. Patients were observed for any changes in cardiovascular parameters.</p><p>In Group II, injection polygeline 3.5% 500 ml (i.v.) was infused over 10 min just prior to SAB with constant vigilance for any signs of allergic reactions or fluid overload in addition to the hemodynamic monitoring.</p><p>Spinal anesthesia was instituted in all cases in the lateral position, at L2-3 or L-4 level, using 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine, volume depending on patients&#x02019; weight, height, sex and physical condition.</p><p>Sensory level was confirmed at 5 and 15 min. intervals with pinprick. Maintenance infusion of injection Ringer's lactate was administered to both the groups as calculated according to the conventional 4-2-1 rule.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Redistribution and evaporative surgical fluid losses were replaced with 4 ml/kg of crystalloid.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Blood was transfused if the losses summed up to 10-20% of the blood volume.</p><p>Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure were measured at 2-3 min intervals until 10 min. after induction and at 5 min. intervals thereafter. An episode of hypotension was defined as a fall in SBP by 25% of the baseline (mean of three consecutive readings) or an absolute value &#x0003c;90 mm of Hg; treatment was instituted only if the next reading taken 1 min apart also showed persistent hypotension. Any SBP variation of 25% from the baseline or an absolute value of 90 mm of Hg was observed carefully.</p><p>Episodes of hypotension were treated with i.v. boluses of injection Ringer's lactate 2.5 ml/kg. A maximum of three boluses were given, and if SBP remained &#x0003c;75% of baseline, injection ephedrine (6 mg) i.v. was also given.</p><p>Postoperatively, the patients were followed-up for any complications or hemodynamic instability.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The data were compiled and statistically analyzed using &#x0201c;Chi-square&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Student's <italic>t</italic>-test.&#x0201d; The previous studies have selected 45-60 patients to evaluate hypotension after SAB using various regimes.

SAB provides superb operating conditions with a drier surgical field, reduced blood loss, lower incidence of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, postoperative analgesia and above all the maintenance of mental function.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Reduced physiological reserve and chronic diseases predispose them to long term complications after hypotension particularly coronary artery disease and cognitive behavioral dysfunction.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Management modalities for hypotension include volume resuscitation and vasopressor therapy. The efficacy of crystalloid loading, which dates back to 30 years, is still under doubt. Over and above, these benefits seem doubtful in elderly population who have higher propensity to develop hypotension because of reduced sympathetic tone. Moreover, poor cardiac reserve giving rise to significant increase in central venous pressure, pulmonary edema and hemodilution, simultaneously increasing the need for urinary catheterization.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Ephedrine has been the first agent to be used successfully to treat hypotension induced by SAB in 1927. It is sympathomimetic with both &#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;-adrenergic activity and also releases noradrenaline from storage sites. There are numerous studies that have proved its role in preventing hypotension after SAB targeting obstetrics and orthopedic surgeries.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] We chose elderly population for our study to evaluate its effectiveness as a vasopressor for maintaining hemodynamics without crystalloid loading. i.m. route has been preferred for the fear of tachyphylaxis with repeated i.v. injections.</p><p>Our study shows higher pulse rates with ephedrine in the first half hour after administration of spinal anesthesia, which may also have contributed to better hemodynamic stability by maintaining the cardiac output. It is feared that it may be ineffective in reversing the spinal induced decrease in systemic vascular resistance, possible because of its &#x003b2;-agonist effect causing arteriolar dilatation in opposing to &#x003b1; vasoconstrictor effect. Moreover, its &#x003b2; mediated increase in HR may expose elderly patients with latent coronary disease to myocardial ischemia.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] However, in our study, elderly patients of ASA Group, II and III maintained hemodynamic stability in ephedrine group, albeit tachycardia in few cases.</p><p>Colloid solution is proposed to be more effective for its large molecular weight ensures longer intravascular retention and avoids overcorrection of hemodynamics seen with vasopressors.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] A plausible explanation for the failure of injection polygeline in the elderly may be that the reduced physiological reserve in the elderly patients make them less able to respond to volume by increasing cardiac output.</p><p>This study also emphasizes the role of i.v. fluids in maintaining preload and thus cardiac output as the patients of Group I were well hydrated, whereas those of Group II received 500 ml of fluid in the form of colloid in addition to their maintenance fluid requirement.</p><p>Our results are in accordance with other studies on the management of hypotension occurring during central neural block where crystalloids, colloids and vasopressors have been used alone or in combinations.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] McCrae and Wildsmith concluded that each patient should be treated on individual merit, recognizing that many factors may influence arterial pressure during anesthesia and surgery.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Similarly Morgan also concluded in his study on regional anesthesia induced hypotension that there is no single management strategy.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The meticulously calculated administration of crystalloids in our study worked well in conjunction with prophylatic vasopressor, whereas, with colloid preloading incremental fluid boluses were administered.</p><p>The complications of ephedrine as documented in literature include central nervous system symptoms: Vertigo, headache, vomiting.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] These symptoms were not observed in our study, which may be due to difference in dose and route of administration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This prospective, randomized, singe blinded, clinical study involving a comparison of two different measures intended to reduce hypotension post-SAB in elderly patients showed greater hemodynamic stability with preemptive injection ephedrine, 30 mg (i.m.), given 10 min before sub arachnoid block compared with an infusion of injection polygeline 3.5% 500 ml.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn
