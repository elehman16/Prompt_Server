A detailed and reliable account of the event by an eyewitness is the most important part of the diagnostic evaluation, but it may not often be available. Electroencephalography (EEG) is recommended in evaluation of a child with first seizure presentation and it is a useful diagnostic tool in diagnosis of seizure and differentiating it from seizure-like attacks[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>].</p><p>EEG needs cooperation and immobility of the patient and in all children, apart from the age, recording in natural sleep is preferred to drug- induced one. But, in children who do not naturally sleep, pharmacological agents and procedural sedation should be used to induce it[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>].</p><p>Different sedation regimens may be used in children for sedation induction. Chloral hydrate is a non-opiate, non-benzodiazepines sedative-hypnotic drug which has been used for pediatric sedation induction in dosage of 40-100 mg/kg for years[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>]. But, there are concerns about its long action duration, obstruction of airway and depression in respiration, desaturation of oxygen, sedative effects consistency and its potential for carcinogenicity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>]. Promethazine is a cheap and easily available antiemetic agent which can be used for sedation induction as an old sedative agent[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>].</p><p>There has been no randomized trial to compare these two agents in drug-induced sleep EEG. So, the purpose of this study was to compare efficacy and safety of oral chloralhydrate (CH) and promethazine (PZ) in sedation induction for sleep EEG of children in Yazd, a central city in IR Iran.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S0002"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><p>We followed a randomized single-blind study on sixty referred children to EEG Unit of Shahid Sadoughi Hospital from January 2010 to February 2011.</p><p>Thirty children were required in clinical, open-label, parallel group study conducted on each group to detect a 20% difference in efficacy between the two drugs with type one error (alpha) of 0.05 and 80% power. Eligible participants included children aged 1-10 years, referred to EEG Unit by a pediatric neurologist based on standard indications after a clinical assessment which was indicative of seizure or unclear spells or seizure-like events, didn't sleep naturally, and were classified as American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) class 1 (a normally healthy patient) or 2 (a patient with mild systemic disease: mild asthma, controlled diabetes mellitus)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>]. Exclusion criteria consisted of presence of gastritis or any other serious systemic diseases, severe systemic reaction and receiving a sedative or hypnotic agent within the past 48 hours.</p><p>The trial used computer generated equal randomization and allocation ratio was 1:1 for the two groups. Randomisation was done by a computer generated random number list and blinding was done by employing an investigator with no clinical involvement in the trial. Data collectors, outcome assessors and data analysts were all kept blinded to the allocation but the interventionists (EEG staff). The trial adhered to established procedures to maintain separation between person who took outcome assessment and staff that delivered the intervention. The drug was delivered by EEG staff and primary and secondary outcomes were assessed by the resident of research who was not informed of the drug group assignment. Investigators, staff and participants were all kept masked to outcome measurements and trial results.</p><p>The children were randomized to receive either single dose of 70 mg/kg chloral hydrate which was diluted in water (Group I) or 1 mg/kg of promethazine dissolved in water (Group II). In both groups, the drugs were administered orally and before entering electroencephalography room. The sedation level was observed and recorded every 10 min. After the child was adequately sedated, EEG was recorded.</p><p>Ramsay sedation scale was used for assessment of sedation level[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">11</xref>]. If the child was not sedated after 30 minutes of drug ingestion, the second dose of the drug, in half of the first one, was administered. Heart rate, blood pressure and respiratory rate were measured before and every 15 minutes after two hours of drug taking. Pulse oximetry was also done before and within two hours after the drug was taken. A Ramsay score of four was considered as adequately sedated.</p><p>The primary outcome was efficacy in adequate sedation and successful recording of EEG. Secondary outcome included clinical side effects, serious adverse events (respiratory depression requiring assisted ventilation, cyanosis, hypoxia (oxygen saturation of less than 90%), hypotension or 25% or greater decrease in pre sedation mean arterial blood pressure, severe vomiting, intractable irritability and agitation, apnea, laryngospasm, bradycardia, time from administration of the drug to adequate sedation, caregiver's satisfaction on a Likert scale (5 for completely satisfied, 4 for satisfied, 3 for partially satisfied, 2 for partially unsatisfied and 1 for completely unsatisfied), and total stay time in EEG unit.</p><p>Any kind of clinical side effects were evaluated either by parents<sup>,</sup> report or by physical examination within two hours after taking the drugs. Failure to achieve adequate sedation (patient awakened or moved, interfered with completion of EEG, inadequate sedation and need to administration of other sedative drug) and procedure abortion due to serious adverse events, were considered as failure of sedation regimen. The developmental status of the patient was assessed by a pediatric neurologist based on Denver II Developmental screening test.</p><p>The data was analyzed using SPSS 15 statistical software. Chi-square test or Fisher exact test was used for data analysis of qualitative variables and mean values were compared using independent t-test. Differences were considered significant at <italic>P</italic> values of less than 0.05.</p><p>Informed consent was taken from the parents. The study has been approved by the ethic committee of Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran. The design and conduct of this trial was straightforward, and we did not have any exclusions or losses during follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="S0003"><title>Findings</title><p>Twenty four girls (40%) and 36 boys (60%) with mean age of 2.9&#x000b1;1.9 years were evaluated.
