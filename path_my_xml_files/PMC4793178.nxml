Caffeine consumption is increasing by the world&#x02019;s population and there is a relationship between caffeine intake and adverse reproductive outcomes. The aim of this
study was to evaluate the effects of caffeine on implantation sites, number of live births,
birth weight, crown-rump length (CRL) and abnormality in pregnant rats.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>In this experimental study, 40 female albino rats (170-190
g) were randomly divided into two experimental and two control groups (n=10/each
group). In both experimental groups, animals received caffeine intraperitoneally (IP:
150 mg/kg/day) on days 1-5 of pregnancy. In experimental group 1, treated animals
were euthanized on day 7of pregnancy and the number of implantation sites was
counted. In experimental group 2, treated animals maintained pregnant and after delivery, the number of live births, birth weight, CRL and abnormality of neonates were
investigated. In control group, animals received IP injections of distilled water. Data
were analyzed by independent t test.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Results showed that administration of caffeine significantly decreased the number of implantation sites, number of live births and CRL as compared with control group

A variety of physiological adaptations are required to create an environment for the optimal fetal development during pregnancy. Pregnant women are concerned about what they consume during pregnancy. The widespread consumption of caffeine by pregnant women suggests that it is important to determine whether caffeine may influence maternal physiology and development of the fetus during pregnancy (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). </p><p>A few of the known biological effects of caffeine are central nervous system stimulation, increased secretion of catecholamine, increased heart rate and relaxation of smooth muscle (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Due to high lipid solubility and low molecular weight characteristics, caffeine crosses through the placenta easily (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Fenster et al. (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) reported that after repeated consumption of caffeine in pregnant women, plasma caffeine levels and its biological effects are influenced by the metabolic characteristic of caffeine. An increase in half-life of caffeine during the last few weeks of pregnancy is caused by the elevated estrogen levels. Therefore, the caffeine blood levels in the mother and the fetus increase, but the fetus has no enzymes to metabolize it (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). A number of studies have showed that caffeine may influence the reproductive outcome and fetal development (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). </p><p>Previous studies indicated that maternal caffeine consumption might increase the risk of an early spontaneous abortion (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Other studies showed that consumption of coffee during pregnancy might be associated with a shortened gestation and a lowered birth weight, but they did not find any relationship between risk of spontaneous abortion and caffeine metabolite (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). </p><p>Some investigators reported that consuming high amounts of caffeine during pregnancy may be harmful (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). It is yet unknown whether consuming small amounts of caffeine during pregnancy affects fetal development. In mammals, caffeine has been shown to be teratogenic only at extremely high doses, or following a single large intraperitoneal (IP) injection. Reduced fetal body weight and delayed skeletal ossification have been observed at relatively high doses of caffeine (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). </p><p>Since caffeine-containing products are consumed in large quantities, its effect during gestation on the developing offspring is important (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Although there are studies focusing on the effects of caffeine, the exact activity mechanisms of caffeine on pregnancy have been less characterized (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In the present study, the effects of caffeine injection on the offspring of pregnant rats given a dose approximating to that of a high daily coffee consumption were evaluated. Furthermore we aimed to investigate the effects of caffeine on implantation sites, number of live births, birth weight, crown-rump length (CRL) and abnormality of neonate rats. </p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Acute toxic dose</title><p>Acute toxicity [lethal dose 50 (LD50)] of caffeine was evaluated through the IP injections into rats as described by Miller and Tainted (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Briefly, the method involved the administration of 7 different concentrations of caffeine to 7 groups of rats (n=5/group) in pilot study. After 1 week, there were no deaths in animals receiving caffeine in concentrations of 1, 10, 50, 100, 150, 500 and 1000 mg/kg. The effects of 3 different concentrations of caffeine on fertility rate were tested. The 50 and 100 mg/kg/day showed no significant change in fertility rate; therefore, the dose was changed to 150 mg/kg/day. </p></sec><sec><title>Treatment</title><p>This experimental study was carried out between April to June 2012 at the Fertility and Infertility Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran. The Ethical Committee of Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences approved all procedures used in this study. </p><p>In present study, 40 young female albino rats (170- 190 g) were used. Prior to mating, the females were isolated for one month to rule out pre-existing pregnancy. Female rat were mated with males (3:1) in each cage, under controlled environmental conditions with a 12/12 hour light-dark cycle and free access to food. In the next morning, a positive sign of mating was confirmed by sperm-positive vaginal smears and the presence of copulatory plugs (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The day on which a vaginal plug was found was designated as day 0 of gestation. Then, the positive vaginal smear rats were classified into two experimental (groups 1 and 2) and two control groups. Both experimental groups (n=10/each) received the IP injections of caffeine in concentration of 150 mg/kg/day on days 1-5 of pregnancy, and both control groups (n=10/each) received the IP injections of distilled water. In experimental group 1, animals were maintained on normal diet and on day 7 of pregnancy, they were euthanized. </p><p>The number of implantation sites in each uterine horn was determined under a stereomicroscope (Leica, Germany) and compared with the control group. In experiment group 2, animals were maintained pregnant till delivery. After delivery, the number of live births, birth weight and CRL of neonates were investigated. Abnormality of neonates was investigated under a stereomicroscope and compared with the control group. </p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The data were analyzed by independent&#x02013;t test using the SPSS (SPSS Inc., USA) version 15.

caused a significant decrease in implantation
sites and number of live births. These results suggest
that caffeine is likely to cause anti-fertility effect.
The data also showed that caffeine consumption
can decrease the birth weight of neonates that
was not significant compared with the control
group. Several fetuses were observed with a significant
reduction in CRL.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that caffeine affects
adversely human reproduction (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). These effects
could be very serious because most of the human
populations of the world consumed caffeinecontaining
foods (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The findings of caffeine
effects on pregnancy outcomes and fetal development
differ widely; therefore, in the current study,
developmental and reproductive risks of caffeine on
pregnant rats and their offspring were evaluated.</p><p>In a recent study, Dorostghoal et al. (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) showed
a reduction in ovarian weight and primordial follicle
population caused by consumption of high dose
caffeine during pregnancy and lactation, leading
to diminish fertility and reproductive ability in rat.
They stated that these alterations in the ovary were
associated with a significant growth retardation of
the female offspring.</p><p>Savineau and Mironneau (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) showed that absence
of a caffeine-sensitive calcium-release channel
in the sarcoplasmic reticulum prevents spasm
of rat myometrium during pregnancy. Albina et al.
(<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) showed that caffeine administration to pregnant
mice on gestational days 0-18 at doses of
120 mg/kg/day has adverse maternal effects that
are evidenced by a significant reduction in body
weight gain and gravid uterine weight. In consistent
with their results, in the present study, caffeine
decreased the birth weight, but it was not significant
as compared with control group.</p><p>The results of the current work were in agreement
with the results of Gilbert and Pistey (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).
They showed that repeated IP injections of caffeine
(4 to 16 mg/day) to pregnant rats resulted
in significant resorptions and a decrease in the
birth weight of neonates, but developmental malformations
were not observed in neonates. In the
current study, there was no significant difference
regarding abnormality between experimental
group 2 and control group, confirming previous
investigations.</p><p>In the study by Gilbert and Rice (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), showed that
the administration of different concentration of
caffeine to monkeys before, during, and after pregnancy
caused a dose-related increase in stillbirths
and miscarriages as well as a decrease in maternal
weight gain, suggesting that increased serum caffeine
levels, particularly theophylline, may affect
maternal physiology in pregnant monkey.</p><p>Vik et al. (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) found that a high caffeine intake
in the third trimester of pregnancy was associated
with an increased risk of small for gestational age
(SGA) birth among male fetuses, but not in female
fetuses. In current study, several fetuses were observed
with small CRL and low birth weight that
can be mediated by accumulation of caffeine in fetal
tissues that could influence fetal development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>IP injections of caffeine to pregnant rats resulted in a significant decrease in the numbers of implantation sites and live births. The findings showed that administration of caffeine induced anti-implantation activity, but the changes in abnormality and birth weight of the offspring were not significant. </p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was approved and financially supported by the Fertility and Infertility Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences.
