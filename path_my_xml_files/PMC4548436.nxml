The target population were patients who the candidate for hand surgeries. Inclusion criteria were American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade I or II (ASA I = normal healthy patients; ASA II = patients with mild systemic disease), aged 20&#x02013;50 years old scheduled for elective hand and forearm surgery (i.e., tendon carpal tunnel release). Patients with the history of any drug allergy, Reynaud disease, chronic pain syndromes, sickle cell anemia, psychological disorders, diabetes, epilepsy, leukemia, ingestion of any analgesic or sedative medication during 24 h before surgery or pregnant or breastfeeding women, were excluded. In the case of change in the type of surgery or technique of anesthesia and increase of operation time (above 2 h), the patient was excluded from the study.</p><p>The sample size for this study was estimated using the formula of estimating the sample size for comparing means, considering the 95% level of confidence (Z<sub>1-a/2</sub>), 80% power (Z<sub>1-b</sub>), 1.17 (D) for the standard deviation of postoperative pain[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and 0.8 statistically difference between groups; accordingly, the sample size was calculated 35 patients for each group.</p><p>After Ethics Committee approval and improved written consent, 140 patients were allocated in 4 groups of 35 patients by block randomization method.</p><p>Injectable drugs were prepared by an anesthesia assistant who had not any role in the study. Preparing the patients for operation, they were premeditated with 1 mg midazolam administered IV, 30 min before the surgical procedure and were monitored for mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), and heart rate (HR); before beginning the anesthetic block, two IV Canola were inserted, one in dorsal vein of the operative hand and the other in the opposite hand for crystalloid infusion.</p><p>The operated arm was elevated for 2 min then exsanguinated with an esmarch bandage or pneumatic (double tourniquet) and then placed around the upper arm and the proximal Cuff was inflated 250 mmHg (at least 100 mmHg above the systolic blood pressure for all patients); circulatory isolation of the arm was confirmed by Peyton absence of radial pulse, and loss of pulse oximetry tracing in the ipsilateral index finger. IVRA was achieved with 3 mg/kg lidocaine 2% W/V diluted with normal saline to the total volume of 40 mL in the Control Group L-C (<italic>n</italic> = 35), or with 50 &#x003bc;g/kg midazolam plus 3 mg/kg lidocaine 2% W/V diluted with normal saline to a total volume of 40 mL in the midazolam Group L-M<sub>1</sub> (<italic>n</italic> = 35), or with 40 &#x003bc;g/kg midazolam plus 3 mg/kg lidocaine 2% W/V diluted with normal saline to a total volume of 40 mL in the midazolam Group L-M<sub>2</sub> (<italic>n</italic> = 35), or with 30 &#x003bc;g/kg midazolam plus 3 mg/kg lidocaine 2% W/V diluted with normal saline to a total volume of 40 mL in the midazolam Group L-M<sub>3</sub> (<italic>n</italic> = 35). The solutions were prepared by an anesthesiology assistant not involved in any other parts of the study. The solution was injected over 90 s by an anesthesiologist blinded to group assignments.</p><p>The sensory block was evaluated with pinprick testing every 30 s until the start of surgery with a 22 gauge needle in the median, ulnar, and radial nerve innervated areas of the hand and forearm. Motor function has been evaluated by examining the flexion and extension of the patients&#x02019; wrist and fingers, whereas complete motor block recorded when the voluntary movement was impossible. Sensory block onset time was defined as the time elapsed from injection of the drug to loss of pinprick sensation wall nerve distribution and onset of motor block (defined as the time elapsed from injection of the study drug to complex motor block). After completion of sensory and motor block, the distal Cuff was inflated to 250 mmHg and the proximal tourniquet was released. Thereafter, the operation was started.</p><p>MAP, SpO<sub>2</sub>, visual analog scale (VAS) scores (from 0 = no pain, to 10 = the worst pain imaginable), and degree of sedation scale 1&#x02013;5 (1 = complete awake; 2 = awake, but drowsy; 3 = asleep, but responsive to verbal command; 4 = asleep, but responsive to tactile stimulus; 5 = asleep and not responsive to any stimulus) were recorded before and after tourniquet inflation at 1, 5, l0, 15, and 30 min after injection of study drugs and at 1, 5, 10, 15, and 30 min after tourniquet release, and postoperatively at 1, 2, 6, and 12 h.</p><p>Boluses of fentanyl 1 &#x003bc;g/kg were administered intra-operatively for tourniquet pain treatment when VAS was more than 4, and it was repeated 5 min after if pain was not improved; the number of the patients requiring fentanyl was recorded. During surgery, 5 mg IV ephedrine was given for hypotension (systolic blood pressure &#x0003c;90 mmHg or 50 mmHg lower than normal value), 0.5 mg atropine was given for bradycardia defined as HR &#x0003c;50 min, and 4 mg IV ondansetron for nausea and vomiting.</p><p>Arterial SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c;91% was treated with O<sub>2</sub> supplementation via a face mask and all of these complications were also considered with respect to time. No additional sedative drugs were given during the intra-operative period. Postoperatively, when VAS was more than 4, the boluses of pethidine 25 mg/kg were administered, whereas total pethidine consumption was recorded. The time elapsed after tourniquet release to the first patient request for pethidine was also recorded at the end of the operation. Patients were asked to qualify the operative conditions such as tourniquet pain or incisional pain, according to the following numeric scale: Excellent (4), no complaint from pain, good (3), minor complaint with no need for supplement analgesics, moderate (2), complaint that needed a supplemental analgesia and unsuccessful (1).[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The patient was given general anesthesia at the end of the operation.</p><p>The surgeon who was blinded to group assignment was asked to qualify the operation conditions according to the following numeric scale: 0 = unsuccessful, 1 = poor, 2 = acceptable, 3 = good, 4 = excellent.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The tourniquet was not deflated before 30 min and was not inflated more than 90 min. At the end of surgery, the tourniquet deflation was completed by cyclic deflation technique. The tourniquet was deflated 3 times with fixed periods of deflation (10) separated by 1-min periods of reflation. Sensors recovery time was noted (time elapsed after tourniquet deflation up to the recovery of pain in all innervated areas determined by pinprick to test done in 30 s).</p><p>Motor block recovery time was noted (the time elapsed after tourniquet deflation up to movement of fingers) as well as the first analgesic requirement time (the time elapsed after tourniquet release to first patient request of analgesic). Through the study period, the patients were asked about any side effects (tinnitus, skin rash, gastric discomfort, nausea and other side effects) which were recorded if any. All evaluations were performed by an anesthesiology resident blinded to the study group assigned patients who were assessed for 12 h in the postsurgical ward for MAP, HR, SpO<sub>2</sub>, VAS, and sedation. At 1, 6, and 12 h postoperatively, they were questioned for pain, and if VAS score was more than 4, pethidine 25 mg was given. Finally, the collected data entered to computer and analyzed by SPSS version 20 software (Chicago, IL, USA) and the One-way analysis of variance, Chi-square, Fisher exact tests, and Mann&#x02013;Whitney test were used for data analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>All the groups were similar with regard to sex, age, weight, surgical procedure, ASA, duration of tourniquet, and duration of sensory [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].

It is currently believed that together, the nerve endings and trunk are affected;[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] it was possible that the analgesic effect of midazolam added to IVRA was due to its action on binding sites in the periphery.

The above-described mechanisms may possibly explain the efficacy of IV midazolam in relieving Intra- and post-operative pain when added to IVRA. It is possible that IVRA might not be a perfect model to differentiate peripheral versus central mechanisms of analgesia.</p><p>Chang <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] demonstrated that midazolam produces vasodilation by endothelium-dependent and independent mechanisms. Endothelium-dependent vasodilatation produced by midazolam possibly is mediated by own release of NO. Endothelium in dependent vasodilatation appears to be related to inhibition of voltage-gate calcium channels. The beneficial effects of midazolam, which were showed in our study, probably will also depend on vasodilator effect that promotes distribution of lidocaine to nerves. This would explain the rapid onset sensory and motor block. There was no significant difference in side effects among groups. In our study, we have no cased of apnea. Respiratory depression, hypoxia, bradycardia, hypotension, or another side effect after tourniquet would be released till 12 h after surgery. Our study had some limitations. There is no possibility of patients follow-up in 48 h due to discharge in 12 h postoperation.</p><p>In conclusion, this study showed that the addition of 50 &#x003bc;/kg midazolam to lidocaine for IVRA enhanced intra-operative analgesia and improved anesthesia quality; this could be explained by the peripheral effect of midazolam as the tourniquet placement prevents whole-body distribution of midazolam through the blood stream. The occurrence of sedation and enhanced postoperative analgesia after tourniquet deflation in the midazolam groups could be explained by the systemic effect of midazolam in addition to the peripheral analgesic effect.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>AUTHORS&#x02019; CONTRIBUTION</title><p>MRS has planned the study and finalized it; KN, AH, PO, and MRS did the statistical analysis and prepared the first version of the manuscript for publish.
