The Combined Protocol for Acute Malnutrition Study (ComPAS) aims to simplify and unify the treatment of uncomplicated severe and moderate acute malnutrition (SAM and MAM) for children 6&#x02013;59&#x000a0;months into one protocol in order to improve the global coverage, quality, continuity of care and cost-effectiveness of acute malnutrition treatment in resource-constrained settings.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">This study is a multi-site, cluster randomized non-inferiority trial with 12 clusters in Kenya and 12 clusters in South Sudan. Participants are 3600 children aged 6&#x02013;59&#x000a0;months with uncomplicated acute malnutrition. This study will evaluate the impact of a simplified and combined protocol for the treatment of SAM and MAM compared to the standard protocol, which is the national treatment protocol in each country. We will assess recovery rate as a primary outcome and coverage, defaulting, death, length of stay, average weekly weight gain and average weekly mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) gain as secondary outcomes. Recovery rate is defined across both treatment arms as MUAC &#x02265;125&#x000a0;mm and no oedema for two consecutive visits. Per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses will be conducted.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">If the combined protocol is shown to be non-inferior to the standard protocol, updating guidelines to use the combined protocol would eliminate the need for separate products, resources and procedures for MAM treatment. This would likely be more cost-effective, increase availability of services, enable earlier case finding and treatment before deterioration of MAM into SAM, promote better continuity of care and improve community perceptions of the programme.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">ISRCTN, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN30393230">ISRCTN30393230</ext-link>.

Of these, some 35 million have moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) and 17 million have severe acute malnutrition (SAM). The true burden of disease is however likely much higher. This is because most current estimates are based on cross-sectional survey data giving prevalence figures, whereas SAM and MAM, being short-lasting conditions, should ideally be assessed in terms of incidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Malnutrition in all its forms is an underlying cause of 3.1 million (45%) of deaths among children under 5, with wasting alone responsible for 875,000 child deaths per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">Despite the availability of effective, evidence-based treatment programmes, especially for SAM, their public impact is often limited by low coverage of the affected population. According to recent estimates, less than 20% of children with SAM receive the treatment they need [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Figures for MAM programme coverage are unknown&#x02014;but are likely to be lower since it is often perceived to be less of a priority compared to SAM. This is despite wasting, the major manifestation of both SAM and MAM, being on a continuum, with the cut-off between the two defined statistically (based on weight-for-height/length standard deviations from the median) rather than by any distinguishable clinical changes.</p><p id="Par26">In humanitarian settings (as well as many other non-emergency but fragile contexts where malnutrition is common), current international and national recommendations involve treating SAM and MAM in separate programmes, using separate protocols and separate products managed by two large but separate United Nations agencies. SAM is treated with ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) in an outpatient therapeutic programme (OTP), with oversight and technical guidance from the United Nations International Children&#x02019;s Fund (UNICEF). MAM is treated with ready-to-use supplementary food (RUSF) or fortified corn soy blend ++ (CSB++) in a supplementary feeding programme (SFP), with oversight and technical guidance from the World Food Programme (WFP). The shortcomings of this system include the following: (1) it is logistically complicated to implement, requiring the procurement of two different nutritional products and the set-up of two separate programs, in coordination with two separate UN agencies, (2) it is consequently expensive, and (3) it often results in the prioritization of SAM over MAM: many aid agencies and governments offer treatment only of SAM due to the challenges associated with procuring two products and coordinating two programmes. This results in a situation where treatment may not be available to children with MAM until they deteriorate to SAM.</p><p id="Par27">Responding to these current challenges, the Combined Protocol for Acute Malnutrition Study (ComPAS) will assess the effectiveness of a simplified, combined protocol for the treatment of uncomplicated SAM and MAM for children 6&#x02013;59&#x000a0;months. The study aims to improve the quality, coverage, continuity and cost-effectiveness of care (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The combined protocol uses one product (RUTF) for both SAM and MAM, at doses designed to optimize growth and minimize cost at each stage of treatment. Admission and discharge is assessed using only mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) and oedema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].

This study explored the efficacy of an integrated SAM/MAM treatment protocol using one product (RUTF) but at different doses for children &#x0003c;115&#x000a0;mm (175&#x000a0;kcal/kg/day) and 115 to &#x0003c;125&#x000a0;mm (75&#x000a0;kcal/kg/day). Controls followed standard care guidelines: RUTF for SAM and SFP with CSB++ for MAM. Results showed that the integrated programme had a reduced caseload of SAM, due to earlier treatment of children presenting as MAM, with a similar recovery rate (83% vs. 79%) and higher coverage (71% vs. 55%, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0005).

Once their eligibility for treatment is confirmed, they are seen by the ComPAS research officer and clinical officer responsible for their care. First, the research officer will confirm that the present caretaker is a primary guardian for the child. If yes, the research officer describes the aims of the study as detailed in the &#x02018;participant information sheet&#x02019;, ensuring that the caretaker feels comfortable and understands the information. The participant information sheet provides details of the treatments provided in the study. The research officer will ensure the caretaker understands that treatment is available for all malnourished children regardless of whether they choose to participate in the study. Caretakers who agree to participate in the study will indicate their consent by signing a written consent form. If caretakers are not able to read or write, an impartial witness will oversee the consent process and attest to the caretaker&#x02019;s verbal consent. If the caretaker is not a primary guardian or chooses not to participate in the study, their child is enrolled for treatment only, and their information is not collected.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Randomization and blinding</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Sequence generation</title><p id="Par54">Randomization sequence is generated using an online sequence generator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Type</title><p id="Par55">There is stratification by country to ensure equal, 1:1 distribution of control and intervention clinics (clusters) in each country.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Allocation concealment mechanism and implementation</title><p id="Par56">Clinics agree to participate understanding that group allocation is unknown in advance and is allocated randomly. The study statistician applies the random number sequence to a pre-written list of participating clinics, and the study team conveys the resultant allocation to the clinic staff. Individual carers attending clinics for the first time are very unlikely to know in advance whether their local clinic is in the intervention or control arm of the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Blinding</title><p id="Par57">Due to the nature of intervention, this is not a fully blinded study. Front-line clinical and study staff must know whether they are treating children according to intervention or control (standard care) protocols, and the same staff enrol, manage and follow up patients. Staff in the standard protocol clinics were given refreshing trainings to reinforce standard protocol implementation, and staff in the combined protocol clinics were given trainings to roll out the new protocol. Staff in the clinics do not have access to overall treatment outcomes for each clinic or each arm of the trial; they are only aware of individual outcomes for the children they are responsible for treating. Similarly, individual carers cannot be blinded to the intervention being given to their child. Important to note however is that inter-group differences are unlikely to be striking to anyone but expert observers: both study arms use nutrient-dense food pastes, with RUTF and RUSF being peanut-based with similar taste and appearance; children are measured and clinically managed in exactly the same way in both study arms. The principal investigator is blinded to the treatment outcomes, in order to maintain objective trial management and analysis of results.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Treatment</title><p id="Par58">The combined protocol will be compared against the standard protocol (the national protocol in each country). The combined protocol admits all children with a MUAC &#x0003c;125&#x000a0;mm and/or oedema (+/++) and treats them according to a standardized dose of RUTF (children with a MUAC &#x0003c;115&#x000a0;mm or oedema receive 1000&#x000a0;kcal/day of RUTF; children with a MUAC 115 to &#x0003c;125&#x000a0;mm receive 500&#x000a0;kcal/day of RUTF). The combined protocol remains in line with globally accepted practice, with children recovering from SAM receiving enough therapeutic food to cover their total energy needs and children with MAM receiving a supplement to their family diet (most SFP protocols provide approximately 500&#x02013;550&#x000a0;kcal/day of RUSF). The standard protocol includes treatment of SAM in an OTP using RUTF (200&#x000a0;kcal/kg/day) and MAM in a SFP using RUSF (500&#x000a0;kcal/day), as approved by the WHO, UNICEF, WFP and Ministries of Health in each country. The medical components of each protocol are the same, with children in the combined protocol with a MUAC &#x0003c;115&#x000a0;mm and/or oedema receiving the same systematic medications as those in the standard protocol enrolled in the OTP (per national guidelines). Children are managed at level 1 (community) health facilities by nurses or clinical officers for the medical aspects of care and by nutritionists for the nutritional components. If a child requires any additional medical care, they are seen by a nurse or clinical officer in the same facility. The few requiring higher level treatment are referred to the nearest inpatient facility. The qualifications of the staff and level of care are the same across both arms. The combined and standard nutritional treatment protocols are summarized in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.</p><p id="Par59">At each weekly follow-up visit, SAM cases are seen by a clinician (nurse or clinical officer) for the medical review and a nutritionist for the nutritional review. MAM cases differ in that they return for follow-up bi-weekly and receive a medical assessment only if they exhibit signs of illness or non-response to treatment. If a child has developed any medical complications or needs more specialist assessment, they are referred to the nearest inpatient facility (hospital in Nairobi, Kenya; Stabilization Centre in Aweil East, South Sudan). If a child is not gaining weight or mid-upper arm circumference appropriately, the nutritionist will discuss with a clinician based at the health facility, exploring possible underlying medical conditions, as well as counselling the caregiver to address possible contributory factors (e.g. sharing of RUTF/RUSF with other children, household food insecurity, breastfeeding for younger children). This is the same process across both arms.</p><p id="Par60">Children who miss visits are followed up by a community health worker (Kenya) or community volunteer (South Sudan) to encourage caretakers to return. Children who default are followed up by a community health worker to ascertain the child&#x02019;s true status (cured, died or remains malnourished).</p><p id="Par61">Participants will be followed up 4&#x000a0;months post-discharge to assess nutritional status (weight, height, MUAC and oedema), health status (any hospitalizations since discharge and morbidities in the prior 2&#x000a0;weeks), and breastfeeding status.

If the combined protocol is non-inferior to the current protocol, allowing for a 10% non-inferiority margin, then we require 12 clusters in each arm with 100 children in each cluster to demonstrate non-inferiority of the combined protocol, with 80% power at the 5% level of significance. An intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.05 was assumed, a conservative estimate based on the results of a similar cluster randomized study testing an integrated SAM/MAM protocol in Sierra Leone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In order to account for losses to follow-up (estimated as 15%) and cross-overs (estimated as 5% in each arm), 150 children per cluster will be recruited for inclusion in the study. The cluster size calculation is as follows: 100&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;1/(1&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;0.15)&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;(1/(1&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;0.05&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;0.05)<sup>2</sup>)&#x02009;=&#x02009;146.

If the results show that the combined protocol has non-inferior recovery rates compared to the standard protocol, this study will contribute to the evidence that current CMAM protocols can be simplified and that treatment of SAM and MAM can be combined (one product, one protocol and one anthropometric criterion for admission and discharge).
