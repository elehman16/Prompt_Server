Both anesthetic regimens studied are administered on a daily basis to patients undergoing carotid surgery in our hospital.

This protocol was approved by our Research Ethics Board and patients were enrolled after their informed consent was obtained.</p><p>A preliminary study estimated at 60% the number of operated patients presenting a decrease below 55% of SrcO2 during carotid clamping under conventional general anesthesia. In order to observe a decrease of two third in the number of patients developing a decrease below 55%, with risks alfa = 5% and beta = 10%, 68 patients had to be included in the study.</p><p>All patients were anesthetized by the same anesthetist (GG). Seventy-four consecutive patients scheduled for surgery of carotid stenosis were included. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension, and/or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and/or hypoxemia at rest, were excluded.</p><p>Treatments taken chronically by the patients, were continued or not, according to the latest French guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]: continuation of cardiovascular treatments except angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor andor angiotensin II receptor antagonist (AIIR1A) which were discontinued 48 hours before surgery, continuation of antidiabetic agents except metformin. Treatment by clopidogrel was stopped 8 days before surgery and replaced by aspirin if necessary and except for specific indication. For all patients, monitoring included an invasive measure of blood pressure, monitoring of pulsed pressure index (VPP&#x000ae;, Philips Medical Systems, Eindhoven, The Netherlands), bispectral analysis of the EEG (BIS Aspect&#x000ae;, Covidien, Elancourt, France) and SrcO2 (NIRS&#x000ae;, Covidien, Elancourt, France). BIS sensor was positioned on the opposite side of the operated carotid, and NIRS sensor was positioned on operated carotid side.</p><p>All patients initially received propofol (Schnider model) and remifentanil (Minto model) via a target controlled infusion (TCI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>] (Primea&#x000ae;, Fresenius-Vial, Brezins, France) and cisatracurium. Ventilation parameters included a positive end-expiratory pressure (Peep) at 5 mmHg and a FIO2 at 35% with a closed circuit. Patients were then divided into 2 groups according to the drug administered for the maintenance of anesthesia:</p><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>in Control group, anesthesia was maintained with TCI propofol and remifentanil;</p></list-item><list-item><p>in Xenon group, anesthesia was maintained with xenon (target inspired concentration of 60%) and TCI remifentanil.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Propofol was discontinued when inspired concentration of xenon reached 40%.

Four patients presented a neurological transient stroke (contra lateral hemi paresis), all regressive within one hour (3 in the Xenon group, 1 in the Control group). One patient in the Control group presented a worsening of a previous cognitive disorder (Table 5). As shown in the Table 6, no correlation seems to exist between these neurological abnormalities and the symptomatic characteristics of the operated lesion, the use of a shunt, and SrcO2. No patient developed significant postoperative cardiovascular andor hemorrhagic complications, and/or required a reoperation. All the patients were discharged free of neurologic abnormalities from the vascular unit.</p><fig id="F006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 6</label><caption><p>Clinical characteristics of patients with postoperative transient ischemic attack (N=4) or other postoperative neurologic abnormalities (N=4).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="hsrp-05-110-g006"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s8"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The main result of the study is that xenon anesthesia is associated to a smaller decrease in SrcO2 during carotid clamping and that a decrease below 55% was less frequently observed in the Xenon group. These results add to the experimental literature showing a cerebral protective effect of xenon anesthesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>].</p><p>Patients in the Xenon group had more hemodynamic stability. After induction of general anesthesia, the usual hypotension is related to the well described vasodilator effect of the conventional agents such as propofol. In patients undergoing vascular surgery, the hypotension is exacerbated by chronic hypertension and use of chronic antihypertensive treatments. This hypotension is readily managed by volume expansion and administration of vasoactive agents. Xenon use was associated with higher systolic and mean blood pressures after carotid declamping and at the end of surgery (<italic>Table 2</italic>). Even if the hypertension is partially artificial and partially related to the administration of vasoactive agents, it is necessary to remember that this increase is quasi-constant, appears in the first 2 or 3 minutes following carotid cross-clamping, and is due to a baroreceptor reflex stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17"> 17</xref>]. With xenon, the pressure profile is quite different, with a later and more important rise of blood pressure, requiring in some patients an increase of remifentanil concentration, or administration of nicardipine. This hypertension with xenon was previously described as frequent, and its mechanism needs to be clarified. A sympathetic activation cannot be a definitive explanation because a bradycardia (50 to 60 b/min) was always associated to the operation. Xenon- induced hypertension may confound the clinician&#x02019;s understanding of the depth of anesthesia and therefore some sort of cerebral function monitoring indicative of the depth of anesthesia should be employed. Another hemodynamic observation was a stable bradycardia observed even in patients not treated with a b-blocking agent. This phenomenon cannot be related to the increase in remifentanil concentrations as it appeared previously. It does not receive a definitive physiopathological explanation at the moment. An activation of the parasympathic system could be hypothesized.</p><p>We did not consider as an objective of this study the incidence of postoperative neurological events because they are rare (near 1%) in patients scheduled for carotid surgery. Moreover, mortality and morbidity are both extremely low within all skilled teams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R06">6</xref>], and, so far, no agent or technique of anesthesia has demonstrated its superiority in decreasing them.</p><p>Although cerebral neurological accidents occurring during carotid surgery are largely related to thromboembolisms (atheromatous, clot or gaseous) which arise before the clamping or after the removal of an arterial clamp, a postoperative stroke can also arise in a situation of poor cerebral perfusion during clamping, more frequently observed in case of occlusion of the contra lateral carotid, or of discontinuity of the circle of Willis. The main measurement of this study was the variation of SrcO2, a non-invasive but relevant parameter of the cerebral perfusion. Cerebral perfusion monitoring has been shown of interest under general anesthesia during endarterectomy. Amongst all the monitoring systems available, most of them used for several years, none is perfect. They all present limits that could be logistic or concerning their reliability. Transcranial Doppler is unfeasible for anatomical reasons in up to 20% of the patients, EEG and monitoring of the somaesthetic potential can have a poor sensitivity andor a poor specificity, while they are perturbed by agents of anesthesia, measurement of stump pressure is poorly sensitive in indicating the need of a shunt, while furthermore, it is only a punctual measure during a test of clamping, influenced by numerous factors such as arterial pressure, PaCO2 and agents of anesthesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Measurement of SrcO2 in regard of the frontal cortex is one of elements that can allow and indirect evaluation of the quality of the cerebral perfusion. It is a technique which is neither invasive, nor observer dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R08">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19"> 19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. This parameter is in fact a mixture of SaO2, SvO2 and tissue saturation in O2. The measure is moderately polluted by an extra cranial signal. All elements which contribute to modify one of its constituents can explain a decrease of SrcO2. Several studies concerning the monitoring of SrcO2 in carotid surgery, in particular those of Murkin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R07">7</xref>], reported a good correlation between the modifications of SrcO2 during the clamping and the modifications of the other techniques of monitoring such as the transcranial Doppler. For Murkin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R07">7</xref>], a decline of more than 12% of SrcO2 or an absolute value lower than 55%, would be predictive of a cerebral ischemia (detected by EEG or somaesthetic evoked potentials) or of modifications of the transcranial Doppler or the stump pressure which can incite the use of a shunt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R08">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R09"> 9</xref>]. Several criticisms can be made concerning these studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] since a high incidence of neurological complications was recorded and no study focused on patient operated under general anesthesia. Nevertheless, monitoring of SrcO2, can allow improvement of hemodynamic status in patients with high cerebral risk. Under xenon, we noted that, compared with a conventional general anesthesia, decline of SrcO2 at clamping is less important and is observed in fewer patients. This result is in agreement with the hypothesis of a neuroprotection conferred by this molecule. The neuroprotection may be related in part to a better respect of cerebral perfusion andor its regulation. Xenon&#x02019;s effects on cerebral perfusion and metabolism are quite complex. Its neuroprotective effect is caused by enhanced ischemic tolerance. Moreover, the connection between neuroprotection and increased perfusion is quite hypothetical. The neuroprotective effects of xenon have been demonstrated in several experimental studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R03">3</xref>]. These neuroprotective properties imply complex mechanisms involving: inhibition on the N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors, decrease of the glutamate, opening of potassium channels (TREK), comparable to a preconditioning against the ischemic effects. Many cell targets are evoked, at the origin of this preconditioning: mitochondrial, K-ATP canals, PI3-AKt kinases, serine threonine and tyrosine kinases, NO-synthetase, inhibition of free radical scavengers.</p><p>The second advantage theoretically brought by xenon is cardioprotection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. A modification of the activity of the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 could be involved in this cardioprotective effect. Clinical study has shown a better left ventricular function with xenon compared with propofol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>].</p><p>The limits of this study are mostly methodological since this study was not randomized and the patients were included in one or the other group depending on which operative room had been scheduled. Furthermore the use of xenon can have several limits such as the necessity of specific equipment, a phase of learning for its manipulation, an important cost, and the existence of contraindications. A strength of the study was that the cerebral oxymetry was continuously recorded, and was not taken into account in a decision-making algorithm.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s9"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In this pilot, non-randomized study xenon was associated with higher cerebral oxygen saturation values when compared to propofol anesthesia during cross-clamping for carotid endarterectomy.
