When muscle mass changes, the quality and quantity of the extracellular matrix protein, particularly the collagens, change with it. In this study, we investigated the temporal profile of three peptide biomarkers derived from turnover of collagen type III and type VI in a long-term immobilization and remobilization study.

It is reported that elderly men lose 1% leg lean mass per year [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], that 2&#x02013;3% of muscle mass is lost per week during immobilization [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and sometimes even quicker with cachexia [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Impaired muscle mass and function in elderly or hospitalized individuals has been shown to be associated with (co)morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. With the population age increasing in the industrialized world, maintaining functional independence shows increasing importance. Nowadays, the diagnosis and monitoring of muscle loss rely on the imaging examination, e.g. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, such examinations are not in widespread clinical use, probably owing to its expensive cost and inconvenience to be used in routine clinical care. Urinary and serological biomarkers such as creatinine and 3-methyl histidine have also been shown to be able to assess muscle mass and could thus assist the management of muscle loss. However, high variation and poor validity of these assays limit their use [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In summary, there is an urgent need for biomarkers which can be used in the diagnosing and predicting muscle function as well as monitoring anticatabolic and anabolic treatment outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Loss of muscle mass is driven by unbalanced turnover of muscle extracellular proteins [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144525.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As protein turnover, particularly of extracellular proteins, can allow proteolytic fragments to escape into the circulation, quantitative or qualitative changes in protein metabolism can give rise to biomarker profiles that can be of use in monitoring muscle mass or function [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Collagens are important extracellular proteins of skeletal muscle, which could contribute to the passive tension of muscle [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Collagen type III is expressed in most of the collagen type I containing tissues except for bone, and is an important component of connective tissues, muscle tissues and skin [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. PIIINP is the N-terminal propeptide of collagen type III, which is removed during mature collagen type III synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It has been reported to be related to the anabolic response of hormone treatment [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144525.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Recently, a new ELISA kit was developed by applying monoclonal antibody targeting the N-protease cleavage site of collagen type III propeptide, which could assess the true synthesis of collagen type III [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Collagen type VI is a unique extracellular collagen, which can form an independent microfibrillar network in the basement membrane of cells. It can interact with other matrix proteins including collagens, biglycan, proteoglycans, <italic>etc</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In muscle, collagen type VI is part of the sarcolemma and involved in anchoring the muscle fiber into the intramuscular extracellular matrix, thus involved in force transmission [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144525.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Moreover, mutations in collagen type VI can cause Bethlem myopathy and Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It has been reported that the C-terminus of collagen type VI &#x003b1;3 chain is cleaved off from the mature type VI microfibril after secretion [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144525.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore, the level of C-terminus of &#x003b1;3 chain could reflect the level of newly formed mature collagen type VI. In order to investigate the synthesis of collagen type VI, we developed a Pro-C6 ELISA kit targeting the C-terminus of &#x003b1;3 chain. In addition, collagen type VI is also a substrate of MMPs [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Previous studies showed that both MMP-2 and MMP-9 are relevant to muscle atrophy [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144525.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Therefore, collagen type VI degradation fragment by MMP-2 and MMP-9 could be interesting in relation to immobilization induced muscle atrophy.</p><p>In this study, we measured three neo-epitope biomarkers Pro-C6 (measuring the C-terminus &#x003b1;3(VI) chain) and C6M (measuring collagen type VI fragment degraded by MMP-2 and MMP-9) [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and Pro-C3 (measuring the synthesis of collagen type III) [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which directly measure the turnover of collagen type III and VI in the Berlin bed rest study&#x02013;using bed rest immobilization and remobilization as a human model of muscle atrophy and hypertrophy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Bed rest study</title><p>The Berlin bed rest study (BBR) has been described elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144525.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Briefly, 20 healthy young men were recruited and underwent a strict 8-week bed rest study. The 20 young men were then randomly divided into two groups. The resistive vibration exercise group (RVE) group was assigned to resistive vibration exercise 11 times per week. The resistive vibration exercises were performed with a vibration exercise apparatus at the end of the beds, and with the subject pulling themselves towards the vibration plate through waist and shoulder straps and handles. The control group (CTRL) was not allowed to perform any exercise during the 8-week bed rest. The serum samples were obtained 2 days before the study (baseline), in the bed rest period (BR) and in the following recovery period (R). The serum samples were stored at -80&#x000b0;C until further measurement. The muscle mass of both groups were assessed by MRI and DXA during the three periods. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Charit&#x000e9; Universit&#x000e4;tsmedizin Berlin. Subjects gave their written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Antibody development for Pro-C6</title><p>We used the last 10 amino acids of the collagen type VI &#x003b1;3 chain (<sup>3168&#x02019;</sup>KPGVISVMGT<sup>&#x02019;3177</sup>, Chinese Peptide Company, China) as the immunogenic peptide to generate specific monoclonal antibodies. All the work on mice was approved by Beijing laboratory animal administration office and animal ethics committee of Nordic Bioscience (Beijing). The methods used for monoclonal antibody development were as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Briefly, 4-6-week-old Balb/C mice were immunized subcutaneously with 200&#x003bc;l emulsified antigen with 60&#x003bc;g of the immunogenic peptide. Consecutive immunizations were performed at 2-week intervals in Freund's incomplete adjuvant, until stable sera titer levels were reached, and the mice were bled from the 2nd immunization on. At each bleeding, the serum titer was detected and the mouse with highest antiserum titer and the best native reactivity was selected for fusion. The selected mouse was rested for 1 month followed by intraperitoneal boosting with 50&#x003bc;g of immunogenic peptide in 100&#x003bc;l 0.9% sodium chloride solution 3 days before isolation of the spleen for cell fusion.</p><p>The fusion procedure has been described elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Briefly, mouse spleen cells were fused with SP2/0 myeloma fusion partner cells. The fusion cells were raised in 96-well plates and incubated in the CO2-incubator. Here standard limited dilution was used to promote monoclonal growth. Cell lines specific to the selection peptide and without cross-reactivity to neither elongated peptide (KPGVISVMGTA, Chinese Peptide Company, China) nor truncated peptide (KPGVISVMG, American Peptide Company, USA) were selected and sub-cloned. At last the antibodies were purified using an IgG column.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Pro-C6 assay protocol</title><p>ELISA-plates used for the assay development were Streptavidin-coated from Roche (cat.: 11940279). All ELISA plates were analyzed with the ELISA reader from Molecular Devices, SpectraMax M, (CA, USA). We labeled the selected monoclonal antibody with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) using the Lightning link HRP labeling kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Innovabioscience, Babraham, Cambridge, UK).

Stable isotope studies have shown that atrophy in most tissues and muscle in particular is driven by global decreases of synthesis to a larger extent than increases in degradation [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144525.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>There is little research on the effect of immobilization on muscle ECM turnover on proteome scale as well as for individual proteins. Naturally, turnover of individual proteins can be regulated in a different manner. Looking at rodent studies, the total muscular collagen was increased during immobilization [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Of particular interest, in the Miller study, immobilization resulted in increases in collagen III protein [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], which occurs in despite of down-regulated collagen III mRNA reported elsewhere in rat muscle unloading in a similar model [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>In this paper, we report the modulation of serological collagen peptide biomarkers in response to long-term unloading in the form of bed rest and subsequent reloading in the Berlin Bed Rest study. In this study, the subjects were immobilized through bed rest with or without a vibration device countermeasure for 8 weeks followed by remobilization through habitual physical activity. Both groups lost muscle mass and strength during the immobilization, with slightly more lost in the CTRL group than in the RVE group. Both group regained muscle mass and strength during remobilization.</p><p>During immobilization, the biomarkers Pro-C3 and Pro-C6 display somewhat similar temporal patterns. While Pro-C3 initially drops slightly following the onset of immobilization, both Pro-C3 and Pro-C6 eventually increase with immobilization over time, 20% and 40% respectively. At the onset of remobilization, a slight initial drop can again be observed followed by an increase that on the part of Pro-C6 was bigger in the CTRL than in the RVE group, followed by a return to baseline in both biomarkers. The C6M biomarker is essentially unresponsive to bed rest unloading, but spikes briefly in response to reloading, with no significant difference between groups.</p><p>Collagen type III is expressed ubiquitously in tensile stress bearing tissues, including, but not restricted to, tendon, muscle, vasculature and skin. This essentially restricts expression to Lean Body Mass. We have in two previous studies shown that baseline levels of the Pro-C3 biomarker correlate with LBM in healthy adults [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144525.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We believe that the measured levels of the biomarker reflect the total level of collagen III steady-state synthesis and thus, by extension, the amount of LBM.</p><p>The finding from the Miller study fits well with the temporal Pro-C3 pattern we observed, as the Pro-C3 is a biomarker of collagen III synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The further increase in Pro-C3 we observed during remobilization, also matches well with findings from both animal and human studies. These have shown increases in collagen protein synthesis and content [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144525.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>While it can appear counterintuitive that counter-directional stimuli produce the same biomarker response, we can only speculate that both the detrained and more trained phenotypes are associated with specific ECM mechanical and compositional profiles that each requires specific remodeling, thus explaining the changes observed.</p><p>Collagen VI is ubiquitously expressed basement membrane protein expressed as heterotrimers of alpha1, alpha2 and either alpha3, alpha5 or alpha6 chains (the alpha4 is absent in humans). However, it appears to be particularly important or at least partially indispensable in skeletal muscle as genetic defects in &#x003b1;1(VI), &#x003b1;2(VI) or &#x003b1;3(VI) chains result in dystrophic phenotypes. In these dystrophic phenotypes creatine kinase is chronically elevated, indicating loss of sarcolemma integrity [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This matches well with the supposed function in which Collagen VI surrounding cells, help anchor them into the surrounding extra-cellular matrix.</p><p>When it comes to discussing the changes in Collagen type VI biomarkers it becomes more difficult as these are very poorly described in relation to changes in physical activity. There is essentially no information about collagen type VI expression at mRNA or protein levels in homogenates or histochemistry in healthy human muscle. Our interest in peptides derived from Collagen type VI were derived from previous studies, where we found that a biomarker derived from the &#x003b1;1(VI) chain correlated well with LBM in healthy adults [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and the fact that Collagen type VI appears indispensable in skeletal muscle, as mutations in these chains cause Ullrich and Bethlem Myopathies. The temporal pattern of Pro-C6 during the course of immobilization and subsequent remobilization is similar to Pro-C3.</p><p>In muscle it has been shown that the abundance of Collagen type III relative to total collagen is higher in endomysium, the connective tissue sheath surrounding individual muscle fibers. Considering that Collagen type VI is a basement membrane protein, their shared pattern could indicate that protein turnover of the proteins making up the muscle fiber niche are regulated in a parallel manner.</p><p>The correlation analysis revealed that higher levels of Pro-C6 were associated with smaller loss of muscle during immobilization and higher levels were also associated with a smaller degree of muscle (re)gain during remobilization. While it may appear counterintuitive, this may be confounded by the ones that lost the most LBM also regained the most. Collagen type VI is involved in proper satellite cell function [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and autophagic function [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], so while there is plenty of possibly causal and/or mechanistic relationships explaining the temporal pattern we see, at the present there is inadequate knowledge available for us to suggest which ones might be at play.</p><p>Collagen type III and type VI have different structure and functions in muscle. Collagen type III is a fibrillar collagen, usually co-distributes with collagen type I. While Collagen type VI forms a unique microfibrillar network and acts as a linker between the cell skeleton and ECM. Therefore, their remodeling rate in immobilization and remobilization could be different, which could be observed in the specific biomarker responses. C6M is unchanged during muscle atrophy, and only spikes in the early phase of remobilization, shows some similarity of creatine kinase [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. While Pro-C3 shows an initial drop in the early phase of immobilization, then Pro-C3 and Pro-C6 increase during the atrophy and spike in remobilization.</p><p>It is worth noting that none of the biomarkers display significantly different patterns between the two treatments in the study. This can most likely be attributed to the fact that the changes in lean mass with the study were not as large as those reported for total immobilization, e.g. from casting. There are significant differences of muscle volume change in some lower limb (from MRI) between two groups [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We can also observe a loss of 8% LBM (from DXA) in the lower body in the CTRL group and 4% in the RVE group, however, there is no change or even a small increase in upper body LBM [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. As these biomarkers are presumably produced during connective tissue turnover and released to the circulation, this differential muscle response translates into a mixed signal in serum, thereby explaining a limited sensitivity to the different interventions.</p><p>Although there is no significant difference between two treatments, Pro-C3, Pro-C6 and C6M appear to have greater increase in control group, and Pro-C3 and C6M last longer to return to baseline. This finding might reflect greater muscle loss in control group compared with RVE group in some of the major postural muscles [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and potentially more muscle damage [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], which leads to the needs for more muscle re-building.</p><p>With increased age or systemic pathologies, fibrogenicity in all tissues increases and eventually some degree of fibrosis also manifests in muscle. The increase in propeptide biomarkers observed here, could be understood in that context, i.e. that muscle fibrosis in the elderly or the seriously ill, is not driven by age or pathology <italic>per se</italic>, but by repeated cycles of immobilization. This would parallel the proposed mechanism for age-related muscle loss, which has also been suggested to be driven by discrete catabolic events, rather than a sustained catabolic or anti-anabolic drive [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>While this is obviously hypothetical, immobilization in animal models have also been shown to lead to intramuscular fibrosis [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144525.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>As these peptide biomarkers are released to the circulation and expressed in many different tissues it is difficult to prove the exact origin of them. In this paper we are in part just reporting the temporal patterns and in part comparing them with changes in LBM, in the context of a bed rest immobilization and remobilization study.</p><p>We cannot exclude the possibility that the biomarkers correlations we report are driven by other effects, e.g. changes in hepatic circulating peptide clearance. Also, we must appreciate the fact that several processes can contribute to production of biomarker peptides. For example, even though we report here (and have done so before) that in healthy adults, Pro-C3 correlates with LBM [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144525.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], it has also been shown that other processes increases the amount of collagen III propeptide in the circulation, like liver fibrosis or anabolic drug administration [<xref rid="pone.0144525.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144525.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144525.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Therefore the inferences made about the biomarkers should only be generalized to other populations with consideration of this.</p><p>There is very little scientific literature about the changes in collagen expression and metabolism with unloading and reloading and most of the literature that does exist focuses on collagens I and III using histochemistry, mRNA expression or analysis of hydroxyproline content. While these findings may help interpreting our collagen III results, there is practically no scientific literature about collagen type VI and collagen type VI peptides, making contextualizing our findings there very limited.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec019"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Immobilization is associated with pronounced modulation of Pro-C3 and Pro-C6, but not C6M. The upregulation of both Pro-C3 and&#x02013;C6 likely reflects remodeling of the extracellular matrix in muscle in response to unloading and reloading. Pro-C6 was related to the anabolic and catabolic responses to unloading and reloading. Furthermore, we can report that Pro-C3 is correlated with LBM in young healthy adults, extending previous findings from our group.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Pingping Chen and Qinlong Zheng for assisting antibody development.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0144525.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
