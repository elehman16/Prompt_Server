Multiple factors have increased the need for ToC between healthcare providers, including a restriction of duty hours for residents, transfer of patients between hospitals for specialist care, and the transfer of patients among specialized teams within a hospital (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The Joint Commission has identified communication failures during this handover process as a major contributor to medical errors (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Moreover, communication failures occur more frequently when ToC occurs during times of patient crisis (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). A recent study assessed the quality of the ToC process by anesthesiology residents in a crisis situation and found that there was a significant loss of information during the ToC process (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>The ToC process is a critical component of safe patient care (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). However, the medical school curriculum may not provide structured training and documentation of competency in the ToC process. Informal and observational training of handoffs during clinical training may be the only way ToC skills are learned. It is unclear if this clinical experience and training are sufficient to prepare graduating medical students adequately for ToC during clinical rotations where it is more focused on census based handoff during shift change and more specifically, ToC in crisis situations.</p><p>We hypothesized that the ToC training that medical students receive during medical school is not sufficient for adequate ToC during crisis situations, resulting in the potential for significant information loss during the process. The use of a cognitive aid may improve the completeness of information transfer during the ToC process by providing structure and organization.</p><p>The aim of this project was to assess: 1) graduating fourth-year medical students&#x02019; ability to perform a ToC process in a crisis situation, and 2) whether the use of a cognitive aid improves the quality of the ToC process of these graduating medical students in crisis situations in order to prepare them for this skill entering residency.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S0002"><title>Methods</title><p>Following institutional review board approval and informed student consent, graduating fourth-year medical students from the University of Kentucky (UK) (<italic>n</italic>=112) agreed to participate in this project. The simulation scenario was conducted 2 weeks prior to graduation as a part of a weeklong &#x02018;intern preparation&#x02019; course designed to prepare the graduates for the upcoming challenges of their intern year (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><sec id="S0002-S20001"><title>Simulation scenario</title><p>The authors developed, by consensus, two different simulation scenarios. The scenarios, similar in complexity but not identical, were assigned randomly between the two groups of students (using a cognitive aid [CA] and without cognitive aid [nCA]). The medical students were randomly divided into teams of three, thus forming a rapid response team (RRT) with self-assigned roles (team leader, respiratory therapist, and ICU nurse). Before the scenario, all medical students received formal instruction in ToC by watching a 15 min instructional video produced by the authors, containing a brief review of the ToC process. The video, a &#x02018;just-in-time&#x02019; teaching method (instruction immediately prior to application) (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), covered knowledge components about the ToC process and also explained the different components of the handoff, including structured methods for obtaining and relaying patient information. The training video included a demonstration of a correctly performed patient care handoff. After watching the video, the students entered the simulation room. The patient simulation used a computer-controlled mannequin (Laerdal Sim Man 3G&#x02122;). The scenario began with the RRT arriving at the bedside of a deteriorating patient. The bedside nurse (confederate 1) was present and provided baseline patient information. The student team leader initiated communication with the bedside nurse, obtained the necessary information, and delegated tasks to be performed by the other team members. When the team was satisfied with the amount of information received, the retrieving information portion was concluded and a read back from the confederate was performed. The read back repeated all the pertinent information about the patient and situation in a structured format to the RRT, therefore ensuring that all student teams received complete and identical information.</p><p>In the second stage of the scenario, the patient deteriorated into cardiac arrest, and the RRT was required to perform Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS). Following CPR, patient intubation, and intravenous epinephrine, the patient's medical condition stabilized. Confederate 2 (&#x02018;ICU fellow&#x02019;) then entered the scenarioand received report from the medical student team. The scenario outline is described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>. Directly after conclusion of the scenario, all participants received feedback and a debriefing session by the confederates and the simulation instructor. The complete scenario was videotaped with voice recording for data analysis.</p><fig id="F0001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Scenario outline.

The medical students are split into teams of three to form a rapid response team (RRT) prior to entering the scenario.

However, it becomes a daily requirement in almost all specialties in graduate medical education and has gained attention with the limitations on duty hours (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and the possibility of increased loss of information with more frequent ToC. It seems imperative to introduce the concept to medical students during their medical school curriculum and allow them to begin practicing ToC prior to graduation. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education has even emphasized the need to provide more structural ToC training during residency, and ToC is one of the six focus area of the ACGME CLER program (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Medical students close to graduation should be prepared to take on junior resident responsibilities and should be competent to perform ToC in all clinical situations (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>Efficient and complete ToC becomes essential during critical events necessitating an escalation of care (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Proficiency in ToC is critical at the beginning of residency training (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Therefore, we chose to assess ToC ability in all graduating medical students and to explore possible improvement opportunities for education in this skill including the use of a cognitive aid to improve ToC completeness (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>The main findings of our study are as follows: 1) graduating medical students with previous informal clinical training and video-based training performed the ToC process with a significant loss of information, 2) simulation-based ToC experience increased the subjective knowledge and comfort level of graduating medical students with the ToC process in crisis situations, and 3) the use of a cognitive aid improves the ToC completeness.</p><p>The current training medical students receive in medical school for ToC may not be sufficient. In our pre-scenario survey, approximately one-half of the participants indicated they did not receive prior ToC teaching. ToC instruction may be more commonly focused on &#x02018;census based handoff&#x02019; at shift transition, but not addressing the needs if information transfer must be prioritized due to time constraints (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). At our institution, the medical school curriculum provides formal ToC training using web-based podcasts in addition to the informal handoff training during their clinical clerkships. Due to integration of the majority of ToC training into their clinical work and the small amount of structured ToC training, the medical students may actually perceive that they have not received any training in patient care handoff at all. It explains the perceived lack of knowledge and confidence found during the pre-scenario survey. Other medical colleges have ToC training during a specific clerkship or during the third year (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Rarely, simulation-based training is offered to teach and assess ToC competency. However, simulation provides an optimal learning environment for instruction and evaluation of the ToC process (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). As a response to our project and to the obvious need to prepare our medical students for clinical practice, our medical school curriculum has been reorganized to emphasize structured ToC training using simulation and standardized patients.</p><p>Our study suggests the feasibility of providing a safe learning environment for ToC in crisis situations by using the simulation scenario. To improve the quality of the process, we constructed a specific cognitive aid to assist in ToC during time-sensitive situations. Our project was able to confirm the positive impact of a cognitive aid on the ToC process. Other studies have supported the value of a cognitive aid for transfer of important information (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>A delayed assessment (video review) for completeness and information organization indicated a statistically significant difference when a cognitive aid is utilized in the ToC presentation.</p><p>The use of a cognitive aid to help with the ToC process is useful and could be introduced during medical school. With multiple studies from healthcare and aviation industry supporting use of a cognitive aid, it seems plausible that one could choose most any of the formats and achieve an improvement in organization and completeness of handover (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). A recent review of healthcare handoff practices showed that the majority of published evaluation studies used departmental and specialty specific handoff tools (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Further development of the cognitive aid format for the ToC process is needed, and further multi-institutional research is planned in this direction. The trend in handoff-related publications indicates a preference for electronic handoff tools with possible electronic medical record (EMR)-integrated information population (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). However, we are not aware of any study showing superiority of one format over another. Currently, the reasons for choosing one format over another should be based on equipment availability, system-based practice, and provider preferences (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p><p>There are several limitations to our project. In addition to the single-center design and limited sample size, the format of the cognitive aid limits our conclusions. Although a separate study was conducted to determine the most beneficial cognitive aid design, that study may also present limitations due to bias (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). It is possible that the developers of the aid were more comfortable with a paper/hand-written aid, while the graduating medical school population may obtain more benefit from an electronic form of the document (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Non-familiarity of the cognitive aid by the medical students could also be a limitation to our study since the cognitive aid is not a routine tool used in standard clinical practice at our hospital.</p><p>In conclusion, our single-center simulation-based study indicated that the use of a cognitive aid during a high-acuity patient handover situation is beneficial in relaying correct, complete, and concise information to the next patient care provider. Further studies are needed to determine the best method(s) of preparing medical students to perform skilled ToC during graduate medical education. When a patient is transferred between levels of care, the use of a cognitive aid should become standard practice.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="S0005"><title>Conflict of interest and funding</title><p>The authors declare they have no conflicts of interest or competing interests.
