The prevalence of cataract in people over 40 years in the United States, 20.5 million individuals, 23.3% of individuals over 50 years in China and 32%, 96.9% and 100% of individuals over 40, 70 and 80 years old, respectively, in Japan have been reported.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] According to the WHO, the cataract has caused the 27 to 45 million of blindness in the world.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>The cataract surgery is the most common eye surgery in the world and in 98% of this surgery, the intraocular lens (IOL) has been used. Between all aphakia methods, the IOLs are easier and have better performance in terms of eyesight. In the last decade, there were significant improvements in the accuracy with which the surgeon able to correct refractive errors by surgery and to achieve emmetropia.</p><p>The development of advanced instruments for measuring the axial length (AL) and using the precise mathematical formulas to calculate the IOLs power have helped to these improvements.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Precise biometry, phacoemulsification surgery and formulas for determining the IOLs power lead to reduction of refractive errors after the cataract surgery. The most important step for an accurate calculation of the IOL power is the preoperative measurement of the ocular axial length.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Accurate measurement of the eye axial length is performed with ultrasound development in the optical biometry, and third-generation new formulas (SRK/T formula, Holladay I formula and Hoffer Q formula) are based on measurement of corneal power and the axial length.</p><p>The post-operative lens position determination mechanism has a certain formula and is based on the axial length and the keratometry. The formulas for measurement of the IOLs power are classified into four generations. The first generation of formulas is theoretical and based on the same fundamental constant and regardless of anterior chamber depth. The second generation was designed by combining linear regression analysis and stepwise adjustment for long and short eyes according to anterior chamber depth. The third- and fourth-generation formulas, all aimed at better calculation of the IOL power in eyes with extreme axial length. The accuracy of third- and fourth-generation formulas had not been fully evaluated in patients with high axial myopia, in which the need for more studies conducted in this field is crucial.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>New formulas, Holladay II formula and Haigis formula, have some other variables for calculating the IOL power such as: The anterior chamber depth, the lens thickness, the pre-operative refraction errors and the effective IOLs position. These improvements are used for the selection of the fittest IOL power.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The Holladay II formula uses the theoretical vergence formula to calculate the IOL power. This formula uses seven variables including keratometry, ocular axial length, horizontal corneal diameter or horizontal WTW (horizontal white to white), anterior chamber depth, lens thickness, age and refraction.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] According to different studies with different results, lack of similar studies in Iran, and in accordance to determine the appropriate formula is an important factor for obtaining the best result in the cataract surgery, especially in individuals with high axial length; this study was done to compare the refractive index variation between Hoffer-Q formula, Haigis formula and SRK/T formula used for preoperative biometry calculation in patients with the axial length higher than 25 mm undergoing the cataract surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This is a randomized clinical trial study that was performed in eye clinic of the Feiz hospital affiliated to Isfahan University of Medical Sciences during years 2012&#x02013;2013. The statistical population of this study includes patients who had cataract surgery in the mentioned clinic.</p><p>The inclusion criteria of this study were including: The ages of 40&#x02013;70 years old, the axial length &#x0003e;25mm that was measured with a IOL MASTER 500 ZEISS Biometer, the preoperative corneal cylinder value between 0 and &#x02013;1.5 diopter, the existence of age-related cataract confirmed by ophthalmologist, no previous surgery of anterior or posterior segment in the same eye and finally, patient's consent for study. The exclusion criteria included non-correctable retinal and corneal problems affecting vision, other eye pathologies except cataract, surgical-related complication during surgery and post-operation and inaccessibility to patients after operation due to lack of comeback to clinic for re-visiting after surgery.</p><p>The sample size required for the study was estimated by the use of the &#x0201c;sample size estimation formula for comparison of mean&#x0201d; values. Moreover, some other factors were included for determining sample size, they are reliability of 95%, test power of 80% and refraction variation of 0.75 as obtained from other studies and the least significant differences between the two groups was considered as 0.8. Considering these items, the sample size was estimated at 18 individuals in each group. The patient examined by ophthalmologist and after earning the necessary criteria were enrolled to the study and filled out the consent form. Initially, a profile was prepared for each patient. Some questions were asked from patients for filling the form: Visual history before cataract, use or not use of glasses, previous eye examination, age, gender, right or left eye, address, and telephone number, and recorded by ophthalmologist and residents of ophthalmology in their profiles. For all patients complete ocular examination was performed before operation including visual acuity, intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement, slit-lamp examination, fundoscopy and cycloplegic auto-refraction. The patients undergo biometry by IOL MASTER 500 ZEISS Biometer under the supervision of a qualified person in the Feiz eye clinic. Then patients with AL &#x0003e;25 mm, randomly classified into three groups. The first, second and third patients were classified respectively in Haigis, SRK/T and Hoffer-Q groups, and other patients were distributed in the three consecutively groups until the sample size was completed. Haigis formula, SRK/T formula and Hoffer-Q formula were used respectively in first, second and third groups to calculate the IOL power. Experienced surgeons performed all operation using standard phacoemulsification through a 3.2 mm clear cornea tunnel incision without suture. Phacoemulsification was followed by in the bag implantation of IOL. After that, the patients underwent the supportive care and were discharged if possible. Patients were followed up for examination in the first and second days and then weekly until the first month and also monthly for 3 months after surgery. One and 3 months after surgery, cycloplegic auto-refraction was measured again for each patient and recorded in their profiles.</p><p>The collected data was entered in SPSS software version 22 and was analyzed by ANOVA and Chi-square statistical test.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>In this study 54 volunteers for cataract surgery with AL &#x0003e;25 mm were randomly classified in three groups of 18 individuals and were studied.

In this study there were no significant differences in terms of age and gender distributions between three investigated groups. Therefore, the confounding effect of these factors in this study neutralized.</p><p>According to the results, there was no statistically significant difference in mean of the axial length between the Hoffer-Q, the SRK/T and the Haigis groups. In the investigation of parameters related to refraction included sphere, SE and astigmatism, in the preoperative, no significant differences were observed between the three groups. But after operation, there were statistically significant differences between the mean of sphere and SE indexes. The patients undergoing the cataract surgery with the use of Haigis formula and SRK/T formula had a more favorable postoperative refraction. These results are consistent with the Raouf,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] the Mona Mohammad,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] the Reuland[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and the Priti[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] studies, so that the Raouf study which was done on 53 myopic eyes with the axial length between 25.5 to 31.4 mm, in terms of refractive errors after cataract surgery, there was no statistically significant difference between SRK/T formula and Haigis formula.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Furthermore, the Mona Mohammad study was done on 50 high myopic eyes, no statistically significant difference between SRK/T formula and Haigis formula was found; but both mentioned formulas were better than Hoffer-Q formula[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] which is similar to this study. In the Reuland study which was carried out on 86 high myopia eyes with the axial length &#x0003e;28 mm, Haigis formula and SRK/T formula were more accurate than Hoffer-Q formula and Holladay formula.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Also, Hoffer-Q formula and Holladay formula led to myopic refractive errors that were observed in this study.</p><p>The Priti study was done on 80 myopic eyes, SRK/T formula and then, with slight difference, Haigis formula were the best formulas for eyes with the axial length &#x0003e;24 mm.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Other study was carried out by Petermeier on 50 high myopia eyes, there was no statistically significant difference between Hagis formula, SRK/T formula and Hoffer-Q formula in post-operative refraction.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Also, in the Nemeth study was done on 40 eyes with the axial length &#x0003e;31 mm, no statistically significant difference found between three mentioned formulas and achieved satisfactory results.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In some other studies, the postoperative refraction results have been more favorable with using Haigis formula. For example, the Asad study was done on 127 myopic eyes with the axial length &#x0003e;26 mm, Haigis formula compared with Hoffer-Q formula and Holladay II formula was the best known.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] As well as, the Jia-Kang study was done on 68 eyes with the axial length &#x0003e;25 mm, the precision of Haigis formula was better than the other formulas.</p><p>Considering the results obtained in this study and comparison with other studies, it can be concluded that although the all three formulas, Haigis, Hoffer-Q and SRK/T, are the new and advanced formulas for the IOL power measurement in patients with high myopia but Haigis formula and then, with slight difference, SRK/T formula have better and more acceptable post-operative refraction results than Hoffer-Q formula in patients with high axial length. Therefore, it is recommended using Haigis formula and SRK/T formula for the IOL power calculation in patients with high axial myopia undergoing cataract surgery.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial
