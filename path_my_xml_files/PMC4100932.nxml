We evaluated the impact of osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) on pain in adults with CF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A pilot multicenter randomized controlled trial was conducted with three parallel arms: OMT (group A, 16 patients), sham OMT (sham treatment, group B, 8 patients) and no treatment (group C, 8 patients). Medical investigators and patients were double-blind to treatment for groups A and B, who received OMT or sham OMT monthly for 6 months. Pain was rated as a composite of its intensity and duration over the previous month. The evolution of chest/back pain after 6 months was compared between group A and groups B+C combined (control group). The evolution of cervical pain, headache and quality of life (QOL) were similarly evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment and control groups in the decrease of chest/back pain (difference&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;2.20 IC95% [&#x02212;4.81; 0.42], p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.098); also, group A did not differ from group B. However, chest/back pain decreased more in groups A (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.002) and B (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.006) than in group C. Cervical pain, headache and QOL scores did not differ between the treatment and control groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of evaluating the efficacy of OMT to treat the pain of patients with CF. The lack of difference between the group treated with OMT and the control group may be due to the small number of patients included in this trial, which also precludes any definitive conclusion about the greater decrease of pain in patients receiving OMT or sham OMT than in those with no intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01293019">NCT01293019</ext-link>

The daily routine of a CF patient generally requires long-term home care, including oral and inhaled antibiotics, pancreatic enzyme replacement, mucolytic agents, vitamin supplements, and daily physiotherapy. In addition, these patients often require home or in-hospital intravenous antibiotic therapy during pulmonary exacerbations. Significant advances in the management of respiratory infection and pancreatic insufficiency, coupled with better quality of care by specialist multidisciplinary teams, have resulted in a significant improvement in the median survival age, which approaches 40 years <xref rid="pone.0102465-Vaincrela1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0102465-Cystic1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.

However, it did not show any difference in the decrease of pain between the group treated with OMT and the control group, though chest/back pain decreased more in patients receiving OMT and sham OMT than in those with no intervention. Our study was therefore not powered to be able to draw firm conclusions on the efficacy of OMT against the pain of patients with CF.</p><p>A sufficient number of patients were rapidly recruited (over 12 months rather than over the 18 months initially planned for) and none of the 32 patients dropped out of the study. This reflects the significant expectations that CF patients have for complementary medicine for pain relief. In a survey in French CF patients, 326 of 714 respondents (46%) had used CAM and 38% had experience of OMT <xref rid="pone.0102465-Agrario1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In a survey on pain including 239 Italian adults with CF, 22.2% used non-pharmacological remedies including massage <xref rid="pone.0102465-Festini1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Hayes reported that 45% of 83 adult CF patients practiced chiropractic, yoga or massage for pain relief <xref rid="pone.0102465-Hayes1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In a study of 97 pediatric CF patients, 77% used some method of CAM including manipulative techniques <xref rid="pone.0102465-Tanase1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Only one study has evaluated the effects of manual mobilization techniques and massage therapy on pain: including 105 adults with CF, it reported positive results <xref rid="pone.0102465-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>; however, the study had limitations, and in particular there was no control group such that it could not reveal any placebo effect.</p><p>In our study, it is noteworthy that the majority of our patients were women. Indeed, in CF there is a female disadvantage in terms of survival and morbidity, called the &#x0201c;CF gender gap&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0102465-Sweezey1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, which might be due to the female sex hormone estrogen. Nevertheless, it is unclear from the literature whether women with CF are in greater pain than men with CF.</p><p>As complementary medical techniques become more mainstream, we anticipate that more adults with CF will attempt alternative therapies for pain relief. Our study is the first to assess a treatment of this type in CF patients. We chose to evaluate the effects of OMT on chest/back pain because pain at these sites is prevalent among adults with CF, affecting 15&#x02013;72% of CF patients <xref rid="pone.0102465-Havermans1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. While some patients seek relief from their pain with osteopathic practitioners (but no more than a few times per year), this treatment is not currently approved in CF and is not covered by public health insurance in France. We opted for a monthly treatment regimen as the optimal OMT regimen is not known. Indeed, there are no existing studies on dose-response effects of OMT, nor are there any recommendations or studies on the optimal frequency of OMT. The only available data are descriptive and refer to the frequency of treatment in current practice <xref rid="pone.0102465-Degenhardt1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Our choice for monthly treatments relied on expert opinions. Regarding the control group, we divided it into patients receiving usual care and those receiving sham OMT, so as to evaluate the feasibility of using sham OMT. Because sham treatment is difficult to implement in clinical trials of OMT <xref rid="pone.0102465-Licciardone1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, we chose to use light touch at the skull and at the sacrum which has been used as a placebo method in trials evaluating OMT <xref rid="pone.0102465-Noll1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0102465-Noll2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Cranial palpation, equivalent to light touch, has been proposed as a sham OMT treatment option <xref rid="pone.0102465-Sergueef1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Although the results of a systematic review on the effects of craniosacral therapy suggest improvements on general wellbeing/quality of life and pain, the moderate quality of current studies and the scarcity of available data prevent any definitive conclusion regarding the clinical effectiveness of this type of OMT <xref rid="pone.0102465-Jkel1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p><p>We found no statistically significant difference in the decrease of chest/back pain between patients treated with OMT and the control group. There was no statistically significant difference between patients receiving the OMT intervention treatment and those receiving the OMT sham treatment. However, chest/back pain decreased significantly more in patients receiving the OMT intervention treatment and in those receiving the osteopathic sham treatment than in patients only receiving usual routine care. There was also no difference between the intervention group and the control group with respect to neck/trapezius pain, headache, QOL scores or the need for analgesics. It has been reported that alternative medicine may be an especially successful placebo-generating health care system <xref rid="pone.0102465-Staud1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0102465-Kaptchuk1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Clinical outcomes of OMT result from both OMT-specific and placebo mechanisms (e.g., importance of patient characteristics, practitioner characteristics, patient-practitioner interaction, length of patient encounter) <xref rid="pone.0102465-Moulson1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p>A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials assessed the effect of OMT on chronic low back pain: it concluded that OMT reduced low back pain significantly more than expected from placebo effects, and that the beneficial effects persisted for at least three months <xref rid="pone.0102465-Licciardone2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. In a trial comparing standard medical therapies and OMT over a 12-week period in 155 patients, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in any of the primary outcome measures, but the OMT group required significantly less analgesic medication and used less physical therapy <xref rid="pone.0102465-Andersson1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. However, this study was not blinded, making it is difficult to distinguish the treatment effect from the placebo effect. In another trial, 91 subjects with chronic low back pain were randomized to OMT, sham manipulation, or a no-intervention control group <xref rid="pone.0102465-Licciardone3" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. As in our study, both the patients who received OMT and those who received the sham manipulation reported greater improvement in back pain than the no-intervention control subjects. It is unclear whether the benefits of OMT could be attributed to the manipulative techniques themselves or whether they were related to other non-specific aspects of OMT <xref rid="pone.0102465-Licciardone3" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, our pilot study shows that the assessment of the effects of OMT on chest and back pain in adults with CF is feasible. Patients have substantial expectations and hopes for such studies. The lack of any significant difference between the intervention OMT group and the control group might be related to the small number of patients, which also precludes any definitive conclusion about the greater decrease of pain in patients receiving OMT or sham OMT than in those with no intervention. This may raise the question of a placebo effect and highlights the importance of psychological factors and human relationships in the treatment of pain. Nevertheless, the results need to be interpreted with caution, due to the small number of patients in our pilot study and the multiplicity of the tests.
