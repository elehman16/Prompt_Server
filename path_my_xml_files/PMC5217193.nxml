Chinese herbal medicine has been increasingly prescribed to treat the common cold; however, there is a lack of evidence to support the wide utility of this regimen. This protocol describes an ongoing phase II randomized controlled clinical trial, based on the theory of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), with the objective of evaluating the efficacy and safety of Lian-Ju-Gan-Mao capsules (LJGMC), a Chinese patent medicine, compared with placebo in patients suffering from the common cold with wind-heat syndrome (CCWHS).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial. A total of 240 patients will be recruited and randomly assigned to a high-dose group, medium-dose group, low-dose group, and placebo-matched group in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The treatment course is 3 consecutive days, with a 5-day follow-up. The primary outcome is time to all symptoms&#x02019; clearance. Secondary outcomes include time to the disappearance of primary symptoms and each secondary symptom, time to fever relief, time to fever clearance, and change in TCM symptom and sign scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial is a well-designed study according to principles and regulations issued by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA). The results will provide high-quality evidence on the efficacy and safety of LJGMC in treating CCWHS and help to optimize the dose for the next phase III clinical trial.

Adults may have about two to four episodes annually, whereas children may experience up to six to eight colds per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although the common cold is usually mild and self-limiting, with a mean duration of 7&#x02013;10 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], its economic burden on society is significant in terms of visits to health care providers, treatments, and absences from work and school [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Besides, in some cases, viral pathogens may spread to adjacent organs, resulting in different clinical manifestations, and, occasionally, colds predispose to bacterial complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Symptoms of a cold often include fever, headache, fatigue, nasal stuffiness and discharge, sneezing, sore throat, and cough [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Although great progression has been achieved in Western medicine, there are still no clinically proven &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; medications directly targeting the causative pathogen for treating a cold. Current treatments are limited to symptomatic supportive options that maximize the comfort of patients by reducing symptom severity and limiting the occurrence of complications; these treatments include antihistamines, decongestants, expectorants, antitussives, antipyretics, and analgesics. However, a series of adverse reactions to these drugs, such as drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, digestive system dysfunction, and epistaxis, occasionally occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Accordingly, Chinese herbal medicine as well as zinc and/or vitamin C, garlic, echinacea and vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, as complementary and alternative therapies, have been developed and used in patients with the common cold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a unique, well-established system of medicine with a history of several thousand years, which has been proven effective in the treatment of many diseases, especially the common cold. As the most important component of TCM, Chinese herbal medicine mainly derives from plants and usually incorporates one or more herbs to treat diseases. The common cold can be divided into wind-cold, wind-heat, or summer-heat and dampness syndromes according to its TCM symptoms and signs, such as fever, aversion to cold, tongue proper, tongue coating, and condition of the pulse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], which is called syndrome differentiation (<italic>bian zheng lun zhi</italic>). Common cold with wind-heat syndrome (CCWHS) is the most common type and is primarily characterized by fever, mild aversion to cold, sore throat, red tongue, thin yellow tongue coating, and a floating and fast pulse.</p><p>Lian-Ju-Gan-Mao capsules (LJGMC) are a novel Chinese patent medicine, manufactured by Tasly Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.

The drug prescription has been used as a decoction in clinical practice for years in Southwest Guizhou Autonomous Prefecture Hospital of TCM, and it has demonstrated notable efficacy in lowering body temperature, improving patients&#x02019; symptoms, and shortening the duration of the cold, with few side effects. Preclinical pharmacological and toxicological studies on animals showed that LJGMC was effective in clearing heat, relieving pain, reducing inflammation, and alleviating cough, as well as producing antiallergic, antibacterial, and antiviral effects with no evidence of toxic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Pharmacological effects of each ingredient in a Lian-Ju-Gan-Mao capsule</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Ingredient</th><th>Latin name</th><th>Pharmacological effects based on TCM</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Yangerju</td><td>Inula cappa</td><td>Dispels wind heat, removes toxicity, and soothes throat</td></tr><tr><td>Chuanxinlian</td><td>Herba andrographis</td><td>Clears heat and toxicity</td></tr><tr><td>Shengshigao</td><td>Gypsum</td><td>Clears heat and purges lungs</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>

The mean duration of all symptoms for the common cold was estimated to be 7 &#x000b1; 3&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and reduction in the duration of all symptoms by 2&#x000a0;days is assumed to be clinically significant. Using Power Analysis and Sample Size (PASS) 11.0 with 90% power (1&#x02013;&#x003b2;) and &#x003b1; = 0.05 (two-sided), the sample size needs to be 48 cases for each group. Considering a drop-out of 20%, we decided to recruit 60 subjects in each group. According to the latest edition of Provisions for Drug Registration issued by the CFDA on phase II clinical trials, the total sample size was set to be 240 patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Data management and statistical analysis</title><p>The Drug Clinical Research Center of Shanghai University of TCM is in charge of data statistical analysis. The data entry will be performed by two independent data administrators using the software EpiData 3.1 based on the CRFs, which should have been checked and reviewed for accuracy and consistency by the clinical research associate (CRA) and investigators. Finally, the database will be locked and analyzed under the agreement and confirmed review of the sponsor, principal investigator, and statistician.</p><p>The full analysis set (FAS), in which patients should be dosed with LJGMG or placebo at least once with clinical observation record in the study, is the primary analysis set according to the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach for missing values. All subjects without any major protocol deviations will be included in the per-protocol set (PPS). An efficacy assessment will be carried out using the FAS and PPS. A safety evaluation will be conducted for subjects who have experienced at least one study visit and have safety data, which is defined as the safety set (SS).</p><p>All continuous and normally distributed data are presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation, and median with range for non-normal data. Categorical data are summarized by frequency counts and percentages. Baseline balance among groups will be conducted by performing a chi-squared test or an analysis of variance (ANOVA). Time to all symptoms&#x02019; clearance, time to primary symptoms and each secondary symptom disappearance, time to fever relief, and time to fever clearance will be estimated and compared by the log-rank test. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve will be constructed, and the median time will be provided separately for each group with a two-sided 95% confidence interval. Comparisons among groups of TCM symptom and sign scores will be conducted using ANOVA and the Bonferroni method. All data will be processed by a professional statistician using SAS 9.2 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA); a two-sided <italic>P</italic> value of &#x0003c;0.05 is considered to be statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Quality control and monitoring</title><p>Each trial center has a project manager who is responsible for the quality of research.

Any shortcomings or problems found by the inspectors should be improved.</p><p>To ensure maximum compliance with drug taking and diary recording, a series of measures will be taken which include reminding subjects of their appointments, conducting attentive follow-up by phone or email, and making follow-up appointments at each participant&#x02019;s convenience.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Discussion</title><p>To date, no proven effective drugs or methods in clinical practice can cure the common cold. Chinese herbal medicine has been widely used to treat colds in China for a long time and has gradually been accepted and applied in many other countries. However, evidence-based efficacy and safety data on Chinese herbs are limited, because the studies have used small sample sizes or are of poor quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>It is widely recognized that a randomized placebo-controlled trial is the gold standard to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a drug or treatment method. LJGMC, prescribed as a decoction, has been proven efficient and safe in clinical practice for years in Southwest Guizhou Autonomous Prefecture Hospital of TCM. To support its wide use, we have designed this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) and Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and the &#x0201c;One study, one primary outcome&#x0201d; methodology for clinical trials published by the CFDA. The SPIRIT checklist is given in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. The study is expected to provide high-quality evidence in evaluating the efficacy and safety of LJGMC in treating CCWHS, and it may help to optimize the dose for the next phase III clinical trial based on the four parallel set groups. If proven beneficial, it provides further proof for people to use this inexpensive, easily accessible alternative choice to treat the common cold. Moreover, the protocol presents a detailed and practical methodology for future clinical trials of drugs developed based on TCM.</p><sec id="Sec23"><title>Trial status</title><p>The study is currently in the process of recruiting participants in seven trial centers.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec24"><title>Additional file</title><p>
