The pain of primary dysmenorrhea usually begins a few hours before or just after the onset of menstrual period and may last 48-72 h. The pain is similar to labor pain, with suprapubic cramping, and may be accompanied by lumbosacral backache, with pain radiating down the anterior thigh.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Primary dysmenorrhea is not associated with recognizable pelvic pathology.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] It is caused due to prostaglandin compounds that cause the contraction of myometrium,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] and occurs in 50%-75% of women.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Dysmenorrhea represents a significant personal and public health problem. It is a common complaint of both adolescent and adult women. In the United States, work absenteeism due to dysmenorrhea is estimated to be 600 million work hours per year, and the economic consequences are estimated at $2 billion per year,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] therefore, it is a public problem nowadays.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>A research in Sweden showed that more than 72% of 19-year-old women complained of primary dysmenorrhea. Among those affected, 34% reported mild symptoms, 23% moderate, and 15% reported severe symptoms.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] In surveys conducted in Iran, the prevalence of primary dysmenorrhea has been reported to be 71%-85.5%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>The different options and nutrition methods used for treating primary dysmenorrhea include: psychotherapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), vitamins, and medicines such as prostaglandin inhibitors, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and contraception pills.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>Prostaglandin synthase inhibitors, or NSAIDs (such as Ibuprofen), are effective for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea, but the medication may be contraindicated in patients with gastrointestinal ulcers or bronchospastic hypersensitivity to aspirin. Side effects are usually mild, and include nausea, dyspepsia, diarrhea, and occasionally fatigue.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>On the other hand, the use of plants accompanied with synthetic drugs can help to treat the disease. In Iran, folk herbal remedies can be used for healing of dysmenorrhea (such as fennel, chamomile, and marigold). Fennel (<italic>Foeniculum vulgare Mill</italic>) is an umbelliferous plant.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Both the seed and extract of this plant are appetizing, digestive, diuretic, increased health, menstrative, anti-spasmodic, lactigenic, and laxative.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>The study that compared the effect of oral fennel effect and mefenamic acid on primary dysmenorrhea reported no significant difference between them.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>The probably effect of fennel might be related to the anti-spasmodic property of this plant. Anethole, the major fragrant in fennel seed, is similar in properties.</p><p>Nowadays, vitamins play an important role in the treatment of dysmenorrhea. Studies have shown this property with dopamine. It has been shown that anethole joins with dopamine receptors and decreases pain.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] Use of these products has no adverse effect of tranquilizers.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] Vitamin E relieves primary dysmenorrhea, and probably its antioxidant property can suppress the oxidation of arachidonic acid, decreasing the production of prostaglandin.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] Iaghmaii <italic>et al</italic>. reported that vitamin E/mefenamic acid provided grater pain relief than mefenamic acid alone.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] The aim of this survey was to evaluate the efficacy of fennel extract/vitamin E compared with ibuprofen in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea, with due attention to the different mechanisms of vitamin E and fennel extract (vitamin E is an antioxidant, and anethole in the extract of fennel is anti-spasmodic).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This study was a double-blinded, cross-over study. The samples were female students of Tabriz University and Tabriz University of Medical Science, who suffered from primary dysmenorrhea. Inclusion criteria were having a history of primary dysmenorrhea, with regular menses in the last 3 months prior to the first visit, and no previous history of gynecologic disease and of allergy to NSAIDs, or suspected contraindication to herbal remedies, no history of pelvic major surgery, seizure, stressor factor in the last 6 months, severe gastrointestinal disorders, or any diseases that might interfere with the conduct of the study or the interpretation of the results. Exclusion criteria were having pain in the Duration of the menstruation period or before the onset of menstrual bleeding, use of oral hormonal contraception during treatment, having urinary tract infection in the study period, simultaneous participation in another clinical trial or participation in another clinical trial prior to study entry that might have an impact on the study objectives at the discretion of the investigator. The data were collected by using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS; questionnaire number 1, 2). For validation of the questionnaire, we used content validity that was conducted by 10 academic members of Tabriz University of Medical Science. For questionnaire reliability, test-retest was used. This study was undertaken with approval of the Tabriz University and Tabriz University of Medical Science ethics committee. Students who had the criteria for admission, and want to participate in the trial were asked to give their informed consent. The questionnaires were distributed to the students, and they were asked to fill them up. They were asked about demographic characteristics, menstrual health, general health, and intensity of menstruation pain. The researchers requested the participants who completed the questionnaire in the next month without use of any drugs. After that, the eligible students were determined; every student was randomly (Systematic Random Sampling) assigned to fennel/vitamin E group or ibuprofen group (34 participants in each group). For both groups, questionnaires 1 and 2 and drug packages with randomization codes of A and B were dispensed. The shape, size, and color of the capsule of drugs were similar. The subjects were requested to record the intensity of menstrual pain by VAS at 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after the onset of bleeding. The first group used package A in the first month and package B in the second month. The second group was treated by package B in the first month and package A in the second month. Packages A and B contained fennel extract/vitamin E and ibuprofen. The study was double-blinded, i.e. the researcher and students did not know which medication was administered.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using SPSS version 14.
