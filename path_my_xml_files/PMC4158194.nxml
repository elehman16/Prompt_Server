As the majority of patients who fracture have fallen, it follows that people who fall can usefully be targeted in any programme that aims to reduce osteoporotic fracture. Targeting vulnerable patients who are likely to benefit from intervention may help shift the management of fracture prevention into primary care, away from emergency departments. Paramedics who attend to patients who have fallen may be well placed to assess future fracture risk, using the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) and communicate that information directly to general practitioners (GPs).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This feasibility study takes the form of a pragmatic, randomised controlled trial aimed at exploring and refining issues of study design, recruitment, retention, sample size and acceptability preceding a large-scale study with fracture as the end point. Patients (aged &#x0003e;50) who fall, call an ambulance, are attended by a study paramedic and give verbal consent will be asked FRAX and fall questions. Patients who subsequently formally consent to participation will be randomised to control (usual care) or intervention groups. Intervention will constitute transmission of calculated future fracture risk to the patients&#x02019; GP with suitable, evidence-based recommendations for investigation or treatment. 3&#x02005;months after the index fall, data (proportion of patients in each group undergoing investigation or starting new treatment, quality of life and health economic) will be collected and analysed using descriptive statistics. A nested qualitative study will explore issues of acceptability and study design with patients, paramedics and GPs.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This protocol was approved by NRES Committee South Central Oxford C in October 2012.

In total, 35% of people aged over 65 fall each year rising to 50% at age 85.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Many patients fall repeatedly. 56% of patients attending an emergency department reported recurrent falls, and 55% of patients presenting with an acute fracture had previously fallen.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> A fall with osteoporosis is particularly risky. In a study of 2649 postmenopausal women, those with osteoporosis were 2.8 times more likely to fracture than those without, and osteoporotic women with a history of fall 24.8 times more likely, even after taking age and body mass index into account.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Treatment to reduce fracture risk in those with osteoporosis is known to be cost-effective<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> but there is far less evidence to suggest benefit in targeting people who fall for fracture risk assessment.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> A high proportion of people who fall and call an ambulance are not reviewed by their general practitioner (GP). Only 25% of such patients visit their general practice within 3&#x02005;months of a fall.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Treatment of patients considered at high risk of fracture might consist of a combination of non-medication (education, physiotherapy, balance classes) and medication options. Fracture rates may be reduced by calcium and vitamin D supplementation among older people who live in care homes.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Specific treatments such as the bisphosphonates (for example, oral alendronate or intravenous zoledronate) can reduce future fracture rate between 40% and 50%.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Drug treatment thresholds, based on a combination of fracture risk, age and gender, have been set in the UK by the National Osteoporosis Guideline Group (NOGG).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Both National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and NOGG recognise that falls play an important part in fracture risk, but neither include fall history in their risk-profiling algorithms.</p><p>However, NICE has published guidance to help clinicians identify patients most at risk of fragility (low impact or osteoporotic) fracture.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;16</xref> Technology Appraisal Guidelines (TAG) 160/161<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> advise the use of clinical factors (family history of hip fracture, conditions associated with osteoporosis, early menopause, excessive alcohol consumption) to target dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans and/or treatment to postmenopausal women. Healthcare commissioners are charged with ensuring NICE guidance is implemented nationally. However the advice is complex (particularly TAG160) and uptake has been poor.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> NICE guidance also specifically excludes women taking corticosteroids, and men.</p><p>Assessment of future fracture risk is central to good management, and the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) has been developed to enable identification of individuals most at risk of fragility fracture.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> FRAX is a validated and freely available algorithm in the form of a calculator that estimates a 10-year absolute risk of fragility fracture from patient data inputted online. The online calculator is clear, easy to use and allows risk calculation in postmenopausal women, patients taking corticosteroids and men aged 50&#x02005;years or over.</p><p>As the majority of patients who fracture have fallen, it follows that people who fall can usefully be targeted in any programme to reduce osteoporotic fracture. Targeting such a population may allow the identification of vulnerable patients who are likely to benefit from intervention, and serve to further shift the burden of fracture prevention into primary care. As people who fall are often attended by paramedics,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> involving these professionals in the assessment of future fracture risk has the potential to impact on follow-up and management. Specifically, if paramedics help to determine a patient's 10-year fracture risk at the time of a fall, if that information is conveyed to their GP, and if the GP acts on the recommendations, then a higher proportion of patients may be treated according to the national fracture prevention guidelines.</p><p>It is possible that introducing routine FRAX assessment by paramedics of all patients who fall and call an ambulance could reduce long-term fracture rates. In order to justify such a service development, evidence of fracture reduction is required. A large (expensive) trial, conducted over a number of years would be needed to address this important question. Before such an undertaking, it is wise to assess the feasibility of such an approach, to explore the possibilities and potential pitfalls of the intervention, to inform the design of a large-scale randomised trial aimed at reducing fragility fracture rates over the coming years in those who fall.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Aim</title><p>Our future aim is to determine whether FRAX administered opportunistically by paramedics to people who fall improves diagnosis and treatment of patients at high risk of fracture, leading to a reduced fracture rate. To design such a trial (in the future), we need to conduct a feasibility study to collect data (quantitative and qualitative) to inform the effective design of the main (fracture reduction) trial.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Objectives</title><p>To achieve the aim of the feasibility study we have set the following objectives:

The paramedics will receive overtime payments to attend. The sessions will be carried out in small groups (4&#x02013;6), face to face, and facilitated by an experienced clinician according to a preagreed session plan. The paramedics will learn about research, receive refresher training in the Mental Capacity Act, find out about the importance of osteoporosis and learn how to use the FRAX tool. There will be an interactive session designed to allow the paramedics to try out the study paperwork, in particular, asking the FRAX questions of a volunteer (drawn from the patient participation group). After the time to ask questions, the paramedic will be appraised in their use of the study literature.</p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>Study plan</title><p>Paramedics will ensure the patient is medically stable and comfortable. If the patient is eligible (see inclusion and exclusions 1&#x02013;4) the paramedic will seek verbal agreement from the patient to ask FRAX questions relating to osteoporosis risk and falling, and for a member of the research team to contact them later about the study. Paramedics will defer to the patient's carer or consultee for verbal agreement if the patient lacks capacity.</p><p>The paramedic will use a double-sided sheet to record the patient's verbal consent on one side, and the answers to questions about fracture (FRAX) and fall risk on the other (see online supplementary appendix 1). He or she will then return the completed paper sheets with the (medication) response bag, at the end of shift, to the ambulance base.</p><p>The patient contact sheets will be transmitted securely to the researcher. The researcher will then check that potential participants have not been admitted to hospital for 24&#x02005;h or longer (exclusion 5).</p><p>Within 10 working days of the index fall the researcher will send an information pack (patient information (see online supplementary appendix 2), reply slip, consent form, stamped addressed return envelope) to the patient. The researcher will also then telephone the patient to discuss the study. This will provide an opportunity for the patient to ask any questions they may have in order for them to provide valid, written consent. If the patient prefers to consent in person the researcher will visit the patient.</p><p>If the patient declines, we will call the patient to enquire after the reason(s) they have opted not to take part.

Analysis will be carried out on data collected prior to patient discontinuation.</p></sec><sec id="s4n"><title>Health economics methods and analysis</title><p>This study will pilot the methodology to carry out a cost-effectiveness analysis in the future trial. The future economic evaluation will include a cost-consequences study at 3&#x02005;months, comparing costs and outcomes for patients in the short-term, and, if possible, a cost-effectiveness model to extrapolate costs and health benefits to the longer term, incorporating the possible effect of the intervention in fractures averted.</p><p>In this study we will assess the feasibility of collecting the resource-use data by reporting on the percentage of completed sets of data returned from patients and from research staff in case report forms. We will value resources required to deliver the intervention (training paramedics, administering the FRAX score and liaising with GPs) using national estimates for health and social care<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> or local sources when appropriate.</p><p>Each health status score produced by the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire will be allocated a preference-based quality-of-life weight for the UK population at baseline and 3&#x02005;months. This allows quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) to be derived. A QALY weighs survival by the quality of life of the patient within that period of time. We will compute a 3-month incremental QALY using the area under the curve method and then adjust the QALY gain against baseline utility using linear regression with robust SEs.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p></sec><sec id="s4o"><title>Qualitative methods</title><p>The qualitative study aims to assess the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention with patients, GPs and paramedics. Data collection will involve semistructured interviews with patients (up to 40), GPs (up to 20) and paramedics (up to 20) as well as observation of paramedics when attending people who have fallen (8). With informed consent, interviews will be digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. The interviewer/observer will be an experienced qualitative health researcher.</p><p>Semistructured interviews with patients will elicit their views about the study design, including being asked the FRAX questions by ambulance crew, the recruitment process, the process of randomisation and its effect on differential treatment, and the acceptability of completing questionnaires and accessing their medical records 3&#x02005;months post follow-up. Interview participants will be selected purposively to include a range of patients from intervention and control groups, genders, ages. Family carers will be included for their views where appropriate.</p><p>GPs who have received the intervention letters, with details of a patient's fracture risk and advice about treatment, will be interviewed to elicit their views on the trial design and the intervention. GPs will be asked about their current practice in fracture prevention, their opinions about the information received from the study team, whether and why they chose to follow recommendations and suggestions for improvement to the intervention and study design. GPs will be purposively selected based on whether they had patients in the intervention arm of the trial.</p><p>Selected (and consenting) participating paramedics will be observed in the course of their daily routine to help assess the feasibility of the trial processes and FRAX administration. Triangulating both these methods and data sets will more accurately assess the acceptability for paramedics to use FRAX in prehospital care, with people who have fallen.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In interviews, paramedics will be asked about their experience of using FRAX with their patients who have fallen; their reflections on the recruitment process; the study training and reminders provided; the ease, or otherwise, of assessing mental capacity, particularly with regard to research and any other views on patients who fall.</p><p>When observing paramedics, notes will be made during and after the observation.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Observations will take place throughout the recruitment period, examining the ease of asking the FRAX questions, the quality of information recorded, whether any barriers exist to carrying out the intervention and recruitment, whether any conversations take place about fracturing and falling prevention, whether any self-care advice is given, if any emotional support is given to patients, and how interagency relationships with other organisations work. Paramedics will be purposively sampled based on gender and level of experience.</p><p>The 3 sets of data (patients, GPs and paramedics) will be analysed separately with the aid of NVivo (V.10). Data will be inductively coded thematically, producing thematic frameworks.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> 20% of the transcripts and coding framework will be double-coded by another experienced qualitative researcher to ensure dependability and credibility of findings.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The thematic coding frame will be explored and refined<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and findings will be interpreted in the light of existing theory and literature. The qualitative study will provide information about the acceptability of study processes and the intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s5"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although the majority of patients who experience a fragility fracture have done so consequent to a fall, and there are assessment algorithms that allow us to predict which patients are most likely to benefit from specific antiosteoporotic treatment, there is no mechanism within the NHS that allows for fracture risk assessment at the time of a fall. Fractures can be painful, disabling and are expensive to our health system.</p><p>This study is designed to collect data to help determine whether it may be feasible to link falls with fracture risk at the time a patient asks for help. It addresses the practicalities of teaching, collecting and delivering the FRAX information to a patient's GP and the acceptability of the intervention to the patients, paramedics and GPs. The study will collect data on the number of patients who fall and are at increased risk of fracture, and the proportion of those patients who are not already on treatment.</p><p>These data will allow calculation of the size of a subsequent RCT to determine whether paramedics, by assessing fracture risk in those who fall, can positively influence the number of fragility fractures that occur over a 5-year period.</p><sec id="s5a"><title>Dissemination</title><p>The final data set will be held by the principal investigator but will be available on request (with patient identifiers removed to ensure participant confidentiality). The project outcomes will be relayed to all participants, the sponsor and funding body. The outcomes will be submitted (with the sponsor and funders approval) to peer-reviewed journals and for presentation at relevant scientific local and national meetings. A publication plan and authorship criteria have been preagreed by the research team.</p></sec><sec id="s5b"><title>Study management</title><p>The principle investigator will have overall responsibility for project delivery.</p><p>A Project Steering Committee (PSC) will be independently chaired, will meet twice annually and be constituted by a majority of independent members who will be representatives from stakeholder groups (patients, ambulance service, academic research, general practice and secondary care).
