In phase 2, patients achieving remission or low disease activity were followed up with randomization to 1 of 2 step-down protocols: leflunomide plus hydroxychloroquine combination or leflunomide monotherapy. The primary endpoints were good European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response (DAS28 (ESR) &#x0003c; 3.2 and a decrease of DAS28 by at least 1.2) during the intensive treatment and the disease state retention rate during step-down maintenance treatment.

In phase 1, enrolled patients received DMARDs treatment comprising a combination of methotrexate (MTX), leflunomide (LEF), and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). The starting dose of oral MTX was 7.5&#x0200a;mg/wk that could be increased to a maximum of 20&#x0200a;mg/wk. LEF (10&#x02013;20&#x0200a;mg/d per rheumatologists&#x02019; discretion) and HCQ (400&#x0200a;mg/d) were administrated in combination with MTX. Adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs were recorded throughout the study. Folic acid was administered to every patient (5&#x0200a;mg/wk, 1 single dose). Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was allowed and the dose could be changed in the study. Intra-articular or intramuscular injection of glucocorticoids was allowed only once (no more than 40&#x0200a;mg Triamcinolone Acetonide or its equivalent) at the beginning of the study. Oral glucocorticoids (prednisone &#x02264; 10&#x0200a;mg/d) were allowed but were tapered to discontinuation before entering the step-down maintenance period. Disease activity was assessed every 12 weeks. Patients who achieved a DAS28 &#x02264; 3.2 entered the maintenance period.</p><p>In phase 2, patients who achieved a DAS28 &#x02264; 3.2 were randomized to 1 of 2 step-down maintenance regimens: LEF monotreatment group (10&#x0200a;mg/d) or LEF (10&#x0200a;mg/d) plus HCQ (400&#x0200a;mg/d) group. Disease activity was assessed every 12 weeks.

The secondary endpoint was the disease retention (maintenance of good EULAR response) rate during step-down maintenance treatment. Clinically relevant predictive factors for good EULAR response in the prolonged intensive treatment period and predictive factors for disease flare in the randomized step-down maintenance period were assessed. Health assessment questionnaire disability index (HAQ, which had been translated and validated for the enrolled patients), swollen and tender joint counts (28 joints), concentration of C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, physician and patient global assessments (0&#x02013;10&#x0200a;cm visual analog scales), and patient assessed pain and fatigue (0&#x02013;10&#x0200a;cm visual analog scales) were measured. Rheumatoid factor (RF) and anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies were performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay twice at entry of the intensive and maintenance treatment phases, respectively. Extra-articular features were acquired, including rheumatoid nodules, vasculitis, secondary Sjogren syndrome, interstitial lung disease, and other extra-articular manifestations associated with RA.</p></sec><sec><label>2.5</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A sample size of 344 patients was estimated for the intensive treatment period with the assumption that 80% of patients would achieve LDA or remission at the end of intensive treatment stage (on the basis of the TICORA trial).<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> A sample size of 110 patients per maintenance treatment group was calculated to have 90% power to detect a 15% difference between the 2 groups with an &#x003b1; level of 0.05.</p><p>In the intensive treatment period, the intention-to-treat population included all patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug.

In this study, we found high response rate of RA with prolonged intensive DMARDs therapy. The proportion of patients with good EULAR response increased with time without shifting the treatment. There was around 18% increment of good response rate at 36 weeks. The result suggested that prolonged intensive treatment could be continued and steered though the treat goal was not reached at 6 months.</p><p>Several studies have analyzed the role of baseline characteristics as predictors of response, such as HAQ, disease duration, and baseline disease activity.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> Sex and age have also been related to the treatment response.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> In our study, we found that age and ESR were the predictors for the outcome of intensive treatment, which was similar with the previous reports.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> It seemed that young patients with low level of ESR were prone to respond to intensive treatment. Predicting clinical outcomes based upon baseline factors would be useful to help select the optimal management of RA.</p><p>Our study showed that patients achieving DAS28 remission and low functional activity (HAQ) had highest retention of their disease state and by corollary lowest relapse rates. HAQ was an independent predictor for disease relapse. Thus better control of disease activity (both clinical and functional) was important for sustaining the target during intensive treatment. Studies predicting flare of RA are rare. Scir&#x000e8; et al<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> showed that ultrasound power Doppler (PD)-positive synovial hypertrophy, even in a single joint, was the main predictor of relapse within 6 months. Saleem et al<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> reported that baseline PD activity, HAQ, and DAS28 predicted the flare after remission. Flare was associated with worse clinical and functional outcomes. Our results further confirmed the important impact of DAS28 and HAQ on the maintenance of the treatment target.</p><p>In this study, unique conventional DMARDs therapy using MTX in combination with LEF and HCQ was given to severely active RA patients. This combination therapy was thought to be toxic and rarely used in current clinical trials. In our study, good effect and safety of the triple intensive treatment were found during 36th week. MTX, as an anchor drug in RA, was the most common drug in RA treatment. In addition, a number of studies have shown that LEF has comparable efficacy to MTX.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> In maintenance period, MTX and prednisone were withdrawn. We found that there was no advantage on tapering to combination rather than monotherapy, suggesting that LEF is a good maintenance treatment as single treatment. Though there were also some weakness of the study, such as the open label design and significant dropout, the study evaluated the induction and maintenance of remission of prolonged intensive DMARDs treatment at the first time.</p><p>In conclusion, the prolonged intensive DMARDs treatment was an effective treatment strategy for active RA, and a high remission could be continued and steered though the treat goal was not reached at 6 months. Higher remission and a lower HAQ lead to less flare when tapering the DMARDs.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors thank Professor Hong-Yuan Wang, from School of Public Health, Peking University, for assistance with randomization and statistical analysis.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: AE = adverse events, anti-CCP = anticyclic citrullinated peptide, CRP = C-reactive protein, DAS28 = disease activity score (28 joints), DMARD = disease-modifying antirheumatic drug, ESR = erythrocyte sedimentation rate, EULAR = European League Against Rheumatism, HCQ = hydroxychloroquine, LDA = low disease activity, LEF = leflunomide, MGA = medical global assessment, MTX = methotrexate, PGA = patient global assessment, RA = rheumatoid arthritis, RF = rheumatoid factor, SJC = swollen joint count, TJC = tender joint count, VAS = visual analog scale.</p></fn><fn fn-type="equal"><p>RL and J-XZ have contributed equally to this work.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>The study was supported by funds from the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (2008BAI59B01 and 2014BAI07B01), the National Basic Research Program of China (2010CB529100), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81273292).</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Smolen</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name><name><surname>Aletaha</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Bijlsma</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
