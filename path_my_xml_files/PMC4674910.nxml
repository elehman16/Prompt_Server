Unhealthy lifestyle is one of the major risk factors and lifestyle interventions have been shown to be efficacious for primary, secondary and early tertiary prevention. However, there is a paucity of evidence regarding effective community-based lifestyle interventions in the Pacific Islands. The Complete Health Improvement Program for high-income countries was contextualised for rural communities with relatively low-literacy rates in low-income countries using the REFLECT delivery approach. This study will assess the effect of this &#x02018;Live More&#x02019; program to reduce participant&#x02019;s NCD risk factors and improve lifestyle behaviours associated with health and wellbeing, in low-literacy communities in countries of the South Pacific.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This study is a 6-month cluster-randomised controlled trial of 288 adults (equal proportions of men and women aged 18&#x000a0;years and over) with waist circumference of &#x02265;92&#x000a0;cm for men and &#x02265;80&#x000a0;cm for women in four rural villages in each of Fiji, Vanuatu and Solomon Islands.

Outcome assessments at baseline, 30-days, 3-months and 6-months include body mass index, waist circumference, blood lipids, blood pressure and blood glucose. Secondary outcomes include changes in medication and substance use, diet, physical activity, emotional health and supportive relationships, collected by lifestyle questionnaire at the same time points.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first lifestyle intervention using the Reflect approach to target NCDs.

However, on a global scale the shift from communicable to NCDs as the major cause of mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] is now complete, with NCDs being responsible for 63&#x000a0;% of all deaths worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In fact, the impact of NCDs is now felt most strongly in LMICs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] which bear 86&#x000a0;% of the global burden of premature deaths from NCDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Further, many LMICs now face a double burden of disease from communicable and non-communicable risks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] resulting in significant social disadvantage and economic burden on individuals, families and society at large [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It is projected that as a consequence of NCDs LMICs will accumulate economic losses of US$7 trillion over the next 15&#x000a0;years and produce millions of people trapped in poverty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>The four main NCDs are cardiovascular diseases (CVD), cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes. Diabetes in particular is increasing to epidemic proportions, with 387 million people in the world living with the condition and it was responsible for 4.9 million deaths in 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Eighty percent of people with diabetes live in LMICs, and the Western Pacific (which includes the South Pacific) is seen as the epicentre of the diabetes epidemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The situation in the South Pacific Islands is particularly alarming with seven of the top ten countries in the world with the highest prevalence of diabetes being Pacific Islands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In Vanuatu, almost 1 in 4 (24&#x000a0;%) of the population have diabetes, and there are similar trends in other Pacific Island countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>The urgency and need to address NCDs in LMICs through appropriate prevention and treatment has only recently been recognised by the United Nations (UN), governments and the non-government organization (NGO) sector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. At the 42nd Pacific Islands Forum Communique in 2011, it was declared that &#x02018;NCDs have reached epidemic proportions in Pacific Island countries and territories and have become a human, social and economic crisis requiring an urgent and comprehensive response&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Clearly, there is a need for effective and relevant programs to address NCDs, particularly in the South Pacific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Unhealthy lifestyle is one of the major risk factors of NCDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and lifestyle interventions have been shown to be efficacious for their primary, secondary and early tertiary prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, there is a paucity of evidence regarding effective community-based lifestyle interventions in the Pacific Islands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>The Complete Health Improvement Program (CHIP) is a community-based lifestyle intervention that originated in the United States of America and has demonstrated significant benefits for the management of cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], type 2 diabetes mellitus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The positive health outcomes have been documented and published in more than 25 peer reviewed journals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. CHIP is a holistic, evidence-based, education program which addresses various aspects of health including nutrition, physical activity, substance use, stress, self-worth and happiness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The CHIP intervention involves 18 one to 1.5-h group sessions over 6 to 12&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>While the program was developed for middle to high socio-economic (SES) groups in the United States, recent studies from other high-income countries, such as Australia/New Zealand and Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] have shown similar levels of effectiveness, despite the inherent cultural differences. In addition, CHIP delivered to free-living residents of Appalachia, a lower SES community in the Athens County which struggles with the highest poverty levels in Ohio, produced similar results to those observed in higher SES groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>There have been no published studies of the effectiveness of the CHIP intervention in the Pacific Islands to date, however, unpublished data from large urban centres of the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Fiji shows positive biometric outcomes following the program. Noting these pilot findings and the considerable literature supporting the effectiveness of the CHIP intervention, an Australian NGO, the Adventist Disaster and Relief Agency (ADRA) Australia, sought to use the CHIP intervention to address the high rates of NCDs in the Pacific Islands. However, it was recognised that the program was less suited to the rural and most marginalised parts of the Pacific Islands, as well as other LMICs, because: to engage with the program required English literacy, the content was not culturally identifiable, ingredients for suggested recipes were not available, and the program required technical equipment that was not commonly accessible such as video projection. As a result, a contextualised version of the CHIP intervention, appropriate for rural communities with relatively low literacy rates, was developed. The program communicated the core messages embedded in the conventional CHIP but also focused more widely on food security, availability, access and utilisation.</p><p>The developed program was built on a model of adult learning and social change known as Regenerated Freirean Literacy through Empowering Community Techniques (REFLECT). The REFLECT model fuses the theories of Brazilian educator Paulo Freire with Participatory Methodologies (PMs) and was developed in the 1990s to link adult literacy to empowerment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Today, the REFLECT approach is used by over 500 organisations in more than 70 countries worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. REFLECT utilises a &#x0201c;Reflect Circle&#x0201d; which is a group methodology in which the teacher facilitates discussion, rather than lectures to a &#x02018;class&#x02019;. The groups meet regularly to discuss local issues and how these can be addressed, while at the same time developing literacy skills. Key to the REFLECT approach is creating a space where people feel comfortable to meet and discuss issues relevant to them and their lives. This is often the first opportunity the village members have to conduct a systematic analysis of their lives and environment. While this process may lack in technical expertise, it is enriched by the local specificity and the connections and insights that emerge, which would not be elucidated by a more formal education process.</p><p>ADRA has been using the REFLECT approach to enact social change, financial security and literacy/numeracy in countries such as Tanzania, Albania, Sudan and Cambodia. Anecdotally, these programs have resulted in perceived health and wellbeing benefits, despite not specifically addressing these domains. Hence, it was rationalised that the REFLECT approach might be appropriate for delivering a program specifically targeting NCDs.</p><p>This paper provides the rationale and methods for the study of the adapted version of the CHIP intervention, contextualised for low SES communities in the islands of the South Pacific, utilising the REFLECT approach of delivery. The program is referred to as &#x02018;Live More&#x02019; and is designed to reduce participant&#x02019;s NCD risk factors and improve lifestyle behaviours associated with health and wellbeing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The &#x02019;Live More&#x02019; program will be evaluated using a cluster randomised controlled trial.

The 6-month intervention will be conducted in three Pacific Island countries: Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Fiji. In each country there will be two intervention villages and two control, resulting in a total of six intervention villages and six control villages across the three countries. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, and repeated at 30&#x000a0;days, 3&#x000a0;months and 6&#x000a0;months post baseline. The design, conduct and reporting of this study will adhere to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines for group trials.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study design and flow</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2015_2560_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>The study was approved by the (name of the ethics committee removed for blinding) Human Research Ethics Committee in New South Wales, Australia (ID: 2014/03) on 18th of March 2014.

The session will commence with the facilitator welcoming the participants in a culturally appropriate way and ensuring no-one feels excluded. Participants will be encouraged to discuss their progress and ask any questions that have arisen since the previous session. Using the lesson plan, the predetermined participatory technique and the necessary aids, the facilitator will introduce the theme for the session by exploring what the participants already know about themselves and their local situation. In particular, graphics/visuals in the form of maps, pictures, calendars and matrices will be utilised to describe their current situation and understandings. Following this activity, the participants will be further drawn into the session&#x02019;s topic by use of a trigger picture, where they will be asked to describe what they see. Throughout this discussion, information will be shared with the group to enhance their understanding of the topic. When all material included in the lesson plan is covered, the facilitator will guide the participants into an action plan to incorporate the learnings from that session into their lives (e.g. how to incorporate 10,000 steps into their day). The session will conclude with congratulations for success so far in the health journey and a reminder of the time and venue for the next session. This whole process empowers the participants to openly discuss their situation and develop strategies to address the issue introduced in that session.</p><p>At the end of the 6-months, there will be another biometric measurement, completion of the lifestyle questionnaire and personal feedback. A group feedback session will follow where the achievements of the groups will be acknowledged and graduation certificates distributed.

To the authors&#x02019; knowledge,&#x02019;Live More&#x02019; is the first lifestyle intervention using the Reflect approach targeting low-income countries, such as those found in the South Pacific.</p><p>Targeting low-income countries in the South Pacific is important because increased access to nutritiously poor imported foods, coupled with limited funds available to support the delivery of public health campaigns and health care services, are having deleterious health consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Over the last two decades, poverty has been growing in some countries of the South Pacific, with Solomon Islands and Vanuatu now on par with Guinea, Burundi, Senegal and Bangladesh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Indeed awareness of the association between NCDs and poverty is growing with the NCD Alliance, consisting of four international NGO federations, advocating for the recognition that NCDs are a major cause of poverty, a barrier to economic development and a global emergency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>While there is strong evidence that lifestyle interventions are effective in addressing NCDs in high-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], peak bodies such as the World Health Organization acknowledges that there are few evidence-based lifestyle interventions suitable for low SES communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. More specifically, regarding the countries in this study, these interventions are sparse in Fiji, and non-existent in Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, where programs do exist, these are costly and have limited usefulness in the communities that have low literacy levels and limited access to technology.</p><p>Interventions that provide professional learning opportunities for facilitators who live with and can mentor participants in the same village may provide a valuable framework for sustainable practice. Utilising villagers as facilitators not only uses local resources but can also improve psychological well-being, self-efficacy and confidence, particularly where underemployment is prevalent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In addition, community self-help that involves the whole community through the interest and awareness it creates can also contribute to its development as a whole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>The &#x02019;Live More&#x02019; program is an innovative intervention targeting participants at risk of NCDs in low-income communities. The strengths of this study include the opportunity to build self-sufficiency and autonomy within a community, the objective measures of various biometrics and PA, and the comprehensive multi-component intervention. The findings from the study will be used to guide delivery of a lifestyle intervention to improve health and wellbeing in the South Pacific.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>NCD</term><def><p>Non-Communicable Disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LMIC</term><def><p>Low and Middle Income Countries</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>Body Mass Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CVD</term><def><p>Cardiovascular Disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UN</term><def><p>United Nations</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NGO</term><def><p>Non-Government Organisation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ADRA</term><def><p>Adventist Disaster and Relief Agency</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CHIP</term><def><p>Coronary Health Improvement Program</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SES</term><def><p>Socioeconomic Status</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>REFLECT</term><def><p>Regenerated Freirean Literacy through Empowering Community Techniques</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PM</term><def><p>Participatory Methodology</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CONSORT</term><def><p>Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MSC</term><def><p>Significant Change Stories</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AI</term><def><p>Appreciative Inquiry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HP</term><def><p>Health Professional</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p>Standard Deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>Confidence Interval</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>LM and DM have no competing interests.
