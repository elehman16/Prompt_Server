It is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The primary physiological abnormality in COPD is an accelerated decline in the forced expiratory volume in first second (FEV1). FEV1 declines approximately 30 ml per year in adults over 30 years of age, in COPD the rate of decline increased to nearly 60 ml per year.</p><p>According to guidelines from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) the airflow limitation in COPD is characterized by a FEV1 value that is less than 80 percent of the predicted normal value and a FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 0.70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>).</p><p>Cysteinyl leukotrienes (Cys-LTs) are proinflammatory mediators derived from arachidonic acid through the 5-lypoxigenase (5-LO) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>).

Patients with rhinitis, asthma, mixed pattern of asthma and COPD might benefit from this drug. The most relevant leukotriene in COPD is leukotriene B<sub>4</sub>, which is not inhibited by pranlukast, montelukast or Zafirlukas. The Zileuton might have some inhibitory effect, which has not been studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">11</xref>).</p><p>Arachidonic acid is the precursor of fatty acid that transformed into the leukotrienes by the 5-lipoxygenase pathway. The leukoteriens exert their biologic activities via binding to and activating specific receptors. Two subtypes of cysteinyl leukoteriens have been identified. Most of cysteinyl leukoteriens actions are mediated by type 1 receptor.</p><p>Activation of this receptor leads to smooth muscle contraction in airways, chemotaxis and increased vascular permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>). The leukotriene receptor antagonists dilate the airways in the lung with baseline bronchoconstriction.</p><p>The CysLTs are portent bronchoconstrictors in subjects with asthma, but there is no rigid evidence for a role of these mediators in COPD, although the presence of CysLTs in the sputum of patients with chronic bronchitis has been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>). There are few studies that show the zafirlukast has bronchodilator effect in COPD and cysteinyl leukotrienes might contribute to the bronchospasm in these patients. Cazzola and his group studied 16 patients with COPD and 10 asthmatics in which all were treated with monotherapy of Zafirlukast 40 mg bid, Salmeterol, the combination of Salmeterol and Zafirlukast, or placebo. Pulmonary functions test were measured at 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min. At the end of 4 h, salbutamol was administered, and spirometry was repeated in 30 min. In patients with COPD and asthma maximum bronchodilation was seen at 120 and 180 min respectively. Salmeterol increased the FEV<sub>1</sub> by 21.7%, while Zafirlukast increased it by 11.2%. The Zafirlukast produced no acute bronchodilation compared to the effect of Salmeterol alone, but 7 of 16 patients with COPD and 7 of 10 patients with asthma had additional benefit after the first few hours of treated with the combination of Salmeterol and Zafirlukast. The Salbutamol produced no additional increase after patients received Salmeterol or the combination, but there was an increase after Zafirlukast and placebo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">12</xref>).</p><p>Another study by Cazzola et al showed that Zafirlukast improves lung function in smokers with COPD. Sixteen outpatients with stable COPD received 40 mg of oral Zafirlukast. Lung function was measured at 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min. At the end of this period, 400 &#x000b5;g of salbutamol was administered to them. The Zafirlukast added a significant bronchodilator effect between 30 min and 4 h following administration, with a maximum mean increase of 0.134 L above baseline after 2 h. Nine of the 16 patients had an increase in FEV<sub>1</sub> of at least 15% above baseline after Zafirlukast treatment. There was no difference in the post-salbutamol FEV<sub>1</sub> after placebo or Zafirlukast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>).</p><p>Nannini LJ Jr et al studied through a randomised, double-blind, crossover and placebo-controlled study and assessed the short-term effects of Zafirlukast in patients with severe COPD. They enrolled 23 subjects, after baseline spirometry, a single oral dose of 40 mg Zafirlukast or the corresponding placebo was administered. FVC and FEV1 was measured every 30 min until 2 hrs. On Zafirlukast day, the mean FEV1 at 90 min and the mean FVC at 90 min were significantly higher than the respective means at placebo day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>).</p><p>In a retrospective cohort study to determine the effects of long-term treatment with montelukast on patients with moderate to severe COPD, a significant improvement was observed in complaints of shortness of breath, sputum production, wheezing and nocturnal symptoms during the observation period. In addition, there was a significant reduction in the number of visits to the emergency department, number of hospitalizations and duration of hospitalizations for acute exacerbations of COPD but no significant changes in FEV1 (% predicted), FEV1/FVC ratio (% predicted) and peak expiratory flow rate were found during this time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">13</xref>). In another study to investigate the short-term effects of montelukast in stable patients with moderate to severe COPD in a randomized, prospective, single-blind, and controlled study, a significant improvement found in vital capacity, FVC, FEV1, dyspnea score and quality of life. These results suggest that leukotriene-receptor antagonists may be taken into account when there is need for an additional anti-inflammatory treatment in COPD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">14</xref>).</p><p>This study was performed to evaluate the effect of Zafirlukast on lung function improvement in patients suffering from COPD. The study results showed that Zafirlukast has no bronchodilatory effect in COPD and did not confirm the hypothesis that Zafirlukast improves lung function in COPD, it seems that adding this drug may improve treatment such as those available as bronchodilators without more benefit. But we had many limitations in our study; one was the sample size. Because of methodological and financial reasons we had to use small sample size. The present study was an observation of a very short period of drug impact but it is possible that if we extend duration of study, the result could have been different.</p><p>Nevertheless, larger samples are needed to verify the impact of leukoterien receptor antagonists on the improvement of lung function in COPD patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="S0009"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Results showed that Zafirlukast has no considerable bronchodilatory effect in COPD. Our results showed that Zafirlukast had no considerable bronchodilatory effect in COPD except for FEV1/FVC. Demonstrated effects of Zafirlukast were mostly observed in asthma; and its results in COPD are still controversial. There are a few studies that show Zafirlukast has bronchodilator effect in COPD and cysteinyl leukotrienes might contribute to the bronchospasm in the patients. Present study consisted of a very short treatment period and it is possible that the extension of this period could possibly have more effects. Additional studies are needed to verify the impact of leukoterien receptor antagonists on improving the lung function in COPD patients. In conclusion the present study did not confirm the hypothesis that Zafirlukast causes improvement in lung function in COPD patients. Although several studies have shown that Zafirlukast may improve lung function in COPD, however, our study suggests that Zafirlukast has no bronchodilatory effect in COPD.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><collab>Strategy for the diagnosis, management, and
