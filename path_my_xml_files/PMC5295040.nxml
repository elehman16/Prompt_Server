statistical analyses performed on the measurements obtained from the samples in each group. As the novel model of translational
healthcare, which integrates translational research and translational effectiveness, becomes increasingly established in modern
contemporary medicine, healthcare continues to evolve into a model of care that is evidence-based, effectiveness-focused and patientcentered.
Patient-centered care requires the timely and critical development and validation of a new research paradigm, which is referred
to as &#x0201c;individual patient research (IPR)&#x0201d;, as opposed as the customary group research approach. That is to say, research in geriatric disease
conditions, such as Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease (AD) must be performed from the viewpoint of individual patient research outcomes, and
individual patient data analysis. Here, we discuss IPR in patients with AD in the context of the best available research evidence that
indicates psychological symptoms, endocrine deregulation, and immune alterations in AD. We propose a clinical adaptive cluster
randomized stepped wedge blinded controlled trial, with sequential with sequential roll-out of an evidence-based intervention in a
crossover paradigm.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Individual patient research (IPR)</kwd><kwd>Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD)</kwd><kwd>hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis (HPA)</kwd><kwd>cell mediated immunity (CMI)</kwd><kwd>psychoneuroimmunology</kwd><kwd>comparative effectiveness research (CER)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Background</title><p>The Affordable Care Act, passed by Congress and signed into law
by President Obama on March 23, 2010, and further upheld by the
US Supreme Court on June 28, 2012 is the health care law of the
land: It has, over the past 6 years, proffered many benefits to
millions of Americans. But, it is by no means perfect, and in fact has
carried forward hardship to another significant segment of the US
population. Whereas, it demands additional concerted work
toward its improvement, it, overall, has transformed the views of
the scientific community about how healthcare research and
delivery should be brought forth. The concerted forces that led to
this legislation included a trend toward &#x0201c;translational research&#x0201d;.
Originally in the early 1990&#x02019;s, the term indicated work that spanned
across (i.e., that &#x0201c;translated across&#x0201d;) different types of medical
fields, from immunology to neurosciences, such as for example,
&#x0201c;psychoneuroimmunology&#x0201d; [<xref rid="R01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], which defines and characterizes the
intertwined cross-regulatory processes among the
psychoneuroendocrine and the immune systems.</p><p>The term then evolved into a bidirectional continuum by which
biopsies obtained from the patient are studied and characterized in
the laboratory, and the elucidation of the fundamental biology and
pathological mechanisms thus elucidated are communicated back to
the clinical for prompt intervention directly on the patient who
provided the biopsy. Thus, translational research by its very nature
is patient-centered. Research in the health sciences has produced a
plethora of new knowledge about disease processes and a vast
armamentarium of possible interventions for any. It thus has
become increasingly prohibitive for clinicians to determine which
intervention might be best for a given patient. Thence [<xref rid="R02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] emerged
evidence-based medicine, and the current conceptualization of
translational effectiveness, as the product of research synthesis and 
comparative effectiveness research for documenting, in the form of
systematic reviews that report the consensus of best evidence base
(BEB) for ensuring cost- and benefit effectiveness [<xref rid="R03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Contemporary translational science for healthcare consists of a
continuum from translational research (T1) &#x02013; the transfer of
knowledge from basic research to the clinical domain &#x02013; to
translational effectiveness (T2) &#x02013; the identification and
dissemination of BEB to practice settings and communities of
stakeholders. Translational healthcare strengthens the array of
knowledge available for academicians, the integration of multiple
fields of biomedicine, and the drive toward bettering IPR, and
simultaneously optimizes patient-clinician communication and
patient-care delivery. T1 and T2 together optimize evidence-based,
effectiveness-focused and patient-centered care, as articulated in the
Affordable Care Act-2010.</p><p>Patient-centered care tailors healthcare in an articulated manner
that requires patient-centered outcomes of research and evaluation.
To encourage patient centered research in healthcare, and as a direct
product of the Affordable Care Act-2010, the Patient-Centered
Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) was established. PCORI sets
the methodological standards and guidelines in patient-centered
outcomes research (i.e., individual patient research, IPR), prioritizes
patient-centered outcomes research questions, obtains and
disseminates BEB consensus, and responds to specific critiques,
input and suggestions from the stakeholders. In the context of
geriatric research, we propose here the hypothesis that timely and
critical new information about the pathological spectrum that
afflicts patients with AD systemically can be obtained using the IPR
paradigm.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="s2a"><title>IPR Protocol:</title><p>Psychological symptoms of agitation, aggression and anxiety, and
endocrine deregulation, including the hypothalamus-pituitaryadrenal
(HPA), characterize patients with AD, as well as alterations
in cell-mediated immune (CMI) surveillance [<xref rid="R05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
<xref rid="R07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
<xref rid="R09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The crossregulation
between the psychoneuroendocrine and the immune
systems [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and specifically HPA-CMI interactions, have not
been investigated to date in patients with AD with clinically
relevant psychological symptoms.</p><p>One possible avenue of psychoneuroimmune research in this
subgroup of patients with AD involves dynamic and static
challenges of the HPA axis, with IPR outcomes that include
pituitary and adrenocortical hormones as well as certain CMI
functional and phenotypic responses. For example in a repeated
measures experimental design, subjects will act as their own
controls. The dynamic challenge of the HPA axis will involve
intravenous administration of ovine corticotropin releasing factor (1
ug/kg, i.v., 11:00 PM). The static challenge of the HPA axis will
simply result from oral administration of the synthetic
glucocorticoid dexamethasone (5 mg, PO, 11:00 PM).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>IPR Outcome Measures:</title><p>IPR outcome measures can be salivary and plasma cortisol, plasma
adrenocorticotropin hormone, and plasma and salivary cytokines
levels (e.g., interleukin-6). Certain CMI functional responses can be
tested in vitro with isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(e.g., stimulation with phytohemagglutinin - 5 ug/ml, 72h - for T
cells, or with lipopysaccharide - 5 ug/ml, 72h - for myeloid cells), as
well as the distribution of lymphocyte subpopulations by dual- or
tri-color flow cytometry (e.g., na&#x000ef;ve [CD45RA+CD4+] vs. memory T
cells [CD45RO+CD4+]) [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>To ensure effectiveness, which includes lowering risk and prompt
management of side-effects, the study must be performed in the
context of a clinical research center Corticotropin releasing factor
can lead to dizziness, fainting, nausea, vomiting, flushing, slight
fever, or slight unease. No side effects result from dexamethasone,
except some queasiness.</p><p>Expectations are that HPA-CMI alterations will be most evident in
AD patients with psychological symptomatology. Therefore, stress
and anxiety state of each patient should be monitored by the State-
Trait Anxiety Inventory [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. 
The Stroop [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] test for executive
functions [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] is not per se a measure anxiety, but performance on
the Stroop is impacted by anxiety. The Stroop quantifies the
patients' difference in selective attention capacity and skills, and
their processing speed ability. It provides a neuro-psychological
glimpse on the patients' psycho-cognitive executive processing
function, and is informative for patients with certain neurological
abnormalities [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>IPR Data Analysis</title><p>Three baseline samples of peripheral venous blood and whole
saliva, obtained simply by presenting the subjects with a cut half
lemon, which triggers salivation, must be obtained in EDTA- and
protease inhibitors-coated tubes at the onset of the study (evening
of day 1). Repeated measures samples should be collected in the
same manner at 4:30 PM, 5:00 PM and 5:30 PM of day 2.</p><p>For each subjects, baseline measurements can be processed as
means + standard deviation. A difference, delta (D) is obtained at
each repeated measures time point. For example: salivary
interleukin-6 data would be rendered for each patient as D1,
corresponding to its level at the 4:30 PM time point minus the mean
level obtained at baseline, D2, corresponding to its level at the 5:00
PM time point minus the mean level obtained at baseline; and D3,
corresponding to its level at the 5:30 PM time point minus the mean
level obtained at baseline. The IPR data of the proposed study will
be summarized for each individual patient as the set of D1, D2, and
D3 for each HPA and each CMI repeated measures.</p><p>Analysis of these data will require repeated measure ANOVA, with
Newman-Keuls post-hoc comparisons and Bonferroni corrections
for comparative purposes. For predictive purposes integrating other 
patient characteristics in the model, such as stage of AD, anxiety
scores, Stroop scores, gender, age, etc., analysis will be performed
by hierarchical multiple regression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion:</title><p>The purpose of this hypothetical study is two-fold: (1) Firstly, it
serves as a model design, methodology and data analysis for
individual patient research in general, and specifically in patients
with AD; (2) Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, it can serve a
Proof of Concept or Proof of Mechanism project to establish the
psycho-neuro-endocrine-immuno-pathology of AD.</p><p>In that respect, the data produced by the hypothetical clinical
research described here can lay the foundations for an adaptive
cluster randomized stepped wedge blinded controlled trial [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>],
that will involve sequential roll-out of an evidence-based
intervention in a crossover paradigm. The different clusters (i.e.,
ambulatory clinics of a practice-based research network) will cross
over and switch treatments at different time points. The first time
point must yield baseline measurements for each patient
individually, as none of the clusters will be receiving the
experimental intervention. At subsequent time points, clusters will
switch over, following random ordering, and measurements would
be obtained from each patient and analyzed as above as D&#x02019;s. Within
each cluster, patients will be randomized, thus yielding a cluster
randomized stepped wedge blinded controlled trial. In a design
such as this, all patients eventually receive the intervention,
ensuring adequate power, equipoise as well as benefit- and costeffectiveness.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>In conclusion, similar to the adaptation and survival mechanism
nature has intended for the success of species, we must adapt and
evolve our clinical research tools from group statistics to individual
patient data analysis, as dictated by modern translational science -
the two pillars of which, translational research (T1) and
translational effectiveness (T2), and supported and dependents
upon dissemination of BEB and increased health literacy of patients,
clinicians, and stakeholders &#x02013;, and legislated the Affordable Care
Act-2010. In that vein, we provided here a hypothetical study that
exemplifies the culmination of translational science and IPR in the
context of pragmatic translational science in gerontology in general
and geriatric patients with AD in particular.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the Evidence-Based Decisions Active Groups of
