We sought to determine its impact on pain in computer workers with upper limb MSDs and visual discomfort.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a pilot cluster randomised trial in 2 different sites of a tyre factory in France. We randomised 200 employees to either an intervention group (I-Preventive) or control group, each comprising symptomatic and asymptomatic employees. The workers were followed up for 5&#x02005;months. The main outcome was overall recovery from symptoms following 1&#x02005;month's intervention based on Nordic-style and eyestrain questionnaires.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We included 185/200 workers: 96 in the intervention group (mean age 41.8&#x000b1;1.4&#x02005;years; 88.5% males) and 79 in the control group (mean age 42.9&#x000b1;12.0&#x02005;years; 94.5% males). The most painful areas (numerical scale &#x02265;2) were the neck (40.0%), upper back (18.8%) and shoulders (15.7%). For the most painful anatomical area, the Nordic score significantly decreased after 1&#x02005;month in the intervention group (p=0.038); no change was observed in the control group (p=0.59). After 1&#x02005;month's use, the intervention group reported less pain in the painful area and less visual discomfort symptoms (p=0.02). Adherence to the I-Preventive program was 60%.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>I-Preventive is effective in the short term on musculoskeletal symptoms and visual discomfort by promoting active breaks and eyestrain treatment.

MSD is a broad term encompassing a range of degenerative, dysfunctional and inflammatory conditions affecting the musculoskeletal system.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> These heterogeneous definitions can make drawing comparisons between studies difficult. Although the prevalence rates of MSD vary widely depending on the body part considered and tools used for symptom assessment, they can exceed 30%.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> When considering a global approach, multisite symptoms were predominant (33&#x02013;66% of workers) over those strictly confined to a specific anatomical site (15&#x02013;30% of workers).<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>The major risk factors for MSD are repetitive movements, high muscular strength demands, awkward or extreme positions, rapid work pace, extreme temperatures, insufficient recovery time, mechanical pressure and segmental vibrations.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Additional workplace-related risk factors include psychosocial factors, such as high demands and low decision latitude.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In particular, MSDs are the most prevalent disorders among sedentary workers, especially those using visual display units (VDUs).<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The most frequent musculoskeletal symptoms occur in the neck and shoulder area, with a prevalence of up to 62% reported in VDU workers.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Musculoskeletal symptoms of VDU users have multifactorial aetiologies, such as non-neutral wrist, arm and neck postures, workstation design and duration of VDU exposure, as well as perceived job strain with low decision latitude and high workload.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Long-duration computer work without breaks has also been related to eye injury, as duration of mouse use has been to neck and upper extremity symptoms.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>We are therefore convinced that appropriate MSD-preventive tools for VDU workers are urgently required. These tools must be clinically evaluated by providing evidence-based medical data. Interventions aimed at reducing MSDs in VDU workers should be aimed at both physical/ergonomic and organisational/psychosocial work factors, and must be supported by managers in order to ensure worker adhesion to the intervention.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The majority of strategies have focused on new workstation design,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> yet their effectiveness remains highly questionable. Strategies could be more effective if they were to implement changes in the temporal pattern of the work task, such as supplementary rest breaks allowing for periods of recovery from the monotonous load.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The effect of exercise on MSD symptoms has recently been demonstrated in workers.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In addition to exercise, rest breaks, and especially frequent &#x02018;microbreak&#x02019;,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> have been shown to reduce discomfort, eyestrain, fatigue and mood disturbances, in addition to improving keystroke speed and accuracy. Some software programs were built to promote frequent breaks at work for VDU users. These breaks can be active, with stretching exercises during working days. However, only very few tools were evaluated with a high level of proof (Wellnomics Breaks).<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Within a large French tyre factory, a taskforce was convened including physicians, nurses, prevention engineers and a sports teacher, aiming to evaluate an online tool called &#x02018;I-Preventive&#x02019;, which promotes active breaks with stretching exercises.</p><p>Our principal aim was thus to estimate the effects of I-Preventive on MSDs and visual discomfort.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design</title><p>A pilot cluster randomised trial was proposed within a tyre factory in France. This study aimed to measure the impact of I-Preventive on MSD symptoms and therefore define the optimal effect sizes for calculating the sample size required for a larger cluster-randomised controlled trial. As we did not focus on a putative cluster effect, in order to maintain a suitable methodology, an independent statistician conducted the randomisation of four participating departments using table random. The workers were randomised into an intervention group (I-Preventive) and control group, with each containing participants with MSDs. Workers located on the same floor or in the same building were assigned to the same group in order to avoid contamination bias, to maintain blinding and enhance adherence to the program within the intervention group, as well as to implement the study in a regular work environment. Researchers were composed of two occupational physicians (CL and GG). GG was in charge of selection and inclusion. CL was in charge of the data treatment under blind conditions to the treatment group. This study was conducted from June to October 2014. Measurements were made with repeated data requests. All employees corresponding to the inclusion criteria received a summary of the study, which was considered a non-opposition form. This non-pharmacological trial was designed in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement (CONSORT).<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participants</title><p>The participating workers were recruited from a potential 200 employees of the research departments. The inclusion criteria required participants to be employees aged 18&#x02013;65&#x02005;years, completing at least 5&#x02005;hours of VDU work per day, receiving no treatment for rheumatic or neurological diseases, undergoing no changes in VDU/workstation apparatus, having taken no sick leave in the previous month, and exhibiting no behavioural/learning disorders. Only administrative staff and no blue-collar workers were thus included.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Intervention</title><p>Workers in the intervention group received an activation code to download the software program (I-Preventive, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.i-prentive.com">http://www.i-prentive.com</ext-link>) on their VDU. I-Preventive promoted active breaks via an individualised computer application. It allowed workers to focus on body regions of their choice, offering high flexibility. After selecting the body part, I-Preventive asked about symptoms and suggested appropriate exercises. Workers could follow the suggested personalised exercises or use the random mode. At regular intervals, a visual signal on the screen prompted VDU workers to take active breaks. The visual signal described short individualised exercises of no more than 1&#x000bd;&#x02005;min. The exercises were easy to perform and most could be carried out while seated without needing specific equipment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016011304F1">figure 1</xref>). The following steps for the use of I-Preventive were:

They are stimulated to perform physical exercises (lasting 30&#x02005;s to 1&#x000bd;&#x02005;min each) at the start of each rest break. Users can programme one to four active breaks daily.</p></list-item></list></p><fig id="BMJOPEN2016011304F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Example of an exercise presented on the screen during a prompted rest break (from I-Preventive).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2016011304f01"/></fig><p>During the remaining period of the rest break, the computer was not blocked, and the participants could delay active break later by clicking on the button &#x000ab;later&#x000bb;. Generally, workers postponed breaks when they were in meetings, on average, once or twice a day. The software offered worksheets that could be downloaded, printed at the workplace and used as information tools. These worksheets were composed of physical exercises for each body part. Then employees could realise exercises out of daily breaks proposed by the computer and out of the office. The intervention lasted 4&#x02005;months.</p><p>The control group received usual healthcare with the occupational physician.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Baseline assessments</title><p>All participants (intervention and control groups) completed the same questionnaires.</p><p>MSDs were evaluated by the Nordic-style questionnaire, validated in 2007 as a useful tool for monitoring work-related MSDs, especially if respondents included a numerical rating scale pertaining to symptom severity.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> It is derived from the original Nordic questionnaire published in 1987 that was then translated into French in 1994.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The Nordic questionnaire included a numerical pain scale ranging from 0 to 10 for each anatomical region.</p><p><italic>Eyestrain</italic> assessment covered various symptoms like headache, blurred vision or eye stinging, by means of a horizontal numerical scale from 0 to 10,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> commonly used by the French National Institute of Research and Prevention (INRS).</p><p><italic>Global psychological status</italic> was evaluated on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD).<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The HAD is a 14-item self-report measure that was specifically developed to assess anxiety and depression. It is considered to be an effective means of screening for anxiety and depression and is widely used. It has two subscales, one assessing anxiety (HAD-A) and the other assessing depression (HAD-D). The scores for each subscale range from 0 to 21. Psychosocial work characteristics were measured using a horizontal visual analogue scale (VAS) for both stress<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>

Sample size has been estimated according to Cohen's recommendations<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> which have defined effect-size bounds as: small (ES: 0.2), medium (ES: 0.5) and large (ES: 0.8, &#x02018;grossly perceptible and therefore large&#x02019;). We calculated that 64 workers per group would enable an effect size equal to 0.5 for a type I error &#x003b1;=0.05 (two-tailed) and statistical power of 80%, which corresponds to a minimal difference in terms of primary end point Nordic score equals 1.5 points (for an SD at 3).</p><p>Considering possible loss to follow-up (rate fixed at 25%), we finally chose to include a minimum of 80 VDU workers per group. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata software, V.13 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA). The tests were two-sided, with a type I error set at &#x003b1;=0.05. Baseline characteristics were presented as mean&#x000b1;SE or median (IQR) according to statistical distribution for continuous data, and the number of workers and associated percentages for categorical parameters. Comparisons among independent groups (workers accessing I-Preventive or not) were performed by Student's t-test, or by the Mann-Whitney U test if t-test conditions could not be respected (homoscedasticity analysed by the Fisher-Snedecor distribution). Comparisons between qualitative parameters of the independent groups were performed by &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test or, if necessary, Fisher's exact test. For the evolution of the longitudinal Nordic study (and visual discomfort score), mixed models (the linear models for the Nordic score considered a quantitative or generalised linear for the proportion of VDU workers with Nordic scores above a given threshold, in line with the literature<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) were proposed in order to take into account the difference between and within individual variability (random effect) while studying the fixed group effects, time and interaction. The normality of residuals was assessed and gender, age, site, and original pain or discomfort were studied in previous models as covariates (fixed effects). Workers' frequency of I-Preventive use (before or after holidays) was also recorded, particularly in the context of a specific intragroup analysis of workers who had access to the I-Preventive software. Finally, this was complemented by analyses that were situation-matched to the parameters collected at only two time points (M0 and M4 for HAD, with the usual tests applied: Student's paired t-test or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for quantitative parameters and the Stuart-Maxwell test for categorical variables.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Participants</title><p>Among the 200 employees invited, 185 (93%) agreed to participate.

However, when these specific interventions were included in a combined approach, they became more effective.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Physical activity interventions at the workplace demonstrated benefits on computer worker MSDs, consisting of either 20&#x02013;30&#x02005;min training sessions two or three times a week<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> or short daily active breaks,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> in addition to either stretching and joint mobilisation exercises or strength training and dynamic endurance training.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> These studies involved a coach or physical therapist to motivate the participants.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Training sessions appear to have more pronounced long-term effects than short daily active breaks, in accordance with our study findings.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The I-Preventive software program is particularly effective at 1&#x02005;month but has no long-term effects. Conflicting results reported in the literature could be explained by the high risk of bias from the studies due to an unknown random allocation procedure, as well as insufficient motivation to exercise or lack of intention-to-treat analyses.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> The novelty of the I-Preventive strategy is its implementation of frequent short daily active breaks promoted by a software program.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>A novel digital tool for the prevention of MSD</title><p>Computer usage and sedentary behaviour at the workplace has increased dramatically over the past decade.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Office workers thus remain in the same posture for longer, accompanied by long periods of keyboard usage, which can cause and aggravate MSDs. Paradoxically, several software programs have been implemented to promote exercise at the workplace and reduce MSD. Despite the promotion of exercise through software, however, programs have been largely developed for chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> and these digital strategies were rarely implemented at the workplace for health outcomes in general<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> and especially not for preventing MSD.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> As for the use of a computerised decision support system for primary and secondary prevention of work-related MSD disability, only one study tried to improve MSD prevention by analysing the ergonomic process through self-reported questionnaires from a software tool.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Moreover, only two studies used a software program to specifically reduce MSD. The results from the short-term pilot study conducted on a low sample size supported the theory that this type of exercise reminder software programs may help to reduce perceived pain among office workers.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> In accordance with our findings, the use of a software program encouraging workers to take regular breaks has been reported elsewhere to contribute to perceived recovery from neck and upper limb symptoms.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Nevertheless, our study was not designed to assess the specificity of breaks or exercise in MSD prevention,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and long-term studies involving more participants should now be conducted so as to describe the effects of these programs and underlying mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>General health effects of our intervention</title><p>Overall, the neck, shoulders, and upper and lower back were the most affected regions among our computer users, in line with the literature.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Moreover, computer-related visual and ocular symptoms are the most frequently occurring health problems in people who spend a large proportion of their working day looking at a computer screen.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Given the high prevalence of these symptoms,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> it is likely that all VDU workers will at some point need eye examinations in order to assess symptoms associated with VDU use.

One could argue that the inclusion number was low, yet the sample size was relatively large compared with other pilot studies, and the percentage of participants who agreed to participate was exceptional (&#x0003e;90%),<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> with none lost to follow-up. This good representation of computer workers thus reduced potential bias and allowed us to generalise results for other services. The protocol was carried out in a high-demand working environment, and thus may easily be translated to other areas. Also, the decreasing adherence throughout the study could have been caused by the summer holidays falling between M1 and M2, or a decrease in job demand for those who did not go on holiday, which may have lowered the impact of our intervention on MSD. In addition, some found it impossible to adapt active breaks to their specific working schedules, which, along with software defects, also most likely contributed to the decreasing adherence. Finally, the software was not designed to evaluate the objective measure of adherence to the program, such as the number of connections or amount of time spent on the tool. Furthermore, physical symptoms were not clinically assessed by a physician; however, subjective scales have been validated and are commonly used both in routine practice and research.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Future studies should comprise objective measures of physical performance and effectiveness at work in order to establish cost-effectiveness benefits based on economic analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our pilot feasibility study demonstrated the potential of active breaks for preventing MSDs and ocular symptoms.
