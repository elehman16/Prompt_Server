The present clinical trial was carried out on 135 people, divided into three groups of 45 patients.</p><p>The participants were in the age range of 18&#x02013;65 years, with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I&#x02013;II (ASA I: Normal healthy patient, ASA II: Patient with mild systemic disease; no functional limitation) and were a candidate for elective lower abdominal surgery under spinal anesthesia.</p><p>On arrival to the operating room all patients had a wide bore 18 G intravenous (IV) catheter, patients had one blood pressure and heart rate (HR) reading record, while lying comfortable in the bed in supine position before induction of spinal block.</p><p>Monitoring was standard and included non-invasive blood pressure, continuous electrocardiography, and pulse oximetry.</p><p>The participants were randomly allocated to one of three groups (with 45 patients in each group, respectively) using sealed envelopes that contained a computer-generated randomization code.</p><p>The sample size was estimated based on a power calculation, which showed that at least 42 patients per group were necessary to achieve 80% power to detect a 20% difference between the groups. We recruited 45 patients per group to compensate for any exclusion. Patients were excluded from the study if any changes in anesthesia plan and also surgical plan were needed.</p><p>One of the investigators who was not related to data collection, monitoring, or conduct of anesthesia, prepared ephedrine (2.5 mg/mL), or phenylephrine (25 mcg/mL), or placebo in a 2 mL syringe as per randomization number. The patients were preloaded with 10 mL/kg of crystalloid (Ringer Lactate) before the induction of spinal anesthesia. Patients received Ringer Lactate at a rate of 10 mL/kg/h during the procedure.</p><p>Subarachnoid block was performed with all patients in the sitting position. After skin preparation and infiltration with 2% Lidocaine, a 23 G Quincke&#x02019;s needle was inserted at L3&#x02013;L4 vertebral interspace and once free flow of cerebrospinal fluid was obtained, 3 mL of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% (15 mg) was injected intrathecally. Patients were then immediately turned supine.</p><p>Immediately following spinal block, patients received a 1 mL bolus of the study drug (ephedrine = 2.5 mg or phenyephrine 25 mcg or placebo) and thereafter another 5 mg bolus dose of ephedrine if the blood pressure dropped 10% below the baseline and repeated as necessary.</p><p>The block height was assessed by response to cold sensation using alcohol swab and also bilateral loss of pinprick discrimination every 3 min until maximum block was achieved. Surgery was started as soon as upper level of sensory block reached T8.</p><p>Oxygen 8 L/min was administered via a simple facemask throughout the operation. SBP, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), MAP, and HR was measured at 5-min intervals beginning immediately after spinal injection until 30 min and then at 15 min intervals thereafter until the end of the surgery.</p><p>Bradycardia (HR less than 60 beats/min) if associated with hypotension was treated with 0.5 mg IV atropine. A backup plan was designed anticipating some critical events. These situations allowed the anesthesiologists to adopt any measure to manage all events.</p><p>The data were recorded by the anesthetist conducting the spinal anesthesia. Nausea and vomiting were scored on a scale of 0-2 (0 = none, 1 = nausea without vomiting, 2 = vomiting). The maximum nausea and vomiting score during the operation and also in 2, 6, and 24 postoperatively were noted. At the end of operation the total dose of vasopressor was noted.</p><p>The primary outcome of the study was defined as the incidence of hypotension. Secondary outcomes included changes in blood pressure and HR, the incidence of bradycardia (HR &#x0003c;60 bpm), spinal injection to hypotension interval, amount of rescue ephedrine administered, nausea, and vomiting.</p><p>If the severity of nausea, as reported by patients, was assessed by anesthetist nurse who was unaware of the study on operation bed and also in recovery room by 100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and defined as severe if exceeded 30 mm. In case of vomiting or severe nausea, during operation or in recovery room, metoclopramide (0.15 mg/kg body weight, IV) were administered. SBP, DBP, HR and O<sub>2</sub> saturation of patients were recorded at the admission to operating room (baseline), immediately after anesthesia (displayed as time 0), every 5&#x02013;30 min and then every 15 min till 60 min and then at 2, 6, and 24 h after spinal injection. Time interval between the spinal injection and the occurrence of hypotension, prolongation of hypotension, and the amount of rescue ephedrine administered were recorded.</p><p>Statistical analysis was done using SPSS software (version 20). Data were presented as mean &#x000b1; SD unless mentioned otherwise. Analysis of mean fall of SBP in each groups were done by an independent sample <italic>t</italic> test. Demographic data (mean &#x000b1; SD) were compared between three groups by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. Outcome measures were compared by number needed to treat (NNT), proportion, and Chi-square tests as required. For all quantitative characteristics 95% confidence intervals were given.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 135 patients selected for this study and were randomly divided into three groups of 45 patients each.

Although fluid preloading is frequently employed in an attempt to prevent post&#x02013;spinal hypotension, vasopressors are often required and have been shown to be more effective at limiting this complication than other treatment. There is an abundance of evidence to suggest that phenylephrine is as good as ephedrine for maintaining blood pressure and a more liberal use of this drug is justified. A dose&#x02013;response study to find equipotent dose of the two vasopressors is required. Further work is required to determine the optimal therapy for prevention of hypotension during spinal anesthesia, especially in high-risk patients.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We express our gratitude to all those who gave us the possibility to complete this research.
