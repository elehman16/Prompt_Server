This study aimed to evaluate if providing additional rehabilitation on a Saturday was cost effective at 12&#x000a0;months, from a health system perspective inclusive of private costs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Cost effectiveness analyses alongside a single-blinded randomized controlled trial with 12&#x000a0;months follow up inclusive of informal care. Participants were adults admitted to two publicly funded inpatient rehabilitation facilities. The control group received usual care rehabilitation services from Monday to Friday and the intervention group received usual care plus additional Saturday rehabilitation. Incremental cost effectiveness ratios were reported as cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained and for a minimal clinical important difference (MCID) in functional independence.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 996 patients [mean age 74&#x000a0;years (SD 13)] were randomly assigned to the intervention (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;496) or control group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;500). The intervention was associated with improvements in QALY and MCID in function, as well as a non-significant reduction in cost from admission to 12&#x000a0;months (mean difference (MD) AUD$6,325; 95% CI &#x02212;4,081 to 16,730; <italic>t</italic> test <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.23 and <italic>MWU p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.06), and a significant reduction in cost from admission to 6&#x000a0;months (MD AUD$6,445; 95% CI 3,368 to 9,522; <italic>t test p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04 and <italic>MWU p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01).

Rehabilitation services are available across a variety of settings including acute hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation facilities or in the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. There is emerging evidence of short term clinical and economic gains for the provision of additional weekend rehabilitation services for inpatients including likely cost savings associated with a reduction in hospital length of stay, as well as higher functional status and improved quality of life on discharge from rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>There is an important distinction between achieving short term gains following an intervention and sustaining these gains over the medium and longer term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The success of rehabilitation may initially focus on the point of discharge from the rehabilitation program, but there is also value in evaluating the sustainability of this success. Measuring success for inpatient rehabilitation may include reporting gains in functional status or quality of life using specific outcome measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], or it may take a broader view that reports the ability to return to the community, participate in the workforce and resume usual societal roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. No matter the viewpoint, sustainability of the intervention is an important consideration to measuring the success of inpatient rehabilitation.</p><p>Another consideration in measuring the success and sustainability of rehabilitation is understanding the resource impact on the health system and the broader community beyond discharge from the rehabilitation facility. In the 12&#x000a0;months following discharge from rehabilitation, patients have a high rate of health care and community resource use, such as readmission to inpatient health services, visits to allied health professionals, and the use of informal care which can increase the burden on the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. An economic evaluation limited to the perspective of the inpatient rehabilitation facility will miss the ongoing health and community resources utilized once the patient has been discharged to the community. Taking a broader health system perspective inclusive of private costs and a longer follow up period will capture these additional resources.</p><p>Providing additional Saturday rehabilitation is likely to be cost saving per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained and for a minimal clinical important difference (MCID) in functional independence from the perspective of the individual health service including the 30&#x000a0;day period following discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, the resource impact on the broader health system is not known in the 12&#x000a0;month period following discharge and whether the cost and clinical outcome results favoring additional Saturday rehabilitation are sustained in the medium and longer term. The aim of this study was to determine from a health system perspective inclusive of private costs if the likely short-term cost effectiveness of providing an additional Saturday rehabilitation service to inpatients in addition to Monday to Friday compared to Monday to Friday rehabilitation alone, is sustained 12&#x000a0;months following discharge from rehabilitation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Research design and intervention</title><p>An economic evaluation alongside a randomized controlled trial from a health system perspective inclusive of private costs from admission until 12&#x000a0;months following discharge, was completed comparing usual care Monday to Friday rehabilitation to Monday to Saturday rehabilitation. Saturday rehabilitation consisted of a one hour scheduled Physiotherapy session and a one hour scheduled Occupational Therapy session. Full details of the protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], the clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and an economic evaluation of the clinical trial with a 30&#x000a0;day follow up period from the perspective of the health service [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] have been published elsewhere. The trial was registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12609000973213) prior to patient recruitment. This economic evaluation follows the recommendations of the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) Checklist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>The economic evaluation has taken a health system perspective inclusive of private costs. Out-of-pocket costs for access to medical, non-medical services and pharmaceuticals have been included in this analysis. Informal care was also included on the assumption that its availability meant that health system costs were reduced. For example, without the availability of informal care at discharge, length of stay may have increased, or patients may have been discharged with additional formal community-based health services. We do not consider this economic evaluation to be from a broader societal perspective as productivity changes have not been incorporated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants, recruitment and setting</title><p>Recruitment occurred from July 2010 until June 2011 and participants were included if they were 18&#x000a0;years or older and required acute inpatient rehabilitation at one of the two facilities participating in the trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The economic analysis included the initial rehabilitation admission and had a primary endpoint 12&#x000a0;months following discharge from rehabilitation, with an interim endpoint 6&#x000a0;months following discharge from rehabilitation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Administrative data</title><p>Administrative data were obtained from the primary health service for the initial rehabilitation admission and for any admission in the period 12 months following discharge.

In addition, data from Medicare for medical services and pharmaceuticals (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS)) were obtained for each consenting participant for the 12 months following discharge (Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

The questionnaire was completed for participants at 6 and 12 months following discharge from rehabilitation, administered by assessors blinded to group allocation. Participants reported admissions and length of stay of acute or rehabilitation hospital admissions in facilities outside of the primary health service, as well as primary care. There were no double counting of Medicare and primary health service data in the self-reported health service utilization data because the self-reported data were checked against both the Medicare and primary health service data. Where we had recorded the same services, these were removed from the self-reported data. For example, General Practitioner community visits were reported in both the self-reported and Medicare data, hence they were removed from the self-reported data prior to the final analyses. The number and type of non-Medicare health care visits, over-the-counter medications and the assistance of carers were also collected. Carers included community paid carers (for example a patient care attendant) and informal unpaid carers (for example a family member).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Costing method</title><p>All costs were reported as 2012/2013 Australian dollars (AUD$) (international currency conversion available <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/#converter">http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/#converter</ext-link> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]). Administrative cost data collected for the primary health service, Medicare and PBS covered three financial years. Inflation rates of 3.7% and 7.2% respectively, were applied to the 2010/2011 and 2011/2012 data consistent with the health care inflation rate of the national Consumer Price Index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Self-reported health service utilization costs for hospital admissions outside of the primary health service were calculated as an average cost per day, based on data from the primary health service for acute and rehabilitation admissions in 2012/2013. Out-of-pocket costs were included in the charges reported in the Medicare data for medical and non-medical services and pharmaceuticals. The cost of non-Medicare health care services was based on charges for community allied health services from the Victorian Transport Accident Commission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Over-the-counter medications were costed according to the actual drug used (Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Informal (unpaid) care was costed using the total hours reported by patients multiplied by the hourly rate for a community health care attendant, to represent the true resource cost of an equivalent formal health care professional.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Clinical outcomes measures</title><p>The EuroQol (EQ-5D-3L) questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] was used to measure patient health related quality of life and was reported as a utility index score. A MCID in quality of life was based on the recommendation to use half a standard deviation of the baseline score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Applied to the quality of life utility index score in this study, an increase of 0.18 represented a MCID in quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Functional independence was measured using the FIM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] administered by credentialed assessors. An increase in the FIM score of 22 points (scores range from 18, lowest function, to 126, highest function) was considered to be a MCID in functional independence based on previous literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Both outcome measures were administered on admission (baseline) and 6 and 12&#x000a0;months following discharge from rehabilitation by assessors blind to group allocation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Mean cost difference was determined between the two groups using an independent <italic>t</italic>-test at 6&#x000a0;months and at 12&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Cost data in an economic evaluation is typically positively skewed and this is often due to a small number of patients with high costs, although with samples of greater than 150 participants it is reported that the <italic>t</italic>-test is generally robust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. To acknowledge the potential for skewed cost data, we have presented the mean, SD and range for all cost data, as well as the <italic>p</italic>-value for the <italic>t</italic>-test and the non-parametric equivalent, the Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test for total costs at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months. Between group differences in the quality of life utility score and the functional independence score were calculated with analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) using the baseline score as covariate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. To further address the potential for a skewed distribution of costs and outcomes, relative risks (RRs) were used to calculate the proportion of participants achieving a MCID in the quality of life utility score and the functional independence score at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months following discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Analysis was completed using intention-to-treat principles. Missing clinical outcome data and resource use (due to non-consent for the release of Medicare and PBS data or failure to complete the health utilization questionnaire at 6 or 12&#x000a0;months) were managed using a multiple imputation method via chained equations imputation generating 5 imputed datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Where participants had died (confirmed by the next of kin at the 6 or 12&#x000a0;month survey), they were included in the analyses, with total costs weighted by time in the study. As the exact date of death was unknown, the last date of service from the Medicare data was used as a proxy. For example, if a death was confirmed at the 12&#x000a0;month survey, and the last Medicare service was at 9&#x000a0;months, it was assumed that the person participated in 75% of the follow up period, and costs were weighted at .75. Incident rate ratios (IRR) were analysed for each of the resources in the follow up period to report the difference in event rate between the control and intervention groups.</p><p>Incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and their associated confidence intervals (CIs) for quality of life utility and functional independence scores were calculated at the sample level using the bootstrap method (5000 repetitions) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Individual ICERs were used to generate confidence ellipses and cost effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs), using the central limit theorem, to illustrate cost effectiveness across a range of willingness-to-pay values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The use of either the central limit theorem or the bootstrapping method is appropriate to obtain uncertainty around the mean difference when there is a moderate to large sample size (n&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;50), even when data are highly skewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. While the ellipses provide important information relating to the statistical significance of the intervention under review, the CEACs allow comparison between different interventions. The ICER for the quality of life utility score represents the cost per QALY gained. The ICER for a one point change in the functional independence score was multiplied to report the cost difference for a 22 point change in the functional independence score, representing the marginal cost for a MCID in functional independence.</p><p>Analyses were completed with IBM SPSS Statistics Version 21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], STATA Version 12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and the ICER, CI, CI ellipse and CEAC were completed with software in Microsoft Excel (spreadsheet available from Nixon RM, Wonderling D, Grieve RD. 2010) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. All statistical tests were conducted at a 5% level of significance and reported with 95% confidence intervals (CI) unless otherwise stated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Sensitivity analysis</title><p>A number of sensitivity analyses were performed on the total cost at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months. Two assumptions were made for informal care; the first was to reduce the self-reported amount by 50%, the second was to remove it altogether. Fifty percent meant that the hours were capped at 12&#x000a0;hours per day representative of a nursing shift. Removing informal care was to allow comparison with previous literature, where the inclusion of informal care is inconsistent, reported in less than 10% of cost utility analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>Data from the self-reported health service utilization questionnaire were adjusted to address the uncertainty of recall bias. To determine the direction and amount of adjustment, we compared community General Practitioner (GP) visits recorded in the Medicare administrative data to self-reported data for those participants who were alive at 12&#x000a0;months, had completed both the 6 and 12&#x000a0;month questionnaires and for whom we had 12&#x000a0;months of Medicare data. In addition, self-reported health service utilization data were removed so that only administrative data from the primary health service and Medicare were included, to account for unpredictable variability in self reporting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Statement of ethics approval</title><p>The study obtained ethics approval from Eastern Health Research and Ethics Committee (reference number E58 09/10) and La Trobe University Human Research Ethics Committee (reference number FHEC10/14), including participant consent to meet requirements for Medicare and PBS data.

This suggests under reporting of self-reported primary health care services. Based on these data, the number of self-reported health services utilized in the 12&#x000a0;months following discharge from rehabilitation was inflated by 15%.

An interpretation is that the quantity of inpatient rehabilitation does matter; for the patient population in our trial most functional gains occurred during the inpatient stay, with minimal gains following discharge. For example in the current trial, participants in the intervention group had significant gains in their FIM score from admission to discharge (26%), with lesser gains from discharge to 6 months (2%) and no change from 6 to 12 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These results support previous studies that report most functional gains occur in the initial rehabilitation period and after this functional status largely remains the same [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Health service resource and cost data that favored the intervention group were realized between admission and 6 months (p = 0.04) but not between 6 and 12 months following discharge.</p><p>During the initial inpatient rehabilitation admission there was a potential cost saving from a reduction in length of stay. However, this needs to be considered in the context of the direct additional costs to run a Saturday rehabilitation program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The additional resources required for a Saturday service include therapist time, space, equipment and consumable items. On average these additional resource costs for providing the additional Saturday rehabilitation service were less than $200 per admission, in comparison with the overall observed saving of over $1,600 per admission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This demonstrates that the additional costs of running the Saturday service were offset by a substantial saving over the duration of the rehabilitation admission.</p><p>From admission to 12&#x000a0;months following discharge most of the savings to the health system occurred from the reduction in hospital readmissions, with no significant differences in community care services, including medical services. There was no observed cost shift into the community; in fact there was an ongoing cost saving to the community that included reduced readmissions to the primary and other health services. A cost shift may involve reporting false &#x0201c;savings&#x0201d; based on redistributing the cost from one health service into the broader community health systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]; this would be evident if the intervention group had reduced health service utilization in the inpatient stay, but had higher health service utilization across any or all of the other health services in the 12&#x000a0;months following discharge. This was not the case. The intervention group had reduced health service utilization during their inpatient stay with ongoing reduced health service utilization in the 12&#x000a0;months following discharge. These results are consistent with other inpatient rehabilitation intervention studies that report that cost savings during the initial rehabilitation period are associated with a reduced length of stay, and with no cost shift following discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>Another example of cost shift is the reliance on informal care once the patient is discharged from the rehabilitation facility. That is, the cost of care is shifted from the health system into the household and it is frequently family and friends who provide the unpaid care. In addition to this being reported as a potential cost shift, there needs to be consideration of the burden that this may place on the household [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In Australia, it is estimated that the annual cost of replacing informal care with paid care is $4.8 billion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Despite this substantial cost to society, support for the inclusion of informal care in an economic evaluation, is not consistent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The scope of this economic evaluation included the utilization of informal care which represented 43% of the total costs. Sixteen percent of our participants had survived a stroke and the cost of informal care was within the range of costs reported by other studies with a stroke cohort where informal care represented 4% to 55% of the total costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Contributing to this variation could be different methods for costing informal care, such as allotting one-third the cost of the average national wage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], price equivalence to the cost of hostel care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the minimum wage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], the cost of a home help worker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] or our method of uncapped actual daily hours valued at that of an equivalent paid formal carer. The variation in including the cost of informal care, together with the variation of assumptions of costing of informal care, supported our sensitivity analyses that varied, and removed the cost of informal care. When the amount of informal care was reduced to zero, the observed difference in total cost at 12 months following discharge between the intervention and control groups was significant and in favor of the intervention group.</p><p>This economic evaluation has implications for both health service managers, and policy makers. The provision of an additional Saturday inpatient rehabilitation service provided benefits that reduced short term costs to the health service and reduced the medium term costs across the health system including a reduction in hospital readmissions that could potentially free up inpatient beds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In support of this, participants who received additional Saturday rehabilitation had a mean reduction of 4.9 days (95% CI &#x02212;9.0 to &#x02212;0.9; p = 0.02; IRR 0.71; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.96) in admission to hospital in the 12 months following discharge from rehabilitation compared with the control group. The implication is a win-win intervention for the health service, the health system and the patient. In Australia, health care is funded by the government at both national and state levels, as well as by private insurers. At the national level, primary health care is publically funded by Medicare and this includes community based health care services (e.g. a general practitioner or medical specialist), whereas the state government is responsible for the provision of public hospital services, such as the rehabilitation inpatient admissions included in this clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Funding for public hospital acute and rehabilitation services is via the Australian government and based on a single episode of care; as such readmissions that occur in the 12 month follow up period after the initial rehabilitation hospital episode in this clinical trial are funded as a separate episode of care. Therefore, under output based funding public hospitals have an incentive to discharge acute (including acute phase rehabilitation) patients as early as possible. This contrasts with the private system where private insurance funding may be a per diem amount or a fixed amount for the episode. Theoretically, as the results of our trial show a reduction in total cost, both public and private hospitals should be willing to implement weekend acute rehabilitation services. However, cost savings may be realised at the broader hospital level while the spending and staffing decisions may be realised at the department level, so without resource reallocation and collaboration, the provision of a weekend service may be difficult to implement.</p><p>The strengths of this economic evaluation are that it was completed alongside a blinded, fully powered randomized controlled trial and it used an appropriate alternative intervention, as only 30% of Australian rehabilitation inpatient health services offer a weekend physiotherapy service [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Other strengths included access to complete clinical cost data on all patients across the primary health service, Medicare and PBS administrative data as well as the inclusion of informal care. A range of rehabilitation diagnoses and patients with a language other than English as their first language were included in the trial representing a general rehabilitation population. A limitation of using a self-reported health service utilization tool is recall bias; however, the sensitivity analysis addressed this by varying the value of this self-reported data. The wide and uneven distribution of the CIs around the ICER are difficult to interpret [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], however they have been reported as the sample size is large [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and the non-parametric bootstrap method was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The CI ellipses for the ICERs show that most of the 75% and 95% CIs fall within the bottom right hand quadrant. This suggests that the intervention is dominant over the comparator of usual care. This study did not include the wider economic impact from a societal perspective including factors such as return to work, the costs of travel or the cost of nursing home placement. The impact on return to work for this study has been reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, we are confident that the results are generalizable across public acute phase inpatient rehabilitation settings. There were minor variations to the trial protocol. These included the use of multiple imputation rather than the carry forward technique for missing data, consistent with recent recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], as well as a reduced data collection period due to a higher than expected rate of participant recruitment. Future research may focus on translation research designed for successful and sustained implementation of this additional Saturday rehabilitation service.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>From a health system perspective inclusive of private costs and informal care, the provision of a rehabilitation service to inpatients on a Saturday in addition to Monday to Friday compared to Monday to Friday rehabilitation alone, is likely to have sustained cost savings per QALY gained and for a MCID in functional independence during the inpatient stay and up to 12&#x000a0;months following discharge from rehabilitation.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec21"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12913_2015_822_MOESM1_ESM.doc" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
