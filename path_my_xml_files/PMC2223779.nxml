Cure rates with surgery and radiotherapy are high, but these treatments have never been compared prospectively. A randomized trial was initiated in 1982 to compare surgery and radiotherapy in the treatment of primary BCC of the face measuring less than 4 cm. The primary end point was the failure rate (persistent or recurrent disease) after 4 years of follow-up. The secondary end point was the cosmetic results assessed by the patient, the dermatologist and three persons not involved in the trial. In the course of the trial, 347 patients were treated. Of the 174 patients in the surgery group, 71% had local anaesthesia and 91% frozen section examination. Of the 173 patients in the radiotherapy group, 55% were treated with interstitial brachytherapy, 33% with contactherapy and 12% with conventional radiotherapy. The 4-year actuarial failure rate (95% CI) was 0.7% (0.1-3.9%) in the surgery group compared with 7.5% (4.2-13.1%) in the radiotherapy group (log-rank P = 0.003). The cosmetic results assessed by four of the five judges were significantly better after surgery than after radiotherapy. Eighty-seven per cent of the surgery-treated patients and 69% of the radiation-treated patients considered the cosmetic result as good (P &#x0003c; 0.01). Thus, in the treatment of BCC of the face of less than 4 cm in diameter, surgery should be preferred to radiotherapy.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00165-0104.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="100" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00165-0105.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="101" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00165-0106.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="102" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00165-0107.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="103" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00165-0108.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="104" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00165-0109.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="105" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00165-0110.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="106" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
