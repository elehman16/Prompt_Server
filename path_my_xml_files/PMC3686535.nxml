The effects can vary from a minor inconvenience for most sufferers to rare sight-threatening complications in severe cases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-opth-7-995">5</xref> The International Dry Eye Workshop defined dry eye as a &#x0201c;multifactorial disease of the tears and ocular surface that results in symptoms of discomfort, visual disturbance, and tear film instability, with potential damage to the ocular surface. It is accompanied by increased osmolarity of the tear film and inflammation of the ocular surface.&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-opth-7-995">6</xref> Risk factors for dry eye syndrome include age older than 50 years, female sex, environments with low humidity, systemic medications, autoimmune disorders, extensive visual tasking, nutrition (poor intake of fatty acids omega 3, 6 and vitamins A, E), and contact lenses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-opth-7-995">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-opth-7-995">7</xref> Patients who suffer from dry eye experience varying levels of dryness, burning, photophobia, foreign body sensation, grittiness, and redness. Patients may or may not have signs that include rapid tear film breakup, increased osmolarity, and increased ocular surface staining.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-opth-7-995">8</xref></p><p>Various strategies are employed in the treatment and management of dry eye, including the topical use of lubricants (artificial tears or biological tear substitutes) and antiinflammatory therapies, systemic use of antioxidants (eg, omega-3 fatty acids), and control of external factors associated with increased ocular dryness (medications and environmental conditions).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-opth-7-995">8</xref> Current treatment is heavily weighted toward supplementation, stimulation, or preservation of aqueous tears.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-opth-7-995">5</xref></p><p>Artificial tears are one of the primary treatments for dry eye. This treatment is mainly palliative and focuses on reducing the symptoms of discomfort to improve quality of life for a patient.

Clinical assessments during baseline and the final visit consisted of intraocular pressure (with a calibrated Goldmann applanation tonometer), TBUT, Schirmer I test, indirect ophthalmoscopy under pharmacological mydriasis, OSDI, slit lamp examination (biomicroscopy), and fluorescein and green lissamine dyes.

To maintain masking, medications were bottled and provided in containers that appeared to be identical.

Significant advances have been made in treating the many facets of dry eye; current therapy focuses on restoring a normal ocular surface through tear supplementation as well as inhibition of the aberrant inflammation seen in chronic dry eye disease. Regardless of the etiology and severity of dry eye, artificial tears are the first line of treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-opth-7-995">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-opth-7-995">16</xref> Commercial artificial tears differ in electrolyte composition, thickening agents, physiologic buffering, tonicity, and preservatives.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-opth-7-995">5</xref></p><p>Studies in which treatments for dry eye have been compared show us that some have better efficacy than others. Although TBUT is the best screening test for dry eye disease &#x02013; and is more repeatable &#x02013; compared with other objective tests for dry eye,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-opth-7-995">9</xref> the OSDI has shown good reliability and validity for measuring the severity of dry eye disease and has been proposed as a valuable tool in clinical treatment trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-opth-7-995">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-opth-7-995">6</xref></p><p>There is no previous information about the clinical use of CS and XG in dry eye. Nevertheless, there are some studies in which other combinations have been compared. For example, Davitt et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-opth-7-995">8</xref> compared carboxymethylcellulose 0.5%, glycerin 0.9%, and compatible solutes with polyethylene glycol 400 0.4%, propylene glycol 0.3%, and hydroxypropyl guar. In this study, both groups reported a significant reduction in the mean scores for the ocular symptoms of dryness, gritty/sandy feeling, and burning. Ocular staining scores were lower in the polyethylene glycol 400 0.4%, propylene glycol 0.3%, and hydroxypropyl guar group at days 28 and 42. For TBUT there was no difference between treatments, but mean OSDI was significantly reduced in both groups.</p><p>A review by Benelli<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-opth-7-995">17</xref> concluded that a solution of polyethylene glycol 400 0.4%, propylene glycol 0.3%, and hydroxypropyl guar offers extended relief of dry eye symptoms and improvement of the signs associated with dry eye disease. In this review, this combination exhibits a superior profile in TBUT, extensional viscosity, coefficient of friction and lubrication, and conjunctival and/or corneal staining when compared with other marketed products.</p><p>Another study by Gensheimer et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-opth-7-995">18</xref> evaluated the effectiveness of glycerin 1% with a new excipient in extending TBUT compared with polyethylene glycol 400 0.4%, propylene glycol 0.3% and hydroxypropyl guar. In this study the formulation of glycerin 1% with the new excipient significantly extended TBUT.</p><p>Faraldi et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-opth-7-995">19</xref> investigated an ophthalmic gel containing sodium hyaluronate and XG for the management of posttraumatic corneal abrasions. In this study, the author demonstrated that sodium hyaluronate and XG are high-molecular-weight polysaccharides with water binding and mucoadhesivity properties, providing effective hydration and protection of the cornea.</p><p>The present study compared two ophthalmic solutions, one containing CS and XG and the other containing polyethylene glycol 400 0.4%, propylene glycol 0.3%, and hydroxypropyl guar. We demonstrated that the new combination (PRO-148) effectively reduced OSDI and is similar in regard to TBUT when compared with Systane<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>.</p><p>In this reduced population of patients with dry eye, both groups demonstrated a reduction of OSDI scores toward the normal range, with a slight difference favoring the test group.</p><p>The limitations of our study are that we only included a small number of patients with mild to moderate dry eye, and we did not conduct a crossover or internal control study. Larger studies with longer duration and employing different designs are warranted to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of this formulation in patients with dry eye disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Increasing TBUT is important in the treatment of dry eye disease because it can improve clinical signs and symptoms of dry eye disease and promote epithelial repair. The goal of topical therapy in dry eye is to relieve symptoms in conjunction with potentially replacing deficient components (eg, aqueous fluid) so that the tear film is thickened and stabilized in the short-term to provide healing of the ocular surface over time. The OSDI permits quantification of common symptoms and an objective approach to the evaluation of symptoms over time; therefore, OSDI reduction could indicate that treatment goals are achieved.</p><p>In the present study, the combination CS and XG was as effective in prolonging TBUT and was better at diminishing OSDI compared with polyethylene glycol 400 0.4%, propylene glycol 0.3%, and hydroxypropyl guar.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>This study was sponsored by Laboratorios Sophia, SA de CV.
