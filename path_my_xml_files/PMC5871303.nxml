The pilot study was a randomized crossover design including 26 adolescents randomized to Qigong or rest group. Participants received a 60-minute Qigong program consisted of warm up, deep breathing, imaginary, and a closing warm up. After 24-hour washout period, treatment assignments were switched. We collected before and after intervention using a self-administered questionnaire, which included the faces pain scale to assess expected and perceived pain during blood sugar testing and insulin injection and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. Only expected pain on insulin injection was significantly lower after intervention (<italic>P</italic> = .025). The results suggested that the devised static Qigong program was feasible intervention to decrease at least expected pain on insulin injection of adolescents with type 1 diabetes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>type 1 diabetes mellitus</kwd><kwd>qigong</kwd><kwd>needle pain</kwd><kwd>positive affect</kwd><kwd>negative affect</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1-2156587217722473"><funding-source id="funding1-2156587217722473"><institution-wrap><institution>Korean National Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="funding1-2156587217722473">2013R1A2A2A03015285</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Standard of care for type 1 diabetes includes intensive life-long insulin treatment involving insulin injection and blood sugar testing (BST). This process of injection and BST is an unpleasant experience and causes significant trauma to patients,<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2156587217722473" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> particularly in children and adolescents. This trauma can be worse in children and adolescents where insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring is not affordable in their countries, such as Korea.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2156587217722473" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>The unpleasant experience due to self-insulin injection and BST among adolescents with type 1 diabetes has been documented to be the result of pain,<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2156587217722473" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> fear,<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2156587217722473" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and anxiety.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2156587217722473" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> However, these experiences are difficult to differentiate in young patients. In fact, pain assessment and management is important part of standard of care, and is given higher priority than any other discomforts. According to International Association for the Study of Pain (1994),<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2156587217722473" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> pain is defined as &#x0201c;an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.&#x0201d; Howe et al<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2156587217722473" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> indicated that about 40% of children reported fear and 23% of adolescents reported pain associated with insulin injections. Furthermore, increased pain and fear of self-injection and self-testing are associated with frequent skipping of insulin injections and BST, poor glycemic control, and increased mortality among diabetes patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2156587217722473" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-2156587217722473" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>Despite of impact of needle pain on diabetes management, somewhat surprisingly interventional efforts have been rarely studied. Procedural pain in children is often controlled using topical anesthetic ointment, but more holistic approaches can be beneficial to control acute and mild needle pain complicated with fear and anxiety. We became interested in a mind-body therapy called Qigong as a pain control strategy for Korean adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Qigong is an ancient East Asian relaxation exercise based on integration of body, mind, and spirit,<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2156587217722473" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and many Asians, including Koreans, use it during their daily activities. Qigong is easily learnt and a feasible nonmedical strategy for controlling acute and mild pain.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2156587217722473" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-2156587217722473" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>Therefore, we developed an acute, static style Qigong program to decrease needle pain in adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Acute-type programs can allow beginners to manage occasional circumstances and static Qigong requires a small space and a low to moderate level of activity,<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2156587217722473" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and thus, is quite feasible for adolescents attending a camp. Accordingly, we undertook to apply a Qigong program to decrease needle pain in Korean adolescents with type 1 diabetes and preformed a small pilot study.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="section1-2156587217722473"><title>Methods</title><sec id="section2-2156587217722473"><title>Study Design</title><p>This study was a randomized, with short time crossover design and data collected from January 8, 2015 to January 9, 2015 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2156587217722473">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1-2156587217722473" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Study design.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2156587217722473-fig1"/></fig></sec><sec id="section3-2156587217722473" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>The participants were 26 Korean adolescents with type 1 diabetes.

Hwalmyeon static style is a training method that focuses on the maintenance of certain postures while performing controlled breathing and imagery. These postures can be performed while standing, sitting, and laying down. The program was designed to make it easy to learn and remember, and to be relaxing for adolescents. Therefore, they can continue to practice at home after learning the technique in the camp. The 60-minute program included 4 sections consisting of <italic>warming up</italic>, <italic>relaxation</italic>, <italic>imaginary</italic>, <italic>and closing</italic>.</p><p><italic>Warming up</italic> was a preparatory session for Qigong practice. During the 10-minute warm-up period, adolescents performed clockwise and counterclockwise rotational movements of the neck, wrists, waist, knees, and ankles. This movement was followed by tapping to relax the body from upper to lower arms and then upper to lower legs. <italic>Relaxation</italic> was designed to relax body and mind. This 20-minute session included maintaining a meditation posture in sitting and lying positions. The <italic>imaginary session</italic> was of 20-minute duration and was conducted as a 3-step process. First, the instructor asked adolescents to imagine any object, such as an apple, and then asked to imagine more details of the object, for example, in the case of an apple, its color, taste, smell, and so on. Second, they were asked to imagine that they placed the object in a safe place. Third, they were asked to perform imaginary BST and insulin injection while thinking that they felt no pain or fear. <italic>Closing</italic> took 10 minutes and involved meditation, deep breathing, and tapping and rubbing of their entire bodies while sitting.</p></sec><sec id="section5-2156587217722473"><title>Measurements</title><p>Data were collected on age, gender, height, weight, diabetes information, needle pain, and their emotional affects.

To our knowledge, this is the first interventional study performed on this topic using randomized groups, although the control group was delayed intervention group and the sample size was small. Qigong program was feasible in this population, but its effect was statistically significant only in expected pain on insulin injection. However, it did not ameliorate perceived pain or emotional discomfort. Also, after first and second days, interventions were not significant on pain and affects.</p><p>One possible explanation of our study results might be the small effect size of the study cohort. Although the Qigong program is known to be an effective pain management,<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2156587217722473" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-2156587217722473" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> most studies on the subject have been performed in adult populations. In fact, static Qigong programs may work better with older children than younger ones, as older children find it easier to maintain posture and remain still. Static Qigong has similarities with mindfulness, nonmovement, deep breathing, and meditation. According to Burke,<sup><xref rid="bibr19-2156587217722473" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> when mindfulness is applied to children attention must be paid to age-related development needs (attention span, cognitive capacity, physicality, relevant content). When we compared the baseline characteristics of participants who experienced a reduction in expected pain and those that did not, participants who experienced a reduction tended to be older, taller, and heavier, and had a longer duration of diabetes. This finding is consistent with our opinion that older children benefit more from Qigong in terms of pain management.</p><p>The other explanation concerns the nature of needle pain in adolescents with type 1 diabetes and means of measuring pain. In the present study, perceived pains for insulin injections and BST were measured 1 to 2 hours after intervention at dinner times to avoid additional needle pain for research purpose. Therefore, our results may have been affected by a tendency to underrate pain. Indeed, our study participants reported more pain for insulin injection than BST, and thus, the effect of Qigong on pain was probably greater for insulin injection than BST which was lower enough at baseline. Howe et al<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2156587217722473" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> also noticed that children with type 1 diabetes reported more pain for insulin injection than BST.</p><sec id="section10-2156587217722473"><title>Limitations</title><p>The study participants were recruited form one diabetes camp in Korea, and the sample size was small. Accordingly, the generalizability of our results is limited. Jaccard et al<sup><xref rid="bibr20-2156587217722473" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> mentioned that small sample sizes are common in studies that explore the psychosocial issues of children in clinical settings. Collaborative multicenter studies are needed to overcome the sample size issue for future studies. Furthermore, we did not collect data on potential confounders, such as, types of insulin, needles, and glucometers, which may have affected pain. The main weakness of cross over design, contamination of the intervention among study participants remains in this study. Although study participants were randomly assigned to groups, they participated in other programs together and were able to communicate freely with each other. The length of our program might be too long for adolescents who were young or had minimal pain, although it was designed to be for Qigong beginners. Different length and content of Qigong program should be applicable to adolescents based on their experience with Qigong and types and intensity of their discomfort in the future. Furthermore, the study design had a 24-hour washout period for crossover of intervention switch as previously documented<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2156587217722473" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>; however, this period might be not long enough to prevent residual effect of Qigong. Future studies are needed in evaluation of short- and long-term effect of Qigong program among a wider spectrum of participants with different health conditions and developmental ages.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section11-2156587217722473"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we present meaningful evidence that a Qigong program helped reduce in certain type of pain, though limited to expected pain on insulin injection of adolescents with type 1 diabetes. The devised program was found to be feasible and easily learnt. The program also did not require cumbersome equipment and could be performed almost anywhere. Therefore, we believe the described program may offer a nonpharmacological option for adolescents with type 1 diabetes who experience pain on insulin injection.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was performed at a camp for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.
