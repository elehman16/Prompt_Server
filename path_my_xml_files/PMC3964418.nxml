Background</title><p>Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency among veiled women have been reported to be so prevalent (<xref rid="A11175R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="A11175R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The adverse effects of this deficiency are bone loss, bone turnover and myopathy in pregnant women and rickets, craniotabes, and lower bone mineral content in fetus(<xref rid="A11175R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>); also, it has been related to the low birth weight, autoimmune disease, heart disease, cancers, cesarean section, bacterial vaginosis, preeclampsia, abortion and preterm labor (<xref rid="A11175R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="A11175R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Moreover, this deficiency has been associated with low physical activity which could lead to obesity, high blood pressure and coronary artery disease (<xref rid="A11175R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="A11175R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>The role of vitamin D as a modulator in the immune system (<xref rid="A11175R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) is very important among reproductive women. Scientists reported that the best solution for this deficiency in absence of sun exposure is consumption of vitamin D supplements (<xref rid="A11175R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Although in 2010, IOM (Institute Of Medicine) recommended 600 IU/day vitamin D for 1- 70 years old persons (<xref rid="A11175R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), this dosage is only enough for people who have normal ranges of 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 (<xref rid="A11175R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="A11175R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and exact amounts of supplementation for population with high-risk of deficiency, in a limited time such as preconception period, is yet unclear (<xref rid="A11175R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="A11175R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Because of influential role of Vitamin D in reproductive women and their future pregnancies, reaching to normal ranges of this vitamin in a minimum time and with minimum dosage of supplementation is necessary.</p></sec><sec id="sec40363"><title>2. Objectives</title><p>This study investigated the effect of 2000 IU/day oral vitamin D for 105 days, on serum levels of this vitamin among reproductive women in high-risk population for vitamin D deficiency.</p></sec><sec id="sec40364"><title>3. Materials and Methods</title><p>This paper presents some findings of a major study evaluating the effect of the current intervention on the vaginal infection treatment during preconception period. The method of the whole project was similar; so the main project was registered in Iranian registry of clinical trial (IRCT201105096284N2). Between June 2011 and March 2012, using convenience sampling, eligible women aged 18 to 35 who referred to gynecology clinic of Tehran Imam-Khomeini hospital, were enrolled after signing the informed consent.</p><p>According to the study on vitamin D levels of Iranian mothers (<xref rid="A11175R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), the population of this study was high-risk about vitamin D deficiency; these high-risk women must had resided in the city, had stable medical condition during past six months, and didn&#x02019;t have criteria such as pathological obesity, tobacco use, history of hypercalcemia, pregnancy, hepatic or renal dysfunction, malignancy or malabsorption, using medications that suppress the immunity or interfere with vitamin D metabolism. Also they should not had taken vitamin D or calcium supplements. They knew that they would be excluded from the study in case they didn&#x02019;t wish to continue using drugs, become pregnant or have symptoms of sensitivity to the drug. Demographic and life style questionnaire was completed by interviewing with 237 persons and their blood samples were obtained.</p><p>Women clot samples were transferred to the laboratory and were centrifuged at 4&#x025e6;C for 15 min to separate serum. Serums were stored at -20&#x025e6;C until analysis time. 25(OH)D was measured by EIA (Enzymatic ImmunoAssay) method using UK-made IDS (Immuno Diagnostic Systems) kits at the beginning of the study and after the intervention. The estimated sample size of the main project was 190 in the registered protocol; but with considering the aim of the current study, estimated sample size was increased slightly. Using online sample size estimation (available at: http://openepi.com/v37/SampleSize) and considering 90% power and 95% two-sided significance level to detect a 20% success in the experimental group, a sample size of 228 was estimated. In sampling process only 8 cases (from 237 women) had normal values of serum vitamin D (&#x0003e; 75nmol/L) and we removed them to homogenize the samples, so finally 229 women entered to the randomization stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8414">Figure 1</xref>). </p><fig id="fig8414" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Consort Flow Diagram of Participants</title><p>* vitamin</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ircmj-16-11175-i001"/></fig><p>In this study, using the block randomization method, cases were randomly divided into the intervention and control groups. The list of allocation sequence was created by computer-generated randomization and based on it, each women with unique identification number was assigned to study groups. 116 women of intervention group consumed 2 drops/day of an oily vitamin D solution (equivalent to 2000 IU) and 113 women of control group received the same amounts of placebo with the similar color, smell, taste and appearance (both solutions were made by pharmacist of relevant university and were used for 105 days).</p><p>The current study was double-blind; vitamin D and placebo solutions were labeled as A and B by the pharmacist. During the study, researchers and participants didn&#x02019;t have any information about real contains of these solutions. A was the placebo and B was the vitamin D solution. Participants were phone called every two weeks to ensure proper use of the drops and their cooperation. After 15 weeks, women were told to stop the usage of drops and were referred to the clinic. New blood samples were collected for laboratory examination and clot samples were evaluated by the laboratory methods used at the beginning of the study. Only 3 women were not eager to continue the study and were replaced. Results were analyzed by SPSS version 20 software using paired T test, independent T test, linear regression and chi-square tests. Relevant university ethics committee approved this study. Also at the end of the study, participants were informed about their group and their vitamin D levels.</p></sec><sec id="sec40365"><title>4. Results</title><p>The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 96.62% in reproductive women. Baseline mean of serum 25(OH) D was 23.34 &#x000b1; 15.87 nmol/L in the control group and 25.13 &#x000b1; 18.46 nmol/L in the intervention group without any significant difference (P = 0.43).

Discussion</title><p>The study reports an excessive high rate of vitamin D deficiency among reproductive women of Iran (96.62%). The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency of this study is greater than the previously stated prevalence in pregnant women, both in Iran (86%) (<xref rid="A11175R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and other countries (66.7%) (<xref rid="A11175R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) which it can be due to the defined cut-point or the method of 25 (OH) D measurement. The study&#x02019;s goal was to evaluate the impact of the higher dose of vitamin D supplementation in the short-term of pre-conception period. This study determined that the dosage of 2000 IU/day oral vitamin D is effective on serum levels of 25 (OH)D, although it failed to reach normal levels in a large number of cases (The normal levels of vitamin D for pregnant women has been reported to be 75-250 nmol/L (<xref rid="A11175R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>)).</p><p>By statistical analysis of the intervention group, it was found that basal amounts of vitamin D, exposing to sunlight and consuming dietary supplements (except vitamin D and calcium which were exclusion criteria) in daily life were effective in reaching to normal ranges of vitamin D. The intervention by higher dosage of oral vitamin D among reproductive or pregnant women had been done by several researchers. Hollis et al. (<xref rid="A11175R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) after intervention in pregnant women by 2000 or 4000 IU of vitamin D/day until delivery, demonstrated that both of these dosages had significantly improved 25(OH) D in mothers and newborns at birth, and also there was a significant difference between intervention groups and control group in achieving to 80 nmol/L level, 1 month after delivery. Similar to our results, they didn&#x02019;t observe any adverse events. The significant difference between our study and Hollis et al.&#x02019;s study is the target group. The method of this study is more powerful in the prevention of vitamin D deficiency adverse effect on pregnancy. </p><p>Also cross sectional studies showed direct relationship between using different doses of vitamin D during pregnancy and vitamin D serum levels (<xref rid="A11175R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="A11175R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In an important retrospective cohort study, Rapuri and Gallagher (<xref rid="A11175R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) found that 25(OH) D in case-group women had significantly higher amounts than control-group (P &#x0003e; 0.05). 78% of women, who consumed vitamin D supplement, had appropriate levels of serum 25(OH) D2. All of these findings showed that the long time consumption of vitamin D supplementation (400 IU/day) is an effective method, but low-dosage intake of vitamin D was not an effective way to treat the vitamin D deficiency (<xref rid="A11175R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="A11175R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) and scientists suggested higher dosage of supplementation, particularly in reproductive women (<xref rid="A11175R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). This study investigated the effect of higher, and safe dosage of vitamin D in the short time of preconception period which is about 2 or 3 month before being pregnant, to avoid concurrency of vitamin D deficiency and the early stages of embryonic life and pregnancy. In regression analysis of the present study, only the basal vitamin D and using vitamin D had a significant correlation with serum vitamin D levels after the intervention (P &#x0003c; 0.001) which is not surprising. The association between vitamin D level and exercise had been shown in elderly population (<xref rid="A11175R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), while this study failed to demonstrate the relationship between regular exercise and vitamin D level enhancement among reproductive women.</p><p>Confounding factors in achieving normal levels of vitamin D in the study of Larijani et al. (<xref rid="A11175R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) which used fortified milk with 600 IU of vitamin D, were the kind of milk and the basal amounts of serum vitamin D (P &#x0003e; 0.001), that the second one is the same as our findings. Factors such as non-Hispanic ethnicity, obesity, smoking, history of diabetes and cardiovascular have been associated with increased risk of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency. Also supplement consumption, drinking more than one meal milk daily, and exposure to sunlight during the months of May through October have been associated with reduced risk of vitamin D deficiency (P &#x0003c; 0.05) (<xref rid="A11175R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). These data were collected from 1814 reproductive women and has high validity due to the large sample size but these findings were not limited to the short time of preconception period. </p><p>We only included women with deficiency because only a few samples had normal baseline level. In this way we would be able to use the results for people with vitamin D deficiency, which constitute very high percentage of our female population. To the authors&#x02019; knowledge, these kinds of samples have not been studied exclusively in another trial. Excellent tracking of individuals by the researcher and the loss of only 3 samples and even replacement of them are other strengths of our study. Sampling in the different seasons is the main weakness of this study but the researchers couldn&#x02019;t be able to modify it. Consumption of vitamin D or calcium during pregnancy could affect serum vitamin D or calcium levels (<xref rid="A11175R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="A11175R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), so the impact of 2000 IU/day vitamin D intake during pregnancy on serum vitamin D levels of newborns should be evaluated in future works.</p><p>Our data showed that the intake of 2000 IU/day vitamin D for 105 days increased serum levels of this vitamin and brought more than half of women into the normal range. We believe that this therapy in women with high-risk of deficiency, during preconception period is so efficient to prevent the mentioned complications.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This project is funded and supported by Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS); grant no: 90-01-28-13331</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="afn22485" fn-type="other"><p><bold>Implication for health policy/practice/research/medical education:</bold>The majority of Iranian reproductive women are vitamin D deficient before being pregnant.
