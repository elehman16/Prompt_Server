Therefore, we compared the cardiovascular adaptations of completing 24 high-intensity aerobic interval training sessions carried out for either three or eight weeks, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Twenty-one healthy subjects (23.0&#x000b1;2.1 years, 10 females) completed 24 high-intensity training sessions throughout a time-period of either eight weeks (moderate frequency, MF) or three weeks (high frequency, HF) followed by a detraining period of nine weeks without any training. In both groups, maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2max</sub>) was evaluated before training, at the 9<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> session and four days after the final 24<sup>th</sup> training session. In the detraining phase VO<sub>2max</sub> was evaluated after 12 days and thereafter every second week for eight weeks. Left ventricular echocardiography, carbon monoxide lung diffusion transfer factor, brachial artery flow mediated dilatation and vastus lateralis citrate maximal synthase activity was tested before and after training.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The cardiovascular adaptation after HF training was delayed compared to training with MF. Four days after ending training the HF group showed no improvement (+3.0%, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.126), whereas the MF group reached their highest VO<sub>2max</sub> with a 10.7% improvement (p&#x0003c;0.001: group difference p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.035). The HF group reached their highest VO<sub>2max</sub> (6.1% increase, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.026) twelve days into the detraining period, compared to a concomitant reduction to 7.9% of VO<sub>2max</sub> (p&#x0003c;0.001) above baseline in the MF group (group difference p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.609).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both HF and MF training of high-intensity aerobic exercise improves VO<sub>2max</sub>.

The most efficient exercise intensity for improving VO<sub>2max</sub> has been found to be close to maximal heart rate (HR<sub>max</sub>) in both healthy subjects <xref rid="pone.0088375-Helgerud1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> as well as in different patient groups <xref rid="pone.0088375-Rognmo1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0088375-Wisloff1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Interval training is an effective way of performing high-intensity aerobic exercise, and our research group have previously demonstrated that high-intensity interval exercise at 90&#x02013;95% of HR<sub>max</sub>, performed 2&#x02013;3 times per week is superior to continuous moderate exercise at 60&#x02013;70% of HR<sub>max</sub> for improving VO<sub>2max</sub> when total exercise volume is equalized <xref rid="pone.0088375-Kemi1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>The knowledge of how a short and intensified period of high-intensity exercise influences the progression of VO<sub>2max</sub> is however less clear. Such block periodization could provide a highly time-efficient method for improving VO<sub>2max</sub> within a very short time-period <xref rid="pone.0088375-Laursen1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. A recent study of Swiss alpine junior skiers found that 15 high-intensity exercise sessions at 90&#x02013;95% of HR<sub>max</sub> performed over 11 days improved VO<sub>2max</sub> by 6% when measured seven days after completing training <xref rid="pone.0088375-Breil1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. However, two earlier studies have reported a decrease in VO<sub>2max</sub> and work performance after two weeks of highly intensified training in competitive cyclists <xref rid="pone.0088375-Jeukendrup1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088375-Snyder1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. This indicates that the assessment of VO<sub>2max</sub> may be dependent of when the measurements are taking place after completing a highly intensified training period. Also the cardiovascular and pulmonary adaptations have shown to be depressed immediately after intensified exercise <xref rid="pone.0088375-McKenzie1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088375-Aslani1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the progression of aerobic adaptation in young, healthy individuals completing 24 interval training sessions carried out over either 3 weeks or 8 weeks, respectively. A secondary aim was to study the cardiovascular, pulmonary, endothelial and skeletal muscle adaptation induced by the two training programmes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty-one students (23.0&#x000b1;2.1 years, 10 females) were recruited from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, Norway.

A subsequent detraining period consisted of nine weeks without aerobic training, except necessary daily activities. Both groups performed high-intensity aerobic training running uphill on a treadmill, with individually adjusted speed and inclination, supervised by a personal trainer. Each training session consisted of 10 minutes warm-up followed by 4&#x000d7;4-minute intervals at 90&#x02013;95% of HR<sub>max</sub>, alternating with 3-minute of active recovery at 70% of HR<sub>max</sub>, ending with a 5-minute cool-down, giving a total exercise time of 40 minutes per session. Heart rate (HR) was monitored by HR recorders (Polar, Finland) to ensure that all training sessions was carried out at definitive intensities.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Maximal Oxygen Uptake Testing</title><p>Maximal oxygen uptake was tested using an individualized graded step incremental test on a treadmill (Woodway, PPS 55). After a 10 minutes warm-up, a facemask was placed on the subjects for metabolic measurements using a Metamax II (Cortex, Leipzig, Germany), where incline was constant at 10% and speed was increased by 1 km &#x000b7; h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> every minute. Tests were terminated when candidates reached a VO<sub>2</sub> plateau that remained stable despite increased work load, i.e. VO<sub>2</sub> did not increase more than 2 mL &#x000b7; kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x000b7; min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> despite increased work load, and a respiratory exchange ratio (RER) &#x0003e;1.10. VO<sub>2max</sub> was measured before study started (pre-test) and four days after the 24<sup>th</sup> and final training session (post-test). VO<sub>2max</sub> was also tested during the training period, i.e. at the 9<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> training session, and after these tests the subjects performed 3&#x000d7;4-minute intervals. In the detraining phase the subjects were tested 12 days after the last training session and thereafter every second week until the end of the eight week detraining phase.

Measurements were also repeated after the nine weeks of detraining. Complete echocardiographic examinations were performed using a Vivid 7 scanner (GE Vingmed Ultrasound, Horten, Norway) with a phased-array transducer (3MS probe). Three cine loops from the three standard apical planes (four-chamber, two-chamber and long-axis) as well as short-axis (basal, mid-papillary and apical) were recorded in gray scale harmonic mode and tissue Doppler mode. B-mode recordings were done with an average of 53 frames per second and tissue Doppler with 154 frames per second. Measurements and calculations obtained were in accordance to standard procedures recommended by the American Society of Echocardiography. LV volumes and ejection fraction (EF) were calculated from apical recordings by modified biplane Simpson&#x02019;s method. Inflow velocity of the left ventricle was measured by pulsed Doppler with the sample volume at the tips level of mitral valves. Measurements included early diastolic filling (E) and late diastolic filling (A). Stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output (CO) was calculated by Doppler flow measurement in the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT). Tissue Doppler recordings of the mitral annulus were obtained from the septal and lateral points in four-chamber and in the anterior and inferior points in two-chamber views. Peak annulus velocity in systole (S&#x02019;), early diastole (e&#x02019;) and late diastole (A&#x02019;) were measured as average of the four points.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Lung Function</title><p>Lung function testing was performed before and four days after the training period.

The biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis with a sterile 5 mm diameter biopsy needle (Pelomi, Denmark) under local anaesthesia. All samples were snap-freezed in liquid nitrogen immediately after sampling. For citrate synthase (CS) maximal activity measurements, the muscle samples were homogenized in CelLytic buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) at 6000 shakes/min for 2&#x000d7;8 seconds in a Precellys24 tissue homogenizer (Bertin, France). The homogenate was then centrifugated at 10000 g for 10 min at 4&#x000b0;C and supernatant tested for CS activity. The CS maximal activity was determined by the use of citrate synthase Assay Kit (CS 0720, Sigma-Aldrich). Absorbance at 412 nm was measured on a Fluostar Omega spectrometer (BMG Labtech, Germany). Specific activity was calculated by dividing measured activity on the muscle extract protein concentration.

We found however no improvements in VO<sub>2max</sub> immediately after ending the HF training programme. In addition, we found a reduction in lung diffusion capacity and indications of a reduction in cardiac function in HF immediately after training. This indicates a possibility of fatigue when exposed to such a high exercise dose. However, during the detraining period there was a delayed increase in VO<sub>2max</sub> in the HF group demonstrating the necessity of sufficient rest to adapt from such a heavy exercise training programme. The MF training programme, in contrast, had a positive effect for improving the aerobic capacity in a progressive manner throughout the training period.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Maximal Oxygen Uptake</title><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that VO<sub>2max</sub> improves after HF aerobic training <xref rid="pone.0088375-Pollock1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088375-Gettman1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, suggesting a possibility to improve VO<sub>2max</sub> in reduced time compared to more moderate training regimes. In line with this, a recent study by Breil et al. <xref rid="pone.0088375-Breil1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> involving Swiss alpine skiers, showed that it is possible to boost the aerobic capacity by means of a 6% increase of VO<sub>2max</sub> using a high-intensity interval training &#x0201c;shock&#x0201d; of 15 sessions in 11 days. In our study we found a quite different progression of the adaptation between MF- and HF-training, and the highest VO<sub>2max</sub>-values occurred at different time points. In the MF group the adaptation to physical training progressed in a regular manner. VO<sub>2max</sub> increased progressively in the MF group during the training period, and reached highest value at post-test, four days after ending training period (+10.7%, p&#x0003c;0.001). Contrary, in the HF group there was no change in VO<sub>2max</sub> during the training period. In fact, we measured a small, but not significant reduction at the VO<sub>2max</sub>-test performed at the 16<sup>th</sup> training session, 14 days into the training regime. Furthermore, the HF group showed no improvements four days after ending 24 sessions of training (+2.9%, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.126), and improved their VO<sub>2max</sub> first after another week of detraining (+6.1%, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.026), i.e. 12 days after finishing training. Interestingly, despite training for only 3 weeks the HF group still required 5 weeks to reach their highest measured VO<sub>2max</sub> (+6.1% from baseline) whereas the MF group reached an improvement of 7.1% immediately after completing their 6 weeks of moderate training.</p><p>Our results show that the highly intensified training load experienced by the HF group was too severe to progressively adapt compared to the MF training programme. It is assumed that recovery processes continue through homoeostatic restoration of the body after training until a compensation effect may occur <xref rid="pone.0088375-Viru1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The most common way to adapt and improve physical fitness after training is to recover sufficiently and then perform the next exercise session at the peak of the compensation phase <xref rid="pone.0088375-Kuipers1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. However, It has been described that athletes may experience acute feelings of fatigue and decrease in performance following periods of intensified training <xref rid="pone.0088375-Halson1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Intensified training can thus result in a temporarily decline in performance, but when sufficient periods of recovery are provided, a supercompensation may occur with enhanced performance compared to baseline levels <xref rid="pone.0088375-Halson1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. As it is possible to recover within a 2-week period <xref rid="pone.0088375-Halson2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, it may be argued that this is a relatively normal condition and thus a normal part of a strenuous training process. The lack of improvement of VO<sub>2max</sub> in the HF group during the training period, along with the compensation effect in the detraining phase, suggests that too severe training load was induced, as opposed to the progressive improvement of VO<sub>2max</sub> in the MF group suggesting sufficient rest between the exercise sessions. However, it is still possible that more well-trained athletes could have acquired greater adaptation to HF training compared with our moderately trained students. There was however only one drop-out in each group, despite the higher physical demands in the HF group. The high compliance rate might be due to the young healthy population and a strong will to complete the training programme.</p><p>After 6 weeks of detraining, that started after the last exercise session, VO<sub>2max</sub> returned to baseline values both in the MF and HF group. Mujika and Padilla <xref rid="pone.0088375-Mujika1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> found that recently trained subjects most often reverse their gained VO<sub>2max</sub> when detraining extends 4 weeks <xref rid="pone.0088375-Mujika2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, whereas Pedersen et al. <xref rid="pone.0088375-Pedersen1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> found that the inactivity period simply reverses the training effect in the same manner as it emerged. Coyle et al. found that the decline in VO<sub>2max</sub> stabilized after 8 weeks of detraining <xref rid="pone.0088375-Coyle1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Although VO<sub>2max</sub> in both groups in our study were still elevated compared to baseline VO<sub>2max</sub> at 4 weeks into the de-training period, our findings suggest an earlier reduction of VO<sub>2max</sub> relative to highest measured value in the MF group, i.e. after 4 weeks compared to 6 weeks in the HF group. The reason for this may simply correspond to the latency of their highest VO<sub>2max</sub> value in the HF group, which occurred 2 weeks after training cessation. The gained aerobic capacity in both groups thus declined in a similar pattern from the highest reached value, being back at baseline 4 weeks after their highest measurement.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Cardiovascular Response</title><p>We observed that stroke volume increased significantly in the MF group in response to the interval training in line with other studies <xref rid="pone.0088375-Helgerud1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088375-Wisloff1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088375-Amundsen1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In the HF group we found an increased end diastolic volume. In the HF group EF was reduced, suggesting a depressed left ventricular adaptation after the training period. The reduction in the systolic function is in concordance with another study that revealed a negative myocardial effect immediately after a strenuous exercise programme <xref rid="pone.0088375-Aslani1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. It should be emphasized that heart rate was reduced in the HF group after the exercise period, which may have affected the cardiac measurements. The cardiac measurements were secondary endpoints and the study is thus too small to draw firm conclusion. As expected, the diastolic measurements at rest did not improve, confirming existing literature that young healthy sedentary subjects on beforehand have a normal and optimal diastolic function <xref rid="pone.0088375-George1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><p>During detraining in the MF group we observed that the stroke volume and the EF returned to baseline values. This indicates loss of the training induced adaptations caused by inactivity. The groups however differed in their adaptations during detraining. Stroke volume increased during detraining amongst the HF group and this was attributable to the increased end diastolic volume. EF was subsequently normalized. This indicates that recovery is crucial to achieve cardiac improvements after a strenuous physical activity programme. However, although the HF group increased stroke volume during detraining, the inactivity period returned VO<sub>2max</sub> to baseline values.</p><p>It has previously been suggested that intense exercise may induce stress that impairs the systemic endothelial function <xref rid="pone.0088375-Goto1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. We found however no signs of endothelial dysfunction as both groups showed the same FMD of the brachial artery both before and after training.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Lung Function</title><p>The MF group increased pulmonary diffusion capacity after the training period.

In line with our results, a recent study concluded that in skeletal muscle of trained individuals, the maximal activity of citrate synthase were enhanced to a greater extent by having a day of rest between the exercise sessions compared with training daily for 3 weeks <xref rid="pone.0088375-Yeo1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Study Strengths and Limitations</title><p>This study is small with few subjects in each group. However, the high number of test points throughout the study with a steady incline and decline of VO<sub>2max</sub> in the MF group, is indicating that changes not just being measurement variations. Also, the VO<sub>2max</sub>-tests consistently showed plateaus of the O<sub>2</sub>-curve and high RER-values above 1.10, suggesting maximal effort during all tests. As it is difficult to predict when each subject achieves their highest VO<sub>2max</sub> value after a training programme, an even more frequent test programme could have revealed even higher maximum values. More frequent testing could on the other hand elicit an unwanted training effect in the detraining period. Another aspect would have been to elucidate which mechanisms were causing the signs of fatigue during and after HF training. However, this study was not designed to examine these underlying mechanisms. The study was originally designed also to investigate retraining after the detraining period, but due to the strain of the participants, this part of the study was not implemented.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>It has previously been shown that it is possible to boost VO<sub>2max</sub> by a short and intensified high-intensity interval training period. In our study we found a different progression of the adaptation between MF- and HF-training, and the highest VO<sub>2max</sub>-values occurred at different time points. The adaptation following a HF programme of high-intensity exercise was delayed compared to training with MF. The HF programme may induce an initially fatigue which may limit the cardiopulmonary function whereas the latter programme follows a more progressive adaptation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0088375.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>
