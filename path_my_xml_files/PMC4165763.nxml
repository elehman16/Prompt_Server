ALD is a progressive disease initiated by steatosis and inflammation, followed by liver fibrosis and cirrhosis <xref rid="pone.0107421-Sawada1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Only 30% of chronic alcoholics eventually develop cirrhosis, indicating that additional factors are required <xref rid="pone.0107421-Rao1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Recent evidence points to a role for the gut-liver axis in the pathogenesis of ALD <xref rid="pone.0107421-Szabo1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Ethanol is known to disrupt GI epithelial barrier integrity <xref rid="pone.0107421-Keshavarzian1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, resulting in translocation of potentially harmful bacteria and their products such as endotoxins <xref rid="pone.0107421-Bode1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and peptidoglycans <xref rid="pone.0107421-Tabata1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> into the portal circulation and consequently, liver injury. Dysfunction of GI mucosal barrier may result in increased susceptibility not only to infections <xref rid="pone.0107421-Mandrekar1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> but also to development of ethanol-related GI cancers <xref rid="pone.0107421-Squier1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Human studies investigating effects of ethanol on intestinal barrier function have focused mainly on chronic heavy drinkers (&#x0003e;80 g/day) <xref rid="pone.0107421-Eckardt1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, demonstrating that ethanol increases small intestinal permeability <xref rid="pone.0107421-Bode2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Effects of moderate ethanol consumption on GI barrier function are less well known but are especially relevant since daily moderate alcohol consumption (daily intake of 1&#x02013;2 alcoholic drinks or 12&#x02013;24 g ethanol), is widespread <xref rid="pone.0107421-Dufour1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Ethanol and its metabolites can reach the distal GI tract through the vascular space <xref rid="pone.0107421-Elamin1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Therefore, ethanol and its metabolites may be injurious not only to the small but also to the large intestinal barrier. Intestinal barrier integrity is maintained by the tight junctions (TJs), a complex meshwork of transmembrane and cytoplasmic proteins including occludin, the claudins and the zona occludens family (ZO-1,2,3), linked to the cytoskeletal protein F-actin <xref rid="pone.0107421-Shen1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The TJs are supported by the adherens junctions proteins (AJs) E-cadherin and &#x003b2;-catenin, which are also required for TJ assembly <xref rid="pone.0107421-Guo1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Data obtained <italic>in vitro</italic> using intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-2 cell monolayers) indicate that ethanol disrupts TJs integrity via mechanisms involving oxidative stress <xref rid="pone.0107421-Bode2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, modulation of microtubules <xref rid="pone.0107421-Elamin2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and activation of the cell signaling pathway myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) <xref rid="pone.0107421-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The three isoforms of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) isoforms including P38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and stress-activated protein kinase/C-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) have been shown to modulate TJs integrity <xref rid="pone.0107421-Usatyuk1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Furthermore, activation of MAPK has been reported to mediate intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction <xref rid="pone.0107421-Samak1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Data on mechanims of ethanol-induced barrier dysfunction are mainly derived from <italic>in vitro</italic> studies <xref rid="pone.0107421-Elamin3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In addition, insight into effects of moderate doses of ethanol on human intestinal barrier function and potential mechanisms involved is still lacking.</p><p>Our aims were to determine effects of a single moderate dose of ethanol, administered intraduodenally, on 1) small intestinal and colon permeability and 2) localization and expression of TJ in duodenal biopsies. In addition, the role of MAPK pathway as a primary signaling mechanism involved in ethanol-induced barrier disruption was investigated both <italic>in vivo</italic> in duodenal biopsies and <italic>in vitro</italic> in Caco-2 cell monolayers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects and study design</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107421.s004">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107421.s005">Protocol S1</xref>. The study was performed according to a randomized placebo-controlled crossover design, in 12 healthy subjects recruited between October 2010 and July 2011. Participants were healthy men from Caucasian ethnicity, between 18 and 45 years of age to avoid genome-related differences in ethanol metabolism <xref rid="pone.0107421-Seitz1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Exclusion criteria included BMI&#x0003e;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, history of GI disorders, liver diseases i.e. hepatitis and cirrhosis, abdominal surgery, excessive alcohol consumption (&#x0003e;20 g/day) and smoking. The study flow diagram is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107421.s001">Figure S1</xref>. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Maastricht University Medical Center (MUMC), conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and registered at the Clinical Trial Registry (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>; NCT00928733). All participants provided written informed consent. An overview of the experimental procedures is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107421.s001">Figure S1</xref>. The study consisted of two test days in a random order, with a washout period of one week. Participants arrived at the MUMC at 08:00 AM after an overnight fasting. An intravenous cannula was placed in an antecubital vein for blood sampling. Then, the tube was placed intraduodenally and optimal positioning was confirmed by X-ray.</p><p>Moderate ethanol intake is difficult to define. However, despite the complexity, Department of Agriculture and Department of Health and Human Services define moderate consumption of one standard drink a day for women and two drinks men <xref rid="pone.0107421-US1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. A standard drink is generally considered to be 360 ml of beer, 150 ml of wine, or 45 ml of 80-proof distilled spirits. These drinks contain roughly the same amount of absolute alcohol-approximately 12&#x02013;24 g <xref rid="pone.0107421-Dufour1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Accordingly and via the intestinal tube, either 20 g ethanol in 100 ml water (5% v/v) or water (placebo) was perfused at a rate of 7 ml/min for 15 min. Earlier observations have indicated that ethanol can reach concentrations of 2&#x02013;10% in small intestinal lumen after consumption of 50 ml ethanol in 20% solution <xref rid="pone.0107421-Millan1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Ethanol was introduced directly into the duodenum to overcome interindividual variations in its upper GI metabolism after oral consumption <xref rid="pone.0107421-Stermer1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Thereafter, participants received an oral multi-sugar drink to assess intestinal permeability, consisting of 1 g lactulose (Centrafarm, Etten-Leur, the Netherlands), 1 g sucralose (Brenntag, Sittard, the Netherlands), 1 g erythritol (Danisco, Copenhagen, Denmark), 1 g sucrose (Van Gilse, Dinteloord, the Netherlands), and 0.5 g L-rhamnose (Danisco) dissolved in 150 ml tap water. At t&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;30 min after start of placebo or ethanol perfusion, participants underwent a gastroduodenoscopy to obtain mucosal biopsies from the second part of the duodenum (forceps diameter: 2.8 mm). Tissue samples were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until further analyses. Blood was collected before and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 min after onset of ethanol perfusion. Urine was collected in plastic containers before, and in three fractions after ethanol perfusion, i.e. 0&#x02013;2 h, 2&#x02013;5 h and 5&#x02013;24 h. All samples were stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C within 4 hours after collection.

This finding is in line with reports by others and by our group, identifying oxidative stress as a key factor in the mechanisms by which ethanol and its metabolites disrupt intestinal barrier function <xref rid="pone.0107421-Forsyth1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107421-Elamin4" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Furthermore, oxidative stress has been found to activate MAPK in intestinal epithelial cells <xref rid="pone.0107421-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Therefore, our findings have relevance for ethanol-induced gut leakiness and indicate that the deleterious effects on barrier integrity can be reduced with antioxidants.</p><p>The inability of ethanol to induce changes in Caco-2 monolayers after pretreatment with MAPK inhibitors suggests that ethanol requires MAPK activation to disrupt TJ, highlighting a pivotal role for MAPK in ethanol-induced barrier disruption. Previously, it has been found that p38-dependent MLCK activation is required for burn-induced intestinal permeability <xref rid="pone.0107421-Aepfelbacher1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Our study provided evidences that ethanol leads to MAPK-dependent MLC phosphorylation, F-actin rearrangement and stress fiber formation in Caco-2 cells. Disruption of actin cytoskeleton and interaction with TJ and AJ have been implicated in ethanol and acetaldehyde-induced loss of TJ integrity in Caco-2 cell monolayers <xref rid="pone.0107421-Sheth1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Therefore, our <italic>in vitro</italic> data support the <italic>in vivo</italic> observations that ethanol increases intestinal permeability in association with up-regulation of MLCK gene expression and activation of MAPK in duodenal mucosa.</p><p>Ethanol and FAEEs including ethyl oleate and ethyl palmitate were measured in plasma, showing that ethanol can reach high levels within 30 min after administration accompanied by increased concentrations of the FAEEs ethyl oleate and ethyl palmitate. Acetaldehyde concentrations have not been measured due to its volatile character.</p><p>Duodenal biopsies obtained at the same time point (i.e. 30 min post-administration) have shown major changes on TJ at both posttranscriptional and transcriptional levels. Prior <italic>in vitro</italic> data have shown that ethanol <xref rid="pone.0107421-Forsyth1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, acetaldehyde <xref rid="pone.0107421-Rao2" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> and FAEEs <xref rid="pone.0107421-Elamin4" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> can increase paracellular permeability in Caco-2 monolayers. Since intestinal mucosa is considered a major site for FAEE synthesis <xref rid="pone.0107421-Diczfalusy1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, together with a shift in ethanol metabolism into nonoxidative pathways resulting from low ALD activity in chronic alcoholics additive or even synergistic deleterious effects of ethanol and its oxidative and nonoxidative metabolites are expected to occur <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0107421-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>.</p><p>Limitations of our study include the lack of assessment of TJ integrity at the colon mucosal level. In addition, being a proof of concept study, ethanol was administered directly into the duodenum to overcome interindividual variations in its upper GI metabolism. Our data allow future studies to include more physiological approaches with a major focus on the colon.</p><p>In conclusion, a moderate dose of ethanol increases small and large intestinal permeability. Oxidative stress-mediated activation of MAPK is involved in ethanol-induced TJ and AJ disruption, actin cytoskeleton reorganization and consequently, intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction. Our findings have potential implications for pathogenesis of alcoholic-related liver and GI disorders. A better understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in ethanol-induced gut leakiness may provide clues for development of preventive strategies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0107421.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
