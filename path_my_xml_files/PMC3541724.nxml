Here, we assess anthropometry measurements in children 6&#x02013;60 months in 24 communities randomized to one or two mass azithromycin distributions over a 1-year period in Niger. We compared the prevalence of wasting, low mid-upper arm circumference, stunting, and underweight in communities in the two treatment arms. We were unable to prove that there was a difference in the prevalence of wasting in the 12 communities that received one mass azithromycin distribution versus the 12 communities that received two mass azithromycin distributions (odds ratio = 0.75, 95% confidence interval = 0.46&#x02013;1.23). Likewise, we were unable to detect a difference in the two treatment arms for low mid-upper arm circumference, stunting, and underweight. There may not be an association between antibiotic use and improved growth in humans, or this trial was not powerful enough to detect an association if it exists.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes notes-type="disclaimer"><p>Disclaimer: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Antimicrobials are used primarily to treat infectious diseases, although their effects are wide-ranging.

However, if mass azithromycin treatments affect mortality, the mechanism by which they do so is unknown. We aim to investigate explanatory factors for mortality reduction by measuring anthropometric indices. Mass azithromycin treatments for trachoma provide a unique opportunity to study the effect of these treatments on growth and nutrition. The current investigation is a substudy of the Partnership for the Rapid Elimination of Trachoma (PRET), a cluster-randomized clinical trial (clinicaltrials.gov trial NCT00792922) investigating different treatment strategies for trachoma, an ocular infection with <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>.

Eligible individuals &#x0003e; 6 months were offered their assigned treatment of a single directly observed oral dose of azithromycin (height-based dosing equaling 20 mg/kg) in June or July of 2010.

All outcome measurements were performed in a random sample of 50 children ages 6&#x02013;60 months in each of the 24 communities based on the May of 2011 census. If the community did not contain 50 children, all children were included. Randomization of communities to the treatment arms and randomization of individuals within communities were done using RANDOM and SORT functions in Excel (version 2003) or the statistical package R (version 2.12; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.r-project.org">www.r-project.org</ext-link>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> by B.N. and T.C.P. as previously described.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> Study teams monitored antibiotic treatment coverage levels in all communities at both treatments.

We measured recumbent length in children younger than 24 months or standing height in children older than 24 months when the child was able to stand to the nearest 0.1 cm (Shoreboard; Shorr Productions, LLC, Olney, MD).

All communities received mass treatment in June and July of 2010, and the biannually treated communities received a second treatment in December of 2010 and January of 2011. There were 1,030 individuals (6&#x02013;60 months) in the 24 communities in this anthropometry study (486 individuals in annually treated communities and 545 individuals in biannually treated communities). The mean antibiotic coverage of children ages 6&#x02013;60 months was 80.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 76.8&#x02013;84.1) for the single treatment of the annually treated communities and 74.4% (95% CI = 69.4&#x02013;79.3) and 78.7% (95% CI = 74.6&#x02013;82.7) for the two treatments in the biannually treated communities. Anthropometry measurements were performed in May of 2011, 10 or 11 months after treatment in the annual arm and 6 months after treatment in the biannual arm as per study design. Baseline characteristics, including average number of children per community, age of children, fraction female, and clinical trachoma prevalence, were similar in the communities randomized to the two treatment arms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). All communities received their scheduled treatments, and no community was lost to follow-up over the length of the study.

Note that this restriction is a deviation from our primary pre-specified intention-to-treat analysis, where participants were not withdrawn after randomization for any reason. We are aware that withdrawing individuals from the study, even because of non-adherence, may offer bias of unknown magnitude and direction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> Nevertheless, these restricted analyses can present an estimate of biological efficacy that intention-to-treat analyses may be unable to provide.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> For example, we detected a dose response in those individuals who received their assigned treatment, and each additional treatment (from zero treatments to one treatment and from one treatment to two treatments) resulted in a WHZ score that was approximately 30% higher.</p><p>Although we did not detect a difference between annual and biannual mass antibiotic treatments on anthropometry, this finding may be because of the following reasons. First, a single extra mass azithromycin treatment over the course of 1 year may not be sufficient to have an effect on growth. Second, this study was a cross-sectional study and did not follow communities longitudinally; a longitudinal study might be better able to detect a smaller effect size. Third, there is a seasonal component to wasting in Niger, with high prevalence from December to February (after the rainy season) and lower prevalence in October (in the dry season when our study took place).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> Performing a study when wasting is at its lowest might make it more difficult to detect an effect of mass antibiotic treatment.</p><p>The outcome measures were performed 1 year after treatment in the annually treated communities and 6 months after treatment in the biannually treated communities by study design. In future studies, we plan to perform outcome measurements at the same time after treatment in compared communities to help with interpretation.</p><p>In conventional livestock production, antibiotics have been used to enhance weight gain and promote growth since the early 1950s.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> The use of antibiotics in food-producing animal agriculture results in healthier, more productive animals, lower disease incidence, and reduced morbidity and mortality, although this practice is controversial.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> The biological basis for the growth-promoting effects of oral antibiotics could be a reduction in intestinal microflora, which compete for nutrients,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> or treatment of subclinical infection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> The Animal Health Institute (AHI) estimates that between 9% and 17% of all antibiotics sold in the United States for animals are for growth promotion or improved feed efficiency.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> Antibiotics are not currently prescribed for growth promotion in humans, although treatment of children with deworming drugs has been shown to increase weight in some studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> The mechanism for the observed reduction in childhood mortality associated with mass azithromycin treatments is unknown, and it may be, in part, because of improved growth and nutrition.</p><p>Antibiotics do not provide a benefit for the treatment of undernutrition based on our study. Mass azithromycin treatments have proven to be very effective in programs for trachoma control, and the treatments are well-tolerated.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> Since 1999, over 225 million treatments of azithromycin have been donated through the International Trachoma Initiative for distribution by local partners in 19 countries.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> Investigation of positive and negative secondary effects associated with these treatments should be part of any mass treatment trial or program, particularly study of emerging antibiotic resistance. Although there is a large increase in the prevalence of resistance in nasopharyngeal pneumococcus after mass antibiotic use,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> this resistance drops quickly when mass distributions are discontinued.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> Nevertheless, a strategy that provides antibiotics to large numbers of children to prevent non-specific infectious diseases to improve growth parameters is currently not advised based on our study.</p><p>In summary, we were unable to detect differences in anthropometry measurements in communities randomized to receive an extra mass azithromycin distribution; there were fewer cases of stunting and wasting with the extra treatment, but the result was not significant. There may not be an association between antibiotics and enhanced growth, or this trial may not have been powerful enough to detect an association. Larger studies, longer studies, or longitudinal measurements of growth may be able to find a beneficial effect of antibiotics on growth if it exists.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors thank the data and safety monitoring committee, including Douglas Jabs, MD, MBA (chair); Antoinette Darville, MD; Maureen Maguire, PhD; and Grace Saguti, MD, who were generous with their time and advice and met before and during the study.
