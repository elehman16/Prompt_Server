This 95 staff was divided into two groups: Experimental (<italic>n</italic> = 47) and control (<italic>n</italic> = 48). A sample of this study includes all staff working in medical emergencies as many as 95 persons who showed their interest to participate in this study. Purposive sampling method and size in this study were similar to the total population. In Iran, prehospital emergency medical handled by the graduate of an emergency medical technician and a bachelor and only men is graduates in this field. Moreover, there are a number of general physicians in the central dispatch who provide medical consultation for people who call emergency medical services (EMS) and also give medical advice to the technicians who treat victims at the crash scene or on the way to the hospital.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Then, all personnel filled out a demographic variables&#x02019; questionnaire.

In this regard, any significant difference was not observed between research units in both groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). decision-making and critical thinking skill of personnel was evaluated before and after the intervention.</p><p>Decision-making skill was evaluated in twenty questions using decision-making questionnaire. According to Likert Scale, each question was scored in four levels from 0.25 to 1. The minimum and maximum score in this questionnaire stood at 5 and 20, respectively. In other words, the lowest score in this questionnaire was calculated 5, whereas the highest score stood at 20. Translation and preparation stages of questionnaire were conducted.</p><p>In the same direction, face and content validity of the questionnaire was approved by five professors.

Unfortunately, a study has not thus far been conducted with regard to the determination of decision-making skill among personnel of medical emergencies.</p><p>In a study which was conducted by Gunnarsson and Stomberg in Sweden, he examined factors affecting decision making among EMS personnel in emergency centers. In his study, he reported that various factors affect decision-making power of these personnel which includes as follows: Factors related to patient, factors related to the environment, factors related to colleagues, factors related to patients&#x02019; privacy issues, performance of team leader, staff technical know&#x02013;how and knowledge and moral contradictions, etc.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] It should be noted that these issues make decision making very difficult for these people and sometimes, would lead to unsuccessful decisions.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>In a study conducted by Franklin <italic>et al</italic>., they examined the way of decision-making among staff of medical emergency and reported that method of staff's decision-making has high relationship with the mental processes, cognitive abilities, degree of sensitiveness of decision, power of cognition (judgment), solving problem, and organizational situation of their workplace. Therefore, quality decision-making training courses should be organized at higher levels by adopting better decisions. Hence, to make better decision, staff must make an educated decision at higher levels, and education in healthcare environment merely should go step further. Generally speaking, high&#x02013;level training courses should be disseminated in this regard.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>Furthermore, results of study conducted by Dy and Purnell showed that a variety of factors effect on the complexity of decision-making process among personnel in healthcare and treatment system, the most important of which include as follows: ability and talent of individuals, level of culture, ability of patient, level of knowledge and information, method of establishing relationship, ability of solving problem, etc. To adopt the best decision, personnel should strengthen and improve the aforesaid skills among themselves.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p>Pitt <italic>et al</italic>. also reported that promoting critical thinking skills can increase professional competency and qualifications of nurses to a great extent, the issue of which as of paramount importance for personnel working in special emergency wards.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</p><p>Thaiposri and Wannapiroon also studied the impact of conceptual methods in promoting critical thinking skill and enumerated problem-solving method as one of methods of strengthening and improving critical thinking skill which is a solid evidence of the said claim.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</p><p>Popil also showed that the critical thinking skill can be promoted using challenge methods such as case study.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The results a study conducted by Roberts <italic>et al</italic>. and Heidari and Ebrahimi emphasizing on decision-making skill, confirm these results.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</p><p>With due observance to the results of this study and given the significance which is considered for empowering associate's degree personnel of medical emergencies in terms of problem-solving skills, it can be concluded that these skills are weak among them. Hence, to attain the best decisions, providers should receive on-the-job training to foster strong problem-solving and decision-making skills that can be utilized in the field and on the front lines of Iranian emergency medicine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Finally, despite the significance of decision making and its influence on the way of managing and caring victims, the results of studies conducted in Iran show the insufficient skill of personnel in decision-making and critical thinking process.</p><p>Considering the job sensitivity of staff working in medical emergencies and significance of decision-making power and ability of critical thinking in them, it can be said that giant stride can be taken in line with promoting scientific and job level of associate's degree personnel working in medical emergencies.</p><p>In general, status of this scientific course can be promoted to a great extent. Considering that this study has been conducted among students in medical emergencies, generalization of results of this study to other students is impossible, so that this study is recommended to be conducted in other academic courses with high number of students.</p><p>In other words, results of this study cannot be generalized to other students.
