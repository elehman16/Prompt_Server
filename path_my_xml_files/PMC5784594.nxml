It is the fourth most common reason why women attend gynaecology outpatient clinics and accounts for one-fifth of all gynaecology outpatient referrals. Initial treatment in primary care is medical - either by means of oral or injected medication or the levonorgestrel-intrauterine system (Mirena&#x000ae;). If medical treatment fails then surgical treatment can be offered, either endometrial ablation (EA), which destroys the lining of the cavity of the uterus (endometrium), or hysterectomy, i.e. surgical removal of the uterus.</p><p id="Par2">While effective, conventional hysterectomy is invasive and carries a risk of complications due to injury to other pelvic structures. The procedure can be simplified and complications minimised by undertaking a &#x02018;supracervical&#x02019; hysterectomy where the cervix is left in situ and only the body of the uterus removed.

For clinical purposes, HMB is defined as excessive menstrual blood loss which interferes with the woman&#x02019;s physical, emotional, social and material quality of life (QoL), and which can occur alone or in combination with other symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">The condition accounts for one-fifth of all gynaecology outpatient referrals and has a major impact on women&#x02019;s physical, emotional, social and material QoL. The condition is initially treated by general practitioners, either by means of oral or injected medication or insertion of the levonorgestrel-intrauterine system (Mirena&#x000ae;). If medical treatment fails, surgical treatment can be offered, either in the form of endometrial ablation (EA), which destroys the lining of the cavity of the uterus (endometrium), or hysterectomy, i.e. surgical removal of the uterus. However, neither medical treatment nor EA can guarantee complete resolution of symptoms. Up to 59% of women on oral drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and 13.5% of those using the levonorgestrel-intrauterine system (Mirena) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] require surgery within two years, while 19% of women treated by EA go on to have a hysterectomy for relief of their symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">Hospital Episode Statistics data indicate that a total of 136,921 hysterectomies and 128,434 EAs for HMB were performed in England and Wales between April 1997 and December 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. EA is commonly performed at present by means of second-generation or non-hysteroscopic procedures including thermal balloon EA and bipolar electrode EA (Novasure&#x000ae; (Hologic Inc.)).</p><p id="Par39">The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline on HMB recommends both EA as well as hysterectomy as options for women with HMB resistant to medical treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], but a significant minority of women treated with EA are likely need further EA or hysterectomy. A recent individual patient data meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] of results from randomised trials has shown that despite the greater invasiveness, longer hospital stay and prolonged recovery associated with conventional hysterectomy (removal of the uterus and the cervix), fewer women are dissatisfied with it in comparison with EA. Additionally, a cost-effectiveness model based on these data also favoured hysterectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A Health Technology Assessment (HTA) evidence synthesis report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] showed that one-quarter of all women who undergo EA will require subsequent gynaecological surgery, with just under one-fifth requiring hysterectomy. These findings, which are consistent with those of a relevant Cochrane review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], suggest that the optimal surgical treatment for HMB unresponsive to medical treatment may well be hysterectomy, but its effectiveness needs to be balanced against its invasiveness and increased short-term and long-term morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">Unlike conventional hysterectomy, the more recent approach of laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy (LASH) removes the body of the uterus, which is responsible for menstrual bleeding, but conserves the cervix and the uterosacral ligament complex. It is minimally invasive, quick, relatively easy to learn and associated with low risk of complications, short hospital stay (under 24&#x000a0;h) and rapid recovery time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and could potentially provide the benefits of a conventional hysterectomy without its morbidity and prolonged recovery time.</p><p id="Par41">Before this technique is incorporated into routine clinical practice, it is important that it is subjected to robust evaluation. Authors of two small randomised trials comparing LASH with a first-generation EA&#x02014;endometrial resection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]&#x02014;or second-generation EA&#x02014;thermal balloon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]&#x02014;suggest that LASH could lead to a better QoL, but have emphasised the need for larger evaluative studies to confirm this, a view endorsed by the relevant Cochrane and HTA reviews.</p><p id="Par42">The last decade has seen widespread use of laparoscopic techniques in gynaecology due to increased familiarity with the procedures, more sophisticated instruments, better training and greater surgical skill. As a result of this, LASH could be delivered by most general gynaecologists with minimal morbidity to women who are currently being treated with EA. Advances in perioperative care also means that, unlike conventional hysterectomy, hospital stay in women treated by this procedure may not be any longer than in those receiving EA.</p><p id="Par43">HEALTH (Hysterectomy or Endometrial AbLation Trial for Heavy menstrual bleeding) is a multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing LASH with second-generation EA (the current first line surgical treatment for HMB) in terms of clinical and cost-effectiveness. The trial is relevant and timely, as a robust evaluation of this new surgical option will provide much-needed high-quality evidence to underpin any decision to offer it as a preferred treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par44">We have designed a multicentre RCT of alternative surgical treatments for women with HMB. The trial structure is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> (flow diagram). The rationale for our proposed trial design reflects the uncertainties in the evidence base in this clinical area. EA is a successful treatment in the short term, but as around 20% of women who fail to benefit from this procedure will need further treatment such as repeat ablation or hysterectomy, it is important to address the impact of these events on relative cost-effectiveness. Conventional hysterectomy (where the cervix is removed along with the body of the uterus through an open procedure) is a definitive treatment, but is also potentially more morbid, with a longer postoperative recovery time. LASH offers the permanence of a conventional hysterectomy by means of a less invasive procedure with a quick recovery time.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>HEALTH flow diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2374_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study population</title><p id="Par45">We aim to recruit women aged&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;50&#x000a0;years with HMB who are eligible for EA from approximately 30 active secondary care NHS hospitals in the UK which can carry out both surgical procedures.

The surgical procedures have been agreed and standardised by consensus within the research team and recruiting gynaecologists. EA will be performed using second-generation techniques under either local or general anaesthetic.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy (LASH)</title><p id="Par53">LASH involves removal of the upper part of the uterus or the body by means of keyhole surgery facilitated by use of morcellation or culdotomy to remove the uterine corpus. The uterine body contains the endometrial cavity lined with tissue which undergoes cyclic growth and shedding each month thus causing menstrual bleeding. Increased access to specialised laparoscopic equipment and training means that LASH is quick and relatively easy to learn. It is associated with low morbidity, short hospital stay (under 24&#x000a0;h) and rapid recovery time. Unlike conventional total hysterectomy, the cervix is not removed, thus removing the need for bladder dissection, extended surgery around the cervix and often disruption of the uterosacral ligament complex. These extra steps, necessary for the removal of the cervix, can lead to serious complications such as injury to the bladder, ureters and blood vessels. As the cervix is retained, cervical smears are still required and although most women will cease to have periods after the procedure, light menstrual loss can occur in 5&#x02013;10% of cases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Endometrial ablation (EA)</title><p id="Par54">EA aims to treat HMB by destroying the endometrium (lining of the womb) which is responsible for heavy periods. Historically, a number of methods have been used to achieve this. Initially, in operations involving so called &#x02018;first-generation&#x02019; techniques, the interior of the uterine cavity was visualised endoscopically and the endometrial lining resected or ablated using electric diathermy or laser energy. More recently, &#x02018;second-generation&#x02019; techniques which did not require hysteroscopic visualisation of the uterine cavity became popular. Current second-generation procedures used in the UK include thermal balloon EA and a bipolar radiofrequency electrode EA device known as Novasure&#x000ae; (Hologic, Inc.). Thermal balloon EA is undertaken by means of a silicone balloon which is introduced through the cervix into the uterine cavity. Hot fluid circulating within the balloon ensures endometrial destruction and the temperature and duration of treatment is carefully controlled electronically by means of a computer attached to the device. Novasure&#x000ae; uses radiofrequency energy delivered through an intrauterine mesh electrode which expands on insertion through the cervix to fit the shape of the uterine cavity. These EA techniques significantly reduce menstrual loss and result in complete cessation of bleeding in 40&#x02013;50% of women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Second-generation EA procedures can be performed either under general or local anaesthetic, costing the NHS &#x000a3;995 per procedure carried out as a day case in 2011/2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Identification and enrolment of potential participants</title><p id="Par55">The consultant gynaecologist, dedicated research nurse or designated team member at outpatient gynaecology clinics and pre-assessment clinics in each recruiting centre will identify all eligible women referred from primary care for consideration of surgery for HMB. As local procedures at the participating hospitals are different, the timing and mode of approach to women and the consent process may vary in order to accommodate both the specific circumstances at each site and the needs of the women. The local recruitment team will give or send a patient information leaflet (PIL) describing the study to each eligible woman who will have the opportunity to discuss the study with her gynaecologist. Women will also have the opportunity to discuss all aspects of the proposed research with the local clinical team (staff at pre-admission clinics and ward staff while admitted), the Research Nurse, family and friends and, if appropriate, with their GP before admission. Women may decide to participate during an initial consultation with their gynaecologist, during a subsequent visit to hospital (e.g. a clinic appointment, a pre-assessment visit or when they are admitted for surgery) or alternatively at home. If the woman agrees to be contacted at home (recorded on the Surgical Assessment Form), she may receive a telephone call from the local research nurse to discuss any queries. Women who decide to participate following telephone counselling can either send their completed documents (consent form and baseline questionnaire) through the post to the local team at their treating hospital or bring it with them if they are returning to hospital for another consultation or surgery.</p><p id="Par56">The PIL and consent form refer to the possibility of long-term follow-up to determine the incidence of future operations (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Randomisation and allocation</title><p id="Par57">Eligible and consenting participants are randomised to one of the two study groups in a 1:1 allocation ratio using the randomisation application at the trial office at the Centre for Healthcare Randomised Trials (CHaRT).

Sensitivity analyses (such as using a multiple imputation approach) will also explore what influence missing data might have on the robustness of our findings and where feasible modelling non-ignorable (informative) missing data mechanisms. A further analysis of patient satisfaction will use a proportional odds model utilising the underlying ordinal (Likert) scale (Ologit function, Statacorp, 2012).

We will estimate costs of the initial intervention procedures from resource use data recorded on the CRFs of each individual patient (including time in theatre, staff present, any perioperative complications and length of stay in hospital post treatment) coupled with routine unit cost data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. We will also value any subsequent contacts with primary and secondary care (collected from patient questionnaires at six months after surgery and 15&#x000a0;months after randomisation), for each patient using nationally accepted sources of unit costs. Since the EQ-5D is the recommended instrument for deriving QALY weights by NICE (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nice.org.uk/process/pmg9/chapter/foreword">https://www.nice.org.uk/process/pmg9/chapter/foreword</ext-link>), we will use participant responses to this instrument (at baseline, six weeks and six months after surgery and 15&#x000a0;months after randomisation) to derive QALYs. The SF-12 is being included as another potentially more sensitive measure of general health-related QoL and will provide an alternative means for estimating QALYs via the SF-6D scoring algorithm. We will undertake this as a sensitivity analysis at 12&#x000a0;months. Productivity losses will be estimated based on the reported time taken to return to normal activities (assessed at six weeks after surgery) and responses to work productivity questions at six months after surgery and 15&#x000a0;months after randomisation. We will value time lost from paid employment using national age-/sex-specific average gross wage rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. We will estimate the value of time lost from alternative non-paid activities using appropriate shadow prices.</p><p id="Par80">Analysis of the patient level cost and QALY data will use appropriately specified generalised linear regression models adjusted for baseline EQ-5D score and minimisation factors applied during randomisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. From these analysis models, the co-efficient for the treatment allocation group will provide estimates of the incremental costs and QALYs associated with LASH vs EA. We will characterise uncertainty surrounding the joint estimates of incremental costs and effects by running the regression models on a large number of bootstrapped samples obtained, with replacement, from the original trial sample. This process will generate a large number of estimates of the incremental costs and effects, capturing any correlation between them. We will plot these results on the incremental cost-effectiveness plane and use them to derive a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve, indicating the probability of LASH being cost-effective (at 12&#x000a0;months) given different notional values of decision-makers&#x02019; willingness to pay per QALY gained. The primary analysis will assess cost-effectiveness from the health service perspective, but we will also conduct a secondary analysis incorporating wider costs to society. As a further step to help present the 12-month findings in a meaningful way for decision-makers, we will present all costs and outcomes within a cost&#x02013;consequence balance sheet. This will summarise all the costs and trial outcomes by treatment allocation group and indicate which treatment group each outcome favours.</p><p id="Par81">While the within-trial analysis will be useful for informing cost-effectiveness in the short term, previous research suggests that a longer time horizon may be required to determine the relative cost-effectiveness of LASH vs EA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], as a result of EA being less costly and effective in the short term but associated with higher failure rates and subsequent surgery beyond 12&#x000a0;months. Therefore, we will develop a simple Markov model to simulate the recurrence of symptoms and need for subsequent treatment over time, in order to estimate cost-effectiveness in the longer term. We will construct the model in consultation with clinicians and based on a review of existing decision models developed in the field. Input parameters will initially be informed by the within-trial analysis (to determine initial treatment costs and outcomes and the probability of any subsequent treatment events/complications occurring within 12&#x000a0;months). This will be supplemented with published data on recurrence and the need for further gynaecological surgery (repeat EA, LASH or conventional total hysterectomy) following EA and LASH. The model will incorporate the initial health service costs of treatment, ongoing costs associated with successful and unsuccessful treatment, and costs associated with subsequent surgery. We will apply utility weights (obtained from the trial data) to the alternative states in the model, allowing modelled QALYs to be estimated. We will run the model over a five-year period (the time point by which most women would be expected to have completed any subsequent required treatment), though we will also explore the impact of adopting longer time horizons. Linkage of participants&#x02019; records to health episode statistics will allow future quantification of the incidence of repeat gynaecological surgery, providing a means for validating/updating initial model based predictions.</p><p id="Par82">We will carry out probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analysis to characterise the uncertainty surrounding the model based estimates of incremental costs and effects of LASH vs EA. For the Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis (PSA), we will assign an appropriate distribution to each model input parameter (reflecting the degree of uncertainty surrounding it due to sampling variation) and we will analyse the model a large number of times, each time randomly drawing a value for each input parameter from its assigned distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This process will generate a large number of estimates of the incremental costs and effects. We will use cost-effectiveness acceptability curves to summarise the findings from the PSA. Further deterministic analysis will assess the sensitivity of the model based estimates to further choices over sources of parameter estimates and any structural assumptions required when constructing the model.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Research governance, data protection and sponsorship</title><sec id="Sec29"><title>Research governance</title><p id="Par83">The trial is under the auspices of CHaRT based at the Health Services Research Unit (HSRU), University of Aberdeen.
