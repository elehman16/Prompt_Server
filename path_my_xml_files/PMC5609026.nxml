This paper describes the perspectives of nurse counsellors (NCs) and school liaisons (SLs). SLs were teachers or administrative personnel at the schools who coordinated the study visits of participants with the NCs. We focus on the impediments and catalysts to and recommendations for treatment implementation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">NCs (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3) and SLs (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3) who participated in the RCT during 2014 were purposively recruited by telephone and participated in face-to-face semi-structured in-depth interviews that were recorded and doubly transcribed. Thematic content analysis was applied using Atlas.ti software to identify emerging themes. This paper describes the impediments and catalysts to provide psychotherapy by task-shifting in a community setting across three sub-themes: personal, community, and collaborative care.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Although nurses were initially resistant to supervision it was central to personally coping with complex interventions, managing traumatic content, and working apart from a multi-disciplinary team. Delivering the interventions in the community presented multiple logistical impediments (e.g. transport, communication, venue suitability) which required creative solutions. In light of resource shortages, networking is central to effective delivery and uptake of the interventions. Collaboration between government departments of health and education may have a major impact on providing school-based psychotherapy through task-shifting.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Impediments to implementation are not insurmountable.

Because of resource shortages, this approach has risen in popularity in the treatment of various health problems including tuberculosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], midwifery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Task-shifting has been used to treat PTSD: (i) in adult refugees placed in Uganda by applying narrative exposure therapy and trauma counselling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], (ii) adult survivors of systematic violence in Thailand and Iraq using Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], (iii) adult survivors of torture in Iraq using Cognitive Processing Therapy and CETA in community settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and (iv) in orphaned and vulnerable children in Zambian community settings using trauma focused cognitive behaviour therapy (TF-CBT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These studies did not report on the in depth experiences of the non-specialist health workers who provided the task-shifted interventions.</p><p id="Par13">Other studies report that task-shifting implementation can be hindered by professional and institutional resistance (e.g. seeing task-shifting as competition), lack of regulatory frameworks, limited funding, concerns about the quality of care (e.g. not acting in close consultation with specialist) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], interruptions, lack of privacy, and costs of ongoing expert training and supervision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The efficacy of task-shifting is dependent on training, supervision, support and teamwork, regardless of field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Practical training is the most effective way to train new skills and to reduce the anxiety of undertaking complex new responsibilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. For example, community mental health workers and stakeholders in Ghana highlighted the need to review task-shifting roles, training, and supervision arrangements to ensure quality of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives</title><p id="Par14">No existing studies exclusively provide qualitative descriptions of the barriers, facilitators, and recommendations for implementation of task-shifting in a community based setting from the perspectives of non-specialist health workers. We sought to explore the impediments and catalysts to and recommendations for the implementation of psychotherapeutically informed task-shifting interventions, through the lenses of NCs and SLs. Their perspectives are important when considering rapid scale-up of these evidence-based interventions in community settings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Framework</title><p id="Par15">We undertook a nested, qualitative study evaluating the experiences of stakeholders who participated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. We used a biomedically influenced empiricist framework, which places emphasis on biomedical causal mechanisms, evidence-based practices and measurable outcomes. Both first and second authors are practicing clinical psychologists from an upper-middle class background and, as such, the data was not approached in a value-free manner. Instead, the authors utilized their knowledge obtained through clinical practice. In order to neutralize the researchers&#x02019; inherent investment in the success of the task-shifting paradigm, an empiricist framework was adopted. The authors were concerned with uncovering the truth and presenting it through empirical means [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], believing knowledge to be hard, real, and acquirable. Thus a systematic methodology that relied on control was employed in data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>RCT sampling</title><p id="Par16">For the above mentioned RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], registered nurses studying towards a diploma in advanced psychiatry were trained (5&#x000a0;days of theoretical and practical application) in prolonged exposure therapy for adolescents (PE-A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and supportive counselling (SC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">In 2014, six nurses volunteered to participate in the study as an opportunity to add variety to their course prescribed practical hours. All six met the inclusion criteria (doing an advanced nursing certificate in psychiatry and having their own transport) and received the training. NCs were allocated to treatment and participant through block randomization. As such, NCs were randomly assigned to PE-A and SC cases. The nurses received weekly group supervision with the trainer (second author is a male psychologist, experienced PE-A and SC therapist and supervisor, study PI) where they discussed video recordings of both PE-A and SC cases.</p><p id="Par18">The interventions were provided at participating schools, except during school holidays when sessions were moved to the Stellenbosch University campus. To facilitate these meetings, each school nominated a staff member (e.g. teacher, secretary) to act as liaison between the school, NC, and adolescent counselee.</p><p id="Par19">Fifty-three adolescents from four schools volunteered for the RCT during 2014, 12 of whom consented and met inclusion criteria (13&#x02013;18&#x000a0;years old, PTSD diagnosis by independent evaluator). There were four active SLs during 2014.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Nested study sampling</title><p id="Par20">Data was collected in 2015 where all of the stakeholders who had been in the trial in 2014 [NCs (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6), SLs (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4), adolescent participants (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;12)], were telephonically invited to participate in the qualitative study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. All were invited regardless of treatment arm or completion status in an attempt to draw on a broad range of experiences. Participants were informed that their feedback could provide valuable insights on improving the interventions and that their feedback, participation, or withdrawal would not affect their status in the RCT.</p><p id="Par21">The first author, a clinical psychologist new to the study, conducted in person semi-structured interviews with the SLs (discussion schedule Appendix <xref rid="Sec37" ref-type="sec">A</xref>), NCs (discussion schedule Appendix <xref rid="Sec38" ref-type="sec">B</xref>), and adolescents (results provided elsewhere). The discussion schedule was used as a flexible tool to guide exploration of stakeholder experiences to inform the research team about the acceptability, feasibility, and impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] of the task-shifting interventions. Interviews ranged between 30 and 90&#x000a0;min. SLs and NCs were specifically questioned about their experiences of providing or coordinating treatment at school, perceived impediments to implementation, and recommendations for future intervention delivery. Interviews took place at Stellenbosch University Campus or at the representative school, as best suited to participants.

Nurses wrestled with the notion of <italic>&#x0201c;keep[ing] your professional distance&#x0201d;</italic> (&#x02018;Natalia&#x02019;) during counselling. This challenge was amplified by not being prepared <italic>&#x0201c;for what the children would actually tell you&#x0201d;</italic> (&#x02018;Natasha&#x02019;), knowing that the child would be returning to a <italic>&#x0201c;dysfunctional system&#x0201d;</italic> (&#x02018;Noleen&#x02019;), being <italic>&#x0201c;acutely aware of their circumstances&#x0201d;</italic> (&#x02018;Natalia&#x02019;), and feeling guilt about <italic>&#x0201c;leaving them again&#x0201d;</italic> (&#x02018;Noleen&#x02019;).<disp-quote><p id="Par37">

<italic>When I started there I, yoh, took everything home with me. Everything. Until the school psychologist told me: you cut off!

It is not surprising that the adolescents so freely shared their experiences and put their trust in the adults who showed an interest, as was also indicated in previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This highlights the importance of providing teachers and nurses with the necessary support and training in order to assist them with keeping professional boundaries. Although initially resistant to supervision, it was central to the success of the intervention and provided an excellent vehicle to support the NCs while functioning away from the MDT. It may be advisable to include a one on one individual supervision session to navigate personality differences and counteract missing valuable feedback. Whilst valuable, supervision during training may not be feasible due to resource constraints at training institutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. NCs reports of anxiety initiating the delivery of the interventions highlights the importance of ensuring that intervention manuals are as simple as possible. When employing task-shifting, enough time should be allocated to training not only to ensure successful delivery of the intervention, but build confidence in the service providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Community care</title><p id="Par66">Logistical limitations included transport, communication, and securing suitable times and venues for sessions. NCs took pride in their work and felt frustrated when the logistical arrangements were not done as professionally as they would have liked. In providing community based care, service providers will have to become more flexible to allow for sustainable service delivery. One way to help them accept these practical challenges (e.g. getting lost, miscommunication, appointments being late or not kept, trouble securing venues), could be to reduce their fear of being reprimanded for not following the red-tape associated with the service. Supervision and support could help service providers to navigate their anxiety of being perceived as unprofessional or ill-prepared. With Cape Town being labelled as the most congested city in South Africa in 2016 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tomtom.com">http://www.tomtom.com</ext-link>), it is not surprising that the nurses found driving to and from the schools daunting.
