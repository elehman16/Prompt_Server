The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the School of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. An informed consent, which explained the details of our project, was signed by parents of these children before any intervention.

In children with corrective glasses, the filters were set on their glasses.</p><p>In the present study, I-BiT&#x02122; system was designed in the format of different known games including Pac-Man, Snake, and Tetris for their quick learning in both red and green formats corresponding to the colored filter against the amblyopic eye (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). We asked children to play with all of these games to hold their interest in each session. In addition, to attract more attention, sound stimuli were added to the games. All games were designed by the Dot Net Framework version 2.0 Package (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington). This application runs on the Windows 7 or higher operating system without the requirement of any third party software, so its installation is simplified on any personal computer at home.</p><p>At the first session, the games were explained to the child who was asked to play at the clinic under supervision of a skilled Optometrist, and parents were taught how to install the software. Then CD games and one red&#x02013;green glasses matching with the child's amblyopic eye were given to them.</p><p>The child was asked to play I-BiT&#x02122; games binocularly for 30&#x000a0;min a day, 5 days a week for one month (a total time of 10&#x000a0;h). Younger children who were not able to play games by mouse were suggested to use the keyboard instead of the mouse to play easier and improve the hand-eye coordination. If the child could pass each level successfully, the difficulty of games was increased, making the amblyopic eye follow the moving targets with higher speed. Due to controlling the adherence of children to the daily patching or I-BiT&#x02122; playing, we asked their parents to supervise them and record their time. In addition, the cooperation of the children was checked by calling their parents every week.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><title>Periodic follow-ups</title><p>The BCVA measurement was repeated at the both follow-ups of 1&#x000a0;month at the end of I-BiT&#x02122; treatment and one month after cessation of its playing.

To assess the improvement within the groups, we used Linear Mixed Model (LMM) and multiple comparison considered by the Bonferroni method. To evaluate the difference between the groups, we adjusted for the baseline values, and we used Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA). All statistical analysis was performed by SPSS (IBM Corp.
