As a data entry tool, handheld computers have a number of advantages over paper-based data collection including reduced paperwork, transcription errors, time and cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In some clinical settings it has been estimated that the use of a handheld computer can save nurses nearly two hours per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Handheld computers have been adapted into a variety of research and clinical settings and available software allows integration into many database types. However, studies have not documented the accuracy of data collection using handheld computers. There is an underlying assumption they are better than a paper-based system.</p><p>We recently completed a longitudinal prospective randomised controlled trial of 461 palliative patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] followed from referral to a specialised palliative care service until death. This trial generated more than 2 million paper-based data entry points. Prior to instituting handheld computers for data collection and entry, we assessed user accuracy. Our aim was to use handheld computers to reduce trial nurse's workload.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants, Methods, and Results</title><p>An Ethics Committee-approved comparison study was undertaken with 6 trial forms. Staff undertook training on Compaq Pocket PCs model iPAQ H3950. Research nurses completed a traditional paper-based form that was entered into a database by administrative staff in parallel with the same nurse completing an electronic form on the handheld computer. Data were transferred from the handheld computer using a manual cradle. Results of these two methods were compared for discrepancies; the paper form was considered the gold standard.</p><p>A total of 2001 data elements from 29 consecutive trial participants were entered using both electronic and paper-based methods. Error rates for data entry using the handheld computers were 67.5 errors per 1000 fields, much higher than the accepted 10 per 10,000 fields for paper-based double data entry[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Error rates were highest in fields containing a default value such as a date.</p><p>Staff found the handheld computers easy to use and liked using them as a reference tool however they reported discomfort using them for data collection. As reported elsewhere, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] we experienced a number of technical problems with uploading and downloading data that caused frustration and dissatisfaction. This may have been reduced using a wireless system.</p></sec><sec><title>Comment</title><p>Rarely have evaluations of user accuracy been undertaken when introducing new technologies for data collection. In contrast to the belief that handheld computers would decrease error rates, we found unacceptably high error rates. This finding has implications for the introduction of electronic data collection for research or clinical purposes without an adequate testing phase.</p><p>Error rates need to be monitored if handheld computers are to be used both at the time they are introduced, and in an ongoing way.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>TSJ carried out conception and design, obtaining funding, acquisition of data; analysis and interpretation of data and drafting of the manuscript.

We would also like to thank Christine Lillie for recruiting the participants into the study as well as all the Southern Adelaide Palliative Services community palliative care nurses for collecting the data for this study. Further, we would like to thank all the GPs, patients and families who generously agreed to participate in this study.</p></sec></ack><ref-list><ref id="B1"><citation citation-type="other"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Saleh</surname><given-names>KJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Radosevich</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></name><name><surname>Kassim</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name><name><surname>Moussa</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Dykes</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Bottolfson</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Gioe</surname><given-names>TJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Robinson</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Comparison of commonly used orthopaedic outcome measures using palm-top computers and paper surveys</article-title><source>Journal of Orthopaedic Research</source><year>1920</year><fpage>1146</fpage><lpage>1151</lpage></citation></ref><ref id="B2"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Shaw</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>May</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>An Australian agency revolutionizes home care with the palm pilot</article-title><source>Caring</source><year>2004</year><volume>23</volume><fpage>30</fpage><lpage>32</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14870479</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B3"><citation citation-type="journal"><article-title>Organizational learning: could it be the key to higher quality and increased revenues?</article-title><source>Healthcare Benchmarks &#x00026; Quality Improvement</source><year>2002</year><volume>9</volume><fpage>37</fpage><lpage>40</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12412441</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B4"><citation citation-type="other"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abernethy</surname><given-names>AP</given-names></name><name><surname>Currow</surname><given-names>DC</given-names></name><name><surname>Hunt</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Roder-Allen</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Rowett</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Shelby-James</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Esterman</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>May</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Phillips</surname><given-names>PA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A pragmatic 2 x 2 x 2 factorial cluster randomized controlled trial of educational outreach visiting and case conferencing in palliative care-methodology of the Palliative Care Trial [ISRCTN 81117481]</article-title><source>Contemporary Clinical Trials 27(1):83-100,</source><year>2006</year></citation></ref><ref id="B5"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Day</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Fayers</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Harvey</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Double data entry: What value, what price?</article-title><source>Controlled Clinical Trials</source><year>1998</year><volume>19</volume><fpage>15</fpage><lpage>24</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9492966</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0197-2456(97)00096-2</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B6"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chan</surname><given-names>SS</given-names></name><name><surname>Chu</surname><given-names>CP</given-names></name><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>BC</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>PP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Data management using the personal digital assistant in an acute pain service</article-title><source>Anaesthesia &#x00026; Intensive Care</source><year>2004</year><volume>32</volume><fpage>81</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15058126</pub-id></citation></ref></ref-list></back></article>
