<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Thus, the primary prevention of depressive disorder is an important strategy for global mental health. In addition, stress has enormous socioeconomic implications for all spheres of employment in terms of absenteeism, staff turnover, lost productivity, poor morale, etc.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Although the burden of stress and depression on the workplace is substantial,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> few studies aiming to prevent psychosocial problems have been conducted.</p><p>Two previous meta-analyses have shown that cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is an effective preventive measure for major depressive disorder. One meta-analysis reported that the risk of depressive disorder decreased by 16% on average in the intervention group and summarised 15 various types of CBTs.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Another meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a CBT program, &#x02018;Coping with Depression (CwD)&#x02019;,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> showed that the program can also prevent major depressive disorder and indicated a 38% decrease in the risk among participants in the program.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> However, major limitations exist in the dissemination of these CBT interventions: the programs require that professionals be well trained in CBT;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;12</xref> time, cost and stigma are other barriers to access to a CBT program.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>An innovative way to deliver CBT-based treatment widely is by using computerised CBT (CCBT) and CCBT via the internet (iCBT). Both CCBT and iCBT programs teach basic information and skills based on the same CBT principles as face-to-face CBT programs, with a highly structured format comprised of educational lessons, homework assignments and supplementary resources.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Previous studies have shown a significant positive treatment effect of CCBT and iCBT programs on depression and anxiety in the clinical setting.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> An iCBT program is particularly beneficial with its high anonymity<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and high accessibility.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Recently, there have been increasing applications of iCBT for preventing depression. Using self-reported symptoms of depression as an outcome, one study of adolescents reported a significant prevention effect of iCBT programs, though it included only male participants.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In addition, one study of university students<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and one community-based study<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> reported a significant effect of iCBT programs on improving depressive symptoms in non-clinical settings. However, one community-based study failed to show a significant effect.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> We also have reported that a six-session iCBT program successfully improved symptoms of depression in an RCT in the workplace.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> However, a search of the literature revealed only one previous RCT (conducted by the authors),<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> which investigated the effect of an iCBT program on reducing the risk of major depressive episodes (MDEs) diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV diagnostic criteria.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The control group was also provided with a treatment program during the follow-up.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Thus, evidence for the effect of an iCBT on reducing risk of MDE is still very limited.</p><p>A previous follow-up survey of employees in a company showed that the incidence of DSM-IV major depressive disorder was 2.8% during 12&#x02005;months in Japan.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> If we randomise about 8000 participants equally to intervention and control groups (4000 in each group), the total incidence will be 146 (55 and 91 in the intervention and control groups, respectively), assuming that incidence ratio (IR)=0.62 (see sample size calculation in method and analysis for details). Since the number of participants will be large, it would not be possible to conduct face-to-face or even telephone interviews to ascertain the occurrence of MDE during the follow-up; it is a feasible strategy to use the web-based self-report version of a standard structured interview, such as the WHO-Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) V.3.0 depression section,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> which has been shown to have good concordance with the clinical diagnosis of MDE<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and an acceptable 1-year test-retest reproducibility.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> While a self-report assessment of MDE is clearly a major limitation, only such an instrument is feasible for a large-scale trial to reduce the risk of MDE diagnosed strictly following DSM-IV/DSM-5 criteria, which cannot be made by a symptom checklist.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Objectives</title><p>The present study is a 12-month follow-up large-scale RCT. An improved iCBT program, which was based on the results of the previous study,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> will be used. The purposes of this randomised controlled study are as follows: (1) to decrease the risk of DSM-IV/DSM-5-defined MDE through the 12-month follow-up among workers in Japan; (2) to examine the effects of the iCBT program on improving the symptoms of depression at 3-month, 6-month and 12-month follow-ups among workers who have subthreshold depressive symptoms in Japan; (3) to examine the effects of the iCBT program on improving work engagement and work performance at 3-month, 6-month and 12-month follow-ups among workers in Japan; and (4) to examine the cost-effectiveness of the iCBT program. We expect that: (1) the iCBT program will reduce the risk of MDE during the 12-month follow-up; (2) it will improve symptoms of depression at 3-month, 6-month and 12-month follow-ups among workers who have subthreshold depressive symptoms at baseline; (3) it will improve work engagement and work performance at 3-month, 6-month and 12-month follow-ups; and (4) the program will be cost-effective.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Trial design</title><p>The study will be a two-arm, parallel-group, treatment as usual (TAU)-controlled, non-blinded randomised study.

These 8100 will be randomised either to the intervention group (n=4050) or to the control group (n=4050). They will be allowed to complete the six lessons within 10&#x02005;weeks after the baseline survey. Those in the control group can receive the iCBT after 12&#x02005;months. An invitation email to all workers in a corporate group will direct them to a website that includes a full explanation of the study. After reading the explanation of the study on the website, they will be asked to click on an &#x02018;agree&#x02019; button to give their consent to participate in the study; then they will proceed to the baseline questionnaire page. If a candidate clicks on a &#x02018;disagree&#x02019; button, the website page will close. In order for the randomisation and start of intervention to be as close as possible, the CRC will endeavour to randomise the participants immediately after closing the application and send an email with the iCBT program course description as soon as possible.

About 30 min are needed for each lesson, including the homework. This program can be used anywhere the internet is available.</p><p>One of the unique features of the program is that training is provided along with a Manga (Japanese comic) story of a psychologist and a client to facilitate the understanding of the participants. Several merits of using a comic story with Manga characters have been acknowledged in research on education in school. First, it helps motivate participants to stay in the program.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Second, it facilitates easy learning. A program with text combined with comic stories is easier for learners to understand compared with a text-only program.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Third, using a comic story fosters learners&#x02019; interest in the program.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> These merits might be applicable to education in the workplace because most Japanese people of working age are familiar with comics.</p><p>The present iCBT program was developed with two established CBT packages as its basis. One is the cognitive therapy program developed by Beck.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> The other is the &#x02018;CwD&#x02019; program developed by Lewinsohn.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The CBT skill components included in the program are: self-monitoring, cognitive restructuring, assertiveness, problem-solving and relaxation.

The validity of the web-based CIDI depression section has been established partially but needs further clarification and refinement. The other limitation is that the participants will be recruited from one corporate group in Japan. Most of them have their own PCs in their offices or homes.
