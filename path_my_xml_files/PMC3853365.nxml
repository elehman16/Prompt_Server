Patients with known intolerance to oral iron were excluded. A total of 338 IBD patients in clinical remission or with mild disease, a hemoglobin (Hb) &#x0003c;12&#x02009;g/dl, and a transferrin saturation (TSAT) &#x0003c;20&#x00025; were randomized 2:1 to receive either IV iron isomaltoside 1,000 according to the Ganzoni formula (225 patients) or oral iron sulfate 200&#x02009;mg daily (equivalent to 200&#x02009;mg elemental iron; 113 patients). An interactive web response system method was used to randomize the eligible patient to the treatment groups. The primary end point was change in Hb from baseline to week 8. Iron isomaltoside 1,000 and iron sulfate was compared by a non-inferiority assessment with a margin of &#x02212;0.5&#x02009;g/dl. The secondary end points, which tested for superiority, included change in Hb from baseline to weeks 2 and 4, change in <italic>s-</italic>ferritin, and TSAT to week 8, number of patients who discontinued study because of lack of response or intolerance of investigational drugs, change in total quality of life (QoL) score to weeks 4 and 8, and safety. Exploratory analyses included a responder analysis (proportion of patients with an increase in Hb &#x02265;2&#x02009;g/dl after 8 weeks), the effect of regional differences and total iron dose level, and other potential predictors of the treatment response.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Non-inferiority in change of Hb to week 8 could not be demonstrated. There was a trend for oral iron sulfate being more effective in increasing Hb than iron isomaltoside 1,000. The estimated treatment effect was &#x02212;0.37 (95&#x00025; confidence interval (CI): &#x02212;0.80, 0.06) with <italic>P</italic>=0.09 in the full analysis set (<italic>N</italic>=327) and &#x02212;0.45 (95&#x00025; CI: &#x02212;0.88, &#x02212;0.03) with <italic>P</italic>=0.04 in the per protocol analysis set (<italic>N</italic>=299). In patients treated with IV iron isomaltoside 1,000, the mean change in <italic>s-</italic>ferritin concentration was higher with an estimated treatment effect of 48.7 (95&#x00025; CI: 18.6, 78.8) with <italic>P</italic>=0.002, whereas the mean change in TSAT was lower with an estimated treatment effect of &#x02212;4.4 (95&#x00025; CI: &#x02212;7.4, &#x02212;1.4) with <italic>P</italic>=0.005, compared with patients treated with oral iron. No differences in changes of QoL were observed. The safety profile was similar between the groups. The proportion of responders with Hb &#x02265;2&#x02009;g/dl (IV group: 67&#x00025; oral group: 61&#x00025;) were comparable between the groups (<italic>P</italic>=0.32). Iron isomaltoside 1,000 was more efficacious with higher cumulative doses of &#x0003e;1,000&#x02009;mg IV. Significant predictors of Hb response to IV iron treatment were baseline Hb and C-reactive protein (CRP).</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>We could not demonstrate non-inferiority of IV iron isomaltoside 1,000 compared with oral iron in this study. Based on the dose&#x02013;response relationship observed with the IV iron compound, we suggest that the true iron demand of IV iron was underestimated by the Ganzoni formula in our study. Alternative calculations including Hb and CRP should be explored to gauge iron stores in patients with IBD.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Anemia is a frequent complication often seen in conjunction with acute exacerbation of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) with known negative impact on quality of life (QoL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). The prevalence of anemia has been reported to be 6&#x02013;74&#x00025; in IBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and anemia of chronic diseases are the most common causes of anemia in IBD. IDA is primarily caused by chronic blood loss, impaired gastrointestinal iron absorption, and upregulation of hepcidin due to inflammation, which inhibits enterocytic iron transport.</p><p>Control of the underlying inflammation and appropriate iron replacement therapy are therefore important in IBD. Although oral iron supplementation has traditionally been the treatment for IDA, intolerance often limits its use in IBD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). An international guideline for management of anemia associated with IBD recommends intravenous (IV) administration of iron in patients with IBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>), and some clinical studies support IV over oral iron supplementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). However, overall results are ambivalent because of studies in which no clear benefit in efficacy for IV over oral iron could be shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>).</p><p>The aim of this study was to explore efficacy and safety of different modes of administration of iron isomaltoside 1,000 (Monofer, Pharmacosmos A/S, Holbaek, Denmark) compared with oral iron sulfate for treatment of IDA in IBD patients. The primary objective was to demonstrate that IV iron isomaltoside 1,000 is non-inferior to oral iron sulfate in treatment of IDA secondary to IBD, evaluated as the ability to increase hemoglobin (Hb). A non-inferiority study design was chosen based on the existing literature that both iron treatments could be equally efficacious, whereas they divagate regarding dosing limitation, administration (duration and frequency), and safety and tolerability profile. A non-inferiority margin of &#x02212;0.5&#x02009;g/dl was regarded as clinically relevant. The secondary objectives were to assess other relevant hematology and biochemical parameters, the effect on QoL, and safety. As part of safety, the effect of iron isomaltoside 1,000 on <italic>s-</italic>phosphate was measured as some IV iron therapies have been found to be associated with hypophosphatemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Furthermore, exploratory analyses were performed in order to investigate the effect of regional differences and total iron dose level, and other potential predictors of the treatment response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This prospective, randomized, comparative, open-label, non-inferiority study was conducted in Austria, UK, Denmark, Hungary, and India from December 2009 to July 2012. The study protocol was approved by local ethics committees and competent authorities. The dates of the study was approved by the ethic committees are included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> online. The study was conducted in accordance with good clinical practice and the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>There were no important changes to methods after the study commenced.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>The study took place at 36 sites (hospitals or private IBD clinics): 4 sites in Austria, 1 site in United Kingdom, 5 sites each in Denmark and Hungary, and 21 sites in India.</p><p>Patients &#x02265;18 years of age with a diagnosis of IBD and a score of &#x02264;5 on the Harvey&#x02013;Bradshaw index for Crohn's disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>) or a partial Mayo score of &#x02264;6 for ulcerative colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), a Hb &#x0003c;12&#x02009;g/dl (7.45&#x02009;mmol/l), and a transferrin saturation (TSAT) &#x0003c;20&#x00025; were considered eligible to participate and if willing to provide written informed consent. The exclusion criteria were intolerance to oral iron treatment, other primary causes of anemia, hemochromatosis, hemosiderosis, hypersensitivity to IV iron complexes or iron sulfate, a history of multiple allergies, active intestinal tuberculosis/amoebic infections, liver cirrhosis, active hepatitis, acute infections, rheumatoid arthritis along with symptoms or signs of active joint inflammation, untreated vitamin B<sub>12</sub>/folate deficiency, pregnant or nursing women, and patients with extensive active bleeding necessitating blood transfusion or with planned elective surgery during the study. If the patient had participated in any other clinical study within 3 months, had taken any other IV or oral iron treatment within 4 weeks, had received blood transfusion within 4 weeks or erythropoietin within 8 weeks before screening or had any other medical condition that in the opinion of investigator may have caused the patient to be unsuitable for completion of the study or placed the patient at potential risk from being in the study, they were also excluded from participation in the study.</p><p>During the study, the patients were prohibited from having a blood transfusion, erythropoiesis stimulating agent treatment, and any iron supplementation other than investigational drugs as they would influence the outcome measures of the study. Furthermore, tetracycline, antacids, and cholestyramine were not allowed because of absorption interactions. IBD-related concomitant medication was allowed and did not necessarily need to be kept stable. All the blood samples were analyzed at two central laboratories in Europe and India. Cross-validation of laboratory values between laboratories was documented. C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured as a continuous parameter in Europe but as a positive/negative parameter in India. To be able to compare CRP across regions, CRP from European patients were evaluated as positive if &#x0003e;0.5&#x02009;mg/dl.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>The total calculated IV iron requirement and administered cumulative dose in each patient in group A was calculated according to an adapted Ganzoni formula: cumulative iron dose (mg)=(body weight (kg)&#x000d7;(target Hb&#x02212;actual Hb (g/dl)&#x000d7;2.4.&#x0002b;depot iron (set at 500&#x02009;mg) where the target Hb was 13&#x02009;g/dl (8.1&#x02009;mmol/l), compared with the suggested 15&#x02009;g/dl (9.3&#x02009;mmol/l) in the original formula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Patients in treatment group A were randomized to either (A1) single once weekly infusion of up to 1,000&#x02009;mg iron isomaltoside 1,000 (Monofer) over 15&#x02009;min until reaching cumulative dosage or to (A2) single once weekly 500&#x02009;mg bolus injections of iron isomaltoside 1,000 over 2&#x02009;min until reaching cumulative dosage. All patients in group B received 200&#x02009;mg oral iron sulfate (Ferro Duretter, manufactured by AstraZeneca, London, UK for the first batch and by GlaxoSmithKline, London, UK for the second batch; equivalent to 200&#x02009;mg elemental iron) daily for 8 weeks. The dosing of Ferro Duretter was according to the product insert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>The patients attended seven visits during the 8-week study period. The assessments performed at each visit are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref> online.</p><p>The primary end point was to assess the change in Hb from baseline to week 8. The secondary end points included change in Hb concentration from baseline to weeks 2 and 4, change in concentrations of <italic>s-</italic>ferritin and TSAT from baseline to week 8, number of patients who discontinued study because of lack of response or intolerance of investigational drugs, change in total QoL score from baseline to weeks 4 and 8 as measured by the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>), and safety (adverse events (AEs), vital signs, electrocardiogram, <italic>s</italic>-phosphate, and other safety hematology and biochemistry parameters).</p><p>Exploratory analyses included number of patients, who responded with an increase in Hb &#x02265;2&#x02009;g/dl within 8 weeks, assessment of regional differences between Europe and India, influence on different cumulative doses of iron isomaltoside 1,000 (&#x0003c;1,000&#x02009;mg,=1,000&#x02009;mg, and &#x0003e;1,000&#x02009;mg), and different biochemical makers and baseline characteristics on the Hb response.</p><p>The primary outcome was tested for non-inferiority whereas the remaining outcomes were tested for superiority. The outcomes are similar to other studies measuring treatment effect of iron treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>).</p><p>There were no changes to outcomes after the study commenced.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size calculation was based on absolute change in Hb from baseline to week 8. The non-inferiority margin was set as &#x02212;0.5&#x02009;g/dl. A two-sided significance level of 5&#x00025; was used and the power was set to 80&#x00025; and s.d. in change in Hb was assumed to be 1.5&#x02009;g/dl. Based on these assumptions, a total of 321 patients were to be included in the efficacy analyses (i.e., provided post-randomization Hb measurements).</p><p>No interim analysis of efficacy parameters was performed, but <italic>s-</italic>phosphate as part of safety laboratory were analyzed after 25, 50, and 100 patients had been exposed to iron isomaltoside 1,000. The interim analysis was not related to the non-inferiority hypothesis, but purely part of monitoring safety in the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>Permuted block randomization was used to assign patients in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either treatment A1 (weekly infusion of up to 1,000&#x02009;mg iron isomaltoside 1,000 until reaching cumulative dosage), A2 (weekly 500&#x02009;mg bolus injections of iron isomaltoside 1,000 until reaching cumulative dosage), or B (200&#x02009;mg oral iron sulfate daily for 8 weeks). The block size was 6.</p><p>The randomization list was prepared centrally by a Contract Research Organization, Max Neeman International Data Management Centre, using a validated computer program (Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) 9.1.3, SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) PROC PLAN procedure). The randomization was stratified by whether the patient had received IV iron treatment in the past or not.</p><p>An interactive web response system method was used to randomize the eligible patient to the treatment groups. When the patient data had been entered into the interactive web response system, a unique randomization number was generated for the patient, identifying which treatment the patient was allocated to. The screening and enrollment of the patients were performed by the investigator at the site, whereas the entering of the patient data into the interactive web response system generating the randomization number was typically performed by the study nurse or study coordinator.</p><p>In line with previous studies, the study was not blinded since it is almost impossible to blind for oral iron as it is indicated by black stools. Furthermore, the primary end point is a biochemical measurement which unlikely is affected by the open-label study design.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The following data sets were used in the analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>):</p><p>Safety analysis set (<italic>N</italic>=332): the safety population included all patients who were randomized and received at least one dose of the study drug.</p><p>Full analysis set (FAS; <italic>N</italic>=327): the FAS consisted of all the patients who were randomized into the study, received at least one dose of the study drug, and had at least one after baseline Hb assessment.

Also, an analysis with a separate model only including Hb was performed. In addition, the proportion of patients, who had a change in Hb &#x02265;2&#x02009;g/dl at any time from baseline to week 8, was compared between treatment groups by Fisher's exact test. Time to response was displayed by a Kaplan&#x02013;Meier plot.</p><p>Baseline characteristics and safety data are displayed descriptively.</p><p>All tests were two-sided and the significance level was 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>A total of 560 patients were screened in the period 2 December 2009 to 30 May 2012 of whom 338 were randomized into two treatment groups: (A) iron isomaltoside 1,000 (225 patients) and (B) iron sulfate (113 patients).

The elevated hepatic enzyme levels returned to normal within 2 weeks. The patient previously had marginally increased liver enzymes and it was unclear whether the observed increase in liver enzymes was related to the IV iron treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This study was a non-inferiority study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of iron isomaltoside 1,000 compared with oral iron sulfate in IBD patients with IDA. Non-inferiority at week 8 was not demonstrated and we found a trend toward a higher increase with the oral iron compound from baseline in Hb concentration at week 8.</p><p>The IV vs. oral iron dosages and study duration are not directly comparable to previous studies, where the iron dosages are lower in this study, which could be a contributing factor to the trend for oral iron inducing a higher increase in Hb than IV iron. However, the hematopoietic response to iron isomaltoside 1,000 is in the range of responses seen with other IV irons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). In this study, the oral iron sulfate demonstrated a trend toward a higher increase from baseline in Hb concentration at week 8 compared with IV iron isomaltoside 1,000. Previous reported studies are inconsistent in whether IV or oral iron is superior in increasing Hb but in the majority of studies, IV iron is the most effective treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). Change in Hb is a well-accepted end point for estimating the efficacy of iron treatment. However, a responder analysis of the number of patients with a relevant increase in Hb might pose an alternative end point. Thus, we performed a <italic>post-hoc</italic> exploratory responder analysis defined as the numbers of patients with an increase in Hb &#x02265;2&#x02009;g/dl within 8 weeks. The number of responders was 67&#x00025; in group A (IV iron isomaltoside 1,000) compared with 61&#x00025; in group B (oral iron sulfate) with comparable effects on QoL scores in both groups. A subgroup of patients receiving &#x0003e;1,000&#x02009;mg iron isomaltoside 1,000 (mean 1,313&#x02009;mg) had a &#x02265;2&#x02009;g/dl Hb response in 93&#x00025; of the patients, which points to a dose&#x02013;response relationship.</p><p>The mean change in <italic>s</italic>-ferritin concentration from baseline to week 8 was significantly higher with IV iron isomaltoside 1,000 compared with oral iron sulfate, which is in line with literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>), whereas the opposite was observed for the mean change in TSAT. In this study, the TSAT demonstrated large variability in the oral group which may be part of the explanation. Further, it could indicate a more controlled and slow release of bioavailable iron from iron isomaltoside 1,000 to iron-binding proteins with little risk of free iron toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>), where only the amount necessary to cover the need for a satisfying hematopoietic/metabolic response is released from ferritin to transferrin.</p><p>The oral Hb response was particularly pronounced in the Indians and this study suggests that regional differences may exist among patients with IBD and IDA. Patients from India had lower baseline Hb, included a higher proportion of men, were more often suffering from ulcerative colitis, and in particular in the oral group, had less often elevated CRP. Hence, the Indian population may have suffered from more pronounced absolute IDA with less severe active inflammation compared with the European population. In fact, literature supports that Asians are more prone to anemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>).</p><p>In general, baseline Hb and CRP were associated with a more pronounced Hb response to both iron treatments as demonstrated in the explorative predictor analysis of responds. Within the treatment groups, subjects with ulcerative colitis showed a statistically significant higher response than subjects with Crohn's disease in the oral group. However, as the analysis of potential predictors was explorative in nature, further studies are required to evaluate potential predictors for response.</p><p>In terms of total QoL score, no significant difference in the increase in the QoL score was observed between the treatment groups.</p><p>Data in animals suggest that oral iron sulfate may trigger inflammatory processes associated with progression with Crohn's disease-like ileitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). In this study, there was no statistical significant change in disease activity from screening to week 8 between groups A and B. However, a longer study period might be needed in order to clarify whether there is a different effect of oral and IV iron on disease activity.</p><p>The selection criteria in this study excluding patients with known intolerance to oral iron and severe disease activity may have caused a selection bias toward a favorable tolerability for oral iron. In previous reports, significantly higher percentage of patients (up to 46&#x00025;) on oral iron discontinued the study because of gastrointestinal disturbances in comparison with patients on IV iron (11&#x00025;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). In another study, IBD patients treated with oral iron also reported more gastrointestinal disturbances as compared with IV iron sucrose (21&#x00025; vs. 5&#x00025;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Hence, in an unselected IBD population, the tolerability of oral iron would be lower than in this study, where 101 out of 338 patients had been treated previously with oral iron.</p><p>Iron isomaltoside 1,000 showed a good safety profile in both up to 500&#x02009;mg bolus injections over 2&#x02009;min and up to 1,000&#x02009;mg IV infusions over 15&#x02009;min.</p><p>ADRs were observed in 14&#x00025; in group A (IV iron isomaltoside 1,000) and 10&#x00025; in group B (oral iron sulfate). A single serious ADR of seizures was observed in a patient with no known predisposition to seizures. The mechanism behind the seizure is unknown, but seizures have been described with other IV irons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). Four non-serious nonspecific hypersensitivity reactions of unclear mechanism, but which may involve complement activation related pseudo-allergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>), were reported. No anaphylactic shock reactions were observed.</p><p>The incidence of patients with transient hypophosphatemia (<italic>s</italic>-phosphate &#x0003c;2&#x02009;mg/dl) was 7&#x00025;, which is low compared with hypophosphatemia rates ranging up to 70&#x00025; with other IV irons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). No dose&#x02013;response was seen with frequency of ADRs and no overall safety concerns were found in vital signs or safety laboratory parameters.</p><p>Based on the results from this study, the Ganzoni formula may underestimate the IV iron dose needed when using a target Hb of 13&#x02009;g/dl and iron stores of 500&#x02009;mg. This is supported by the exploratory observation that a higher increase in Hb from baseline was observed with dosing of &#x02265;1,000&#x02009;mg of iron isomaltoside 1,000. In a study by Kulnigg <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>), iron carboxymaltose was compared with oral iron sulfate in reducing IDA in IBD. The median Hb improved from 8.7 to 12.3&#x02009;g/dl in the iron carboxymaltose group and from 9.1 to 12.1&#x02009;g/dl in the oral iron group, demonstrating non-inferiority (<italic>P</italic>=0.6967), but not superiority of iron carboxymaltose for the primary end point. Despite that the Ganzoni formula was used for calculation of the iron demand both in the study by Kulnigg <italic>et al.</italic> and our study, there are major differences which might explain the diverging outcomes and support underdosing in our study. A mean dose of 1,406&#x02009;mg IV iron carboxymaltose was administered in the study by Kulnigg <italic>et al.</italic>, which was a higher dose compared with the mean dose of approximately 880&#x02009;mg iron isomaltoside 1,000 given in this study. The large difference in dosing level was most likely due to using either a higher target Hb and/or higher estimate of depot iron in the Ganzoni formula combined with a lower baseline Hb in the study by Kulnigg <italic>et al.</italic></p><p>In this study, a Hb &#x0003c;12&#x02009;g/dl and a TSAT &#x0003c;20&#x00025; were defined as major inclusion criteria, whereas in the study by Kulnigg <italic>et al.</italic>, subjects with a Hb &#x02264;10g/dl and TSAT &#x0003c;20&#x00025; or s-ferritin &#x0003c;100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/l were eligible. Owing to low recruitment, the inclusion criteria of the latter study were modified after 4 months to an Hb &#x02264;11&#x02009;g/dl. Evaluation of the primary end point in our study was at week 8, whereas in the study by Kulnigg <italic>et al.</italic> at week 12. Importantly, in the latter study a second treatment cycle was allowed in patients in the iron carboxymaltose group, if their iron status parameters indicated that IDA recurred in between the end of the first cycle and week 9 of the study. The above-mentioned aspects might explain differences in both cumulative iron doses and outcomes between the studies. Thus, only 62&#x00025; of the iron dose administered in the study by Kulnigg <italic>et al.</italic> were applied in this study.</p><p>Evstatiev <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>) applied dosages of 1,377&#x02009;mg ferric carboxymaltose using an alternative dosing algorithm and 1,160&#x02009;mg iron sucrose applying the Ganzoni calculation with target Hb 15&#x02009;g/dl and depot 500&#x02009;mg and reached response rates for Hb &#x02265;2&#x02009;g/dl of 65&#x00025; and 58&#x00025;, respectively.</p><p>As patients treated with &#x0003e;1,000&#x02009;mg IV iron had a more pronounced Hb response without affecting safety, there seems to be room for higher dosing of iron isomaltoside 1,000. Based on the identified biochemical predictors of response, the main drivers of IV dosing should be Hb and CRP. As safety did not show a dose&#x02013;response relation, it is suggested that IBD patients with an increase in CRP and Hb &#x0003c;9&#x02009;g/dl are given higher doses of &#x0003e;1,000&#x02009;mg IV iron isomaltoside 1,000.</p><p>The open-label design of the study may be considered a weakness and needs to be justified. This design is used in several other comparable IBD studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). It is almost impossible to blind studies where oral iron is compared with IV, as oral iron is indicated by black stools. However, as the primary efficacy parameter was biochemical it is not likely to represent a major limitation. Hence, we consider the study design justified and indicative of important new findings.</p><p>In conclusion, we failed to demonstrate non-inferiority of IV iron isomaltoside 1,000 compared with oral iron in our study. However, we provide exploratory evidence that the demand of IV iron was underestimated. Alternative estimates of iron stores including Hb, CRP, and sex should be explored in patients with IBD. Higher doses of iron isomaltoside 1,000 were safe and might have led to superior response rates compared with oral iron in our study.</p></sec><sec><title>STUDY HIGHLIGHTS</title><p><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ajg2013335i1.jpg"/></p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all the investigators and study personal for their contribution to the study, and G&#x000fc;nter Weiss for his valuable input to interpretation of the iron-related biochemistry.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</xref> is linked to the online version of the paper at http://www.nature.com/ajg</p></fn></fn-group><notes><p><bold>Guarantor of the article:</bold> Walter Reinisch, MD, PhD.</p><p><bold>Specific author contributions:</bold> Michael Staun, Rakesh K.
