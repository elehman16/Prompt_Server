Although the glucose-lowering effect of GLP-1 in the fasting state is primarily mediated by its glucose-dependent augmentation of insulin secretion and inhibition of glucagon release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), the key mechanism driving the postprandial normalization of glycemia by GLP-1 is a marked deceleration of gastric emptying leading to a delayed entry of glucose into the circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). In fact, when the deceleration of gastric emptying by GLP-1 is antagonized, the glucose-lowering effect of the incretin is largely abolished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>Although a longer duration of action covering the entire 24 h of the day is generally thought to confer improved glycemic control, constant activation of the GLP-1 receptor might also lead to the induction of tolerance against the incretin hormone, thereby possibly reducing its potency. In analogy, the development of tachyphylaxis is well known to alter the actions of nitrates or catecholamines during constant pharmacologic exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Whether the actions of GLP-1 are also subject to tachyphylaxis has not yet been examined. However, when GLP-1 was administered intravenously over a period of 7 days in patients with type 2 diabetes, postprandial glucose concentrations declined after serving the first meal, whereas an increment in postprandial glucose levels was observed after the subsequent meal courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Unfortunately, gastric emptying measurements were not available from that study or any other study with chronic GLP-1 administration over repeated meal courses.</p><p>Therefore, the current study addressed whether the deceleration of gastric emptying by intravenous GLP-1 is subject to rapid tachyphylaxis and if so, whether this can lead to clinically relevant differences in postprandial glycemic control.</p><sec id="s5"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s6"><title>Study protocol.</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the medical faculty of Ruhr University, Bochum, Germany (registration number 652 a) before study commencement.

We report that the GLP-1&#x02013;induced deceleration of gastric emptying is significantly diminished already after 5 h of continuous infusion compared with its initial effects. This attenuation of GLP-1 efficacy leads to increased postprandial concentrations of glucose, insulin, and glucagon, as well as changes in the concentration time pattern of GIP.</p><p>A deceleration of gastric emptying by GLP-1 has been demonstrated in patients with type 2 diabetes and healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). In line with these studies, the GLP-1&#x02013;induced delay in gastric emptying not only prevented the postprandial increase in glycemia but also led to a marked reduction in insulin and C-peptide levels. The GLP-1&#x02013;induced reduction in postprandial glycemia and insulin secretion was less pronounced during the second meal course, when the delay in gastric emptying was largely attenuated. This finding is consistent with previous studies showing that the reduction in postprandial glycemia and insulin secretion is largely diminished, when the effects of the incretin on the stomach are antagonized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Taken together, these studies underline the importance of delayed gastric emptying as the primary factor driving the reduction in postprandial glycemia during acute GLP-1 administration.</p><p>What are the mechanisms conferring the induction of tolerance against the GLP-1 effects on gastric emptying? One possibility would be a downregulation or desensitization of the GLP-1 receptor in response to chronically elevated GLP-1 levels. Indeed, receptor desensitization has been described for GIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), which shares many intracellular signaling steps with GLP-1. For GLP-1, chronic exposure to a receptor antagonist in mice in vivo did not result in a significant receptor downregulation or attenuation of its glucoregulatory effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), thereby rendering this explanation less likely.</p><p>The alternative hypothesis would be tachyphylaxis to the effects of GLP-1 at the level of the vagal nerve. Such a mechanism would explain why the effects of GLP-1 on gastric emptying are obviously more affected by the induction of tolerance than the islet hormone responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Furthermore, chronic adaptation of the autonomous nervous system is a well-recognized principle, which is also responsible for many other phenomena, such as hypoglycemia unawareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), tolerance to &#x003b2;-adrenergic agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), and opioid tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Finally, the time kinetics of tolerance induction observed in the current study (within &#x0223c;5 h) are more typical for the mechanism of tachyphylaxis than for receptor downregulation, which usually requires longer periods of exposure. The hypothesis of vagal nervous tachyphylaxis is further supported by the plasma concentrations of PP, which are thought to mirror the systemic level of vagal nervous activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). In fact, PP levels were markedly suppressed by GLP-1 during the first meal course, but slightly elevated during the second test meal, suggesting a more pronounced inhibition of parasympathetic outflow during the first test meal. Thus, GLP-1 seems to inhibit gastric emptying primarily through inhibition of the vagal nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), but this mechanism is subject to rapid tachyphylaxis after chronic GLP-1 exposure.</p><p>The present data give rise to consider which of the multiple GLP-1 effects are subject to rapid tachyphylaxis and which are not. Clearly, the GLP-1&#x02013;induced inhibition of gastric emptying was less pronounced during the second meal course compared with the first meal. In contrast, the quantitative amount of insulin released after the second test meal was even greater than after the first test meal, thereby arguing against an attenuation of the insulinotropic effect of GLP-1 during continuous exposure. For glucagon, an opposite picture was found, with a marked suppression after the first meal and higher levels after the second meal. However, because these postprandial changes in insulin and glucagon levels were primarily driven by the changes in gastric emptying, it is impossible to draw firm conclusions regarding a rapid tachyphylaxis to the GLP-1 effects on islet hormone secretion from this study. By taking into account the results obtained from the various long-term studies with GLP-1 analogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), there is little reason to assume the presence of such a mechanism. Thus, although the GLP-1 actions on the stomach seem to critically depend on the time kinetics of GLP-1 levels, its insulinotropic and glucagon static effects are likely less dependent on the fluctuations in GLP-1 levels.</p><p>Of note, glucagon concentrations increased after the ingestion of the test meal. This is in contrast with previous studies showing a significant decline in glucagon levels after intravenous or oral glucose ingestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). This apparent discrepancy is most likely due to the high amino acid content of the test meal, which is known to stimulate rather than suppress glucagon secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>).</p><p>Another interesting finding from this study is the alteration in GIP secretion by GLP-1. During the first test meal, the GLP-1&#x02013;induced retardation of gastric emptying led to a significant delay in GIP secretion. Given the importance of GIP as a physiologic incretin hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), this might theoretically impair postprandial insulin responses and thus worsen glucose control. In the present experiments, the concentration time patterns of insulin and C-peptide seemed to closely mirror the respective GIP levels, thereby emphasizing the role of GIP as a physiologic enhancer of postprandial insulin release. In addition, GIP has also been shown to augment glucagon secretion in healthy humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). It is therefore possible that the differences in the postprandial concentrations of glucagon between the two test meals were also partly secondary to the changes in GIP release. However, given the complexity of these interactions among vagal nervous activation, gastrointestinal motility, gut hormone release, and islet hormone secretion, it is difficult to fully elucidate these relationships on the basis of the present experiments.</p><p>Although the present studies in healthy individuals do not allow for firm conclusions regarding the therapeutic use of GLP-1&#x02013;based drugs, it would be tempting to speculate that the development of tachyphylaxis might be involved in the unequal susceptibility of patients to develop nausea when treated with either short- or long-acting GLP-1 analogs. It would therefore be of interest to examine the induction of tachyphylaxis in patients with type 2 diabetes during the chronic treatment with different GLP-1 analogs.</p><p>In conclusion, the delay in gastric emptying by GLP-1 is markedly attenuated during continued exposure to high GLP-1 concentrations. Most likely, this is due to the induction of tachyphylaxis at the level of vagal nervous activation. As a consequence, postprandial glucose control by GLP-1 is attenuated after its chronic administration.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>This article contains Supplementary Data online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db10-0474/-/DC1">http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db10-0474/-/DC1</ext-link>.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This study was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (grant Na 203/2-2) and the Danish Medical Research Council.</p><p>No potential conflicts of interest relevant to this article were reported.</p><p>M.A.N. designed the study and contributed to data analysis and article preparation.
