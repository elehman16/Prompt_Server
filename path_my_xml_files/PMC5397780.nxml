Studies suggest urban informal settlements have particularly high levels of IPV and HIV-prevalence and these settlements are rapidly growing. The current evidence base of effective approaches to preventing IPV recognizes the potential of combining economic strengthening and gender transformative interventions. However, few of these interventions have been done in urban informal settlements, and almost none have included men as direct recipients of these interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Stepping Stones and Creating Futures intervention is a participatory gender transformative and livelihoods strengthening intervention. It is being evaluated through a cluster randomized control trial amongst young women and men (18&#x02013;30) living in urban informal settlements in eThekwini Municipality, South Africa. The evaluation includes a qualitative process evaluation and cost-effectiveness analysis.

In South Africa, violence and injuries are the second leading cause of death and loss of disability-adjusted life years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Population-based estimates for South Africa from 2010, show a lifetime prevalence in adult women of physical IPV victimisation of 33% and past-year prevalence of 13%, and 40% of men disclose having perpetrated physical IPV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A quarter of women have been raped by a partner or non-partner, and between 28 and 37% of men disclose rape perpetration of partner or non-partner in surveys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Women&#x02019;s experiences of IPV, alongside violating their human rights, constitute a key health burden. Studies suggest women who experience physical and/or sexual IPV are more likely to be depressed and suicidal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], consume higher levels of alcohol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], have greater numbers of unplanned pregnancies, and increased induced abortions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In addition, in southern and eastern Africa they are between 15 and 25% more likely to acquire HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Urban informal settlements, globally and in South Africa, are rapidly expanding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These are spaces with a high prevalence of major health problems, including HIV, and IPV, which particularly affect young people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In South Africa HIV-prevalence in informal settlements is twice that of formal housing settlements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and IPV-incidence among young people (18&#x02013;30) is between 3 and 5 times national estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>A range of theories explain the high levels of IPV and HIV in southern and eastern Africa, and particularly urban informal settlements. One body of research links poverty and material inequality to HIV and IPV risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Others emphasise mobility and the weak social relationships existing in urban informal settlements, undermining social forms of power that have a tendency to constrain certain behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A cross-cutting explanation are the ways in which gender inequalities, particularly in contexts of poverty, are pronounced. This combination places women in economically and socially dependent relationships with men, and thus at higher risk of experiencing IPV and HIV-vulnerability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. For men, it is argued their experience of economic marginalisation limits them from achieving respectability and a sense of masculine success through providing for their household, a key feature of masculinity in many communities. In turn they seek other forms of identity and respect, namely through control and dominance over women sexually and physically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Current evidence on gender transformative plus economic strengthening interventions</title><p>Current evidence around interventions to reduce women&#x02019;s experiences of IPV and HIV-vulnerability are located in gender transformative approaches, whether working with women or with men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. As Ellsberg and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] comment, these approaches &#x0201c;address underlying expectations about male and female roles and behavior&#x02026;through a process of critical reflection, discussion, and practice.&#x0201d; There remains a paucity of well-evaluated group-based, gender transformative interventions. One of the few interventions showing effect was the Stepping Stones RCT, implemented in the rural Eastern Cape of South Africa. At 12&#x000a0;months follow-up, men reported less transactional sex with a casual partner, and less problematic alcohol use. At 24&#x000a0;months, men reported less perpetration of sexual and/or physical IPV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Other group-based interventions have shown promise at reducing IPV but have often been limited by small sample sizes. In Cote d&#x02019;Ivoire, for instance, a group-based intervention for men, seemed to reduce men&#x02019;s perpetration of IPV, but the effect was not significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>More evaluations have shown promise through combining group-based gender transformative interventions with economic strengthening interventions for women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The IMAGE study combined micro-finance training with a gender transformative component and community mobilization for women in rural South Africa. This showed a 55% significant reduction in IPV experienced by women who participated in the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In addition, the IMAGE study reported positive changes around HIV-risk behaviours for young women (under 35), including an increase in condom use at last sex with non-cohabiting partners, and greater communication about HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Similar interventions have shown positive outcomes, but often effects have not been significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>Translating economic empowerment and gender transformative interventions into approaches for young women initially proved challenging. An early generation of interventions including SHAZ! &#x02013; which combined microfinance and gender training - and TRY showed promise, but no significant results in terms of reducing IPV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. More recently, Bandiera and colleagues report on a combined microfinance, life-skills training and vocational training in Uganda which reduced young women&#x02019;s experiences of sexual violence significantly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. While in Zimbabwe, SHAZ! was adapted to respond to the challenges in the pilot, and included vocational training, a small non-repayable grant and gender training. After 24&#x000a0;months, women reported a reduction in IPV and HIV-risk behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>The majority of the gender transformative and economic strengthening interventions have focused on working directly with women. Where men have been included, it has tended to be partial inclusion, often as the woman&#x02019;s husband/partner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Only one pilot study in the US explicitly included young men in a combined economic and gender transformative intervention, and reported a range of positive outcomes, but could not look at IPV perpetration as the sample was too small [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>The lack of rigorous evaluations of men involved in gender transformative and economic strengthening interventions is problematic. First, many interventions are working to strengthen men&#x02019;s employment and livelihoods, without an analysis of the impact of these on IPV. Second, there may be benefits of including men in such interventions. A central argument about men&#x02019;s perpetration of IPV is that violence emerges when men are structurally excluded from economic opportunities and then use violence as a way to achieve some form of respect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. On the other hand, some research has shown men who are poor, but not the poorest, may have higher rates of perpetration of violence against women (VAW) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], so understanding how men respond to interventions of this type is very important.</p><p>This paper describes the Stepping Stones and Creating Futures Intervention trial in terms of the SPIRIT (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) 2013 Checklist, alongside a comparison of baseline characteristics of participants.

In eThekwini municipality an estimated 25% of the population live in informal housing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Informal settlements are characterised by dense housing, and poor access to water and electricity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>At the cluster level, eligibility is defined as urban informal settlements in the eThekwini Municipality, South Africa in communities where Project Empower, the implementing partner, have assessed it is safe to work. Informality is defined as not having formal service provision within the home, such as no electricity legally supplied and no piped water to housing.</p><p>Defining an informal settlement as a cluster is not straightforward. In cluster randomized trials, there are often clear governmental boundaries that delineate clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. For instance, in SASA! clusters were defined as municipal parishes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], while in IMAGE, rural villages could be easily identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Informal settlements do not follow governmental boundaries. Rather, they are located on previously under-used land, steep hillsides, or areas prone to flooding, and fill spaces between formal housing.</p><p>Despite these challenges, larger informal settlements in eThekwini are typically geographically bounded. The significant variation in size of informal settlements is dealt with in three ways to create comparable clusters: 1) Small informal settlements close to each other were clustered together to form a larger informal settlement cluster where we can recruit participants; 2) Large informal settlements, were split into separate clusters using naturally occurring boundaries and space to limit the potential for contamination; and, 3) In analyses we will account for variation in baseline characteristics of clusters.</p><p>Eligible participants must report being normally resident in an informal settlement, aged 18&#x02013;30&#x000a0;years, not in formal employment, able to communicate in the main languages of the study (English, isiXhosa or isiZulu) and not suffering from a learning difficulty, or be&#x000a0;currently psychotic, drunk or drugged, which would impair their ability to consent to participation in the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Intervention</title><p>The intervention comprised two separate intervention manuals, the third edition of the South African adaptation of Alice Welbourn&#x02019;s Stepping Stones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and Creating Futures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The rationale for the combined intervention is shown in the Theory of Change for the combined interventions (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Stepping Stones and Creating Futures theory of change</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Interventions</th><th colspan="2">Creating futures</th><th colspan="6">Stepping stones</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Overall result</td><td colspan="7">REDUCED VAWG AND OTHER OUTCOMES</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Hypothesised effect</td><td colspan="2">Greater engagement in income generating activity gives women more social power and enhances men&#x02019;s selfworth</td><td colspan="3">Critical reflection methodology challenges acceptance of patriarchy, opens doors to more respectful masculinities and more assertive femininities, all leading to less VAWG</td><td colspan="2">Empowerment overall and better relationships enhance mood and reduces substance abuse</td><td>Empowering methodology and group work combined with communication skills improves relationships and handling of disagreements</td></tr><tr><td>Required intervention elements</td><td colspan="2">Life skills intervention to assist income generation or return to education</td><td colspan="5">Focus on building and understanding of gender equity and tackling VAWG</td><td>Building communication skills combined with gender equity</td></tr><tr><td>Amenable risk and aggrevating factors</td><td>Low economic power</td><td>Low education</td><td>Masculinities predicated on dominance over &#x00026; control of women</td><td>Women&#x02019;s acceptance of patriarchal dominance</td><td>Ingrained acceptability of use of VAWG</td><td>Depression</td><td>Men&#x02019;s substance abuse</td><td>Poor relationship skills (esp.over conflict)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="8">MEN AND WOMEN</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Problem statement</td><td colspan="8">One third of South African women experience VAWG in their lifetime and this is higher in some local areas.

</p><p>This edition of Stepping Stones has ten, three-hour sessions delivered to single-sex groups of about 14&#x02013;20 participants. It spans 30&#x000a0;h and is run over 6&#x02013;8&#x000a0;weeks. It uses participatory learning approaches, including critical reflection, role play and drama and draws the everyday reality of participants&#x02019; lives into the sessions. The content includes: how we act and what shapes it (gender and peer influences); sex and love; conception and contraception; STIs and HIV; safer sex and condoms; gender-based violence; motivations for sexual behavior (including alcohol and poverty); and communication skills. Our South African adaptation has slightly different content from the Welbourn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] original. It places a greater emphasis on sexual health and gender-based violence, and in this trial is run without peer group meetings. Welbourn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] recommended working with older men and women in each community as well as youth, and suggested that peer groups be encouraged to continue to meet after the end of the workshops. We are not doing either, as it would add greatly to the cost of the intervention, which is already made more complex by the combination with Creating Futures. Further, our design deliberately focuses on changes and relationships within and among young people, and while recognizing the existence of intergenerational relationships, South African communities have very important age/sex group peer influences and we did not feel the focus on the older generation was the correct focus for this study. Additionally, our previous research in the rural Eastern Cape Province of South Africa has shown that Stepping Stones works effectively with young people to reduce sexual risk-taking and men&#x02019;s use of IPV outside a community development context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Creating Futures has eleven, three-hour sessions that are delivered immediately following the Stepping Stones sessions to the same single-sex groups. Overall contact time is approximately 33&#x000a0;h. Key issues covered include setting livelihood goals, coping with crises, saving and spending, getting and keeping jobs, and managing work expectations. There is also a significant focus on small-income generating activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Creating Futures is located within a sustainable livelihoods framework, emphasising that people survive through drawing on five capitals: financial, human, social, physical and natural [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Conventionally, approaches to addressing poverty include interventions such as micro-loan schemes, and technical or business training. Creating Futures treats these interventions as resources, which may or may not be available in participants&#x02019; contexts. Rather than offering a single resource as a stand-alone remedy for livelihoods strengthening, the curriculum engages participants in exercises which enable them to evaluate all available capitals and to map these into a single implementable livelihoods strategy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Pilot research and field testing</title><p>The Stepping Stones and Creating Futures combined intervention was piloted among young adults in eThekwini informal settlements in 2012&#x02013;13. 123 women and 110 men were recruited and received the intervention and then followed up 6 and 12&#x000a0;months later. Retention in the study at 12&#x000a0;months was 88%.

Both men and women scored significantly better on gender attitudes, and men significantly reduced controlling practices in their relationships.

</p><p>We recognise it is conventional to keep the number of primary outcomes to the lowest possible number. However, there is no agreed binary goal in VAW research, that would be equivalent to e.g. acquiring or not acquiring HIV. VAW has different manifestations (we consider here physical and sexual violence, and controlling behaviours which are a dimension of emotional violence) and forms have different severities. It is not agreed whether it is more important to stop all women having any exposure or to reduce severe exposure, and nor is it agreed whether sexual violence is more or less important than physical violence or controlling behaviours. Research in South Africa on HIV and violence, for example, has shown that controlling behaviours and more severe physical and/or sexual violence are the exposures more strongly predictive of health risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].

Project Empower approached ward councillors for permission letters. In the eThekwini context, Ward Councillor permission was critical and implementation could not have happened without it. Throughout the process, Ward Counsellors were made fully aware of what phase the study was at, enabling on-going access and community buy-in. Once secured, local development committees and other key actors were approached for permission to work in specific clusters/informal settlements. Throughout the process of accessing communities the study was described as a project that hopes to help young people improve their lives &#x02013; as such it did not focus on either the violence or livelihoods aspects of the work.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Individual participant community mobilisation and consent processes</title><p>Once permission to access clusters was secured and clusters randomised, Project Empower hosted a number of community meetings to brief community members about the trial, its nature and design. During these community meetings, Project Empower requested those eligible and interested in the trial to contact the project staff by sending free &#x02018;please call me&#x02019; messages from cell phones. Most young people in informal settlements have access to cell phones. Those who do not can easily access cell phones through low-cost stalls on the side of the road.</p><p>Potential participants were invited to meet with project staff in a central location in their community. Spaces varied, including community halls, or a spare room off a shop. Over approximately two days, participants arrived and Project Empower and HEARD staff explained the trial in detail, including the intervention and ethics. Informed consent process only occurred after initial agreement of participants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Methods: Assignment of interventions</title><p>Randomisation into intervention and control (delayed intervention) arms was undertaken at the cluster level once clusters agreed to participate. Each cluster was allocated a cluster number and randomisation was performed by the study statistician, using a system of numbers. At the time of randomisation the statistician did not know which number was allocated to which cluster. Public randomisation of clusters was not done due to political sensitivities.</p><p>Individuals were not blinded to the study arm at time of recruitment and informed consent. While this may lead to recruitment bias, high levels of mistrust around research often found in marginalised communities, and historical experiences of being promised support and then not receiving it were of greater concern for participant wellbeing and project staff safety.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Methods: Data collection, management and analysis</title><sec id="Sec20"><title>Data collection methods</title><p>The study used self-completed questionnaires on cell phones lent to participants.

A range of strategies to retain the cohort were developed including collection of details of friends and family members of participants in case we lose direct contact, sending SMSes regularly throughout the follow-up and recruiting community members to help identify participants.</p><p>In addition, there is an escalating cash incentive for control and intervention arms. Such an approach has been used before to retain cohorts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. For the intervention arm the incentive is: baseline &#x02013; R100 (~US$7); 12&#x000a0;months &#x02013; R150 (~US$11); 24&#x000a0;months &#x02013; R300 (~US$21). For the control arm: baseline &#x02013; R300 (~US$21); 12&#x000a0;months &#x02013; R450 (~US$31); 24&#x000a0;months &#x02013; R600 (~US$42).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> We set the level unequally between arms as we anticipated some loyalty from the intervention arm due to the engagement in the intervention. We felt we would need to more strongly incentivise control arm retention.</p><p>The impact of what could be considered unconditional cash transfers is likely to be minimal. Previous research on cash transfers only show impact when transfers are over several months, or they are of a large value. Additionally, impact has often been shown to be negligible on violence measures or inconsistent. For instance, in Latin America cash transfers over time have shown mixed outcomes. One study of a long-term transfer of US$15 per month (approx. 6&#x02013;10% of income) showed a marginal increase in controlling behaviours by partners, but no impact on physical or sexual violence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Another of US$40/month over 6&#x000a0;months, showed a reduction in physical and/or sexual violence at end line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Once off cash transfers have needed to be of a high value to show impact, for instance Give Directly in Kenya provided once-off payments of US$1100 direct transfers to households and showed impacts on sexual violence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. As such, the incentives are neither of a long-enough duration (i.e. repeat payment every month) nor of enough significant value, to be likely to have impact on the primary or secondary outcomes of the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Data management</title><p>As questionnaires are self-completed on cell phones, data management issues and missing data are minimized.

The economic evaluation of Stepping Stones and Creating Futures compares the cost, and impact of the intervention, to determine its cost-effectiveness. The main analysis will calculated the cost per incident of physical and/or sexual IPV averted. Women and men will be analysed separately.</p><p>A micro-costing approach from the provider perspective will be applied to the economic evaluation, to identify, quantify and value all resources used to develop and deliver the intervention. For intervention development (from 2011 to 2014) costing will be retrospective, while for intervention delivery in the evaluation it will be prospective. For both phases, interviews with research and intervention staff will be conducted to identify resources and activities. Relevant financial records will then be extracted. Employees&#x02019; time will be valued at the salaries they receive. Any resource for which no cost is incurred will be valued at its replacement cost. In addition, a time-and-motion study of facilitators delivering the intervention will be undertaken to determine facilitators&#x02019; time allocation across core intervention tasks, administration and research.</p><p>Finally, the costing also includes a household/individual perspective, accounting for costs participants incurred to receive the intervention (e.g., transport cost, work opportunities forgone). This will contribute to monetising the burden intervention attendance places on participants, and provide an estimate of how much they value the intervention. Participant costs are collected through paper and pencil self-completed questionnaires during the second-to-last intervention session.</p><p>Costs and outcomes will be discounted using a 3% discount factor.

As argued by R Jewkes, Y Sikweyiya, M Nduna, NJ Shai and K Dunkle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] this requirement is practicable to implement in survey studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], but it was difficult to do so in this intervention trial, particularly because of its design. First, as its primary outcome, this trial aims to prevent IPV, during recruitment of participants it was difficult to conceal the IPV focus. Second, both men and women are enrolled this trial and both will be asked questions on violence. Third, as participants are young women and men from the same cluster, it is likely that some of them will be involved in relationships, and therefore are likely to have an idea of what their partner will be asked.</p><p>However, the trial has been designed to ensure that the project does not expose participants to more than minimal risk (more than everyday risk). The study design has measures in place to minimise the potential of harm to participants (e.g. third party retaliation) and to respond to any adverse consequences i.e. emotional or psychological harm that may result from the questions that will be asked in this study. This includes use of self-completed questionnaires and the option to refer participants into supportive care if necessary.</p><p>If participants do become distressed during research, or the intervention, the team has referral mechanisms to provide appropriate support. In addition, given the lack, and often inadequacy, of government-provided services, an &#x02018;ethics fund&#x02019; has been established. The ethics fund provides short-term, limited relief to participants who have exhausted formal state options for support, and who would be unable to continue their participation in the group without relief. Disbursements are approved following a written application by the Project Empower Programmes Manager outlining the details of the case, and is reviewed by two senior staff and a board member of Project Empower. Relief provided includes access to professional psycho-social services or medical appointments for cases where primary health care clinics have been unable to treat a participant, as well as material relief such as food, or transport. There has been limited use of the fund; examples of recipients to date include providing blankets to a participant whose bedding was lost during flooding, and the purchase of prescription medication for another.</p><p>No data monitoring board (DMB) was feasible for this study. The entire intervention is provided to participants before the follow-up data collection occurs, as such assessment of harms cannot happen until the intervention is completed.</p><p>The study was approved by the Biomedical Research Ethics Committee (BREC) at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa (BFC043/15) and the South African Medical Research Council Ethics Committee (EC006&#x02013;2/2015).</p><sec id="Sec28"><title>Consent</title><p>All participants were provided with, and signed informed consent forms, in a language of their choice, with verbal explanation as well. They have the option to withdraw throughout the study without detrimental outcomes to them.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Confidentiality</title><p>The trial includes questions about participation in illegal activities. To ensure confidentiality all questionnaires are self-administered on cell phones. Participants were allocated a unique study code, not linked to their names, and thus their responses will not be traceable back to them. Using cell phones will allow us to collect data anonymously and this will therefore protect researchers and participants should the latter disclose illegal activities or practices in the interviews.</p><p>However, there are limits to confidentiality, particularly during the intervention where there may be risks of participants disclosing information which may require reporting. While this is unlikely to happen, participants have been alerted in the informed consent, and facilitators have been trained to stop participants before they reveal issues that may need to be reported. However, unsolicited reports may emerge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] and, if participants do report such activities to fieldworkers, facilitators or team members, they may have to report onwards to ethics committees and potentially the police.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec31"><title>Cluster recruitment</title><p>All clusters approached for participation were willing to be included in the study. During the cluster recruitment, a local government election was held and in number of clusters new Ward Councillors were elected. The cluster&#x02019;s continued participation in the study was reconfirmed by the new Ward Councillors. In total 34 clusters were recruited.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Comparison of baseline results between arms</title><p>A total of 680 women and 677 men were enrolled into the study.

</p><p>In terms of relationships there were no significant differences amongst women by study arm, with about one fifth of women reporting not currently being in a relationship (20.0% control, 17.1% intervention), and a similar proportion reporting living with a boyfriend (16.8% control, 16.5% intervention), while the majority had a boyfriend they did not live with (63.2% control, 66.5% intervention). Amongst men there was a significant difference in relationship status (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.006). The main difference was that men in the control arm were more likely to report living with a girlfriend (14.2% control, 7.4% intervention), other types of relationship were similar by arm, and most men (66.7% control, 68.9% intervention) had a girlfriend but were not cohabiting.</p><p>Education levels were low amongst participants and balanced across arms. Overall less than a third of women and men had completed matric/Grade 12 (school leaving certificate), but most had some secondary school education (57.4% control, 65.9% intervention). Few women and men reported currently studying, with similar proportions in both arms for women (7.9% control, 7.7% intervention) and men (14.2% control, 11.0% intervention).</p><p>Young women and men experienced high levels of food-insecurity as assessed by the Household Hunger Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Overall the proportion experiencing severe food insecurity was a quarter for men and a little higher for women, and was very similar for men and women between the arms. There were differences among women by arm in experience of moderate food insecurity, which was reported by just over half (55.0%) of control arm women compared to 45.6% intervention arm.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Discussion</title><p>Overall baseline data suggests balance between arms on most socio-demographic measures. This suggests that, while participants were not blinded to study arm at recruitment, this did not affect who was recruited in terms of observable characteristics. Baseline socio-demographic data also highlight the high levels of food insecurity and low educational levels of participants entering the study. These challenges shape young people&#x02019;s experiences of relationships and job seeking, and emphasise the need for combination interventions to reduce poverty and strengthen socio-economic outcomes, irrespective of wider aims of IPV prevention.</p><p>The study has a number of limitations. The evaluation may show an under-estimation of effect of the intervention. While the potential for contamination is limited as clusters are discreet and the intervention is intensive in nature, there is mobility in informal settlements that may lead to sharing of information, as well as loss to follow up. Of concern is the wide-scale implementation of the DREAMS programme (Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored, and Safe women) funded by PEPFAR, Gates Foundation and Girl Effect, and additionally Global Fund programming in the eThekwini Municipality, including study communities. Both programmes include aspects of gender transformation and draw heavily on Stepping Stones, and Stepping Stones and Creating Futures, as well as other approaches to reduce HIV-vulnerability and prevent IPV, with the potential that control arm participants receive the intervention, though they were randomized into the delayed intervention. In addition, participants were not blinded to study arm at time of recruitment. While this was done for practical and political realities, and there were few differences between arms in terms of socio-demographic characteristics, there may be unmeasured bias between arms not reflected in the data. Going forward, participants will not be blind to their intervention group and this may impact on self-reported behaviours. Unfortunately, we have no way of knowing this, but the fairly large number of trials with negative findings in this research field overall suggests that invitation to participate in an intervention of the type we are researching does not overwhelmingly bias responses.</p><p>While there is growing evidence of the importance of gender transformative and economic strengthening interventions to reduce women&#x02019;s experiences of IPV, the number of large well evaluated interventions remains limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Research in South Africa on IPV prevention interventions has predominantly been conducted in rural areas and so little is known about the effectiveness of interventions in very challenging urban settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Rigorously evaluated interventions directly assessing the impact of including men in such interventions are very limited and the impact of economic empowerment on men&#x02019;s use of violence is particularly unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. As such, the Stepping Stones and Creating Futures evaluation is important and will considerably increase knowledge of what works to prevent violence against women in South Africa. The qualitative evaluation will enable processes of change to be understood and to capture unforeseen impacts, in addition the economic evaluation enables the cost-effectiveness of the intervention to be assessed. The multi-pronged nature of the evaluation will also contribute to strengthening future interventions in the field of IPV prevention.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec34"><title>Additional file</title><p>
