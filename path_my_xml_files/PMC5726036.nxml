Medical students are a potentially untapped resource who could deliver cessation counselling, while upskilling themselves and changing their own attitudes to delivering such advice in the future; however, no studies have investigated this. We aimed to determine if brief student-led counselling could enhance motivation to quit and smoking cessation behaviours among hospitalised patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A mixed-methods, 2-arm pilot feasibility randomised controlled trial with qualitative process evaluation enrolled 67 hospitalised adult smokers, who were recruited and randomized to receive a brief medical student-delivered cessation intervention (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;33) or usual care (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;34); 61 medical students received standardised cessation training and 33 were randomly assigned to provide a brief in-hospital consultation and follow-up support by phone or in-person one week post-discharge. Telephone follow-up at 3- and 6-months assessed scores on the Motivation to Stop Smoking Scale (MTSS; primary outcome) and several other outcomes, including 7-day point prevalent abstinence, quit attempts, use of cessation medication, and ratings of student&#x02019;s knowledge and efficacy. Data were analysed as intention to treat (ITT) using penalised imputation, per protocol, and random effects repeated measures. Focus group interviews were conducted with students post-intervention to elicit their views on the training and intervention process.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Analyses for primary and most secondary outcomes favoured the intervention group, although results were not statistically significant. Point prevalence abstinence rates were significantly higher for the intervention group during follow-up for all analyses except 6-month ITT analysis. Fidelity was variable. Patients rated students as being &#x0201c;very&#x0201d; knowledgeable about quitting and &#x0201c;somewhat&#x0201d; helpful. Qualitative results showed students were glad to deliver the intervention; were critical of current cessation care; felt constrained by their inability to prescribe cessation medications and wanted to include cessation and other behavioural counselling in their normal history taking.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">It appears feasible for medical students to be smoking cessation interventionists during their training, although their fidelity to the intervention requires further investigation. A definitive trial is needed to determine if medical students are effective cessation counsellors and if student-led intervention could be tailored for other health behaviours.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5">

In Ireland the prevalence of smoking is estimated to be 19.5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], with about 5200 people dying every year from smoking and related healthcare costs accounting for approximately &#x020ac;500 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Smoking is also a major cause of health inequality and cessation is therefore an important public health goal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Cessation benefits are well established, with successfully quitting smoking shown to result in an increase in life expectancy of 10&#x000a0;years and more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Cessation interventions are also one of the most cost-effective healthcare interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Smoking cessation is therefore a unique opportunity to promote health across all healthcare disciplines, with relatively fast and potentially profound public health implications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Several Cochrane reviews have demonstrated that provision of brief advice by healthcare professionals (HCPs) increases quit attempts and rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Among hospitalized smokers, simple advice, along with nicotine replacement therapy and supportive contact for at least one month post-hospital discharge, increases likelihood of cessation by 37&#x02013;54% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Given the efficacy of such HCP interventions, implementation into routine clinical practice is now a key goal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Hospitalisation appears to be an ideal time to implement cessation interventions for several reasons: ability to identify smokers; availability of HCPs; increased patient receptivity/motivation; ability to manage withdrawal symptoms in-hospital; ability to facilitate follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Surveys in Dublin hospitals and internationally have suggested a consistent failure of HCPs to intervene in patients who smoke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], with less than half of smokers being advised to quit across several studies. Similarly, low rates of use of smoking cessation medications are evident post-discharge, with, for example, only 4.5% of smokers using nicotine replacement therapy 3-months post-discharge in one recent Irish study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Common barriers to delivering interventions have been reported by HCPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par23">Lack of time</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par24">Lack of knowledge, training and confidence</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par25">Lack of a systematic approach across sites, wards or staff</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par26">Staff beliefs that: cessation is someone else&#x02019;s role; interventions are less effective than they actually are, or require more time than is necessary or available; smoking is merely a &#x02018;habit&#x02019; not requiring treatment</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par27">Perceived patient resistance, despite research suggesting the contrary.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="Par28">Clearly, there is ample room for improvement in service provision, yet in the face of stringent service cutbacks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], it may be that creative thinking is required to implement low-cost, scalable solutions to ensure that smokers receive such vital advice.</p><p id="Par29">Students are the healthcare professionals of the future, and are potentially an untapped, cost-effective resource for providing brief intervention for health promotion, including smoking cessation. To date, literature has suggested that graduates do not feel prepared for the &#x02018;real-life&#x02019; demands of clinical practice, including smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and more intensive behaviour change teaching during residency has also been described as a potential solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Few studies have assessed students&#x02019; ability to deliver behaviour change skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. One recent randomised study showed that students who interacted directly with patients had the highest objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) scores for smoking cessation skills, with role-playing next, but both conditions were significantly higher than scores for students who attended a lecture or underwent web-based training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Results from a cluster randomised trial from 10 medical schools investigating the effect of a complex, web-based, role-playing and clerkship modelling tobacco education (intervention) with traditional tobacco education (control) were recently published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Students in the intervention schools were not significantly more likely to get higher OSCE scores for tobacco care than in control schools, even if they did score higher on some important components of cessation care, such as suggesting behavioural strategies and using quitlines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. One potential reason for this negative outcome could be the lack of interaction with actual patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and the lack of opportunity to use, and try out, one&#x02019;s learning in real situations, as is deemed theoretically important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">In sum, medical students are potentially an untapped resource who could deliver cessation counselling, and it is possible that the attitudes of future doctors towards provision of vital smoking cessation advice could be positively influenced by specialist cessation training and interaction with smokers. However, it is unknown whether students could be effective interventionists. We explored these issues in a mixed-methods feasibility randomised trial.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aim and objectives</title><p id="Par31">We conducted a mixed-methods study, utilizing a two-arm, parallel group randomised controlled trial (RCT) and a qualitative process improvement component, to evaluate the feasibility of a medical student-delivered intervention to enhance hospitalised patients&#x02019; motivation to quit smoking, their use of pharmacotherapy, and cessation outcomes.</p><p id="Par32">The objectives were to:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par33">Determine the potential efficacy of student-delivered smoking cessation counselling on primary and secondary outcomes</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par34">Obtain student evaluations of the training and intervention implementation</p></list-item></list>

Patients in the intervention group who received a student consult and were receptive to using pharmacotherapy to aid cessation had a yellow-black coloured sticker placed by the student in the medical chart, stating:<disp-quote><p id="Par52">A course of smoking cessation counselling has been delivered to this patient. The patient has requested a consultation with you to determine appropriateness of medication to aid abstinence.

</p><p id="Par56">4 procedures</p><p id="Par57">To avoid treatment contamination, it was important that students did not deliver the intervention to the usual care group. Therefore, recruitment was conducted by an independent researcher, who visited wards to assess patient eligibility prior to student contact. AK, a clinical lecturer, took on the responsibility of patient recruitment and follow-up. AK recruited eligible patients, who were asked to participate in a program to help them quit smoking, which would involve receiving information about how to quit and possibly a consultation with a specially trained medical student. Informed written consent was obtained from participants. Relevant demographic (age, sex, education, living status, insurance status [Medical Cards are provided to people &#x0003e;70 and those with low incomes]) and clinical details (clinical history, Charlson Co-morbidity Index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]), motivation to quit, smoking history (including Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]) and attitudes towards quitting were obtained. AK then forwarded the patient contact details to the assigned student.</p><p id="Par58">Student intervention was staggered over September 2015 to June 2016.</p><p id="Par59">5 who provided</p><p id="Par60">The intervention was to be provided by 61&#x000a0;s year Graduate Entry Medicine (GEM) students from the RCSI who received Brief Intervention for Smoking Cessation (BISC) training. Students had a variety of primary degrees before joining the GEM programme.</p><p id="Par61">Pre-intervention medical student training took place on 14th September 2015, in three groups of ~20 students. Students received the one-day Health Services Executive (HSE) national standard BISC motivational interviewing-based cessation training available to all HSE staff (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hse.ie/cessation/">http://www.hse.ie/cessation/</ext-link>), which was delivered by experienced trainers. The HSE BISC is a short, patient-centred intervention which emphasises self-efficacy, personal responsibility for change, information giving and details of resources available to support change, including pharmacotherapy education. BISC uses the 5As approach (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange follow-up) as its central framework.</p><p id="Par62">6 how</p><p id="Par63">Students individually delivered the intervention face-to-face with individual patients.</p><p id="Par64">7 where</p><p id="Par65">The intervention took place on the inpatient wards of Connolly Hospital (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.connollyhospital.ie">www.connollyhospital.ie</ext-link>), which is an RCSI-affiliated teaching hospital in Dublin, Ireland.</p><p id="Par66">8 when and how much</p><p id="Par67">Once notified about a recruited participant the student then went to the relevant ward and counselled the patient within the next 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;days, including obtaining data for the outcomes of interest. This typically lasted ~15&#x02013;20&#x000a0;min. Students also re-contacted the smoker at 1-week post-discharge via telephone or personal follow-up, in order to provide further support. This typically lasted ~10&#x000a0;min.</p><p id="Par68">9 tailoring</p><p id="Par69">Tailoring to an individual smoker&#x02019;s needs was emphasised during training.

And on the week follow up he was basically discharged without a refill prescription for Nicorette patches. So that struck me. I&#x02019;m not sure if the smoking cessation officer or nurse saw or not, or if another doctor would think to prescribe that. But it just shows me how it really is not a priority at all.

Yeah, that&#x02019;s a different story. I was thinking more of the patients in their care in the wards. I think they would definitely have the time.

So I don&#x02019;t think we should just go and talk to them only about smoking. It&#x02019;s much smoother if you just take a history of the patient, and then talk a little bit about smoking. And in that way, you could be like &#x0201c;hey I heard someone talked to you about smoking. How do you feel about that now?&#x0201d; Then you&#x02019;re giving them a day to think about it, instead of on the spot kind of motivation.

However, this is not uncommon in smoking cessation trials (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]).

While there was no difficulty with this aspect of the design, we have limited details of the fidelity of delivery of the cessation counselling &#x02013; just because students completed the items does not mean that these were delivered accordingly, and vice versa, although the proportions of completed student prompt items was variable. We deemed it more important that students had the opportunity to complete a brief intervention and not be burdened completing detailed fidelity forms which would be of high scientific value, but perhaps of lower educational value. Indeed, some student reflections on the prompt sheets suggested that these were of limited value, perhaps because they did not follow the flow of the conversation with patients. Future research should investigate the level of fidelity to motivational interviewing and recommended cessation techniques, by observing or recording individual sessions.</p><p id="Par108">The intervention is <italic>practical</italic>, in that it was designed to be delivered to overcome resource constraints, albeit that it requires resources to recruit participants.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Study outcomes</title><p id="Par109">No significant difference in the study primary outcome, motivation to quit over time, was seen. However, motivation scores were somewhat higher in the intervention group during follow-up, suggesting some limited effect that ultimately the study was not powered to detect due to the lower than expected recruitment. It may also be that the MTSS scale was not sensitive enough to detect changes in motivation to quit, and future work should use other, more established motivation tools. This is especially pertinent as it is unclear how to score the MTSS when a person has already quit &#x02013; we imputed the highest score, but it is probable that alternative higher score (e.g. a score of 8) for quitters would have yielded a statistically significant result, given the differences in quit rates seen between groups.</p><p id="Par110">While most results for the secondary outcomes were also non-significant, almost all results favoured the intervention group. This highlights the potential of this intervention for enhancing quality of smoking cessation care in hospital settings, although a definitive trial is needed to determine this. One outcome that was consistently significantly higher in the intervention group was quit rates. This was despite the lack of difference in motivation to quit, which was the theoretical mediator of quitting. The effect sizes were higher than in other smoking cessation randomised trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], however, and this may reflect methodological issues and a lower than expected quit rate in the usual care group, leading to overestimates of the effects. Caution should also be used considering that multiple tests were conducted. Furthermore, there were more positive attitudes towards quitting seen in the intervention group at baseline &#x02013; it is possible that these attitudes sustained quit behaviours beyond the student intervention and that these account for the significant findings and the positive trends for other secondary outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Educational aspects</title><p id="Par111">Practical training, such as that provided here, fits with the Kirpatrick model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] &#x02013; students reacted favourably, acquired skills and knowledge, (some) applied their skills, and outcomes (i.e. enhanced quality of cessation care) appear to have been met, at least in terms of trends in the data. As an educational intervention, it was notable that the student evaluations of the programme were much more positive when they had actually applied their training with a patient, allowing them to demonstrate integrative learning, which is usually appreciated by students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], and may lead to better preparedness for practice post-graduation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. One illustration of integrative learning was that students proposed potential solutions to the issues with implementing this counselling &#x02013; e.g. incorporating this into current history taking. Furthermore, training similar to that provided here, can lead to higher OSCE scores than simple web-based or lecture-based tuition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Applying the training with real patients also overcomes issues of low student engagement, as has been reported in other behaviour change training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. While feedback was positive, it is unknown whether this training will have a longer-term impact on students&#x02019; attitudes towards cessation counselling, or indeed future behaviour as clinicians, but at least students should feel better prepared for real work needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This needs to be investigated in future work. It is possible that at least some of the reported barriers to provision of smoking cessation care, as outlined earlier (e.g. perceived lack of time and lack of training), may be overcome by the programme we outline. It was notable that students who had delivered the intervention were more likely to state that doctors did actually have time to deliver cessation counselling, and were more confident about the overall process, when compared to students who did not counsel patients. This fits with expectations from educational and behavioural science theory: that those who get to practice their learned skills have enhanced self-efficacy to deliver this in the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Ethical issues</title><p id="Par112">This study posed some ethical questions that deserve comment. The study was approved by two Research Ethics Committees, with the recommendation that as students were interventionists, they also become study investigators. Students were also insured to provide this cessation counselling. We also agreed a protocol where students would not advise on cessation medication dosages as this was beyond their training &#x02013; which students found frustrating, as outlined above. Placing coloured stickers in the medical charts indicated without ambiguity that such cessation advice came from students.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par113">There are several potential study limitations. First, although our ultimate goal is to increase smoking cessation rates, our primary outcome in this study was a subjective variable (motivation to quit), given the pilot nature of the study and the importance of motivation to quit as a mediator of cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. However, the primary outcome measure, the MTSS, strongly predicts the odds of making a quit attempt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Second, although we did assess smoking cessation as a secondary outcome, we relied on self-report due to resource limitations. Some degree of false positive reporting is likely, although differential bias is mitigated because both intervention groups knew they were participating in a smoking cessation intervention and cessation was assessed using an identical protocol. Third, like most behavioral interventions, it was not possible to blind participants or interventionists to allocation assignment. Fourth, there may be variation in the delivery of care among students, and with only one intervention each it is likely that students may actually improve with more practice, but this cannot be assessed in the current research. We attempted to account for this between-student variability with the random effects modelling, but estimates may have been affected by small numbers. Fifth, other changes in staffing and/or policy may confound any demonstrated effects &#x02013; for example, an increase in hours or numbers of smoking cessation officer(s). As with most RCTs, the results may not be generalizable to the wider population of smokers &#x02013; particularly, smokers who participate in a cessation trial are already motivated to quit &#x02013; it is unknown how the students would be received by patients who have not agreed to participate. Sixth, we were not powered to obtain statistically significant differences, even though the changes here are arguably clinically relevant. Lastly, we do not contend that students could become expert motivational interviewers after a single day&#x02019;s training and practice with one patient (sometimes with a wide timeframe between each). However, a single day&#x02019;s training is all that could feasibly be delivered in the current, full curriculum. Furthermore, we hope that the present study is a first step towards longer term attitudinal and behaviour change in RCSI graduates with regard to smoking cessation counselling. Even with these limitations, upskilling students in smoking cessation counselling, enhancing their self-efficacy to deliver such counselling and making smoking cessation a priority for the next generation of doctors, is still a very worthwhile endeavour.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par114">It appears feasible for medical students to be cessation interventionists during their training, and this training and intervention practice was appreciated by students. A definitive trial is needed to determine levels of intervention fidelity, whether medical students are effective cessation counsellors and if student-led intervention could be trialled for other health behaviours. We believe, based on this study, that all medical students should be given training in brief motivational interviewing, and have an opportunity to apply these skills when discussing smoking cessation with an actual patient.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>5As</term><def><p id="Par6">Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange follow-up</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BISC</term><def><p id="Par7">Brief intervention for smoking cessation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CCI</term><def><p id="Par8">Charlson Co-morbidity Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FG</term><def><p id="Par9">Focus group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FTND</term><def><p id="Par10">Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GEM</term><def><p id="Par11">Graduate Entry Medicine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HCP</term><def><p id="Par12">Healthcare professional</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HSE</term><def><p id="Par13">Health Services Executive</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p id="Par14">Intention to treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MTSS</term><def><p id="Par15">Motivation to stop smoking scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OSCE</term><def><p id="Par16">Objective structured clinical examination</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PP</term><def><p id="Par17">Per protocol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCSI</term><def><p id="Par18">Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SHO</term><def><p id="Par19">Senior House Officer</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge funding from the RCSI Senior Management Team to SS and FD.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>The GEP 2014&#x02013;18 class consortium</title><p id="Par115">Alice Fox; Justin Greco; Sean Harris; Elise Halpern; Cong (Johnny) Luo; Julie Peck; Alison Cameron-Vendrig; Adel Farah; Qasim Muhammad; Alexandra Mingay; Matthew Common; David Maj; Lorna Sampson Riden; Zhubene Mesbah; Carly Rabin; James Ulrich; Rehab Wali; Jodie Odame; Abhirami (Anu) Ananth; Katie Dunleavy; Jessica Suddaby; Jared Sheridan; Kam Sing Ho; Samuel Mihalcioiu; Andrew Mikhail; Celia Fernandez; Farah Adamali; Samantha Steinmetz-Wood; Michael Strader; Madeleine Sugar; Humraaz Samra; Rachel Dharamshi; Camille Tastenhoye; Orla Fitzpatrick; Catriona Harte Hayes; Lisa Ann Lawlor; David Horan; Ahmed F.
