In Britain, approximately 40% of general practitioners provide complementary therapies for their patients <xref rid="pone.0057622-Schmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. With respect to type 2 diabetes, one third of patients actively use alternative medicine to manage their disease, despite the paucity of scientific evidence to support its use <xref rid="pone.0057622-Yeh1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The leaves of the olive plant (<italic>Olea europaea</italic> L.) have been used for centuries in folk medicine to treat diabetes <xref rid="pone.0057622-Komaki1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Recently, the medicinal properties of olive products have focussed on its polyphenols (particularly oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol), which according to animal and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have antioxidant, hypoglycaemic, antihypertensive, antimicrobial, and anti-atherosclerotic properties <xref rid="pone.0057622-El1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Polyphenols are found in most edible plants, and are reportedly responsible for the health benefits associated with the consumption of chocolate, coffee, green tea, and red wine <xref rid="pone.0057622-deBock1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>The nutraceutical market exploring the potential health benefits of olive products is expanding. The concentration of olive plant polyphenols is far greater in the leaves than in the fruit or fruit oil, and the leaves that were once discarded as by-products of tree pruning are now considered a valuable commodity. However, while the cardiovascular health benefits of a Mediterranean diet rich in olive oil is well established <xref rid="pone.0057622-Keys1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, clinical studies examining the effects of olive polyphenols supplementation on cardiovascular disease risk are scarce, flawed, or contradictory. Thus, although the European Food Safety Authority has endorsed the health claim that &#x0201c;the consumption of olive oil polyphenols contributes to the protection of blood lipids to oxidative damage&#x0201d;, it has rejected several other health claims <xref rid="pone.0057622-Agostoni1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>There are very limited data examining the effects of olive polyphenols on glucose homeostasis in humans. Thus, we conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover trial to assess whether supplementation with olive leaf polyphenols would affect modifiable cardiovascular risk factors in overweight males, who by virtue of their body mass are likely to be insulin resistant. In addition, plasma markers involved in the development of cardiovascular disease were investigated. Potential mechanisms underpinning the clinical outcomes were also examined.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Ethics approval for this study was provided by the Northern Y Regional Ethics Committee (New Zealand Ministry of Health), and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Volunteers were recruited in February 2011 via advertisements in local newspapers that circulate freely in the central Auckland metropolitan area. Exclusion criteria were: illicit drug use (including tobacco), diabetes, or being on medications likely to affect insulin sensitivity. Subjects taking antihypertensive or lipid-lowering medications were recruited, but were required to have been on a stable dose for at least 6 months prior to start of the study. These subjects were also encouraged not to change dose throughout the trial, and doses were checked at each assessment. Further, all participants were asked not to make any substantial alterations to their lifestyle for the duration of the trial. Specifically, participants were instructed not to make changes to their diet and physical activity levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Randomization and Masking</title><p>Randomized allocation was done using computer random number generation.

Participants were instructed to take four capsules as a single dose, once a day, with a glass of water, equating to a daily dose of 51.1 mg oleuropein and 9.7 mg hydroxytyrosol for participants on active treatment. OLE was suspended in safflower oil, while placebo capsules contained safflower oil only.

Digitally stored images were analysed by a single reader [MdB] using computer software automated callipers (SonoCalctm v.4.1, Sonosite). A maximal cIMT measurement approximately 10 mm proximal to the carotid bulb was used for comparative analysis. To assess reproducibility, triplicate measures were taken of seven healthy volunteers over a 7-day interval, and resulted in an intra-observer CV of 3.7% (unpublished data).</p><p>Lifestyle factors were recorded with an itemised food diary and a physical activity recall. Three-day dietary records were collected at baseline and at clinical assessment following each 12-week intervention. Each dietary report encompassed an itemized nutritional intake recorded during two week days (Monday to Friday) and one weekend day. Nutritional intake was recorded using standard household measures, as well as the information from food labels where appropriate. Participants were instructed by a trained investigator [MdB], who also reviewed all food records with each participant to address unclear descriptions, errors, omissions, or doubtful entries.

This novel finding was independent of lifestyle factors (such as dietary intakes and physical activity levels), BMI, or fat distribution. Importantly, the 15&#x02013;20% improvement in insulin sensitivity observed with OLE supplementation is comparable to those seen with medications commonly used to treat diabetes. For example, metformin (250 mg TDS) improved insulin sensitivity by 17% in a group of sedentary overweight non-diabetics <xref rid="pone.0057622-Ou1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. However, as Ou et al.&#x02019;s cohort reported lower levels of physical activity than our participants <xref rid="pone.0057622-Ou1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, the use of metformin in our study group would likely have led to a comparatively smaller improvement in insulin sensitivity. Thus, we speculate that the observed improvement in insulin sensitivity with OLE is greater than would have otherwise been observed if our subjects have been treated with metformin instead. Another study demonstrated a 28% improvement in insulin sensitivity after treatment with 30 mg pioglitazone for 26 weeks <xref rid="pone.0057622-Miyazaki1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>; but as their participants had type 2 diabetes, they are also likely to have shown an exaggerated response compared to our study group.</p><p>In addition, OLE also improved insulin secretion to further aid glucose regulation, which does not occur with the use of metformin. Type 2 diabetes generally involves defects in both insulin sensitivity and pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell secretory capacity <xref rid="pone.0057622-Ferrannini1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057622-Gerich1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. OLE supplementation was associated with a reduction in the glucose and insulin excursion after oral glucose challenge, suggesting an improvement in both pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell function and insulin sensitivity. The observed 28% improvement in disposition index is consistent with this observation. Comparatively, studies in diabetic adults (who are likely to have an exaggerated response to therapy) have shown that mainstream medications affecting only &#x003b2;-cell secretion capacity have achieved improvements of 55% (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 antagonists) <xref rid="pone.0057622-Derosa1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and 100% (glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists) <xref rid="pone.0057622-Degn1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Hence, compared to these drugs that only improve insulin secretion, OLE improves both insulin sensitivity and pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell secretory capacity. Remarkably, the observed effects of OLE supplementation in our study population is comparable to common diabetic therapeutics (particularly metformin), and our results could have clinical significance for patients with type 2 diabetes.</p><p>Only one randomized placebo-controlled trial has previously investigated the effects of OLE on glucose metabolism in subjects with type 2 diabetes, finding an improvement in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) after 14 weeks of supplementation <xref rid="pone.0057622-Wainstein1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. However, that study did not measure or discuss possible variations in diet or levels of physical activity among participants <xref rid="pone.0057622-Wainstein1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, so that the independent effect of OLE cannot be determined. Hence, our study is the first to show the independent effects of OLE on glucose homeostasis in humans, corroborating previous findings <italic>in vitro</italic> and in animal models <xref rid="pone.0057622-El1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>We also found elevated interleukin-6 levels (a pro-inflammatory cytokine) with OLE supplementation. Interleukin-6 functions differently depending on its concentration and the tissue it acts upon. Acute increases improve the insulin-regulated glucose metabolism in the muscle <xref rid="pone.0057622-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, while chronically mildly elevated levels are associated with a pro-inflammatory insulin resistant state in the liver. Thus, OLE supplementation may improve insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake via interleukin-6, and possible mechanisms for this effect have been proposed <xref rid="pone.0057622-Carey1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057622-Weigert1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Further, we also observed that OLE supplementation led to increased IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2 plasma concentrations. Increased IGFBP-2 concentrations are protective against the development of obesity and improve insulin sensitivity <xref rid="pone.0057622-Wheatcroft1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, while higher IGFBP-1 concentrations are associated with lower insulin levels <xref rid="pone.0057622-Heald1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p><p>In regards to other measured cardiovascular outcomes, OLE supplementation did not improve 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure, lipid profile, or cIMT. Previous studies have shown improvements in blood pressure with OLE supplementation <xref rid="pone.0057622-PerrinjaquetMoccetti1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057622-Susalit1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, but they did not involve 24-hour monitoring. Similarly, our findings on lipid profile also contrast with those of previous studies <xref rid="pone.0057622-PerrinjaquetMoccetti1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057622-Susalit1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057622-Fonolla1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. However, Perrinjaquet-Moccetti et al. did not examine dietary factors <xref rid="pone.0057622-PerrinjaquetMoccetti1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, Susalit et al. had a low cholesterol dietary component to the trial <xref rid="pone.0057622-Susalit1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, and Fonolla et al. studied hypercholesterolemic subjects <xref rid="pone.0057622-Fonolla1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In addition, although we did not observe improvements in cIMT, this null result may be a result of our relatively short intervention. Nonetheless, consistent with our findings, the European Food Safety Authority recently concluded that there was insufficient evidence to substantiate health claims of improvements on blood pressure, lipid profile, or anti-inflammatory effects <xref rid="pone.0057622-Agostoni1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>The strengths of this study lie with it being a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, using well-validated scientific methods (i.e. ambulatory blood pressure, Matsuda method, and cIMT). Although insulin sensitivity was not measured using the gold-standard euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp, it was assessed using the Matsuda method that is one of the best performing proxy methods <xref rid="pone.0057622-Lorenzo1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In addition, we adopted a comprehensive approach to modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, including attention to dietary intakes and physical activity levels. The OLE supplement was well-tolerated, and compliance with the study protocol was excellent. Potential weaknesses include the relatively short intervention, which may have obscured pathophysiological changes that require longer periods of time to develop.</p><p>Overall, this is the largest and most comprehensive study to date examining the effect of supplemented olive leaf polyphenols alone on modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. We showed improvements in insulin sensitivity and pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell secretion capacity, in a cohort of overweight middle-aged men. Future research should evaluate the potential effects of olive leaf polyphenols on insulin sensitivity and glycaemic control (HbA1c) in patients with type 2 diabetes, and compare any such effects to conventional therapy (e.g. metformin).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0057622.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>
