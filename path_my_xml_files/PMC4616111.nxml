treadmill exercises three times a week for six weeks with non-elastic tape applied to the
lower extremities of the affected side. The control group performed the same exercises but
without taping. [Results] The intervention significantly improved Berg balance scale
scores and timed up and go (TUG) test scores as well as reduced stance duration and stride
duration in the experimental group. In the control group, statistically significant
improvements were observed in TUG test scores. [Conclusion] Although some differences did
not reach the level of statistical significance, the application of non-elastic tape
stabilized the joints of the lower extremities, thereby increasing balance and reducing
stance duration and one step duration, which resulted in a reduction of overall gait
duration.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Non-elastic taping</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke is a disease that occurs when the blood supply in the brain is interrupted by a
hemorrhage or infarction, resulting in movement and consciousness disorders. A stroke can
occur at any age, although two-thirds of patients are over 60&#x02005;years old<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The main symptoms include not only physical impairment, such as hemiplegia and sensory
loss, but also impaired cognition, visual deficit, verbal deficit, and social problems.
These complications can limit mobility, which results in decrease of activities of daily
living (ADL)<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been reported in
previous studies that stroke patients experience problems with motor control, voluntary
movements, and posture maintenance, limiting the effectiveness of their movements<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the early phase of stroke, the symptoms described above tend to be mild or temporary.
However, permanent disability can develop in severe cases, and psychological depression can
accompany the compromised physical function<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stroke is the most common neurological disease in the world and the
main cause of movement disorders<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Although normal gait patterns have been described in stroke patients, they are impaired in
the majority of cases<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The limitations
are usually confined to one side, dividing the body into affected unaffected sides. The
unaffected side of the body bears more weight, whereas the affected side carries less
load<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Furthermore, the asymmetric postural arrangement of the trunk and lower extremities in
hemiplegic patients reduces the stability of the trunk and proximal part of the lower
extremities<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, altering normal and
natural gait patterns as well as the symmetric balance of the body<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, during walking, 30&#x02013;40% of the overall body weight of
a stroke patient is shifted to the affected side. This can cause instability of posture
control and reduce mobility and balance ability<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Weight shifting exercises for the affected side are necessary for restoring the normal
range of movement and muscle strength, which facilitates the movements of the unaffected
lower extremities by providing the required stability<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The purpose of this study was to investigate the balance ability
and gait function in stroke patients after applying non-elastic tape to the lower
extremities of the affected side, which can stabilize muscles and joints.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>In this study, stroke patients were randomly assigned to two groups after their general
characteristics were determined. Fifteen subjects in the experimental group performed mat
and treadmill exercises three times a week for six weeks with non-elastic tape applied to
the lower extremities of the affected side. Subjects in the control group performed the same
exercises without taping. The participants were provided with a written informed consent
form in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The exercise program consisted of mat exercise and treadmill exercise. In the mat exercise,
the trunk was fixed and correctly arranged to start the exercise in the supine position. A
therapist then stretched the ankle and knee joints of the patient, and active-assistive
flexion/extension exercise of the lower extremities was performed for 10 minutes. In
addition, sit-to-stand exercise, which induced pelvic movement, was also performed for 10
minutes in each session.</p><p>Gait exercise was performed using a treadmill after applying non-elastic tape. The subjects
started the treadmill exercise at the lowest speed (1&#x02005;km/h), and the speed was slowly
increased according to the patient&#x02019;s ability. The exercise was performed for 20 minutes
three times a week for six weeks. A 2- or 3-minute break was provided after each exercise
session.</p><p>Non-elastic tape was applied according to the method of Kim<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Five cm-wide tape was applied after measuring the distance from
the tibial tuberosity to the inferior anterior iliac spine (IAIS). One end of the tape was
attached to the IAIS, and the other end was divided in two and placed directly on the
patella. The divided ends were then attached to the tibial tuberosity in line with the edge
of the knee with the hip extended and the knee flexed.</p><p>The Berg balance scale (BBS) was used to assess dynamic balance ability in this study. This
tool, which consists of 14 items, is used in clinical practice to assess balance in
ambulation and when standing in hemiplegic patients. Corresponding measurements have good
validity and reliability, as the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability were found to be
0.99 and 0.98, respectively<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The timed up and go (TUG) test, which is used to assess mobility and gait, was performed
from a sitting position on a chair.</p><p>Time required to perform the task was recorded three times, and the average value was
calculated. It has been previously reported that healthy adults perform the task within 10
seconds, whereas frail elderly subjects accomplish it within 11&#x02013;20 seconds. A time exceeding
20 seconds indicates functional motor impairment and increased risk of falling. This
measurement tool is known to be reliable and valid, with an inter-rater and intra-rater
reliability of 0.98 and 0.99, respectively<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, the Dartfish software was also used for gait analysis after the gait of
subjects was recorded with a video system. Spatio-temporal analysis is widely used to
evaluate the gait pattern of hemiplegic patients, and the temporal component can improve
clinical significance<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The video
recording was conducted in the sagittal plane twice during a 5-m walk after the greater
trochanter, lateral epicondyle, lateral malleolus, and metatarsophalangeal joint of the 5th
toe were marked with a sticker<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The results were presented as means &#x000b1; SD. SPSS for Windows 20.0 was used for statistical
analysis. The &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test and the independent t-test were used to investigate the
general characteristics of the subjects. The paired t-test was used to compare the
characteristics before and after the intervention in each group, and the independent t-test
was employed to compare differences between the groups. The significance level was set at
0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were no significant differences in the general characteristics between the

gait function, especially with respect to gait speed, in patients with stroke. Generally,
stroke patients show decreased motor function accompanied with sensory deficit, causing
difficulties with posture control and maintenance<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The decreased motor function not only reduces the quality of life (QOL) and affects ADL,
but also leads to the loss of independence, low self-esteem, and depression<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, cognitive impairment also
reduces independence and ability to participate in social activities, diminishing the
QOL<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In addition, compromised postural control, decreased joint mobility, impaired
proprioception, and muscle weakness reduce the ability to maintain balance, and this
abnormal balance negatively influences ADL and gait pattern, increasing the risk of
secondary injury, for example, caused by falls<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The reduced balance hinders recovery of ADL and motor functions as well as interferes with
regaining independent gait by inducing sensory deficit<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> and antagonism of contraction and relaxation in the lower
extremities of patients<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, it
has been reported that two-thirds of stoke patients suffer from reduced mobility accompanied
with gait impairment<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, the ability
to control balance is an important component required for performing ADL, and restoration of
balance control is a fundamental goal of rehabilitation of stroke patients<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Taping, which stabilizes muscles and joints, is widely used to correct muscle imbalance and
unstable posture, thus improving balance control. Taping also prevents secondary injury of
joints and muscles as well as reduces treatment duration by compensating the skin and
ligaments<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Taping treatment stimulates muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs, which increases
transverse muscle area. It has also been reported that fine pressure directed from the skin
to muscles affects muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs, leading to tendon muscle
relaxation, muscle strengthening, and pain relief<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. The ultimate purpose of the taping treatment is to support and
protect joints by limiting their movement and compensating for the function of ligaments,
which is necessary for effective functional movement<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kilbreath et al.<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that taping had a positive effect on gait speed and
distance of gait cycle via improving hip extension during stance phase in stroke patients. A
previous study has also shown that taping of the hip abductor stimulated its activation and
increased gait speed in hemiplegic stroke patients using a cane. In another study, 14 women
with patellofemoral pain showed increased activation of the vastus medialis after taping of
the patella<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of taping during mat and treadmill
exercises on balance and gait function. Balance was assessed using the BBS, which has good
reliability and validity. Significant changes in balance were observed in the experimental
group after the exercises. In addition, the Dartfish software was used to analyze video
recordings of moving subjects. Significant changes in TUG scores after the exercises were
observed in both groups. Stance duration and one step duration were significantly reduced in
the experimental group. Although a similar tendency was also present in the control group,
the corresponding differences were not statistically significant. Significant differences
between the groups were observed only in TUG scores.</p><p>These results suggest that non-elastic taping affects balance and gait function in stroke
patients. However, prolonged taping should be avoided and the tape should be removed
immediately after completing the exercise in patients with skin diseases or if excessive
pressure is present. Clinical relevance of the present findings needs to be examined in
future research. Limitations of this study include a small number of subjects and short
duration. Accordingly, long-term effects of taping are currently unknown, and
generalizability of the conclusions needs to be investigated.</p><p>In conclusion, although some differences were not statistically significant, the
application of non-elastic tape increases joint stability of the lower extremities, thereby
improving balance and reducing stance duration and one step duration, which results in the
reduction of overall gait duration.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>SG</given-names></name><name><surname>Hyun</surname><given-names>JK</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Quantitative evaluation of very acute stage of complex
