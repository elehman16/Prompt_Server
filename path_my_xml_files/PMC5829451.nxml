Our study is an example of collaborative working between transplant centres, sports medicine and exercise facilities, aimed to apply the concepts of &#x0201c;exercise is medicine&#x0201d;.</p><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Kidney transplantation is considered the gold standard of treatment for most patients with end-stage renal disease, nevertheless kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) are characterized by long-term clinical complications and high risk of cardio-vascular disease (CVD).</p><p>In addition to the traditional CVD risk factors (<italic>e.g</italic>., hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes mellitus) other non-traditional factors influence the high incidence of cardiovascular events (<italic>e.g</italic>., duration of prior dialysis, graft function after transplantation, elevated inflammatory markers, proteinuria, toxic effects of immunosuppressant drugs, bone mineral metabolism abnormalities and vascular calcifications). However, among all these risk factors, the lack of physical exercise and a sedentary lifestyle seem to play crucial roles[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>There is mounting evidence that physical exercise reduces the risk of all-cause mortality[<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and it is effective in the primary and secondary prevention of CVD in the general population[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Physical activity is also considered a key element in the prevention and management of chronic diseases[<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], including Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD).</p><p>After transplantation, patients are expected to be more active than before because their uremic syndrome is corrected and they do not have to do haemodialysis treatment[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, their cardiorespiratory fitness remains reduced by 30% in comparison with matched control subjects[<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Only in selected cases they can achieve results comparable to a healthy population[<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], but not all patients increase their physical activity after transplantation; thus, the majority of KTRs maintain a sedentary lifestyle, often associated with an increase in body fat and weight gain[<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Whether exercise can positively affect outcomes in KTRs has only been addressed in few studies[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], with a small number of subjects and with different types, intensity and durations of interventions lasting almost always not more than six months[<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In some studies, exercise was carried out tightly at home without direct supervision and with a partial adherence to the intervention[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Furthermore, few studies have investigated the effect of a combined aerobic and resistance training[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and the effect of these protocols on kidney function is rather unknown.</p><p>In this paper, we present some clinical and fitness outcomes of a 12-mo study conducted on KTRs, with the aim to evaluate the potential effects of supervised exercise combining aerobic and resistance training.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Organisational model</title><p>We introduced a project, based on a model of cooperation among: (1) Transplantation specialists (surgeons and nephrologists), who selected patients suitable for physical activity; (2) sports physicians who prescribed a personalised exercise programme based on the results of functional assessment tests; (3) exercise specialists who supervised the patients performing the prescribed programme. This organisation aims to check the patients from clinical and functional perspectives and to identify facilities in their home districts where patients can easily perform their training programmes under supervision[<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This is a multicentre, controlled, prospective, non-randomised study that considered the enrolment of KTRs patients with clinical and functional stabilities.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were the 18-60 years age range, and at least six months after organ transplantation; exclusion criteria were orthopaedic limitations, psychiatric or neurological disorders, proteinuria within nephrotic range, poor compliance to treatment and any cardiovascular contraindication to exercise testing and training.</p><p>Patients were divided into an interventional exercise group (Group A), in which personalised training was supervised, and a usual care group (Group B), in which some exercise indications were given without a specific prescription and supervision. All subjects received individualised counselling by the transplant centre regarding the protocol, and the inclusion in Group B was based on logistic and organisational grounds (patients living in regions not taking part in the project or living in areas without sports medical centres or an accessible gyms). This is the practical reason why we adopted a non-randomised design of our study.</p><p>Blood chemistry and urinalysis, complete blood count, and a cardiac evaluation were performed by the transplantation centres to assess the exclusion criteria. After the administration of the SF-36 questionnaire to evaluate Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), the patients were sent to the sports medicine centre to perform the functional assessment tests for exercise capacity, muscle strength, and body composition.</p><p>Based on the results of these tests, the sports physicians prescribed a tailored training programme only for Group A. Then, patients in Group A were sent to a certified gym to start the prescribed training under the supervision of exercise specialists, while patients in Group B, as usual, were provided general information to encourage regular physical activities at home but no specific prescription and supervision were given.</p><p>Both groups were checked at baseline (T<sub>0</sub>), six (T<sub>6</sub>) and 12 mo (T<sub>12</sub>) from the enrolment.

The total duration of each session was one hour, with a frequency of 3 times per week for 12 mo. In every session, the aerobic training was performed on a stationary bike and was administered with an intensity corresponding to the lactate aerobic threshold[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], previously assessed by the incremental cycling test at T<sub>0</sub> for the first six months and at T<sub>6</sub>, for the subsequent period. The intensity was continuously monitored by heart rate monitors (Polar, Finland) allowing the patients to maintain a constant heart rate (HR) corresponding to the aerobic threshold during the aerobic training.</p><p>In the same session, the subsequent resistance training consisted of two sets of 20 repetitions at 35% of one Repetition Maximum (1RM) for each muscle group of the upper (elbow flexors, elbow extensors, shoulder abductors) and lower limbs (knee extensors, plantar flexors). The training intensity at 35% of 1RM was chosen to increase local muscle endurance considering that KTRs are novice individuals for strength training where learning proper form and technique is paramount[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Resistance training was not performed with the upper limb with arterio-venous fistula. Warm-up, cool-down and stretching exercises were included in all training sessions.

Furthermore, the proposed organizational model led to a high exercise program adherence, <italic>i.e</italic>., to a positive change in lifestyle.</p><p>The KTRs included in Group B who received only general information to promote regular physical activity at home, without a specific supervision, did not show any improvement in physical fitness outcomes, indicating a low adherence to non-supervised home-based physical activity. This demonstrated that without a direct or indirect supervision (<italic>e.g</italic>., follow-up by calls or e-mails), patients tend to not carry out physical activity even if it is recommended by the physician.</p><p>van Adrichem et al[<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] highlighted how perceived barriers of physical activity in KTRs such as physical limitations, lack of energy, and comorbidities cannot be omitted. Moreover, the lack of specific counselling by physicians about the benefits of physical activity is a critical issue. However, in the present study we recorded a dropout rate of 15% in Group A and 13% in Group B. Painter et al[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] reported a dropout rate of 33% at one year in their exercising group of patients who performed home-based training with regular phone follow-up. Greenwood et al[<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] in their 12-wk study reported a dropout of 7 on 20 KTRs (35%) in both aerobic and resistance training supervised groups. Most of these patients reported difficulties attending classes following return to work after transplantation. Riess et al[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] reported a dropout of 2 out of 16 (13%) on their 12-wk study in the supervised exercise group and 1 out of 15 (7%) in the home based usual care group. O&#x02019;Connor et al[<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] in an un-supervised period of self-managed physical activity reported an attrition rate of 30% at the 12 mo time point that confirms a low exercise adherence without supervision.</p><p>Compliance with the treatment is a common barrier of health programmes based on exercise even if transplant recipients who have experienced a supervised exercise programme supported that it was beneficial to health and well-being[<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Social, cognitive, personality, environmental, and socio-economic factors, unrelated to the recommended guidelines, seem to be of greater importance in considering behavioural adherence issues[<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] in KTRs. To improve physical exercise programme compliance and longer-term outcomes, strategies to diversify and stimulate exercise training or change elements of training like introduce specific tracking devices designed for KTRs should be examined. Anyway, data from our study clearly show that recommendations alone are not sufficient to induce a change in lifestyle and physical fitness. On the other hand, the supervised training for long periods is costly and cannot be proposed for all the transplanted patients, so it is urgent to study new solutions, starting from the cooperation between transplantation, sports medicine, and exercise specialists.</p><p>Renal function data, expressed as creatinine, eGFR and proteinuria, were compatible with the framework of patients of a select population undergoing successful renal transplantation. The proposed training protocol had no negative effects on the renal function in the medium term and, more in detail, creatinine values tended to decrease in Group A and to increase in Group B at the same time, but the results were not significant after 12 mo. The tendency to decrease of creatinine and eGFR in Group A can be considered as positive effect of physical exercise and needs specific studies. Patients in Group A did not show any significant increase in muscle mass after 12 mo of resistance training such as to affect creatinine and eGFR, probably because of the low intensity of the resistance training.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, 12 mo of observation period is one of the longest in the literature with reference to aerobic and resistance trainings; however, it is a relatively short-time period and further studies with larger populations are necessary to understand the long-term effects of exercise or sedentary lifestyle on the renal function of KTRs.</p><p>Regarding exercise capacity, in Group A we observed a 12% increase of V&#x02019;O<sub>2</sub> peak at T<sub>6</sub>. Similar results were obtained by van den Ham et al[<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] in 33 KTRs after 12 wk of combination of endurance and strength training in which V&#x02019;O<sub>2</sub> peak increase of 10% (from 21.6 &#x000b1; 6.3 to 23.8 &#x000b1; 6.1 mL/kg per minute). Riess et al[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] reported an increase of V&#x02019;O<sub>2</sub> peak (from 20 &#x000b1; 9 to 23 &#x000b1; 10 mL/kg per minute) after 12 wk of supervised endurance training (three times/week) on cycle ergometer at 60%-80% of V&#x02019;O<sub>2</sub> max involving 16 patients.</p><p>In a study of eight KTRs, Romano et al[<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] utilised a supervised interval training technique for 10 wk, 40-min sessions for three times per week. They reported an increase of 13% of V&#x02019;O<sub>2</sub> peak.</p><p>Another intervention was published by Kempeneers et al[<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] who trained 16 KTRs for six months in preparation for the National Transplant Games. Their mean V&#x02019;O<sub>2</sub> peak rose from 29.0 &#x000b1; 7.8 to 37.5 &#x000b1; 4.8 mL/kg per minute, with an increase of 27%.</p><p>In the other hand, Painter et al[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] prescribed an individualised home-based exercise training programme in 54 KTRs, consisting on 30 min, four times per week of training at an intensity corresponding to 60%-80% of maximal HR. Patients were contacted every two weeks by phone to assess progress and adherence to the programme and to adjust it as needed. After six months, V&#x02019;O<sub>2</sub> peak increased from 24.0 &#x000b1; 7.5 to 27.8 &#x000b1; 11.0 mL/kg per minute (+ 16%) and to 30.1 &#x000b1; 10.3 mL/kg per minute (+ 25%) after 12 mo.</p><p>We can conclude that the aerobic training in KTRs leads to a substantial increase in aerobic power[<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In most cases, the type of training meets the minimal clinically significant difference of 3.5 mL/kg per minute (<italic>i.e</italic>., 1 metabolic equivalent), which is associated with improved outcomes in CVD. However, Riess et al[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] after 12 wk of endurance training were unable to demonstrate any change in resting small or large arterial compliance, peak exercise systemic vascular resistance and Framingham Risk Assessment Score, indicating that exercise intensity and overall duration are probably the most critical factors affecting CVD risk profile.</p><p>Our study did not reveal significant differences in blood pressure between the two groups, both showing normal blood pressure at rest, during and after maximal incremental exercise. This may be explained by the tightly controlled anti-hypertensive regimes in post-transplant care, as previously reported in other studies[<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Reduced general muscular strength has been related to an increased risk of all-cause of cardiovascular mortality[<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and the handgrip test values are a recognised marker of health status[<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In our study, the handgrip test values improved after six months of training and significantly improved after 12 mo, whereas in the Group B we found a trend in reduction in strength, even if it was not significant. Moreover, in the Group A the muscular strength of the lower limbs improved, and the power of the lower limbs increased after 12 mo. This increase in maximal strength and CMJ values may be associated with both neural adaptations and muscle trophism improvement[<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This finding is consistent with prior studies[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>In relation to anthropometric measures, the 12-mo supervised programme combining aerobic and resistance training was effective in reducing BMI[<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and fat mass in Group A, with a non-significant reduction in fat-free mass (-2%). However, in our study, the lipid profile remained the same; 39% of patients were taking a statin or ezetimibe as a regular drug (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), which would make further improvement in the lipid profile unlikely. Moreover, the patients did not receive a diet programme.</p><p>Regarding quality of life, we found significant improvement in Group A in the self-perception of physical function, role-limitation to physical activity and social function. The KTRs in the usual care group (Group B) did not show any improvement in HRQoL scores. This finding confirms that supervised exercise training led to a better self-perception of quality of life[<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>The association of aerobic and resistance training was safe; no acute cardiovascular event, renal graft-related or serious adverse events due to endurance or strengthening exercises were recorded. The inclusion in the protocol of the CMJ test did not have any consequence to the musculoskeletal system, indicating that KTRs can safely perform supervised power exercises[<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The accurate selection of the patients and the cardiovascular assessment at T<sub>0</sub> certainly contributed to these findings.</p><p>The present study has some limitations. First, it is a non-randomised study; we included the patients in the usual care group (Group B) on logistic and organisational grounds. Therefore, the two groups were different in baseline assessments of body mass.</p><p>Another limit is due to the workloads chosen for the aerobic and strength trainings. We adopted a steady state aerobic exercise protocol at intensity corresponding to the lactate aerobic threshold. Different training protocols, <italic>i.e</italic>., interval training, or different duration of the sessions could be more effective. Furthermore, it is possible that with a higher percentage of 1RM and with a different progressive strengthening protocols the improvements would be higher, especially when training the upper limbs. The fact that the upper limb with the arteriovenous fistula was not trained, for safety precautions, also affected the final strength results. Furthermore, we checked both groups after 6 mo of training, so probably a more frequent adjustment in the prescription of the relative intensity of trainings would lead to better functional outcomes in Group A or would give further motivations in Group B.</p><p>The anthropometric assessment by the skinfolds technique has some limitations and probably it would be possible to detect significant changes with more precise methods (<italic>i.e</italic>., dual energy X-ray absorptiometry). Another limit is that we administered the IPAQ only to Group B to reduce the bias between the two groups, but it was impossible to make any direct comparison with Group A.</p><p>Finally, patients included in our study were carefully selected and were thus not representative of the entire KTRs population. Furthermore, the prescribed exercise program was based on blood tests and other measurements that are not routinely performed in gyms and cannot be universally applied, so the generalizability of the results is limited.</p><p>Despite some limitations, this paper shows that developing a supervised exercise protocol for KTRs is a useful and safe non-pharmacologic contribution to usual after-transplant treatments, which can improve the physiological variables related to physical fitness and cardiovascular risks without consequences on renal function. Our study is an example of collaborative working between transplant centres, sports medicine and exercise facilities, aimed to apply the concepts of &#x0201c;exercise is medicine&#x0201d;.</p><p>Further studies with longer follow-up and larger populations are necessary to understand the strategies that will improve adherence to training programmes, control costs and lead to steady and durable lifestyle changes in KTRs.</p></sec><sec><title>ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS</title><sec><title>Research background</title><p>Kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) are characterised by long term clinical complications and high risk of cardiovascular disease. After transplantation, physical activity is considered a key element in the prevention and management of chronic diseases, however the majority of KTRs maintain a sedentary lifestyle, often associated with an increase of body fat and weight gain. Whether exercise can positively affect outcomes in KTRs has only been addressed in few studies, with a small number of subjects and with different types, intensity and durations of interventions lasting almost always not more than six mo. Furthermore, few studies have investigated the effect of a combined aerobic and resistance training, and the effect of these protocols on kidney function is rather unknown. In this paper, we present some clinical and fitness outcomes of a 12-mo study conducted on KTRs, with the aim to evaluate the potential effects of supervised exercise combining aerobic and resistance training.</p></sec><sec><title>Research frontiers</title><p>Developing a supervised exercise protocol for KTRs is a useful and safe non-pharmacologic contribution to usual after-transplant treatments, which can improve the physiological variables related to physical fitness and cardiovascular risks without consequences on renal function.
