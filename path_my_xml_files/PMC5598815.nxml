Moreover, IBS-QOL overall and all subdomain scores were improved from baseline for up to 4 weeks posttreatment in patients receiving 2-week open-label rifaximin treatment, with the greatest improvements from baseline observed for the IBS-QOL subdomains of dysphoria and interference with activity. Interestingly, IBS-QOL subdomain scores for food avoidance, interference with activity, and dysphoria have been shown to be low (i.e. poorer QOL) in patients with IBS-D,<sup><xref rid="bibr23-1756283X17726087" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bibr24-1756283X17726087" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and the majority of patients with IBS have self-reported intolerances to a number of foods, which aberrantly affects QOL.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-1756283X17726087" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Indeed, in the open-label population, baseline IBS-QOL subdomain scores for food avoidance, interference with activity, and dysphoria were among the lowest, compared with other IBS-QOL subdomain scores. All of these subdomain scores significantly improved in responders treated with rifaximin compared with nonresponders. It is valuable to note that the IBS-QOL is a derivative measure that reflects the perceptions of patients with IBS, including the amount of control they have over their symptoms, if they can socialize, and their sexual relationships, which can have lasting effects even if there is some degree of symptom change. It was not designed as a surrogate measure of symptoms or function.</p><p>Improvements from open-label baseline in IBS-QOL overall and subdomain scores for food avoidance, interference with activity, and body image were significantly greater in patients who responded to open-label rifaximin who did not relapse during the treatment-free observation phase, as compared with those who responded and subsequently relapsed during the observation phase. This finding suggests that greater improvement in QOL following treatment with rifaximin is associated with a lower chance of subsequent symptom relapse. Indeed, responders to open-label treatment with rifaximin had significantly greater improvement from baseline in the IBS-QOL overall score based on an MCID &#x02a7e;14 points compared with nonresponders at 4 weeks posttreatment. The subgroup of nonresponders who achieved the MCID in IBS-QOL may not have met the formal prespecified criteria for response, but it is possible that they may have experienced enough improvement in their clinical symptoms with rifaximin treatment that they deemed their QOL improved. While a direct association between MCID and the symptomatic response to rifaximin is not entirely expected, clinically meaningful improvement in IBS-QOL appears to be consistent with improvements in abdominal pain and stool consistency previously reported for these patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-1756283X17726087" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> These data demonstrate that a single course of short-term treatment with rifaximin is associated with clinically meaningful improvement in QOL in patients with IBS-D.</p><p>For patients with open-label response to rifaximin who relapsed during the observation phase and were randomly assigned to double-blind rifaximin or placebo, a statistically significantly greater percentage of patients receiving rifaximin achieved an MCID in IBS-QOL overall score from double-blind baseline to end of first retreatment 4-week follow-up compared with placebo, providing further evidence of the sustained beneficial and clinically meaningful impact of rifaximin on QOL in patients with IBS-D. These favorable findings regarding QOL appear to align with the significant improvement in efficacy outcomes observed with rifaximin compared with placebo during the first double-blind retreatment phase of the study, suggesting that improvement in IBS-QOL may, in part, be driven by relief of IBS symptoms following repeat treatment with rifaximin <italic>versus</italic> placebo.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-1756283X17726087" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Interestingly, when patients had recurrent IBS symptoms after responding to open-label rifaximin, the baseline QOL immediately preceding double-blind, repeat treatment was improved compared with that reported at open-label baseline. This is consistent with data previously reported for this trial for IBS symptom scores (e.g. 20% improvement in abdominal pain at double-blind baseline relative to symptom severity prior to open-label rifaximin), which were also lower (improved) compared with open-label baseline data.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-1756283X17726087" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The improvement in QOL at baseline of the double-blind, repeat treatment phase reduces the statistical power to detect measurable improvement related to a potential carryover effect.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-1756283X17726087" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p><p>The improvement from both open-label and double-blind baseline to the end of study observed in IBS-QOL overall scores between rifaximin and placebo with short-term exposure (i.e. 2 weeks) was comparable with data reported for patients with IBS-D receiving the mixed &#x000b5;-opioid receptor agonist/&#x003b4;-opioid receptor antagonist eluxadoline 100 mg and 75 mg after 12 weeks of twice-daily therapy.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-1756283X17726087" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> However, it is unclear whether improvements in IBS-QOL overall scores are durable for eluxadoline following treatment discontinuation. The selective type 3 serotonin receptor antagonist alosetron 1 mg administered twice daily improved IBS-specific QOL subdomain scores for emotional, mental health, sleep, energy, food/diet, social function, and physical role from baseline after 12 weeks in women with severe IBS-D.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-1756283X17726087" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Alosetron 1 mg twice daily also improved IBS-specific QOL subscale scores for physical role, food/diet, and social function and met or exceeded the MCID in two randomized, placebo-controlled studies of women with IBS-D or IBS-M after 12 weeks of therapy.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-1756283X17726087" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Similar to eluxadoline, alosetron must be administered daily, long-term, so durability of QOL improvement following treatment discontinuation is unclear. In addition, direct comparisons of alosetron with rifaximin are limited because of a different disease-specific QOL instrument used in alosetron trials.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-1756283X17726087" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bibr29-1756283X17726087" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p><p>A limitation of the current study is that patients who responded to open-label rifaximin, but who did not relapse during the 18-week, treatment-free observation phase, discontinued from the study per protocol. Therefore, further assessment of this nonrelapsing patient population was not conducted to evaluate the duration of improvement in IBS-QOL scores beyond a total of 18 weeks after response was assessed. Another limitation of the current study is that when data were missing for an item within the subdomains of the IBS-QOL instrument, scores were not calculated at a given time point, limiting the data available for some assessments during the study. Data from some assessments included a small number of patients (e.g. patients who only received one repeat treatment course). In addition, some components of the IBS-QOL instrument, although a valid instrument for IBS-D, have been reported not to be optimal for patients with IBS-D,<sup><xref rid="bibr30-1756283X17726087" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> and thus using this instrument may not have fully assessed the condition of IBS-D and potential impact of treatments. This study was not sufficiently powered to examine specific demographic and baseline disease characteristics previously shown to be associated with QOL in patients with IBS-D (e.g. sex), and these analyses were not conducted.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-1756283X17726087" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Finally, this study did not compare improvement in QOL with patient daily activities, which are often impaired by IBS.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1756283X17726087" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>In conclusion, patients with IBS-D receiving short-term (2-week) repeat treatment with rifaximin experienced clinically meaningful improvements in QOL. Furthermore, repeat treatment with rifaximin provided incremental overall and subdomain QOL improvement in addition to the enduring improvement observed following initial treatment with open-label rifaximin. The improvements in QOL reported in the current study further support the clinical usefulness of a 14-day course of rifaximin 550 mg three times a day as treatment and repeat treatment for the management of IBS-D.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplementary material</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="Supplementary_Material_TAG726087.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d35e1039" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Technical editorial assistance was provided, under the direction of the authors, by Mary Beth Moncrief, PhD, and Sophie Bolick, PhD, Synchrony Medical Communications, LLC, West Chester, Pennsylvania, USA.
