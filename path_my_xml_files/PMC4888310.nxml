The purpose of this work is to evaluate whether co-packing using a plastic pouch can enhance the joint adherence to the treatment or not. The study also compares the cost effectiveness (CE) of two co-packaging options: &#x02018;central&#x02019; and &#x02018;health center (HC)&#x02019; level bundling.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This cluster-randomised controlled trial was conducted in 2015 in eight districts of Ethiopia. Thirty two HCs were randomly assigned to one of the following four intervention arms: <italic>(i)</italic> &#x02018;Central bundling&#x02019; (zinc and ORS bundled using a pouch that had instructional message, distributed to HCs); <italic>(ii)</italic> &#x02018;HC level bundling&#x02019; (zinc, ORS and a similar pouch distributed to the HCs and bundled by health workers); <italic>(iii)</italic> &#x02018;Bundling without message&#x02019; (zinc, ORS and plain pouch distributed and bundled by the health workers); and, <italic>(iv)</italic> &#x02018;Status quo&#x02019; (zinc and ORS co-administered without bundling). In each of the four arms, 176 children 6&#x02013;59 months of age, presented with acute diarrhea were enrolled. Twelve days after enrollment, level of adherence was assessed. A composite scale of adherence was developed and modeled using mixed effects linear regression analysis. The unit costs associated with the arms were estimated using secondary data sources. Incremental CE analysis was made by taking the cost and level of adherence in fourth arm as a base value.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The follow-up rate was 95.6&#x000a0;%. As compared with the &#x02018;status quo&#x02019; arm, the joint adherences in the &#x02018;central&#x02019; and &#x02018;HC level&#x02019; bundling arms raised substantially by 14.8 and 15.7 percentage points (PP), respectively (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). No significant difference was observed between &#x02018;bundling without message&#x02019; and the &#x02018;status quo&#x02019; arms. The unit cost incurred by the &#x02018;central bundling&#x02019; is relatively higher (USD 0.658/episode) as compared with the &#x02018;HC level bundling&#x02019; approach (USD 0.608/episode). The incremental CE ratio in the &#x02018;central bundling&#x02019; modality was two times higher than in the &#x02018;HC based bundling&#x02019; approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Bundling zinc with ORS using a pouch with instructional messages increases adherence to the treatment. &#x02018;HC level bundling&#x02019; is more CE than the &#x02018;central bundling&#x02019; approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12889-016-3126-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>ORS</kwd><kwd>Zinc</kwd><kwd>Bundling</kwd><kwd>Co-packing</kwd><kwd>Adherence</kwd><kwd>Ethiopia</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Micronutrient Initiative (MI)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Diarrhea remains the second leading cause of death among infants and young children, accounting for 18&#x000a0;% of mortality and 13&#x000a0;% of all Disability-Adjusted Life Years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Among children younger than 5&#x000a0;years, each year diarrhea kills around 760,000 children and causes 1.7 billion illnesses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Of all child deaths from diarrhea, 78&#x000a0;% occur in the Africa and South-East Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Despite the recent decline in infant (50/1000 live births (LB)) and under five (88/1000 LB) mortality rates, in Ethiopia child morality still remains high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In the country 22&#x000a0;% of childhood deaths are attributable to diarrhea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, according to Ethiopia Demographic Health Survey (DHS) 2011, 13&#x000a0;% children younger than 5&#x000a0;years had diarrhea in the preceding two weeks and the figure was as high as 25&#x000a0;% amongst children 6&#x02013;11 months of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Despite the alarming statistics, diarrhea is highly treatable. More than three-quarters of all diarrhea deaths could be averted with full coverage and utilization of Oral Rehydration Salt (ORS) and adjunct zinc supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. There is unequivocal evidence that therapeutic zinc supplementation decreases the duration and severity of diarrheal episode and the likelihood of subsequent infections in the 2&#x02013;3 months following treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Zinc supplementation also cut diarrhea related mortality by nearly one quarter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Its recommend that under-five years old children should receive 10&#x02013;14 days of zinc treatment for diarrhea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, an increasing number of studies are showing that adherence to zinc is unsatisfactory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A study in Kenya reported that among mothers who received diarrhea treatment for their children, 62&#x000a0;% reported giving zinc for fewer than the recommended 10&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In Bangladesh two studies reported 56&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and 62&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] adherence to the full ten days treatment course. In Mali, less than two-thirds (64&#x000a0;%) received the entire 14-day treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In India, at the 7th day of treatment, 82&#x000a0;% of children had already stopped taking the supplement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Bundling (co-packaging) of zinc with ORS may encourage their combined use, and enhance access to and utilization of the treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. On-pack information can also serve as education and communication tool. A study conducted in Western Guatemala found, bundling of zinc with ORS in a graphic co-pack with instructions and provider messages for counseling significantly improved both the prescription practices of health professionals and adherence to zinc treatment of mothers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Formative research in Cambodia also concluded that co-packaging is an effective means of encouraging the combined use zinc and ORS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>The gray literature indicates many countries in the developing world including Kenya, Uganda, Zambia, Nigeria, Benin, Cambodia and Guatemala are initiating co-packaging of zinc and ORS for diarrhea treatment. Likewise, in Ethiopia, with the support of Micronutrient Initiative (MI), the Pharmaceuticals Fund and Supply Agency (PFSA) has launched the distribution of the bundled products in selected regions of the country. Nevertheless, limited evidence exists regarding the effectiveness of the intervention.</p><p>Bundling of zinc and ORS can be implemented in two approaches. Readymade centrally bundled products can be distributed to the health institutions (Central bundling) or the products can be dispatched and health workers do the bundling at health institution level (health center (HC) level bundling). Nevertheless, comparative cost effectiveness (CE) has not been made.</p><p>Thus, the purpose of this study is to evaluate whether co-packing of zinc with ORS using a plastic pouch can enhance the joint adherence to diarrhea treatment or not. The study also compared the CE (cost per unit of a defined health outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]) of &#x02018;central&#x02019; and &#x02018;health center (HC)&#x02019; level bundling approaches as a means to provide empirical evidence for decision making.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p>The study was a cluster-randomised controlled trial with four parallel intervention arms and an allocation ratio of 1.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p>The study was conducted in 32 HCs selected across 8 districts of Tigray, Amhara, Oromya and Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples (SNNP) regions of Ethiopia.

The study districts were Laelay Maychew, Enda Mehoni, Tehuledere, Dera, Dendi, Dodola, Misrak Badwacho and Aleta Wondo.</p><p>Children 6&#x02013;59 months of age presented with diarrhea in the HCs during the study period (January to March, 2015) where eligible for enrolment.

During first contact, baseline data were collected, treatment administered according to the study protocol and the address of the household was registered. Two weeks later, respondents were visited at their home and adherence was assessed based on the self report of parents/caregivers. Data were collected by 96 trained health professionals working in the selected HCs using a pretested questionnaire prepared in the local languages.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Outcome of the study</title><p>The primary outcome of the study was level of joint adherence to zinc and ORS treatment; secondary outcomes were level of independent adherence to zinc and ORS treatment.</p><p>Adherence to zinc was calculated as percentage of zinc tablets given to the baby out of the ten provided at the HC; whereas, adherence to ORS was computed as percentage of times ORS was administered after the child had diarrheal episodes. Joint adherence to zinc and ORS measured using a composite index developed by assigning a weight of 0.5 to each of the zinc and ORS adherence index.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size required for assessing the level of adherence and cost-effectiveness (CE) was computed via the GPower 3.15 software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] using sample size calculation formula for comparison of means.

Then from each district, 4 HCs having relatively high patient flow were selected. Then four of the HCs selected from each district were randomly allocated to the four arms via the lottery method. Randomisation was done by one of the principal investigators. Finally based on the eligibility criteria, 22 subjects were recruited from each HC using quota sampling technique.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Blinding</title><p>The study did not involve any kind of blinding as it was not possible.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The data were entered and analyzed using SPSS 19.0 and STATA SE 12 software. The analysis was made according to the initial treatment arm assignment. Prior to comparing the level of adherence in the four arms, the socio-demographic profiles of the groups were compared. Categorical variables were evaluated using chi-square test; whereas numeric measures, depending on their normality, assessed using ANOVA or kruskal Wallis test.</p><p>The levels of adherence across the four intervention arms were compared using mixed effects multiple linear regression model (with random intercepts for region, district and HC) adjusted for two variables that showed significant variation across the arms. Prior to analysis the assumptions of linear regression were assessed.</p><p>Wealth index was computed using principal component analysis as a composite indicator of living standard based on ownership of selected household assets, size of agricultural land, quantity of livestock, materials used for housing construction, and ownership of improved water and sanitation facilities. Ultimately wealth tertiles were generated.</p><p>The unit costs associated with the three arms (excluding &#x02018;bundling without message&#x02019; arm) were estimated based on different secondary data sources. Various direct costs (costs for purchasing zinc, ORS and bundling pouch; cost for printing the messages on the pouch) and indirect costs (costs of transportation for the aforementioned items, marginal manpower cost for conducting the bundling at central and HC levels, and intellectual cost for developing the message printed on the pouch) were estimated. The costs are calculated as an aggregate of all inputs which are identified, measured and thereafter valued at determined unit costs.</p><p>With the intension of making macro level comparisons, the hypothetical total annual expenses of the country for treating acute watery diarrhea using the three different approaches were estimated. The computation was made by multiplying the unit cost for treatment by the expected number of health institution based diarrhea treatments per annum. Information regarding the approaches used to estimate unit cost and total national cost is provided as an auxiliary file (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p><p>Incremental CE analysis was made by taking the added Percentage Points (PP) of adherence for joint zinc-ORS treatment as the sole measure of effectiveness. The cost and level of adherence in the fourth arm (the usual way of distribution without bundling) was taken as the base value. CE ratio was calculated by dividing the added unit costs with the added PP in adherence.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Characteristics of the respondents and the study subjects</title><p>In the baseline study 704 children (176 from each arm) were enrolled.

The bundling can create a notion that zinc and ORS are parts of a protocol and should not be used as stand-alone products; further, on-pack instructions can serve as an information and education tool. In the current study, the better adherence observed in the &#x02018;central&#x02019; and &#x02018;HC level&#x02019; arms and the absence of sizable difference between the other two arms demonstrate that the benefit is predominantly due to the effect of instructional messages provided on the pouch.</p><p>The positive effect of bundling zinc with ORS using a pouch with instructional messages has also been witnessed elsewhere. A study in Guatemala reported that provision of the products in a graphic co-pack with instructions significantly improved both the prescription practices and adherence to zinc. Mothers who received the co-pack had 1.7 times increased probability of providing the full 10&#x000a0;days of zinc treatment than their counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Experiences of social marketing of zinc in Cambodia also showed that co-packaging and an instructional insert had encouraged the combined use of the products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>In this study the level of zinc, ORS and joint adherences were comparable in the central and HC level bundling arms. However, the CE was better in the latter. Nevertheless, from program implementation point of view, apart from CE, other feasibility parameters including sustainability and acceptance of the task by health workers and PFSA should be evaluated.</p><p>As the study followed an interventional design, the reported level of adherence is unlikely to illustrate the existing practice in the study districts. Nevertheless, the &#x02018;status quo&#x02019; arm may provide surrogate information. In this arm, merely 38&#x000a0;% of the respondents adhered to the full ten days zinc treatment indicating compliance is suboptimal. Increasing numbers of studies are witnessing the same. For instance, the complete adherence to the full 10&#x000a0;days zinc treatment course was as low as 29&#x000a0;% in Madagascar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], 38&#x000a0;% in Kenya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and 44&#x000a0;% in Bangladesh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Conversely, better level of adherence had been reported in Mali [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and Nigeria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>In the current study the most frequently forwarded reason for discontinuation of zinc is recovery of the child. The fact that diarrheal illness typically lasts for few days but zinc is expected to be provided for 10&#x02013;14 days creates a challenge for adherence. Another study based on a synthesis of formative research results from nine countries including Ethiopia also concluded that, the major barriers to the full course of zinc include the common practice of stopping treatment when diarrhea stops and a lack of caregiver awareness of the benefits of zinc for prevention of diarrhea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. It is therefore important to include in promotional material, strong communication on the need to complete the dosage regardless of whether the child&#x02019;s diarrhea has ceased.</p><p>The findings of the study should be interpreted in consideration of its limitations. Adherence was assessed based on the caregivers&#x02019; report. Consequently, the level is likely to be overestimated due to social desirability bias. Further, adherence to ORS was assessed based on the proportion of diarrhea episodes that were followed by ORS administration. Remembering the total number of diarrheal episodes is evidently challenging and its liable recall errors. The data were only collected from HCs hence the findings may not be inferred to other types of health institutions as the type of health provider and clients&#x02019; characteristics may vary.</p><p>Regarding the CE analysis, the following limitations should be noted. The analysis is made by taking the number of added units of zinc-ORS adherence as the sole measure of effectiveness. Hence, any contribution of the intervention in terms of reducing the severity and recurrence of diarrhea has not been considered. Further, the estimated cost cannot be inferred to other settings as some of its components (like transportation cost) were peculiar to the study districts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Bundling zinc with ORS via a pouch with instructional messages increases adherence to diarrhea treatment. &#x02018;HC level bundling&#x02019; is more cost effective than the &#x02018;central bundling&#x02019; strategy.
