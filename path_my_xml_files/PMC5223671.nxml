Globally, the prevalence of asthma is rising, as is the corresponding burden on healthcare systems.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> With symptom control as the primary goal of treatment, the extent to which asthma patients play an active role in the day-to-day management of their condition is directly associated with improved outcomes.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> However, self-management and long-term control of mild to moderate asthma is often poor and this has been linked to several factors, including complexity of the condition, reluctance to accept diagnosis of a chronic condition, over-reliance on health professionals and simple forgetfulness.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> While effective management of symptoms through appropriate use of medication is vital, education and information play a significant role, with tailored information being shown to be highly effective in asthma care.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Asthma patients report unmet information needs and are generally keen to participate in the decision-making process.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> A disconnection has been reported between patients and healthcare providers views about what patients need to know.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> A tailored, personalised and proactive approach to symptom management has the potential to improve asthma outcomes primarily by encouraging adherence to medication,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> but formal adoption of this approach is wanting.</p><p>In recent years, there has been continuous growth in the use of the internet for health information across Europe,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and the role and nature of digital health resources has evolved. Websites are no longer static repositories of information and health resource consumers are now likely to be &#x02018;prosumers&#x02019;&#x02014;simultaneous consumers and creators of online material&#x02014;with proactive engagement with online resources, particularly those containing patient-focused content, especially high among those with one or more chronic conditions.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> While many early asthma web interventions and digital resources failed to meet patients&#x02019; needs and expectations in terms of usability and content,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> an online interdisciplinary approach has been consistently demonstrated as an attractive and effective source of long-term support for asthma management<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;16</xref> when compared with usual care. Increasingly, people desire more than traditional forms of fact-based health information and actively go online to seek others&#x02019; accounts of their own experiences of health and illness,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> with patients proactively choosing to view online patient experiences that provide immediate and relevant value. In particular, patients experiencing a range of conditions report finding personal testimonials useful in helping them to recognise and reflect on decisions that need consideration, identifying and appraising options, and supporting coping strategies.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> There is now a limited but emerging literature looking at the value of novel digital tools which attempt to harness this narrative, experiential information from peers to influence health attitudes and behaviour.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;23</xref></p><p>However, questions remain regarding the composition of online health information and understanding of what works well, how and for whom. Determining a digital intervention's &#x02018;active ingredients&#x02019; is complex but important: this study attempts to harness and isolate the impact of exposure to online experiential information. Self-management is an established approach to controlling asthma,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and the content of asthma self-management education is well described in UK and international clinical guidelines.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> However, despite the reported effectiveness of asthma self-management, promotion and uptake remains low among patients and healthcare professionals. Factors known to impact on effective self-management include suboptimal social support and perceived ease of access to healthcare, together with a lack of knowledge about how to manage the condition, misunderstandings about therapy, concerns about medication and perceived difficulty with &#x02018;fitting&#x02019; self-management into daily life.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>Although digital tools have been shown to hold promise in supporting self-management, the best way to communicate information and support through such tools is often unclear.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The theoretical foundation of the EXPERT intervention was underpinned by a conceptual review<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> which suggested that observing and participating in the online sharing of personal experience of health and illness could be beneficial in self-management. The conceptual review identified seven &#x02018;domains&#x02019; in which online patients&#x02019; experiences could affect health: finding information, feeling supported, maintaining relationships with others, affecting behaviour, experiencing health services, learning to tell the story and visualising disease. It was hypothesised that the EXPERT asthma intervention could achieve impact across these domains through the provision of experiential, contextualised information. Exposure to such information could help participants feel more informed about their condition, less alone in managing it and more able to manage relationships with significant others through the mechanisms of social support, social comparison and self-efficacy. In addition, the free-form, non-tunnelled approach to navigating the EXPERT website encouraged recursive engagement with information chosen by the participant as being of particular relevance to them and their specific needs.</p><p>Evidence demonstrates that sharing practical and experiential information online is an important part of health-related internet use and that accessing such content is particularly valued by certain patient groups.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The potential for personal stories to improve perceived support has been noted across various health conditions, such as HIV/AIDS,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> prostate and breast cancers<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and fibromyalgia.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> However, far less how is known about how people with asthma view online patient experiences and how they make use of the information they find.</p><p>The theoretical review by Ziebland and Wyke<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> formed the foundation for a programme of work undertaken to develop and test online interventions intending to harness the value of other people's experiences as a new mechanism for delivering health benefit. In this paper, we therefore describe the findings from the first randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a novel &#x02018;experienced-based&#x02019; online intervention for the self-management of chronic asthma. The primary aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of trialling this new approach as an asthma self-management intervention. The secondary aim was to report the effect of the intervention and comparator websites on various self-reported outcomes, including measures of self-efficacy, self-management and health status.

We did this for three conditions: smoking cessation; asthma; and caring for someone with multiple sclerosis. Target recruitment was 300 participants, 100 participants per condition. The smoking cessation and carers case studies will be reported separately. To minimise the risk of contamination across the three studies, each recruited in different settings and only one person per household was eligible to take part in any of the three studies.</p><p>Participants who indicated interest and met the inclusion criteria were sent a patient information sheet and consent form by post to be signed and returned to the research office in a reply-paid envelope. Once consent had been received, participants&#x02019; details were entered into a secure Trial Management Portal and they were emailed a unique &#x02018;Welcome Code&#x02019; with a link to the trial registration web page (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">supplementary file 2</xref>). An automatic email was generated if the participant had not used their code within a week, inviting the participant to visit the trial registration page. Participants who no longer wished to take part could simply ignore this reminder. The email contained a link to access the trial registration page where the participant was invited to complete online baseline questionnaires. Completion of baseline measures generated an invitation to create a unique user ID and password and randomisation to access either the intervention or comparator website, for a period of 2&#x02005;weeks. Randomisation used a computer-generated random number sequence in a 1:1 ratio and was carried out by stratified (on the three conditions) block randomisation with varying block sizes. A randomisation list was generated and uploaded to the online trial portal to ensure treatment concealment. The investigators were not aware of the randomisation result on the system. The randomisation list, which was password-protected, was kept in confidence.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2016-013401.supp2</object-id><label>supplementary file</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss2" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-013401supp2.pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material><p>Participants were able to logon and access the website interventions as much or as little as they wanted.

Up to two emails and one telephone call were used to remind those who did not initially respond. Participants&#x02019; usage of their allocated website was also tracked. In addition to the statistical analysis, we also conducted interviews with participants in this trial and with participants in the two other trials exploring the value of online personal experiences and a joint analysis of these will be reported separately.

An advisory panel of lay representatives, leading researchers and clinicians also provided extensive input. The website included thematic analyses of key topics from interviews with a purposive sample of 40 people with asthma about their experiences of their condition.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Topics are illustrated with interview extracts in short video, audio and written formats. Video and audio extract varied in length but were typically 2&#x02005;min long. Examples of the 25 topics published on the website include &#x02018;early signs and symptoms&#x02019;, &#x02018;what asthma feels like&#x02019;, &#x02018;dealing with health professionals&#x02019;, &#x02018;emotions and coping&#x02019; and &#x02018;advice to others&#x02019;. The content was presented on the website in such a way that users were able to browse topics according to relevance and interest. The content was not personalised to individual users and information flow was not guided or &#x02018;tunnelled&#x02019; in any way: all intervention users experienced the same website and could navigate content in any chosen order. To maintain a stable intervention, we did not include user interactivity that could change the content of the website, other than the option to provide feedback to the research team. Users were able to comment on and rate each page if desired.</p><p>To compare this intervention site with a &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; matched alternative, we provided a control website based on &#x02018;facts and figures&#x02019; about asthma self-management.

Secondary outcomes used the following self-report questionnaires. The Partners in Health (PIH) measure is a 12-item questionnaire which asks participants to rate how well they look after themselves and manage their health condition, on an 8-point scale. The Chronic Disease Self-Efficacy Scale (CDSES) is a 6-item questionnaire which asks respondents to rate their confidence in being able to undertake certain activities, on a 10-point scale. A single-item asthma control question was included, which asked how participants rated their asthma control over the past 2 weeks. The SF36 (including physical and mental dimensions and all subscales) measures health status. Finally, we used the E-Health Impact Questionnaire (eHIQ), a validated measure which captures the attitudes of respondents towards the website they have recently viewed, giving scores on three subscales: confidence and identification, information and presentation, and understanding and motivation.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Sample size and statistical analyses</title><p>The target sample size for this asthma study was 100 participants. The primary determinant of this sample size was to demonstrate feasibility. In terms of effect sizes, based on a balanced randomisation of the intervention:comparator groups in a ratio of 1:1 (ie, 50 intervention, 50 comparator), the study would detect potential large effects of the intervention: for dichotomous outcomes, these were equivalent to relative risks of 2.1 or above for a baseline rate of 30% or less, given an &#x003b1; of 0.05 and 90% power; for continuous outcomes, these detectable differences would be of the order of 0.4 SDs based on the same power and significance. Feasibility outcome measures were summarised using descriptive statistics such as rates reported as percentages. Formal hypothesis testing was not performed since this was a feasibility study and was not intended to power for assessing evidence of significant treatment effect, but estimated difference in outcome measures of efficacy and corresponding 95% CIs were calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusting for baseline values.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 200 invitations were sent in response to expressions of interest in the study, and 150 individuals (75%) completed registration (ie, consented and completed baseline questionnaires).

Recruitment and consent rates were high in this study, demonstrating trial feasibility. It is possible to speculate that strong response rates were achieved thanks to the combined actions of a proactive primary care research network and engaged general practitioners who were able to identify a condition which is readily coded in the primary care system. The intervention was delivered successfully, and there were no adverse events or protocol deviations. As is frequently seen in trials of fully automated online interventions, actual use of the intervention was relatively low: the median number of logins was 2 and the median amount of time spent on the site was 17&#x02005;min, although there was wide variation, with usage data skewed by some participants spending a long time on the website. Collection of the usage data was valuable in exploring whether or not simple exposure to the website was sufficient to have an effect on the outcome measures and given the low level of usage observed, future work needs to maximise user engagement with the intervention. We were not able to record which specific pages of the intervention were most used, and again it would be valuable in future work to understand more about this when interpreting the effect of using the website. Retention rates at 2&#x02005;weeks were moderately high (82%). Future work could include additional forms of automated contact such as text message prompts and reminders to reduce attrition further, without compromising the cost advantage of having no face-to-face contact.</p><p>This study was not designed to assess efficacy, and comparisons between randomised groups showed no significant differences on any of the measures. This is not surprising as the comparator group received access to what is considered to be excellent factual information about management of chronic asthma. Importantly, there were no adverse events from the novel intervention. Future work should take an explicitly pragmatic approach: one way of doing this would be to explore whether the experiential element could be incorporated as an adjunct rather than as an alternative, investigating whether experiential information has added value alongside &#x02018;facts and figures&#x02019;.</p><p>Future work should consider the nature of how the sites are used. Allocating participants to a 2-week &#x02018;dose&#x02019; of a website and then measuring its impact does not reflect real-world information behaviour or everyday internet use. Future work needs to reflect &#x02018;real-life&#x02019; engagement with digital resources. This is challenging within an RCT design which generally packages websites as a static experience, so that everyone in the group receives the same intervention. In practice, people search, reflect on, personally curate and &#x02018;consume&#x02019; multiple information sources within an off-line and online landscape in multiple ways at different stages of an illness. Further theoretical and methodological work may be needed to consider the issues of &#x02018;dosage&#x02019; and &#x02018;exposure&#x02019; in the context of online health information. For example, future work could explore the potential value to users of being able to contribute to an experience-based intervention: the current study used a set of personal accounts which had been solicited and curated so as to comply with the RCT paradigm. In reality, people who are managing chronic asthma may wish to contribute and comment as well as look at those from others; this may offer more realistic interaction and reflects the real-life evolution of such websites.</p><p>It is important to note characteristics of the cohort which would likely influence outcomes. Although participants were eligible if they had been clinically diagnosed with asthma and prescribed inhaled corticosteroids for at least 3&#x02005;months in the previous year, the vast majority of participants had lived with asthma for much longer. No recently diagnosed patients were randomised. Most of the people who volunteered to take part were experienced in managing their condition and had their asthma well controlled. They were also, not surprisingly, people who were comfortable and confident about using the internet. Thus, while they were willing and able to take part in a study of online health information, they were not a group who were likely &#x02018;in the real world&#x02019; to be searching online for health information or connection with other people living with asthma, in order to support their own asthma management. This has clear implications for further research: how do you recruit those people who perhaps are less likely to be motivated to take part in the research but are more likely to need help with self-management? Further work is required to identify which people with asthma are most likely to benefit from such an intervention: for example, experiential information of this type and for this condition may be best suited to those who are newly diagnosed or experiencing a change in symptoms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Asthma remains a major public health problem internationally and can profoundly impact on physical and psychological well-being. Effective self-management of chronic asthma is associated with improved outcomes. The sharing of personal experiences online is a relatively new phenomenon and we have attempted to examine the value of this in a novel intervention to support self-management as part of an RCT. We have demonstrated that this is feasible and not shown any harm from the intervention, compared with a gold standard &#x02018;facts and figures&#x02019; website. However, future work needs to consider how to deliver such an intervention in a more pragmatic fashion reflecting &#x02018;real world&#x02019; internet use, and assessing the value of such an intervention as an adjunct rather than an alternative to other sources of information. Future work, as with all new self-directed internet interventions, is also needed to determine the best methods to maximise engagement and adherence.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are very grateful for the guidance provided by our Trial Steering Committee (TSC) chaired by Professor Elizabeth Murray.
