However, there is some evidence showing that they are involved in development of allergic inflammation. Many papers have been published on the role of these chemokines in skin allergic diseases but the knowledge of their function in respiratory allergic diseases is scanty and mainly refers to <italic>in vitro</italic> and animal studies. It is known that MIG/CXCL9 and IP-10/CXCL10 may be produced by eosinophils after stimulation with INF-&#x003b3; but this effect is suppressed by Th2-cytokine interleukin (IL)-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>]. This may indicate that MIG/CXCL9 and IP-10/CXCL10 may take part in downregulation of allergic inflammation. However, there are some reports showing that at least IP-10/CXCL10 and MIG/CXCL9 may be important factors playing a role in development of the inflammatory state in asthma and asthma exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>].</p><p>In this pilot study we examined basal concentrations of MIG/CXCL9, IP-10/CXCL10 and I-TAC/CXCL11 in nasal lavages collected from healthy and allergic subjects outside of the pollen season as well as the potential effect of application of the relevant allergen on the levels of the chemokines during the early phase of an allergic reaction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S0002"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="S20003"><title>Study group</title><p>Consecutive patients with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis due to grass pollen allergy and healthy volunteers were included.

The presented data focused on the early phase of the allergic reaction, which is the main limitation of this study. Nevertheless, we were able to observe the changes in MIG/CXCL9 concentrations 30 min after the application of the allergen and higher baseline levels of IP-10/CXCL10 in allergic subjects compared to healthy controls outside the pollen season.</p><p>Miotto <italic>et al</italic>. found that IP-10/CXCL10 is overexpressed in asthmatic lower airways, but to a lesser extent than in subjects with sarcoidosis, which is mainly a Th1 mediated disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>]. Similarly, IP-10/CXCL10 as well as MIG/CXCL9 and I-TAC/CXCL11 were detected in higher concentrations in bronchoalveolar fluid of asthmatic children when compared to control subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>]. Moreover, IP-10/CXCL10 and MIG/CXCL9 plasma levels are higher during an acute asthma exacerbation than during a subsequent convalescent period or when compared to patients with stable disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>]. The important role of IP-10/CXCL10 in development of airway hyperresponsiveness and Th2-type allergic inflammation was proven in a murine model of asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>]. Our results show that in nasal lavages of patients allergic to grass pollen IP-10/CXCL10 levels are overexpressed outside the pollen season, which may indicate subclinical inflammation in these subjects despite the lack of exposure to the relevant allergen. This hypothesis is supported by previous findings of our group showing increased levels of 8-isoprostane in nasal lavages obtained outside the pollen season from patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>]. Our study indicates that IP-10/CXCL10 levels do not rise during the early phase reaction; however, it was previously noted that concentrations of this chemokine significantly increase 20 h after intrabronchial administration of the allergen in bronchoalveolar fluid collected at the challenged site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">11</xref>].</p><p>MIG/CXCL9 concentrations were similar in allergic patients and healthy controls at baseline and after administration of control solution but a rapid increase in its levels in nasal lavages was observed 30 min after the challenge with grass pollen. It was previously shown in an animal model of asthma that allergen-induced MIG/CXCL9 acts as a specific and natural inhibitor of eosinophils&#x02019; recruitment and CCR3-mediated functional response of these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">12</xref>]. Therefore the increase in MIG/CXCL9 concentrations after administration of allergen may be explained as part of the negative feedback leading to suppression of the inflammatory response to the allergen.</p><p>It is difficult to determine the influence of the allergen on levels of I-TAC/CXCL11 as it seems that administration of the control solution itself leads to increase in the chemokine concentrations, even in healthy subjects. We speculate that it may be caused by phenol used as the preservative for the allergen solution. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that we observed a much more pronounced increase in I-TAC/CXCL11 levels in nasal lavages after allergen administration in allergic subjects, which may indicate that I-TAC/CXCL11 concentrations also rise in response to exposure to allergens.</p><p>In conclusion, in this pilot study we showed that Th1 chemokines MIG/CXCL9, IP-10/CXCL10 and probably I-TAC/CXCL11 take part in development of allergic inflammation of the nose and subclinical inflammation persists outside the pollen season in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. More studies are necessary to analyze the kinetics of changes in expression of these chemokines in nasal mucosa in regard to inflammatory cell infiltration and other markers of inflammation.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Meller</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Lauerma</surname><given-names>AI</given-names></name><name><surname>Kopp</surname><given-names>FM</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Chemokine responses distinguish chemical-induced allergic from irritant skin inflammation: memory T cells make the difference</article-title><source>J Allergy Clin Immunol</source><year>2007</year><volume>119</volume><fpage>1470</fpage><lpage>80</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17337293</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0002"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Flier</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Boorsma</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></name><name><surname>Bruynzeel</surname><given-names>DP</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>The CXCR3 activating chemokines IP-10, Mig, and IP-9 are expressed in allergic but not in irritant patch test reactions</article-title><source>J Invest Dermatol</source><year>1999</year><volume>113</volume><fpage>574</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10504443</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0003"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Flier</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Boorsma</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></name><name><surname>van Beek</surname><given-names>PJ</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Differential expression of CXCR3 targeting chemokines CXCL10, CXCL9, and CXCL11 in different types of skin inflammation</article-title><source>J Pathol</source><year>2001</year><volume>194</volume><fpage>398</fpage><lpage>405</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11523046</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0004"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dajotoy</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Andersson</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Bjartell</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>L&#x000f6;fdahl</surname><given-names>CG</given-names></name><name><surname>Tapper</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Egesten</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Human eosinophils produce the T cell-attracting chemokines MIG and IP-10 upon stimulation with IFN-gamma</article-title><source>J Leukoc Biol</source><year>2004</year><volume>76</volume><fpage>685</fpage><lpage>91</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15197236</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0005"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Greiff</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Meyer</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Svensson</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Persson</surname><given-names>CG</given-names></name><name><surname>Andersson</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The &#x0201c;nasal pool&#x0201d;-device for challenge and lavage of the nasal mucosa in children: histamine-induced plasma exudation responses</article-title><source>Pediatr Allergy Immunol</source><year>1997</year><volume>8</volume><fpage>137</fpage><lpage>42</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9532254</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0006"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Miotto</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Christodoulopoulos</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Olivenstein</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Expression of IFN-gamma-inducible protein;
