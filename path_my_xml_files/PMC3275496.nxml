The objective of its treatment is to decrease pain while attempting to maintain or increase the range of knee motion and to minimize disabilities in daily living. The majority of osteoarthritic patients visit the clinic with the complaint of pain. As clinical symptoms, joint effusion is frequently associated with pain and limitation in the range of knee motion.</p><p>As conservative therapies for OA of the knee, education and physical therapy, oral administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid, and use of lateral wedge insole or unloading braces are applied based on the degrees of symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Further, diacerein, which is one kind of herbal medicine, has been used clinically as a symptom modifying drug for reducing joint pain in Europe and the United States of America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It has been reported that diacerein has the chondromodulating effect on the hip joint in observating radiographs among OA patients of the hip joint in a total of 507 cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Further, diacerein was reported to be effective on OA of the knee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In Asia, the alkaloid, sinomenine is extracted from the Chinese medical plant <italic>Sinomeniuim acutum</italic>, which has been utilized by Chinese doctors for over 2000 years to treat various rheumatic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Previous pharmacological studies have demonstrated that <italic>sinomenine </italic>inhibits inflammatory reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Boiogito (Japanese herbal medicine, Tsumura Co., Tokyo, Japan) contains a dry extract 3.75 g of the mixed drug substance consisting of <italic>Sinomenium Stem </italic>5.0 g, Astragalus Root 5.0 g, Atractylodes Lancea Rhizome 3.0 g, Jujube 3.0 g, Glycyrrhiza 1.5 g, and Ginger 1.0 g in a daily dose of 7.5 g. That is constituted of numerous components including sinomenine as a principal component (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Since <italic>sinomenine </italic>is a principle component, there is a possibility of it being effective on OA of the knee with joint effusion. The objective of the present study is to investigate the therapeutic effect of Boiogito on OA of the knee associated with joint effusion in a comparative study among randomly assigned groups.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Three Dimensional pattern of High Performance Liquid Chromatography in Boiogito</bold>. HPLC apparatus consisted of a Shimadzu LC 10A (analysis system software: CLASS-M10A ver. 1.64, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a multiple wavelength detector (UV 200-400 nm)(Shimadzu SPD-M10AVP, diode array detector), an auto injector (Shimadzu CTO-10AC). HPLC conditions were described as follows: column, ODS (TSK-GEL 80TS, 250 &#x000d7; 4.6 mm i.d., TOSOH, Tokyo, Japan); eluent, (A) 0.05 M AcONH4 (pH 3.6) (B) 100% CH3CN. A linear gradient of 90% A and 10% B changing over 60 min to 0% A and 100% B was used. And 100% B was continued for 20 min.; temperature, 40 degrees celusius; flow rate, 1.0 mL/min. A granule was extracted with methanol (20 mL) under ultrasonication for 30 min., and was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was filtrated with a membrane filter (0.45 &#x003bc;m) and then submitted for HPLC analysis (30 &#x003bc;L).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1758-2555-4-3-1"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The subjects used were patients with primary OA of the knee associated with clinically detected joint effusion. Those were outpatients having pain in the knee joints while walking and showing a Kellgren-Lawrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] grade III or less in the radiographs. The patients having serious complications (liver diseases, kidney diseases, hematological diseases, etc.), those incapable of taking oral administration, those currently taking other herbal medications and those having a hyaluronic acid injection to the joint were excluded from the study. After approval of the Institutional Review Board at the Hokkaido University Hospital, a random, blinded inter-group comparison study was conducted.</p><p>The subjects were randomly divided into two groups: one group treated by concomitant use of Boiogito and loxoprofen (thereinafter referred to as the concomitant use group) and loxoprofen administration group (hereinafter referred to as the loxoprofen group). Prior to the study, the subjects signed a written consent of their own free will. The treatment drug, Boiogito, was administered at a daily dose of 7.5 g divided into three portions which were given before meals or between meals. Further, loxoprofen at a single dose of 60 mg was orally administered after meals three times daily. The number of subjects enrolled in the present study was 50 subjects divided into 25 subjects in the concomitant use group and 25 subjects in the loxoprofen group with respect to the treatment drugs. Among them, three cases including two cases (loxoprofen group) who did not come back after the initial examination and one case (concomitant use group) who did not come back after 4<sup>th </sup>week were excluded from the study. As a result, the remaining 47 subjects (24 cases in the concomitant use group and 23 cases in the loxoprofen group) were used in the analysis of the treatment results.</p><p>The period of administration of the treatment drug was 12 weeks. The assessment parameters including knee scores in the Knee Society Rating System including Knee score and Functional scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], amount of joint effusion by joint puncture in clinically detected cases, the 36-items short form of the Medical Outcome Study Questionnaire (SF-36) as a measurement of health related quality of life were used.

The number of osteoarthritic patients is simply increasing in society due to the increasing number of the elderly population. The clinical symptoms of OA of the knee include pain as well as limitation in the range of knee motion and joint effusion. As the OA of the knee advances, the symptoms cause a significant effect on activities of daily living.</p><p>When the degeneration of knee joints is not severe, conservatinve treatment including drug therapies and physical therapies are selected. For pain management, NSAIDs are widely used. It has been reported that NSAIDs have a major role in the management of OA in a systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. On the other hand, problems such as an inhibitory action of long-term application of NSAIDs on proteoglycan synthesis of cartilage was pointed out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In some cases, joint effusion exists in spite of various treatments. The joint effusion in the knee contains many aggrecan fragments and MMP-1. It has been reported that joint effusion has adverse effects on the articular cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. According to the results of the present study, joint effusion in OA of the knee significantly decreased by using Boiogito along with NSAIDs. In addition, staircase climbing up and down ability in the knee society score and Physical functioning of SF-36 were found to be improved significantly. These phenomena were assumed to be related to the fact that systematic conditions were improved as a result of improvement in joint effusion by Boiogito. Based on these results, Boiogito was suggested as effective in the conservative treatment for OA of the knee. Boiogito and loxoprofen treatment improve pain and joint effusion, however, their SF-36 scores about another physical area (role physical, bodily pain and general health) were not improve significantly. On the other hand, specific evaluation for knee function according to Knee Society Rating System showed significant difference. These results may be attributed that SF-36 is comprehensive scale and not disease specific scale.</p><p>Since herbal medicines consist of numerous components instead of a single component, the mechanisms of decreasing the amount of joint effusion are still unknown. However, with respect to the pharmacological action of Boiogito, effectiveness of <italic>sinomenine </italic>for inflammation which is a component included in the drug substance was reported in the adjuvant arthritis model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. It was assumed that <italic>sinomenine </italic>inhibits inflammation of secondary synovitis in OA of the knee. It have been reported that other herbal medicine containing <italic>astragalus </italic>have anti-inflammatory activity through decreasing inflammation related cytokine, Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) alpha and Interferon gamma in a rat autoimmune myocarditis model, mice dermatitis model and diabetic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. These reports were not studied on osteoarthritis, however, <italic>astragalus </italic>which is contained in Boiogito have also possibility for decreasing symptoms of osteoarthritis with joint effusion.</p><p>Concerning the limitation of the present study, we did not investigate the single administration of Boiogito and also there is a limitation that the number of cases is small. The studies using a larger number of subjects and the studies including analysis of pharmacological actions based on the analysis of the characteristic changes in the joint effusion should be needed. Further, it is necessary to have a long-term assessment including the degree of satisfaction by patients in the general evaluation not only from the local results in the knees.</p><p>In conclusion, this is the first report that the herbal remedy "Boiogito" have a possibility of conservative treatment for joint effusion associated with OA of the knee.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Each author certifies that he has no commercial associations (e.g. consultations, stock ownership, equity interest, patent/licensing arrangements, etc) that might pose a conflict of interest in connection with the submitted article.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>TM has made substantial contributions to conception and design, acquisition of data, analysis and interpretation of data.
