Although MDD and PPD share many clinical similarities, a meta-analysis of 11 randomized clinical trials showed differences between the diseases on neuroimaging, gonadal steroidal hormone involvement, and response to treatments <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p id="p0015">Postpartum Depression has a prevalence of 14% in the general population of pregnant women <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. It is responsible for maternal suicide and infanticide in the most severe cases <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Studies have shown that PPD impairs maternal-newborn bond producing a greater risk of child abuse and negligence; resulting in irreversible cognitive and social deficits later in child life <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Postpartum depression is the number one cause of maternal morbidity after childbirth <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p id="p0020">The first-line therapy for moderate to severe PPD is of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) such as sertraline <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Although it is considered relatively safe for breastfeeding, mothers still have a concern regarding newborn consumption of drug metabolites in the breast milk compromising treatment adherence <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Additionally, the efficacy of SSRI has come into question with low response rates and high relapse rates. High latency to response of these SSRI also plays an important role for this population and reconciling the mother-to-child bond. Hence there is a need to test new therapies for this specific population.</p><p id="p0025">Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique that has been FDA approved in the treatment of refractory MDD <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. rTMS functions by eliciting focal magnetic waves to the brain. It induces neuroplasticity by promoting synaptogenesis in targeted cortical areas <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Low frequency rTMS stimulates inhibitory GABA neurons while high frequency stimulates the excitatory neurons. This treatment modality combined with standard therapy has demonstrated a faster response in MDD compared to standard therapy alone <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. This results in a reduced exposure to SSRI adverse effects.</p><p id="p0030">Only two pilot studies thus far have evaluated the effects of rTMS in PPD patients. Both trials showed safety and positive results of combined therapy of rTMS and SSRI <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. This warrants further investigation of this treatment modality as a viable option in women with PPD to modulate the effect of standard therapy by increasing its efficacy. It has potential to reduce time to response and adverse effect profile of treatment.</p><p id="p0035">In this trial, we aim to investigate the safety and efficacy of high frequency rTMS (10&#x000a0;Hz) compared to sham rTMS in women with moderate to severe PPD using standard therapy (sertraline). This would pave the way towards finding a safe and efficacious evidence-based therapy for postpartum depression and with a better safety profile than standard therapy alone. By adding a third arm, we also aim to conduct an ancillary, exploratory, double dummy study <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> to assess the safety and efficacy of rTMS compared to Sertraline. To our knowledge, this direct comparison has never been evaluated in patients with postpartum depression and would provide a basis for future trials.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Trial design</title><p id="p0040">A multicenter, parallel arm, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study design to assess safety and efficacy of 10&#x000a0;Hz rTMS compared to sham rTMS in postpartum depressed patients using standard treatment (sertraline).

We considered several study designs such as a non-inferiority design to our two arm and double blind trial compared to sertraline, a superiority trial and our current design with an exploratory question.</p><p id="p0185">In order to prove non-inferiority of rTMS compared to sertraline, two primary considerations were taken into account: assay sensitivity and inferiority margin calculation. Assay sensitivity poses a challenge due to the moderate effect size of SSRI over placebo. A meta-analysis of RCTs showed a 1.01 odds ratio at the lower margin of the confidence interval. This means that in the most conservative estimation, there is no significant difference between SSRI and placebo <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. This makes the choice of an appropriate inferiority margin unfeasible to detect the expected effect size. Therefore, although it would be an interesting study design, there is not enough data supporting the notion that rTMS non inferiority over SSRI represents a true effect over placebo rather than equivalent ineffectiveness over placebo.</p><p id="p0190">Our second option was a two-arm double-dummy superiority design to test rTMS over sertraline. While this design has the advantage of a direct comparison of the two treatments as mono-therapies, no direct comparison between both interventions has been done previously in this population. Hence, there is not enough evidence to support this design, and it is not prudent to conduct a larger late phase II trial without a precedent pilot trial.</p><p id="p0195">Therefore, we designed a study that would provide evidence regarding the efficacy of rTMS compared to sham rTMS in postpartum depressed women under standard treatment (sertraline). This design allows the evaluation of the combination therapy (rTMS and SSRI) over standard mono-therapy in the PPD population through the primary question - a phenomenon with numerous supporting literature <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Meanwhile, it admits an ancillary question involving an exploratory evaluation of rTMS over sertraline mono-therapy. Regardless of positive or negative results, this will pave the way for future head-to-head comparison trials.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><label>3.2</label><title>Recruitment strategy</title><p id="p0200">We target to keep the inclusion criteria as general as possible in order to encompass all women over 18 years old who have moderate to severe PPD. As a late phase II trial, this provides the generalizability required for a pivotal device trial. We also followed the guidance of the previous two pilot PPD trials <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p id="p0205">We expect low drop-out rates based on acceptability of the treatment <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and previous pilot studies that demonstrated high adherence rates for this population receiving rTMS combined with SSRI <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Despite this, we will use several retention strategies such as, providing regular communication with patients, compensating for transportation, involving family members as much as possible, and offering childcare services while the patient undergoes treatment. Furthermore, to increase compliance, investigators will administer monitored doses of SSRI during study visits for rTMS treatment. Data about safety of SSRI use, during breastfeeding, will be shared with the patient. On days with no rTMS treatment, patients will be given doses to take home with an electronic diary to continuously monitor compliance.</p><p id="p0210">Due to the time commitment required by patients in this trial, and the time sensitivity to enroll the patient post-delivery, the perceived challenge for this trial is not adherence but recruitment. To address recruitment obstacles, we have a multicenter design to reduce the recruitment burden at any particular site. In addition, we will begin with a broad recruitment strategy early in the pregnancy by public awareness campaigns that will aim to inform expecting mothers of the prevalence of PPD, and the risks involved.</p><p id="p0215">This strategy attempts to engage all expecting mothers who feel they may be prone to mood disorders. We will also rely on referrals by psychiatrists and obstetricians in order to have a wide selection of potential participants in the targeted 4 week post-delivery window period. Additionally, we will reach out to pediatricians to give information about our trials to mothers of newborns receiving their early childhood immunizations. All patients will be screened for eligibility by our study team.</p><p id="p0220">Our randomization strategy supports our recruitment targets. We determined it would be favorable to randomize in a 2:2:1 ratio as to have a favorable chance of enrolment into our primary arms of the trial, only requiring a total of 72 completers (36 per arm) to reach sufficient power to detect the appropriate effect size.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><label>3.3</label><title>Ethical considerations</title><p id="p0225">In dealing with a vulnerable population such as pregnant women with a moderate to severe psychiatric condition, sound ethical rationale must be incorporated into our study design.</p><p id="p0230">Firstly, safety of rTMS procedure has been repeatedly demonstrated in the general population and specifically in PPD patients in pilot studies <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Secondly, since the effects of rTMS on pregnant women have not been established to date, we will only initiate treatment post-delivery. Thirdly, our randomization ratio allows for 80% of patients to receive standard therapy with active or sham rTMS treatment. Only 20% of our patients will receive rTMS alone. Although rTMS monotherapy has a proven efficacy in MDD <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, we will employ a Data Safety Monitoring Committee to oversee all the trial data in a blinded fashion on an ongoing basis. Patients with worsening symptoms, or serious adverse events, will be evaluated by the DSMC and guidance will be given in regards to SSRI dose adjustment, unblinding, reverting to standard therapy or discontinuation.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.4"><label>3.4</label><title>Limitations</title><p id="p0235">In designing this trial, we perceive limitations that need to be addressed. Blinding in medical device trials is a well-known challenge. In addition, our ancillary study may simply serve as a pilot arm and results should be interpreted as such.</p><p id="p0240">The MagVenture TMS device provides the added feature of an unmarked single, two-sided coil for both sham and active treatments allowing for a blinded operator. However; there are inevitable telltale signs of active and sham treatments by an experienced stimulator. For instance, muscle twitches intensity during calibration by motor threshold and the stimulation itself. For this reason, we will add an additional layer of protection against unblinding by ensuring our blinded stimulator is unrelated to any other trial activities, data analysis, and have limited contact with researchers. By the same mechanism, patients with previous experience with active rTMS may be unblinded by the differences between sham and active treatments sensation. Therefore, these patients will be excluded from the trial.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.5"><label>3.5</label><title>Strengths</title><p id="p0245">We find that this trial design allows for an ethical alternative to evaluate a particularly vulnerable population that is difficult to study. This trial has the benefit of evaluating rTMS as a combination therapy as well as an exploratory monotherapy as a basis for future trials. The ancillary exploration fills a gap in the literature that has not been previously explored in this population. Furthermore, our robust design, tests two parallel hypotheses using easily interpretable statistical tests. Because of the strong evidence of TMS in depressive disorders and FDA approval for this indication, we have strongly validated outcomes to evaluate its efficacy and a well-established rationale for our hypothesis, making it likely to show positive results.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0250">We designed a study protocol scientifically feasible, ethical for the investigation of an innovative treatment for PPD.
