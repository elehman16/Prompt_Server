To achieve the US National HIV/AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) Strategy goals of reducing new diagnoses by 25%, high (eg, 30-50%) coverage of multiple HIV prevention interventions is needed in both urban and rural areas. Mobile phone &#x0201c;apps&#x0201d; are an important channel through which prevention services could be provided at scale and at low marginal cost.</p></sec><sec sec-type="objective"><title>Objective</title><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the usability and acceptability of a theory-based Android mobile phone app for HIV prevention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The app included self-assessment tools; prevention recommendations; commodity (condoms, HIV self-tests) ordering; reminders to MSM for basic HIV prevention services, HIV testing, condom use, screening for preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and nonoccupational postexposure prophylaxis (nPEP); and prevention and treatment provider locators. The study recruited HIV-negative, Android-using MSM in Atlanta and Seattle who were asked to use the app for 4 months and complete a post-use survey. We measured the use of the app and its features, ordering of commodities, self-report of establishing an HIV testing plan, being HIV tested in the community, and starting PrEP or using nPEP. Usability was assessed using the system usability scale (SUS).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 121 MSM were enrolled (59.5%, 72/121 from Atlanta; 40.5%, 49/121 from Seattle). Median age was 28. Nearly half (48.8%, 59/121) were nonwhite, and most (85.9%, 104/121) were gay-identified. Most had tested for HIV in the past (85.1%, 103/121), and 52 (43.0%, 52/121) had a plan to test for HIV regularly. Men used the app for an average of 17.7 minutes over the first 4 months. Over the 4-month period, over half ordered condoms (63.6%, 77/121) and HIV test kits (52.8%, 64/121) on the app. Eight of 86 (9%) PrEP-eligible MSM started PrEP during the 4-month period; of those, 6 of the 8 reported that the app influenced their decision to start PrEP. The mean SUS was 73 (above average).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A theory-based mobile phone app was acceptable to MSM and was rated as having above-average usability. Most men used the commodity-ordering features of the app during the 4-month evaluation period, and nearly 1 in 10 PrEP-eligible men started PrEP, with most attributing their decision to start PrEP in part to the app. A broader, randomized controlled study of the impact of the app on uptake of prevention behaviors for MSM is warranted.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>homosexuality, male</kwd><kwd>mobile applications</kwd><kwd>pilot projects</kwd><kwd>sexual minorities</kwd><kwd>condoms</kwd><kwd>pre-exposure prophylaxis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention has become an HIV sero-status-dependent practice, in which an HIV test is the first step toward either a prevention continuum for HIV-negative individuals, or a treatment and care continuum for those testing HIV-positive. In other words, HIV prevention must rest on a foundation of accurate knowledge of HIV sero-status among key populations, followed by sero-status-specific prevention approaches. For those who are HIV-negative, biomedical interventions such as preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) hold promise to reduce susceptibility to HIV [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Men who have sex with men (MSM) are a key risk group in the United States and are disproportionately impacted in terms of HIV prevalence [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and incidence [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. MSM are the only US risk group for whom HIV incidence increased after 2000 [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; increases are especially alarming among young (15-24 years old) MSM [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and MSM of color [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This has resulted in profound health disparities for both MSM relative to other adult men and within the MSM community, with a burden of HIV infection that is a staggering 67 times greater than for other men in the US population [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Disparities are especially pronounced among MSM of color [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Multiple models of HIV incidence in MSM suggest that to decrease HIV incidence in MSM, we will need to achieve 30-50% coverage of multiple prevention services and interventions (eg, condom promotion, HIV testing, PrEP, treatment as prevention) in at-risk MSM [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, the uptake of routine HIV testing and PrEP is low: less than half of MSM test for HIV yearly [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and in 2013, &#x0003c;5% were utilizing PrEP [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A recent summary of electronic tools for HIV prevention in MSM noted that promotion of certain types of prevention services are most amenable to provision through new technologies. Services for which eligibility can be determined through an algorithm are good candidates to bring to scale with technologies [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. For example, behavioral eligibility for PrEP has well-described criteria and eligibility algorithms [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Using technology to promote uptake of prevention services for MSM would also make services more accessible to rural MSM [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This is especially important because MSM in rural areas may have lower access to HIV prevention services delivered in community-based organizations [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Here, we present briefly the development of a comprehensive mobile HIV prevention app for MSM, and describe and report the initial evaluation of the app for usability and acceptability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Previous Work and App Development</title><p>Needs assessment for an HIV prevention app for MSM was conducted prior to app development using a 3-phase, iterative process [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Phase 1 consisted of separate focus group discussions with MSM, HIV testing counselors, and key community informants to identify preferences and requirements to consider including in a mobile HIV prevention app. Preliminary data from phase 1 was used to build an alpha version of the app. The alpha version was then theater tested with additional focus group discussions. Data from all phases were then used to develop features, language, and security to build into the beta version of the app. All of the app development was completed by Keymind (McLean, VA), a technology firm that specializes in creating data systems and mobile apps, including apps for health care providers and systems. The authors (PS, RS, JS, and TG) were directly involved in creating the requirements for the app; Keymind staff produced the app.</p></sec><sec><title>Theoretical Basis</title><p>The app content was developed based on the social cognitive theory of behavior [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Briefly, the app features enumerated in the following section were developed to fit into a framework of several health outcome behaviors (eg, making a plan to test regularly for HIV, using condoms, self-screening for PrEP, seeking HIV care for those living with HIV). For each health or prevention behavior, there were specific app features that were designed to promote goal setting, self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and self-regulation. For example, for the behaviors of HIV testing, the &#x0201c;Make a plan&#x0201d; app feature promoted goal setting, the presentation of several testing options and information promoted self-efficacy, information about the benefits of testing promoted positive outcome expectations, and a customizable reminder system for testing promoted self-regulation.</p></sec><sec><title>App Features</title><p>A list of app features and descriptions are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; screenshots of the app are available in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Multimedia Appendix 1</xref>. Highlighted features included monthly risk assessment quizzes that offered tailored HIV-prevention related recommendations, quizzes to self-assess PrEP and nonoccupational postexposure prophylaxis (nPEP) eligibility, resources to create and schedule a custom HIV testing plan with reminders, a global positioning system (GPS) enabled map of HIV testing locations with their operational details, and ordering of free condoms and at-home HIV test kits.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Features of the HealthMindr app during the pilot study, United States, 2015.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" width="636" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" border="1"><col width="117" span="1"/><col width="489" span="1"/><thead><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Domain</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Features</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Initial and Monthly Risk Assessments</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Provides tailored, HIV-related prevention suggestions for users to consider based on quiz responses.

The 2 cities were chosen because the availability of high-quality, gay-friendly prevention services differs in the 2 cities; we hypothesized that men who live in a city like Seattle where services are readily available and culturally competent might have less interest in accessing services through a mobile app. MSM were recruited on the Web and asked to install HealthMindr on their mobile phone, keep it on their phones for 4 months, and complete an evaluation survey at the end of the study period. Demographic and HIV prevention behaviors were collected during study enrollment. Brief periodic assessments were delivered monthly; the assessment of 10 risk questions allowed for prevention recommendations to be updated based on recent behaviors. App-based usage data was collected for all in-app actions participants made, including in-app button clicks, page views, and assessment or quiz responses. At the end of the participant&#x02019;s study period, a Web-based evaluation survey was sent to participants to assess their HIV-related prevention behaviors during the pilot and app features that they did and did not find useful. Selected participants who were recommended to receive PrEP, including all who started PrEP, were invited to participate in individual in-depth interviews about their decision to start PrEP or not, and how the app influenced their decision-making process.</p><p>This study was approved by the institutional review boards of Emory University and the University of Washington. Participants were compensated US $25 each for completion of the baseline and 4-month follow-up surveys and US $5 each for the 3 periodic assessments administered through the app. Men who participated in individual in-depth interviewed were compensated US $40.</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment and Enrollment</title><p>Participants were recruited from May 2015 and August 2015 using advertisements on Facebook and a social or sexual networking mobile phone app for MSM. Advertisements targeted adult male Facebook users residing in Atlanta or Seattle who indicated being a man interested in men. Advertisements on the MSM networking app used geolocation to deliver advertisements to men who opened the app on an Android device while in the Atlanta or Seattle metro area.</p><p>Interested participants who clicked on an advertisement were taken to a Web-based screening and enrollment survey and presented with a brief description of the study. Men completed an electronic informed consent to be screened for study eligibility and then completed a brief screening survey; to be eligible for the study, participants must have been &#x02265; 18 years of age, English-speaking, living in the Atlanta or Seattle metropolitan areas, assigned male sex at birth, and identifying as male at the time of the screening; must have had sex with a man in the past year; must have never tested positive for HIV; and must have owned an Android mobile phone device with current service. Eligible men were asked to complete an electronic informed consent for study participation. Disqualified respondents were not given a reason for ineligibility and were provided the principal investigator&#x02019;s contact information.</p><p>Consenting participants were next shown a 7-minute introductory video embedded within the enrollment survey (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app2">Multimedia Appendix 2</xref>). The video introduced study staff members, explained study procedures including compensation schedule, provided detailed instructions with app screenshots on how to download and register the app, and demonstrated different app features. Mobile phone ownership was verified by sending participants an SMS text message (short message service, SMS) with a confirmation number that the participant was required to enter into the enrollment survey before continuing. The last section of the enrollment survey asked for demographic information and HIV testing history during the previous 24 months, use of free condoms in the last year, and whether the participant had ever used PrEP, nPEP, or at-home HIV test kits.</p><p>Access to the app was limited to participants through the use of a unique registration code provided only to participants; password and personal identification number (PIN) protection were provided. After successfully registering the app, participants were asked to complete an initial in-app screening assessment, which completed their enrollment into the study. Enrollment completions that were suspected to be fraudulent based on duplicate or similar phone numbers, Internet protocol (IP) addresses, or email addresses were screened and verified by calling and speaking with the participant before accepting him into the study. In all cases, study staff called all study participants within a week of study enrollment to introduce themselves and answer any questions or concerns.</p></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><sec><title>Enrollment and Baseline Survey</title><p>Participants were asked demographic and baseline characteristics during study enrollment; including age in years; city of residence; race or ethnicity; sexual identity; recent HIV testing history; HIV status; plans for future HIV testing; and past use of PrEP, nPEP, condoms, and at-home HIV testing kits.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation Survey</title><p>After 4 months of use, participants were asked about motivation to use the app, HIV testing during the study period, PrEP and nPEP use during the study period, and at-home test kit and condom use for those who placed in-app orders. Participants were also asked to assess the app&#x02019;s features, usability, design, content, and functionality using both Likert scales and optional open text fields. The usability of the app was further assessed using the system usability scale (SUS), a validated, industry standard scale used to evaluate a variety of products and services, including websites, mobile phones, computer software, and more [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The scale uses a series of questions to generate a usability score ranging from 0-100. An SUS score below 50 is not considered acceptable while above 70 is above average and &#x0003e;90 is superior [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Analysis</title><p>The usage log was used to calculate the number of days participants used the app, pages of the app accessed, and the total time spent in the app. Time spent engaged within the app was quantified by calculating time passed between each action a user took and totaling the time for the visit. The longest 1% of time between actions (ie, longer than 2 minutes 38 seconds) was considered to not be representative of active app engagement. Time engaged within the app per person and per person-month was calculated. Descriptive statistics were used to examine app engagement and are reported as mean with range for time and action measurements. Participants&#x02019; ordering histories were kept for all at-home test kits, condoms, and personal lubricant orders placed. App pages accessed and features used by participants are reported as participant counts with percent. Evaluation responses are reported as percent of users who completed the evaluation survey. SUS results are reported as an aggregate score, using the method by which the scale was validated [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>All analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Study Population</title><p>Of the 919 Web-based survey responses, 244 (26.5%, 244/919) left the survey after reading the study description, 108 (11.7%, 108/919) did not complete the screening survey, and 257 (28.0%, 257/919) did not meet eligibility requirements. Reasons for ineligibility included not owning an Android phone (42.8%, 110/257), being HIV positive (27.6%, 71/257), and living outside of the study area (18.3%, 47/257). Of the 309 eligible survey responses, 127 (41.1%, 127/309) did not complete the postscreening enrollment survey, 21 (6.7%, 21/309) completed the survey but did not download the app, and 40 (12.9%, 40/309) were determined to be fraudulent attempts to enroll multiple times and were disqualified. Final study enrollment was 121 MSM, including 72 in Atlanta and 49 in Seattle. App usage data were available for 90.0% (109/121) of participants. Ninety-eight (81.0%, 98/121) participants completed the 4-month evaluation survey. Participation in the evaluation survey did not differ by age (median test: <italic>P</italic>=.34); race (chi-square test: <italic>P</italic>=.90); or knowing of a local place to be tested for HIV

Achieving our national strategy goal of reducing new HIV infections by 25% by 2020 will require making substantial improvements in HIV prevention for MSM. Based on current use of HIV prevention services [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], achieving the 30%-50% coverage of basic prevention services that will likely be needed to achieve such reductions would require either broad expansions of funding for existing service provision mechanisms or development of new modes of delivery that can scale with low incremental costs [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. And the very communities of MSM most impacted by ongoing transmissions&#x02014;young MSM and MSM of color&#x02014;are the same men most likely to have mobile phones [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In short, there is an intersection of public health need, good fit of technology to programmatic needs, and high coverage of required device ownership among those at greatest need of services. Men in rural areas of the United States are in equal need of HIV prevention services, but are less likely to report receiving HIV testing and condom distribution, and are less likely to be aware of PrEP or have accessed PrEP [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Our data indicate that men will use a mobile phone app for comprehensive HIV prevention services, including engagement in HIV testing, condom use, and PrEP assessment, and that such an app is acceptable to MSM at risk for HIV acquisition.</p><p>Various metrics have been proposed to characterize engagement with mobile phone apps [ [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], although there are very limited data specific to health-related apps. With respect to engagement in the app, our data indicate that there was substantial variation in the extent of engagement with the app. Overall usage time was about 1.5 minutes per week over the period, which suggests that usage of our app was above average (above the median level of engagement observed in a recent analysis of usage of 22,000 mobile phone apps by over 600,000 mobile phone users) [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Our user database from the trial participants, 121 users, places our app above the 80<sup>th</sup> percentile in terms of numbers of users of available apps [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Thus, even in this limited implementation, our app shows engagement characteristics that are more favorable than most available apps.</p><p>Another way to measure engagement is the ordering and use of commodities by app users. Most users ordered condoms, HIV test kits, or both. It is also significant that most users who ordered condoms or HIV test kits reported using them. In a survey of MSM who received free condoms in bar or club settings, less than three quarters reported using the condoms they received [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]; in our study, nearly 90% of those who ordered condoms used them. It is important to recognize that many health jurisdictions already provide distribution of free condoms, sexual lubricants, and HIV test kits. In most places, this is accomplished through paying staff to distribute commodities in high risk venues. Distributing these prevention commodities by mail to those who want them and order them might offer a more targeted and cost-efficient way to fulfill public health functions of condom distribution and HIV testing promotion.</p><p>PrEP is an emerging biomedical approach to reducing HIV acquisition risk in high-risk MSM, but uptake of PrEP among MSM has been slow. Levels of awareness of PrEP are also low, especially among younger MSM and MSM in rural areas [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. When less than 5% of US MSM have ever used PrEP, it is striking that nearly 10% of PrEP-eligible men initiated PrEP within a 4-month period of app use. According to our theoretical model of the PrEP continuum [<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and our qualitative data, the app likely promoted PrEP uptake by increasing awareness of PrEP (PrEP information features), facilitating access to PrEP providers, and helping men identify their personal risk of HIV infection and indications for PrEP. We recognize that some additional information such as information on costs and clinical procedures are currently lacking from the app, and based on the feedback we received from the participants, we will develop and add new materials to the PrEP component of the app.</p><p>According to a broadly accepted standard assessment of usability, our app was assessed as being above average using traditional criteria [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; using a validated translation to qualitative terms, our app would be assessed as being between good and excellent [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Our data also suggest the possibility of social diffusion of the app, when it is made more broadly available: over 7 in 10 participants reported being willing to recommend the app to a friend. MSM have reported that recommendation from a trusted source was a major factor influencing their willingness to use an app [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. By these standards, we conclude that our app is acceptable to the MSM whom we would have use the app.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Our study had several limitations. First, our participants were subject to selection bias across several dimensions. We recruited men who were using Facebook or a Web-based dating app, and who may have been more comfortable using mobile apps than other men. We restricted our study to MSM in Seattle and Atlanta because of the need to provide enhanced resource directories; men in other cities might view and use the app differently. We limited this evaluation to men whose phones used the Android operating system; users of Apple or Windows operating system (OS) phones might have different use experiences or opinions of the app. However, we note that Android phone ownership is higher among Americans of color and among younger Americans, who are the groups with the highest rates of new HIV infections [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Our usage might have been overestimated because participants were enrolled in a research study with compensation for study assessments. Our pilot occurred only among MSM in urban areas, so generalizability to other MSM (including those in rural areas) was limited. Although nearly half of our sample was nonwhite, we had limited enrollment of Hispanic MSM. Enrolling racial or ethnic minorities in Web-based prevention research has been historically challenging, and future studies should over-recruit MSM of color, including Hispanic MSM [<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>There is a broad interest in the use of mobile apps for HIV prevention and a scientific evidence base to support the idea that mobile apps can influence health behaviors. We have developed a theory-based mobile phone app to provide a basic package of HIV prevention services to MSM, and found it to be acceptable to users in Seattle and Atlanta. Furthermore, our data on usage of specific components and order of commodities provide examples of how engaging with the app could improve health outcomes and provide baseline estimates of uptake, which can be used to power future randomized studies of the app. We recommend that, because of the high costs of app development, prevention scientists use a staged approach of qualitative formative work, theater testing, and usability or acceptability testing to ensure that mobile apps that are moved into larger, more expensive efficacy trials meet basic standards of acceptability and usability. The HealthMindr app has been demonstrated as being acceptable to MSM, as being usable, and as being associated with use of prevention services. HealthMindr should be considered for further evaluation in a randomized controlled trial with outcomes of the uptake of prevention behaviors.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was generously supported by the MAC AIDS Fund and the Center for AIDS Research at Emory University (P30AI050409).
