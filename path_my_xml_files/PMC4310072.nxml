IR may affect thyroid function, size and nodules. We investigated the effects of metformin on the thyroid gland in prediabetic people.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>In a randomized, double-blind placebo-control clinical trial, 89 people with prediabetes, aged 18-65 years were studied for 3 months. They were divided into two, metformin (<italic>n</italic> = 43) and placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 46) treated groups. Serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was measured and thyroid nodules and volume was studied by ultrasonography. The data were compared between and within groups, before and after the study.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Mean of the baseline characteristics in metformin and placebo-treated groups had no statistically significant difference. At the end of the study, serum TSH was not significantly different between the two groups. However, if the TSH range was divided into two low normal (0.3-2.5 &#x003bc;U/ml) and high-normal (2.6-5.5 &#x003bc;U/ml) ranges, significant decrease was observed in metformin-treated group with a high-normal basal serum TSH (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01). Thyroid volume did not change in metformin-treated group. However, in placebo-treated group, the thyroid was enlarged (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03). In 53.9% of participants, thyroid nodule was observed.

Persons with prediabetes have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, heart and cerebrovascular diseases. IR is characterized by an inadequate physiological response of peripheral tissues to circulating insulin and results in metabolic and hemodynamic disturbances.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] While prediabetic people could not manage to maintain, the appropriate degree of hyperinsulinemia, they may develop type 2 diabetes.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>It is supposed that functional changes in the thyroid gland might have cooperation with metabolic syndrome and its related components including, obesity, IR, lipid and glucose metabolism abnormalities, and high blood pressure.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In patients with IR, the prevalence of goiter and thyroid nodule is likely more common.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is an important hypertrophic and cell cycle progression factor for a number of cell types. It was previously pointed out that thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in association with insulin or IGF-1 stimulates cell cycle progression and proliferation in various thyroid cell culture systems. The IGF system includes a network of ligands (IGF-1 and IGF-2), which are very similar to insulin; IGF-1 receptor, has structural similarity with the insulin receptor. Insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway has long been known to modulate regulation of thyroid gene expression and might be considered as additional important factors in thyroid cell proliferation and differentiation. Very recently, an elegant cell culture work by Malaguarnera <italic>et al</italic>. showed that insulin receptor isoforms, IGF-1 receptor, IGF-1 and IGF-2, were expressed at high concentrations in thyroid follicular cell precursors and highly decreased in differentiating cells. Insulin and IGFs promoted the growth of thyroid cancer precursors.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Patients with IR are candidates to receive metformin that decreases IR.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>As the prevalence of diabetes mellitus and thyroid disease is relatively high in Isfahan[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and as far as we know, the effect of metformin on thyroid function of patients with prediabetes has not been studied yet, we decided to investigate, prospectively, the effect of metformin on the thyroid gland (volume and function) in prediabetic patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Our study was a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial.

A total of 124 participants during April 2013 to March 2014 were, randomly, enrolled (62 people in each group); however, only 89 people completed the 3-month follow-up period. The randomization method was computer-based generated.

They are using iodized salt since 1989 and are iodine sufficient according to median urinary iodine concentration in different surveys since that time.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] It is supposed that the effect of iodine insufficiency on thyroid volume must have been eliminated during such long period. Although, goiter prevalence is still high in this city and investigating the other causes of thyroid enlargement rather than iodine deficiency should be sought.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] One of these factors might be IR, that has to be studied here. Obesity and obesity-associated IR are increasing in Iran including Isfahan in recent years.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>In some case-control studies which have been conducted in Isfahan city, the role of thyroid autoimmunity as the cause of goiter has been shown.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The concentrations of TPO-Ab and TgAb in prediabetic participants were shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>There was no difference between two groups from view point of autoimmunity. Metformin did not affect on thyroid autoimmunity at least in this short period (3 months). It seems the effect of metformin on TSH &#x0003e;2.5 &#x003bc;U/ml and thyroid volume must be independent of autoimmunity.</p><p>However, TSH has been recognized as the main growth factor for thyroid cells, although, this interpretation does not explain the role of TSH-dependent and independent mechanisms and positive, negative signaling interaction.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] TSH is not only involved in the control of differentiated functions, but also regulates the expression of growth factors and their receptors.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] This has been demonstrated, for example, for the expression of epidermal growth factor receptors,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and for IGF-I-dependent signaling.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Actually, TSH promotes the insulin, IGF-I signaling.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Moreover, exposure to TSH-or cyclic adenosine monophosphate -elevating agents increase the responsiveness of thyroid cells to stimulation with insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Accumulated evidence indicates that IGF-I-dependent, TSH-independent signaling may be of major importance for growth regulation of the human thyroid gland. This assumption is supported by the findings in conditions not accompanied by increased TSH secretion, such as in acromegaly, in which high intrathyroidal IGF-I levels may contribute to the enlargement of the thyroid.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Thus, TSH induces the expression of growth factors and their receptors and may contribute to an increased responsiveness to growth factor-stimulated tyrosine kinase signaling, which consequently will stimulate tissue proliferation via the other pathways.</p><p>Duntas <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] have proposed, an emerging hypothesis to explain the effect of metformin on TSH involves the action of metformin on 5&#x000b4;-adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK regulates cellular metabolism and integrates nutritional and hormonal signals in the hypothalamus, being a central target for both modulation of insulin sensitivity and feedback of thyroid hormones on appetite and energy expenditure. Peripherally, AMPK is dose and time dependently stimulated by tri-iodothyronine (T3).</p><p>In our study, metformin has decreased HOMA-IR, an index of IR. However, it has no statistically significant change on FPG, HbA1c and BMI. It suggests that the effect of metformin on TSH &#x0003e;2.5 &#x003bc;U/ml and thyroid volume and small thyroid nodule volume must probably be through insulin, IGF-I and their receptors. Our study supports that the metformin has a more strong regulatory effect on hormonal signal in the hypothalamus in comparison with cellular metabolism and nutritional signals.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>In the liver, metformin suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis by activating AMPK. The opposite effect is observed in the central nervous system where metformin inhibits hypothalamic AMPK.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Although, few studies on the regulation of the hypothalamic isoforms (a1 and a2) of AMPK are available, the results provided by L&#x000f3;pez <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] support the concept that the effects of metformin on hypothalamic AMPK activity can counteract T3 effects at the hypothalamic level. As an alternative hypothesis, the central effect of metformin could be mediated by a reduction of circulating fatty acids.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>Some studies on the TSH effect of metformin in diabetic patients had been conducted.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>With our best knowledge, the study on the effect of metformin on TSH and thyroid volume of prediabetic people had not been conducted, previously.</p><p>In our study, in which the effect of metformin compared with placebo on TSH and thyroid volume of prediabetic people was investigated. After 3 months of treatment, a significant decrease in TSH levels did not observe. However, when the TSH range was divided into two low and high-normal ranges, a decrease in TSH was significantly observed only in those patients with a basal high-normal TSH concentration [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. There was also slightly increased thyroid volume in both groups that were significant in placebo-treated group [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. In addition, a significant reduction was seen in the size of small solid nodules in metformin-treated group, compared with placebo-treated group [Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>].</p><p>In a retrospective study, conducted in Italy by Cappelli <italic>et al</italic>., TSH levels in diabetic patients treated with metformin were studied, and they concluded that a significant reduction of TSH was seen in patients who had high-normal serum TSH (2.5-4.5 [&#x003bc;U/ml]).[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>The result of our study is similar to Cappelli <italic>et al</italic>. study; however, it has some differences. First of all, our patients had prediabetes, and the study was prospective. In our study, 11 participants had TSH levels in the range of 2.5-5.5 (&#x003bc;U/ml). There was a significant decrease in TSH level after treatment with metformin (3.1 &#x003bc;U/ml vs. 2.85 &#x003bc;U/ml, <italic>P</italic> = 0.01). However, such a reduction in placebo-treated group was not observed.</p><p>In a study by Rezz&#x000f3;nico <italic>et al</italic>., in 14 insulin resistant women that treated with metformin for 6 months compared with 15 female patients who were not treated, they found that TSH levels were not significantly different. However, the volume of small solid nodules in the metformin group, significantly decreased.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>In our study, from 89 patients, 48 patients had thyroid nodules, 26 patients in metformin-treated group and 22 patients were in placebo-treated group. In some patients, due to multiple nodules, comparison of volume of nodules before and after treatment was not possible. Therefore only nodules in 33 of the patients were compared. The numbers of selected nodules were 52.</p><p>At the end of the treatment, there were no significant differences in the posttreatment thyroid nodule size between two groups, but when the solid nodules were separated from mixed nodules (solid and cystic), there were statistically significant reduction in the volume of solid nodules in metformin-treated group. This means that a total of 27 nodules were studied, 16 in metformin-treated group and 11 were in placebo-treated group and a significant reduction in volume of solid nodule was observed (<italic>P</italic> = 0.017) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>].</p><p>In a study by Imani <italic>et al</italic>., on thyroid of 263 people in the normal population of Isfahan, Iran, who 54% and 46% of the population were male and female, respectively, the prevalence of thyroid nodules by ultrasound was 22.4%. Among this normal population, 11.4% (<italic>n</italic> = 30) had one thyroid nodule and 8.7% (<italic>n</italic> = 23) had multinodules. The prevalence of thyroid nodules in males and females were 16.3% and 30%, respectively.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] In our study, 13.5% and 86.5% of patient were male and female, respectively. The prevalence of thyroid nodules was 53.9%.</p><p>In our study, 19.1% (<italic>n</italic> = 17) and 34.8% (<italic>n</italic> = 31) of patients had one thyroid nodule and multinodules, respectively. The prevalence of thyroid nodules in males and females were 58.4% (<italic>n</italic> = 7) and 53.2% (<italic>n</italic> = 41) respectively. Our prediabetic participants are recruited from the same population (Isfahan city). However, the prevalence of thyroid nodule by ultrasonography is 53.9% versus 22.4%. It is much higher than the normal population. This difference suggests the role of some factors like IR in the pathogenesis of thyroid nodule formation which is more common in prediabetic people in comparison with normal population.</p><p>Since, in prediabetic participants, the prevalence of thyroid nodule in male and female is almost equal (58.4% in men vs. 53.2% in women), it seems that the presence of IR blunts the effect of gender on thyroid nodule formation. However, in the normal population of Isfahan, its prevalence in women is twice as men.</p><p>In a Turkish study on 124 patients with prediabetes by Anil <italic>et al</italic>., the percentage of patients with thyroid nodules in the prediabetes and control group was 51.3% and 23.7%, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] In the present study, the prevalence of thyroid nodules in patients with prediabetes was 53.9%. The prevalence of thyroid nodules in prediabetic people in Iran and Turkey is similar to each other.</p><p>In a meta-analysis study by Lupoli <italic>et al</italic>., they concluded that the metformin induces a reduction in TSH levels both in overt and in subclinical hypothyroidism. In contrast, no change in TSH levels was found in euthyroid people.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] In the present study, the effect of metformin compared with placebo on TSH and thyroid volume of prediabetic people who were euthyroid. We did not include hypothyroid patients. After 3 months of treatment, a significant decrease in TSH levels did not observe. In future study, hypothyroid prediabetic people should also be included in order to let us compare the findings with other similar researches.</p><p>Our study has some limitations. 3 months of study period, might be too short to observe the changes in thyroid volume and nodule size. The numbers of male participants in this study was low. However, as the thyroid disease is more prevalent in the female people and the tendency of women to participate in the research projects, it is expected to have such gender differences in future studies. However, bigger sample size may help solve the problem.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In prediabetic people, metformin decreases serum TSH in those with TSH &#x0003e;2.5 &#x003bc;U/ml and reduces the size of small solid thyroid nodules. It also prevents an increase in the thyroid volume. This effect might be through the decrease in IR and hormonal not nutritional and metabolic signals regulation.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>AUTHOR'S CONTRIBUTION</title><p>MK contributed in the conception of the work, conducting the study, revising the draft, approval of the final version of the manuscript, and agreed for all aspects of the work.
