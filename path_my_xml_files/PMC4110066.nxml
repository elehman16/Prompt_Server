The pharmacodynamic efficacy of proton pump inhibitors has not been specifically evaluated in obese subjects. The aim of this study was to compare the antisecretory response to a single oral dose of 20&#x000a0;mg rabeprazole, 20&#x000a0;mg omeprazole and placebo in obese subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Gastric pH was monitored for 24&#x000a0;hours on three separate occasions in eighteen <italic>H. pylori</italic>-negative, asymptomatic obese subjects.

The main analysis criterion was 24-h percent of time post dose with intragastric pH above 3; secondary criteria were percentage of time above pH&#x000a0;4, median pH, [H+] concentrations and nocturnal acid breakthrough (NAB). Results were analyzed using linear mixed models and Wilks test comparing variances.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>24-h median [IQ] percentages of time with gastric pH above 3 and 4 were higher with rabeprazole than omeprazole (46 [37&#x02013;55] vs. 30 [15&#x02013;55] %, 9 [5-11] % for placebo) but the differences did not reach statistical significance (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.11 and 0.24, respectively). Median acid concentrations were significantly lower with rabeprazole than with omeprazole and placebo (22 [14&#x02013;53] vs. 54 [19&#x02013;130] and 95 [73&#x02013;170] mmoles/l, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) for all periods.

Variances of 24-h data (pH above 3 and 4, median pH, [H+] concentrations) were significantly lower with rabeprazole than with omeprazole (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In asymptomatic obese subjects the gastric antisecretory response to a single dose of rabeprazole and omeprazole was strong and not significantly different between drugs despite a significantly more homogeneous response with rabeprazole.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrial.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01136317?term=bruley+des+Varannes&#x00026;rank=6">NCT01136317</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Obesity</kwd><kwd>Treatment</kwd><kwd>Pharmacology</kwd><kwd>Proton pump inhibitor</kwd><kwd>Gastroesophageal reflux disease</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Symptoms suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are reported by 10-20% of the population in Western countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]<italic>.</italic> Although GERD is a multifactorial disease, being overweight and obese are established as increasing the risk of developing GERD and its complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In overweight and obese subjects, direct mechanical factors and proinflammatory signals derived from the visceral adipose tissue may account for an increased occurrence of reflux episodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Acid-suppressive therapy is the main therapeutic option in GERD. However, in spite of the well-documented association between obesity and GERD, the impact of being overweight/obesity on the efficacy of acid-suppressive therapies is still poorly documented. No study has established whether high body mass index (BMI) might affect the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile of PPIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In fact, several mechanisms such as changes in the volume of distribution of the drugs, reduction in tissue blood flow and changes in drug clearance could change the pharmacokinetics of drugs in obese patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. PPIs as prodrugs are lipophilic compounds and may therefore have a different bioavailability in obese individuals compared to lean individuals due to variations in distribution. In addition, as most PPIs are mainly metabolized by the liver cytochrome P450 (CYP450) pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], metabolism may be affected in the setting of obesity with fatty liver disease. Recently, some studies have reported a lower rate of healing of esophagitis symptoms control in patients with a high BMI treated with esomeprazole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Likewise, Chen et al. observed that twice-daily 40&#x000a0;mg pantoprazole induced a better symptomatic control of reflux esophagitis in overweight/obese patients than once-daily 40&#x000a0;mg pantoprazole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Conversely, another study using a retrospective design did not find any clear differences in mucosal healing rate between lean and overweight/obese patients treated with omeprazole or rabeprazole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>All these studies were conducted in patients receiving a chronic treatment on an everyday basis. In fact, a group of patients is encouraged to use PPIs on an on-demand basis adapted on the occurrence of their symptoms. Although the interest of this procedure has been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] no study has carefully determined the pharmacodynamic consequences of a such on-demand intake in obese patients. We only recently showed using a post-hoc analysis that the pharmacodynamic effects of a single dose of rabeprazole and pantoprazole were not hampered by obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Thus, it is not known whether PPI doses should be adjusted according to body weight, especially when administered in a single dose as an on-demand treatment.</p><p>The aim of this study was to investigate prospectively the pharmacodynamic effects of single doses of 20&#x000a0;mg rabeprazole and 20&#x000a0;mg omeprazole in obese asymptomatic subjects by monitoring gastric pH for 24&#x000a0;hours.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>This single-center study was conducted at the Clinical Investigation Center of the University Hospital of Nantes (CIC INSERM-04).

Subjects with clinically relevant diseases such as cardiac, renal or hepatic impairment, and patients with digestive symptoms suggestive of reflux disease or dyspepsia were not included. In addition, subjects were not included if they had known hypersensitivity to a PPI or a component of the drug, or had received acid-suppressing medications or a medication likely to interact with acid secretion in the previous month. Patients with a history of abdominal surgery were not included. During the study, reliable contraceptive methods were requested for nonmenopausal women.</p><p>Patients with consumption of alcohol more than 30&#x000a0;g/d or smoking more than 5 cigarettes per day were not enrolled, nor were patients with ongoing treatment by immunosuppressive therapy, antifungal or antiretroviral drugs. At the baseline enrollment, all patients underwent biological tests of liver function as well as coagulation parameters and ultrasonography of the liver to screen for any findings suggestive of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Also at the time of enrollment, anthropometric characteristics (weight, height, abdominal perimeter) were taken.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover trial. Before breakfast, subjects received one indistinguishable capsule of 20&#x000a0;mg rabeprazole or 20&#x000a0;mg omeprazole or placebo in a randomized order on three separate occasions. The marketed forms available in France, Pariet&#x000ae; (rabeprazole) and Mopral&#x000ae; (omeprazole), and the placebo (lactose tablet - Rodael laboratories - Bierne &#x02013; France) were reconditioned in capsules by the central pharmacy of the hospital.

For the 3 occasions, subjects were given similar daily meals at the same predetermined hours (breakfast at 8:30&#x000a0;am, lunch at 1:00&#x000a0;pm and dinner at 7:00&#x000a0;pm), with a global intake of 1960&#x000a0;kcal/24&#x000a0;h (P:19%, L:32%, G:49%). Only still mineral water and tea were allowed without restriction. Smoking was not allowed. Subjects were required to remain in a recumbent position from 10:00&#x000a0;pm to 7:00&#x000a0;am.</p><p>Analysis was performed on the 24-h recording time, the diurnal period from 8:00&#x000a0;am to 10:00&#x000a0;pm; and the nocturnal period from 10:00&#x000a0;pm to 8:00&#x000a0;am. The primary efficacy criterion was the percentage of time with intragastric pH&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;3. The secondary criteria were the percentage of time with pH&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;4, median intragastric pH, acid concentration and the occurrence of nocturnal acid breakthrough (NAB). Nocturnal acid breakthrough was defined as the occurrence of intragastric pH&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;4 for more than 1&#x000a0;h from 10:00&#x000a0;pm to 08:00&#x000a0;am [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>The number of subjects to be included was calculated using the results of Williams et al&#x02019;s study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].

Statistical analysis exhibited a significant treatment effect for all the analyzed criteria (percent time with intragastric pH&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;3 and 4 and median pH). As far as the main endpoint was considered (percent time with intragastric pH&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;3), there was no statistically significant difference between both drugs. However, there was a statistically significant decrease (approximately 50%) in the median gastric acid concentration after administration of 20&#x000a0;mg rabeprazole vs. 20&#x000a0;mg omeprazole (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Of interest is also the efficiency of rabeprazole in significantly reducing the occurrence of NAB. Reduced NAB episodes have previously been reported even when using low doses of rabeprazole (10&#x000a0;mg) in comparison with a standard dose of omeprazole (20&#x000a0;mg) or pantoprazole (40&#x000a0;mg) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies in healthy, nonobese, <italic>H.pylori</italic>-negative subjects using similar methodology to compare the antisecretory effects of single doses of various PPIs documented similar findings of increased mean intragastric pH, increased percentage of time with pH&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;3 or&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;4, and decreased intragastric [H+] with rabeprazole compared with omeprazole, lanzoprazole or pantoprazole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Regarding omeprazole, and although the omeprazole dose (i.e. 20&#x000a0;mg daily) is the approved daily dose in the treatment of GERD, several pharmacodynamics studies have shown that it is not equivalent to the approved regimens of the other PPIs (namely lansoprazole, pantoprazole and rabeprazole). In addition, the inter-individual variability of the antisecretory action of the 20&#x000a0;mg dose of omeprazole has been well described from its introduction in our therapeutic armamentarium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In our study, the lack of demonstration of a statistically significant difference between omeprazole and rabeprazole for the main endpoint, i.e. 24-h percent time pH&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;3, may be due to a second espece risk. This difference may also suggest that in obese patients the overall antisecretory difference between PPIs is less than that observed in nonobese subjects or patients.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of drugs may be affected by obesity due to alterations in drug distribution mediated by reduced tissue blood flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In addition, drug clearance may be affected in obese patients as a result of changes in renal and hepatic physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The present study does not explain the causes of observed differences between the effects of the two PPIs in obese subjects. Previous evidence of impaired cytochrome P450 metabolism reported in obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] may partially account for the observed advantage of rabeprazole over omeprazole due to increased metabolism of rabeprazole by nonenzymatic pathways and decreased dependency on CYP2C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In fact, the influence of obesity on CYP450 appears to be isoenzyme specific, with a decrease of CYP3A4 activity and an increase of CYP2E1.</p><p>As illustrated by the significantly lower variances for time above pH3 and pH4 and median pH and acid concentrations, the decreased variability of antisecretory response with single-dose rabeprazole in obese subjects may represent an advantage when using PPI intermittently on demand in response to insufficiently controlled symptoms of GERD before suggesting a continuous treatment. Further studies in obese subjects are needed to determine whether these pharmacodynamic differences between rabeprazole and omeprazole persist when taking the drug consistently on a daily basis, as has previously been documented in nonobese subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Our study has several strengths. It is one of the first pharmacodynamic studies specifically conducted in obese subjects. Obese asymptomatic subjects were well characterized in order to exclude any hepatic abnormality, and pharmacodynamic data were obtained in rigorous conditions using continuous monitoring of gastric pH. Our study also has some limitations including small sample size and the lack of a nonobese control group. In fact, the final word on the effect of obesity on PPI pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics will be given by a study, investigating both activities of a given PPI before and after weight reduction, whether obtained by medical or surgical treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, this study shows that in obese healthy volunteers the overall antisecretory effect after a single dose of 20&#x000a0;mg rabeprazole and 20&#x000a0;mg omeprazole, when taken on an on-demand basis, is strong but not significantly different between both drugs. However, the antisecretory response seems to be more homogeneous after rabeprazole. Finally, our results suggest that, from a pharmacodynamic point of view, dose augmentation in obese subjects is not justified.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BMI: Body mass index; GERD: Gastroesophageal reflux disease; NAB: Nocturnal acid breakthrough; PPI: Proton pump inhibitor.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>K.
