A total 56 adult patients were randomly allocated to two equal groups (<italic>n</italic> = 28 in each group) using computer generated random number list. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II, aged between 25 and 50 years of both sexes undergoing short stay ambulatory surgery were enrolled in the study.</p><p>Patients in Group A received aspirin gargle (ECOSPRIN<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 325, USV Limited, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India) (325 mg tablet was dissolved into 20 mL of [5% dextrose] solution). Group M received magnesium sulfate gargle (MAGNEON<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 50% w/v, Neon Laboratories Limited, Thane, Maharashtra, India) ([20 mg/kg] magnesium sulfate solution was dissolved into 20 mL of [5% dextrose] solution). Patients were asked to gargle with this mixture for 30 s, 15 min before induction of anesthesia.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Patient refusal, any known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, magnesium sulfate, pregnancy, lactating mothers, hepatic, renal or cardiopulmonary abnormality, alcoholism, diabetes, long-term analgesic therapy were excluded from the study. Patients having a history of significant neurological, psychiatric, or neuromuscular disorders were also excluded from this study.</p><p>In preoperative assessment, the patients were enquired about any history of drug allergy, recent sore throat, previous operations, or prolonged drug treatment. General examination, systemic examinations and assessment of the airway were done. Preoperative fasting of minimum 6 h was ensured before the operation. All patients received premedication of tablet diazepam 10 mg orally the night before surgery as per preanesthetic check-up direction to allay anxiety, apprehension, and for sound sleep. The patients also received tablet ranitidine 150 mg in the previous night and the morning of operation with sips of water.</p><p>All patients were clinically examined in the preoperative period when whole procedure was explained. Patients were allowed to gurgle slowly for 30 s, 15 min before induction of anesthesia with the solution as per allotment of the group and drug. The gargles were wrapped in colored nontransparent glasses to ensure blinding. The anesthesiologist distributing the solution for gurgling was unaware of the constituent of the drug and allotment of the group and similarly resident doctors keeping records of different parameters were also unaware of group allotment. Thus, blinding was properly maintained.</p><p>All patients are investigated for Hb%, total leukocyte count, differential leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, platelet count, blood sugar, blood urea, serum creatinine, and liver function tests. A 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest X-ray were also taken. On entering the patient in the operative room standard intraoperative monitors such as ECG, pulse oximeter, noninvasive blood pressure (BP) were attached, and baseline parameter were recorded. Intravenous (IV) infusion of Ringers&#x02019; lactate started. After intubation end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO<sub>2</sub>) monitor was attached.</p><p>The patients were preoxygenated with 100% oxygen for 5 min. Injection fentanyl (2 &#x003bc;g/kg) and glycopyrrolate (0.01 mg/kg) were given intravenously 3 min before induction of anesthesia. For induction, injection propofol was administered up to loss of verbal command. Injection atracurium 0.5 mg/kg IV was used for intubation. After 3 min of atracurium administration, laryngoscopy and intubation were performed. The trachea was intubated with a soft seal cuffed sterile polyvinyl chloride ETT with a standard cuff (Fuzhou Kanglite Medical Apparatus Co. Ltd., Fuzhou, China) and an internal diameter of 7&#x02013;8 mm for women and 8&#x02013;9 mm for men. Tracheal intubation was performed by an experienced anesthesiologist after ensuring maximum neuromuscular blocking effect as assessed by train-of-four guard. All the patients received IV paracetamol 1000 mg, 30 min after tracheal intubation. Anesthesia was be maintained with nitrous oxide 66% in oxygen and isoflurane up to 1&#x02013;2 minimal alveolar concentration. The tracheal tube cuff was inflated until no air leakage could be heard with a peak airway pressure at 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and cuff pressure was maintained between 18 cm and 22 cm H<sub>2</sub>O using handheld pressure gauge (Endotest; R&#x000fc;sch, Kernen, Germany). Those patients who required more than one attempt for passage of the tube were excluded from the study. After completion of surgery, neuromuscular block was reversed with injection glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg and injection neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and extubated when adequate spontaneous ventilation was established. Oropharyngeal suction was performed under direct vision to avoid trauma to the tissues before extubation and to confirm that the clearance of secretions was complete.</p><p>The patients were interviewed in a standard fashion by an anesthesiologist (blinded investigator) who is unaware of the group allocation. On arrival in the postanesthesia care unit (0 h), and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, and 24 h thereafter, POST was graded on a four-point scale (0&#x02013;3).[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Grade 0 = no sore throat; Grade 1 = mild sore throat (complains of sore throat only on asking); Grade 2 = moderate sore throat (complains of sore throat on his/her own); Grade 3 = severe sore throat (change of voice or hoarseness, associated with throat pain). Other side-effects, if any, were also noted. ECG (lead-II) and heart rate, SpO<sub>2</sub>, systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP, mean BP, EtCO<sub>2</sub>, respiratory rate, temperature were recorded throughout the operative procedure. Multichannel monitors (Philips IntelliVue MP20) were used for measuring above mentioned parameters. Visual analog scale (VAS) for postoperative pain score ([0&#x02013;10 cm], 0 = no pain, 10 cm = worst pain imaginable).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Calculation of sample size was based on the assumption that the incidence of POST is 60% and to show a 40% reduction in the incidence at &#x003b1; = 0.05, confidence interval of 95%, and a power 90% we required a sample size of 25 patients per group. On adding 10% patients for possible loss to follow-up, the sample size required was 28 patients per group.

Such responses include tachycardia, hypertension, dysrhythmia, raised intraocular pressure, increased intracranial pressure, wound dehiscence, and bronchospasm.

This is essential for local adsorption. In addition, we think that the direct contact of magnesium ions with pharyngeal wall is an important issue. Nevertheless, we suggest that magnesium works locally, and it is adhered to the pharyngeal wall. In case of POST, when the process of passing through to the tissue begins, it can also decrease the edema if it is used as a preoperative gargle form. Thus, its effect might begin immediately when it is contacted with the wall and absorbed from there as long as it stays in the pharyngeal tissue.</p><p>Several hypothesized mechanisms of action have been suggested to explain the analgesic effect of magnesium. Magnesium exerts its analgesic action as a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, blocking ion channels in a voltage-dependent manner.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] The addition of magnesium reduces the activation of C-fibers by inhibiting the slow excitatory postsynaptic currents produced by NMDA receptor activation.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] NMDA receptor antagonists abolish calcium and sodium influx into cells leading to central sensitization and wind-up attributed to peripheral nociceptive stimulation.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] They abolish hypersensitization by blocking NDMA receptor activation in the dorsal horn by excitatory amino acid transmitters, notably glutamate, and aspartate.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Magnesium is also known as &#x0201c;nature's physiological calcium channel blocker.&#x0201d; In animals, calcium channel blockers have demonstrated an antinociceptive effect and in chronic pain patients, they potentiate the effects of morphine.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</p><p>Several potential limitations of our study should be considered. First, although the sample size seems to be relatively small, we were able to successfully test our desired outcomes. However, to avoid type I error, it would be better if the sample size was computed from the incidence derived from a meta-analysis of POST. Second, the mechanism of the novel therapy of oral aspirin and magnesium gargle is still unknown. Data concerning the pharmacokinetic effects of aspirin and magnesium sulfate gargle are limited; therefore, it is difficult to point out the exact administration time and dosage of drug in the gargle. Based on previous data in which different pharmaceutical forms of aspirin and magnesium sulfate were used, the estimated peak effect and duration of action of oral aspirin and magnesium gargle was stated. Third, in our study, the dosage was empirical, with no pilot data.
