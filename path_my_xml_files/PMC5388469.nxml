This trial evaluated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of silk garments (in addition to standard care) for the management of eczema in children with moderate to severe disease.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and findings</title><p>This was a parallel-group, randomised, controlled, observer-blind trial. Children aged 1 to 15 y with moderate to severe eczema were recruited from secondary care and the community at five UK medical centres. Participants were allocated using online randomisation (1:1) to standard care or to standard care plus silk garments, stratified by age and recruiting centre. Silk garments were worn for 6 mo. Primary outcome (eczema severity) was assessed at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 mo, by nurses blinded to treatment allocation, using the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), which was log-transformed for analysis (intention-to-treat analysis). A safety outcome was number of skin infections.</p><p>Three hundred children were randomised (26 November 2013 to 5 May 2015): 42% girls, 79% white, mean age 5 y. Primary analysis included 282/300 (94%) children (<italic>n</italic> = 141 in each group). The garments were worn more often at night than in the day (median of 81% of nights [25th to 75th centile 57% to 96%] and 34% of days [25th to 75th centile 10% to 76%]). Geometric mean EASI scores at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 mo were, respectively, 9.2, 6.4, 5.8, and 5.4 for silk clothing and 8.4, 6.6, 6.0, and 5.4 for standard care. There was no evidence of any difference between the groups in EASI score averaged over all follow-up visits adjusted for baseline EASI score, age, and centre: adjusted ratio of geometric means 0.95, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.07, (p = 0.43). This confidence interval is equivalent to a difference of &#x02212;1.5 to 0.5 in the original EASI units, which is not clinically important. Skin infections occurred in 36/142 (25%) and 39/141 (28%) of children in the silk clothing and standard care groups, respectively. Even if the small observed treatment effect was genuine, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year was &#x000a3;56,811 in the base case analysis from a National Health Service perspective, suggesting that silk garments are unlikely to be cost-effective using currently accepted thresholds. The main limitation of the study is that use of an objective primary outcome, whilst minimising detection bias, may have underestimated treatment effects.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Silk clothing is unlikely to provide additional benefit over standard care in children with moderate to severe eczema.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN77261365">ISRCTN77261365</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>In a randomized controlled trial, Kim Suzanne Thomas and colleagues examine the effectiveness of silk garments vs. standard care for treating eczema in children.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><sec id="sec005"><title>Why was this study done?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Prior to this trial, evidence on the use of silk garments for the management of eczema was limited.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) had been conducted, but these were small (74 participants in total) and at risk of bias.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The existing evidence was insufficient to guide clinical practice on the use of silk clothing in the management of eczema, and no cost-effectiveness analyses had been undertaken.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>What did the researchers do and find?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>We conducted a pragmatic, observer-blind RCT that recruited 300 children with moderate to severe eczema and followed them for six months.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Participants were randomised to receive standard eczema care plus silk clothing (100% sericin-free silk garments; DermaSilk or DreamSkin) or standard care alone.</p></list-item><list-item><p>After six months, there was no evidence of a difference between the groups in eczema severity (Eczema Area and Severity Index score) assessed by research nurses; the 95% confidence interval ranged from 1.5 points favouring silk clothing to 0.5 points favouring standard care, which is not a clinically important difference.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Even if the potential small benefit of silk garments was genuine, our analysis suggests that they are unlikely to be cost-effective within currently accepted thresholds, with an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year of &#x000a3;56,811.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>What do these findings mean?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The CLOTHES Trial is the first large, independent RCT to have evaluated silk garments for the management of eczema.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The results of this trial suggest that silk garments are unlikely to provide additional clinical or economic benefits over standard care for children with moderate to severe eczema.</p></list-item><list-item><p>These results provide robust evidence for health commissioners and prescribers to make informed clinical decisions.</p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Espere Healthcare Ltd.</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>Kim S.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000664</institution-id><institution>Health Technology Assessment Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>11/65/01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>Kim S.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Dreamskin Health Ltd.</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>Kim S.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme (project number 11/65/01).

SJB is supported by a Wellcome Trust Senior Research Fellowship in Clinical Science (106865/Z/15/Z). The trial was supported through the UK Dermatology Clinical Trials Network, who receive infrastructure funding from the British Association of Dermatologists. The NIHR had input into trial design through peer review of the funding proposal, and the companies supplying the garments provided advice in defining how the intervention should be used. Neither of the funders had a role in data collection, data analysis, data interpretation or writing of the report.

Childhood eczema has a substantial impact on the quality of life of children and their families [<xref rid="pmed.1002280.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Many families are keen to identify new ways of managing the symptoms of eczema using non-pharmacological approaches [<xref rid="pmed.1002280.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Clothing may play a role in either soothing or exacerbating eczema symptoms, and patients are commonly advised to avoid wool because of its tendency to worsen itch, and to use cotton or fine weave materials next to the skin [<xref rid="pmed.1002280.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Specialist clothing is now available on prescription in a variety of forms including sericin-free silk, viscose, and silver-impregnated fabrics. These garments are claimed to be beneficial for the management of eczema as they can help to regulate the humidity and temperature of the surface of the skin, are smooth in texture, and may reduce skin damage from scratching. Some products have anti-microbial properties that could help to reduce the bacterial load on the skin, which may be important in eczema [<xref rid="pmed.1002280.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>To date, there have been just three small randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of silk clothing for the management of eczema [<xref rid="pmed.1002280.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1002280.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

Sericin is removed from the silk fibres during manufacture because it is a protein that coats the outside of silk fibres and has the potential to cause allergic reactions. Participants received three sets of garments (long-sleeved undershirts and leggings or bodysuits and leggings, depending on the age of the child) and were instructed to wear the clothing as often as possible during the day and at night.</p><p>Standardised usage instructions were provided, and participants were advised to allow topical medications to absorb into the skin prior to wearing the garments.

Whilst it was not possible to blind participants to their treatment allocation, efforts were made to minimise expectation bias by emphasising in the trial documents that the evidence supporting the use of silk garments for eczema was limited and that it was not yet known if such clothing offered any benefit over standard care.

Estimates of the intervention effect are presented with 95% confidence intervals and <italic>p</italic>-values. All regression models included the randomisation stratification variables (recruiting centre and age) as covariates, and baseline scores, if measured. Adjusted differences in means for the intervention group compared to the standard care group are presented for continuous outcomes, and adjusted risk differences and relative risks for binary outcomes. For outcomes collected at the 2-, 4-, and 6-mo visits, we explored whether the effect of the trial garments on the outcome changed over the study period by including an interaction term between treatment group and time point in the model. As there was no evidence of a differential effect over time for any outcomes, we report a single estimate per outcome that averages the treatment effect over all time points.</p><p>The primary analysis used a multilevel model with observations at 2, 4, and 6 mo nested within participants. The model used a random intercept and slope at the participant level with an unstructured covariance matrix for these random effects. The model assumed that missing EASI scores were missing at random given the observed data. EASI scores were right skewed at all time points. Diagnostic plots indicated that the assumptions for the multilevel model in the original EASI units were not met.

The TIS score was analysed using the multilevel model framework as outlined above for the primary outcome (not transformed). Changes to treatment regimen were based on whether a participant had reported treatment escalation over the 6-mo RCT period and were analysed using a generalised linear model. Skin infections were analysed using negative binomial regression.

The adjusted incremental cost per QALY was &#x000a3;56,811, suggesting that silk garments for AE are not cost-effective using currently accepted thresholds. At a willingness to pay of &#x000a3;30,000 per QALY, the probability of silk garments being cost-effective was 12.13%. This conclusion did not change in sensitivity analysis testing an alternative approach to costing the silk garments. Although the cost of silk garments was reduced with the alternative approach, at &#x000a3;53,989 per QALY, the estimated incremental cost per QALY was still over the accepted NICE threshold value (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002280.s013">S8 Table</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec030"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="sec031"><title>Main findings</title><p>This trial found little evidence of clinical or economic benefit of using silk garments in addition to standard care, compared with standard care alone, in children with moderate to severe eczema. There were no differences between the treatment groups for any of the outcomes that were assessed by research nurses, who were unaware of participants&#x02019; treatment allocation, and the percentage of days on which topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors were used did not differ between the groups. The 95% confidence intervals around the primary efficacy estimates were narrow, suggesting that a clinically important treatment effect is unlikely to have been missed, and sensitivity analyses (imputing missing values, adjusting for baseline imbalances, and exploring the impact of adherence in wearing the garments) supported the primary analysis.</p><p>Subgroup analysis based on <italic>FLG</italic> genotype showed no evidence of differential treatment response in children with an inherited impairment in skin barrier function, and a post hoc analysis exploring the impact of baseline eczema severity on the primary outcome showed no effect, suggesting that children with more severe disease were no more likely to benefit from silk clothing than those with milder disease.</p><p>The trial garments are marketed as possessing antimicrobial properties, but this study found no evidence to suggest a reduction in the number of skin infections in those using the clothing compared to those randomised to standard care alone.</p><p>Of the seven unblinded secondary outcomes, two (POEM and PGA) showed small differences in favour of the silk garments, most noticeably in the first 3 mo of the trial. Whilst these small differences could have been genuine, they are most likely due to an expectation bias that declined with time. Our nested qualitative study (to be reported separately) highlighted the hopes that both children and parents placed on the silk clothing [<xref rid="pmed.1002280.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A previous eczema trial reported differences between blinded and unblinded outcomes when expectation regarding the benefits of the trial intervention was high [<xref rid="pmed.1002280.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec032"><title>Relevance to other studies</title><p>To our knowledge, there have been no further RCTs on the effectiveness of silk garments for eczema since the CLOTHES Trial began (search updated 14 March 2016), and meta-analysis of the available silk clothing trials is not possible due to heterogeneity of designs. Additional brands of silk garments have since become available for use in eczema (e.g., Skinnies), but these have not been formally evaluated in RCTs. At the time of commissioning this research (2011), &#x000a3;840,272 was spent on prescriptions for silk garments per annum in the UK (for all indications). By 2014, this amount had risen to &#x000a3;2,082,810 per annum [<xref rid="pmed.1002280.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1002280.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec033"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The CLOTHES Trial was an adequately powered RCT, with high follow-up rates and good adherence. The pragmatic study design meant that use of silk garments was evaluated as they might be used in normal practice, with mixed patterns of adherence. The trial placed special emphasis on objective outcome measures in order to minimise response bias.</p><p>It is possible that our emphasis on objective eczema severity outcomes meant that some important potential benefits were not captured in the primary analysis. Other factors, such as improvements in quality of life or a reduction in symptoms (especially itch and sleep loss, as measured by POEM), may be important drivers in determining whether or not patients feel that the garments are helpful. Nevertheless, we found no evidence of improved quality of life amongst trial participants using a range of validated scales.</p><p>Eczema severity scores improved for both groups during the trial, probably due to a combination of regression to the mean and regular monitoring of the eczema resulting in enhanced adherence to standard care. It is possible that treatment effects were masked by these general trial effects.</p></sec><sec id="sec034"><title>Generalisability</title><p>The study has strong external validity as it was pragmatic in design to reflect normal clinical practice, and participants were recruited from five UK medical centres covering a range of urban and rural settings. We recruited children with a range of eczema severities, but the majority had moderate to severe disease; 32% had at least one mutation in the <italic>FLG</italic> gene, a proportion typical of eczema patents with moderate or severe disease [<xref rid="pmed.1002280.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Overall, 49% had self-reported food allergy, which is high for children with moderate to severe disease, and 15% reported a history of anaphylaxis. However, these data were collected by self-report and so may include food intolerance as well as food allergy.</p><p>We are unable to comment on the effectiveness of the silk garments if used continuously day and night, although sensitivity analysis found no evidence of improved outcomes in those who adhered more fully in wearing the garments. It is also possible that the beneficial effects of silk garments are best realised during a period of eczema flare, and daily use of the garments in the CLOTHES trial could have led to more rapid deterioration of the clothing than might have been seen if the garments were worn occasionally when the eczema was at its worst.</p></sec><sec id="sec035"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first large, independent trial to have evaluated silk garments for the management of eczema. The nested economic evaluation suggests that use of these garments is unlikely to be cost-effective for health providers, even if the small observed benefits were genuine. These trial results provide health commissioners with a better evidence base on which to make informed decisions about silk garments for eczema. Whether or not parents feel that the small benefits identified in some of the secondary outcomes are sufficient to justify purchasing these garments is something for individuals to consider on a case-by-case basis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec036"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"
