It is expected that dexmedetomidine would induce better hypotension than magnesium that is used routinely during transsphenoidal resection of pituitary tumours in our hospital.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>After obtaining Local Ethics and Research Committee approval and written informed consent from patients, a double-blind, randomised study was performed. One hundred and fifty-two patients with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scanning proof of pituitary gland adenoma scheduled for endoscopic transsphenoidal resection under general anaesthesia were included between November 12, 2014 and October 9, 2016. The inclusion criteria were patients undergoing elective surgery of pituitary adenoma, Mallampati score of airway I, II and American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification system score I or II. The exclusion criteria were presence of morbid obesity, liver or kidney diseases, a pre-operative heart rate &#x0003c;45 beats/min, second or third degree heart block, ejection fraction &#x0003c;30%, coagulopathies, psychiatric diseases, neuromuscular diseases, diabetic neuropathy, known allergy history to study medications or patients receiving calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers or anticoagulants. The pre-operative assessment was focussed on the endocrine manifestations of pituitary tumours (hypo- or hyper-secretion of hormones), neurological complications (such as increased intracranial tension or compression on the adjacent structures, airway assessment and cardiovascular system assessment in addition to the pre-operative investigations). Chest X-ray, lateral view of X-ray neck, electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram and hormonal assays were done for all patients. Pulmonary function tests were done in cases associated with sleep apnoea.</p><p>The patients were allocated randomly (by simple randomisation through a process of coin-tossing: The coin tossing test was carried out every two patients by the staff-nurse and according to the results, the study medication was prepared) into two groups (each = 76) and the study medications were prepared in 50 ml syringe and the infusion started by the staff-nurse according to the study protocol and the anaesthetist was blinded to the contents of the syringe and the name of the medication infused by the syringe pump. Group D: Dexmedetomidine (Abbott, Chicago, IL, USA) was given as loading dose 1 &#x003bc;g/kg IV over 10 min before induction and maintained as an intravenous infusion at 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg/h to the end of surgery. Group M: Magnesium sulphate (magnesium sulphate injection, USP 50% American Regent Laboratories, Inc.), was given as a loading dose of 50 mg/kg IV over 10 min before induction and maintained as an intravenous infusion at 15 mg/kg/h to the end of surgery.</p><p>On arrival in the operating room and under local anaesthesia, left radial arterial line and two venous lines were inserted before starting the study medications. A pre-operative arterial blood gas analysis was performed in cases of sleep apnoea syndrome (due to enlargement of the oral tissues and tongue as in gigantism and acromegaly) or pulmonary function tests showing abnormal results. After attaching the monitors (ECG, pulse oximeter, invasive arterial blood pressure) and starting the study medication according to the study protocol, induction of anaesthesia was done for all patients by pre-oxygenation, intravenous propofol (1&#x02013;2 mg/kg) followed by fentanyl (1&#x02013;2 &#x003bc;g/kg) IV and atracurium 0.5 mg/kg IV as a bolus dose over 30 s. After tracheal intubation, anaesthesia was maintained with 50% oxygen in air, sevoflurane (1%&#x02013;3%), IV fentanyl infusion (1&#x02013;5 &#x003bc;g/kg/h) and IV atracurium (0.5 mg/kg/h IV to provide train-of-four count zero using peripheral nerve stimulator). The end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> was maintained between 30 and 35 mmHg. Nitroglycerine was added if needed to induce intraoperative hypotension. Propranolol or esmolol was added if there was intraoperative tachycardia. Patients with a heart rate below 50 bpm, were managed with a single dose of atropine 0.02 mg/kg IV. If mean arterial blood pressure decreased below 60 mmHg, it was managed with IV fluids (250&#x02013;500 over 5&#x02013;10 min according to the response) and a bolus dose of IV ephedrine (5&#x02013;10 mg) if needed. After successful resection of the tumour, a valsalva manoeuvre (by applying positive end-expiratory pressure 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and maintained for about 15 s) was done to test for a cerebrospinal fluid leak. After finishing the surgery, the study medications were stopped. After extubation, all patients were transferred to post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) for 4 h and monitored using the same monitors used intraoperatively. Nausea and vomiting were treated by intravenous metoclopramide. Pain was assessed using verbal rating scale (no pain = 0, mild = 1, moderate = 2 and severe = 3),[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and managed with a bolus dose of intravenous fentanyl (50&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;g). The patients were transferred to the ward according to the modified Aldrete score.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>The monitors used during anaesthesia included ECG, pulse oximetry, invasive blood pressure from the left radial artery cannula (systolic arterial pressure [SAP], diastolic and mean arterial pressure), temperature from oropharyngeal probe and end-tidal carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) every 5 min. The end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane, total dose of fentanyl and atracurium, emergence time, extubation time, duration of surgery and anaesthesia, and urine output were recorded. The arterial blood gases were done every 30 min to follow up the arterial partial pressure (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) of patients with sleep apnoea syndrome and to check the haemoglobin level. The degree of bleeding was assessed by Boezaart scale (to assess the extent of bleeding in the surgical field) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>],[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and the total amount of blood loss was assessed (by measuring the amount of blood in the in the suction bottle).

A pilot study was carried out before starting this study to assess the hypotensive effect and the incidence of bloodless field during the use of dexmedetomidine and magnesium sulphate in adult patients undergoing sulphate transsphenoidal resection of pituitary tumours. The results of the pilot study showed (18 cases in each group) that the incidence of the bloodless field was 45.5% in dexmedetomidine group and 24% in magnesium sulphate group. Taking power 0.8 and alpha error 0.05, a minimum sample size of 76 patients was calculated for each group.</p><p>Data were statistically described in terms of mean &#x000b1; standard deviation, or frequencies (number of cases), 95% confidence of interval of mean, median and percentages when appropriate. Comparison of numerical variables between the study groups was done using Student's <italic>t</italic>-test for independent samples. For comparing categorical data, Chi-square test was performed.

The decreased blood pressure led to decreased blood loss and good exposure of the surgical field in patients who received dexmedetomidine compared with magnesium. Furthermore, the requirements for intraoperative antihypertensive, fentanyl and sevoflurane were less with dexmedetomidine. The emergence and extubation times were shorter with dexmedetomidine than magnesium. The complications such as hypotension and bradycardia were higher with dexmedetomidine than magnesium, but not severe enough to causes haemodynamic instability, heart block or cardiac arrest. The bradycardia was managed with a small dose of atropine 0.02 mg/kg IV. The hypotension was managed with fluids and a small dose of ephedrine (5&#x02013;10 mg) if needed. The management of bradycardia and hypotension did not produce too much elevation in the heart rate, blood pressure or blood loss.</p><p>A study which included sixty patients undergoing transsphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma found that there was better surgical exposure due to minimal blood loss with dexmedetomidine as compared with the control group. The mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate throughout surgery were significantly lower with dexmedetomidine. The total dose of propofol maintenance dose and fentanyl were significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group than the control group.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>In a randomised study which included 46 patients to evaluate the effect of dexmedetomidine in elective transsphenoidal pituitary resection; it was found that heart rate and mean arterial pressure were significantly higher after intubation, during various stages of surgery and immediately after extubation in the control group compared with the dexmedetomidine group. Dexmedetomidine provided excellent surgical conditions and lesser bleeding than the control group. Emergence time and extubation time were significantly shorter with dexmedetomidine compared with the control group. The total fentanyl consumption during the study was significantly lower with dexmedetomidine than the control group (4.7 and 7.7 &#x003bc;g/kg, respectively; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). End-tidal isoflurane concentration requirement was found to be significantly reduced with dexmedetomidine compared with the control group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01).[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>One study evaluated the effects of dexmedetomidine on haemodynamic stability during intracranial tumour surgery in 54 patients. The study showed that dexmedetomidine decreased response to noxious stimuli, intubation and extubation, thus providing greater haemodynamic stability compared with placebo.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Another study compared dexmedetomidine and magnesium in patients undergoing functional endoscopic sinus surgery and found dexmedetomidine to be safe and more effective in inducing controlled hypotension, in decreasing blood loss and providing a good exposure of the surgical field than magnesium.

These side effects were managed by adding medications and fluids.</p><p>There are some limitations of the present study. It was done in a single centre, with a limited number of patients, and limited researchers talking about the same topics as the present study to discuss these findings in details. Therefore, we recommend other studies be done to compare the haemodynamic parameters and side effects of dexmedetomidine and magnesium on patients undergoing transnasal transsphenoidal pituitary surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Dexmedetomidine and magnesium are safe in patients undergoing transsphenoidal pituitary resection. Dexmedetomidine has advantages such as better control of blood pressure and heart rate, and provides better exposure of the surgical field with minimal blood loss compared to magnesium.
