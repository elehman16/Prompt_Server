Signed informed consent was obtained from all participants. A prospective study was conducted on 40 patients who presented to the Department of General Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Turgut &#x000d6;zal University, Ankara, Turkey scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy operation during a 10 month period from September 2012 to June 2013. The patients who were between 18 and 66 years old, without any chronic or acute lung disease, psychiatric and mental defects, and with a physical status of American Society of Anesthesiology I and II were enrolled in the study. Patients having uncontrolled hypertension, coronary artery disease, pulmonary disease or heart failure, those receiving immunosuppressive therapy, or having an illness, which may change the immunological state, patients having a body mass index over 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, scheduled for an operation due to acute cholecystitis, smokers, and those used steroids, nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs within the last 48 hours were excluded from the study. Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups; ventilation through ZEEP (0 cm H<sub>2</sub>O PEEP) (n=20), and PEEP (10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O PEEP) (n=20) using the closed envelope technique.</p><p>Electrocardiography (ECG), oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), and non-invasive blood pressure monitoring were performed in patients and anesthesia was induced with 3 mg/kg propofol, one &#x000b5;g/kg fentanyl and 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium. After intubation, considering optimum weights of the patients, volume-controlled mechanical ventilation (Datex-Ohmeda S/5 Avance, Madison, USA) was introduced with 8 ml/kg tidal volume (TV) as the inspirium expiration ratio (I/E) to be 1/2 and 12/minutes. Respiratory rate (RR) was adjusted as the end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> pressure (EtCO<sub>2</sub>) to be 35-40 mm Hg. Maintenance of anesthesia was achieved with 2% of sevoflurane in 50% O<sub>2</sub>, and 50% N<sub>2</sub>O. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), SpO2, peak airway pressure (P<sub>peak</sub>), TV, RR, minute ventilation (MV), and EtCO<sub>2</sub> pressure values of the patients were recorded at baseline after intubation with 10 minute intervals during the operation. The PEEP of 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>0 was applied when the mechanical ventilation was initiated in the PEEP group whereas; PEEP was not applied in the ZEEP group. All patients were administered pneumoperitoneum of 15 mm Hg using CO<sub>2</sub> gas. Patients in both groups with P<sub>peak</sub> exceeding 35 cm H<sub>2</sub>0 were planned to be excluded from the study by decreasing the TV or PEEP according to the lung protective strategy during the mechanical ventilation. Totally 2, 8 ml venous blood samples were collected from the patients, one before anesthesia induction, and other after the extubation. Blood samples were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes, and the obtained serums were kept at -800 until the cytokine analysis. The levels of IL 6, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL 10 and TGF-&#x003b2;1 were measured after collecting all the serums.</p><p>Once taken in accordance with the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations, TGF-&#x003b2;1 (Boster Biological Technology Co., Fremont, California, USA), TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, and IL-10 (DIAsource Immuno Assays S.A., Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium) tests were studied using the ELISA method. Following the testing, Bio Tec ELx800 ELISA was bic hromatically read at the reader as 450 nm, and 490 nm, and the outcomes were calculated.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 15 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Compliance of the variables with normal distribution was studied using histogram and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Descriptive statistics were expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation for the variables having normal distribution and median (minimum-maximum) for the variables having not normal distribution. Intergroup data were compared using Student&#x02019;s t or Mann-Whitney U test. Chi-square test was used for comparison of the qualitative data. Wilcoxon test was used for comparison of intergroup pre- and post-operative values. Two-way ANOVA and ANCOVA tests were used with correction to define the effect of hypertension on MAP. Effect of hypertension on the change of MAP over time was studied using repeated measurements variance analysis. Since it was seen that sphericity assumption was absent, Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied. <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 was considered as statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>Plasma cytokine levels of 30 patients were analyzed, and 10 patients were excluded from the study due to hemolysis.

No significant difference was found between the pre- and post-operative levels of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-10, and TGF-&#x003b2;1 in all patients, while we found that IL-6 levels were post-operatively increased. We did not observe a significant difference between the groups in terms of the pre- and post-operative cytokine measurements. While no significant change was found at the levels of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-10, and IL-6, post-operative TGF-&#x003b2;1 levels were found to be higher than the pre-operative levels in patients that underwent PEEP application.</p><p>Maracaj&#x000e1;-Neto et al<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> demonstrated that the application of 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O PEEP improved the elasticity and resistance of the respiratory system, and had beneficial effects on respiratory mechanics during pneumoperitoneum in the laparoscopic cholecystomy.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> We found similar effects of PEEP application on the lung mechanics in previous studies.</p><p>Laparoscopic cholecystectomies have been reported to cause fewer immune response compared with open cholecystectomy surgeries.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Similarly in our study, systemic immune response was not much prominent. In the study group, we observed a significant increase only in the post-operative IL-6 levels compared with the pre-operative levels among the measured levels of cytokines.</p><p>In an animal trial, Haitsma et al<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> concluded that ventilation strategy with PEEP application of 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O prevented ventilator-induced lung injury by markedly decreasing shift of the cytokines to the alveolar compartment. In an isolated rat lung model Tremblay et al<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> showed that fewer cytokine responses occurred with PEEP application of 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O compared than with groups with PEEP application of 0 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. In a study by Meier et al,<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> in order to clarify the effects of PEEP in the systemic and local immune mediator and modulator release in the healthy lungs, they investigated ZEEP and PEEP effects first in isolated rat lungs. According to the results from that study,<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> PEEP might decrease the cytokine release by reducing atelectrauma during the high inspiratory pressure application, as well as an increase in the cytokine release by increasing the pulmonary distension during the low inspiratory pressure application.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>In another study<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> investigating whether using low TV and PEEP application have a protective effect from inflammation on the patients undergoing elective surgery, we found similar results for IL-6 as in our study. While the levels of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-a and 1-&#x003b2; were not affected by the mechanical ventilation in bronchoalveolar lavage, serum levels of IL-6 and IL-8 were increased with the mechanical ventilation, but no significant difference was found between both groups. Likewise, in our study we found the plasma IL-6 levels were increased in both groups and TGF- levels b1 in the PEEP group, but the difference was not statistically significant.</p><p>The TGF-&#x003b2;1 has a central role in the synthesis and degradation of the extracellular matrix collagens, and it is produced by numerous cells, especially by macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and platelets.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Recent studies have demonstrated the dual effect of TGF-&#x003b2;1 on the regulation cellular response in the apoptosis induced by Fas/Fas ligand (a membrane protein, which main function is to trigger apoptosis). Dhainaut et al<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> concluded that TGF-&#x003b2;1 was not only effective in the late periods, but also in the early periods of ARDS, and potentially might contribute to the development of pulmonary edema. The authors proposed that integrin-induced local activation of TGF-&#x003b2;1 was quite important in the development of pulmonary edema in ARDS, and blockage, or activation of TGF-&#x003b2;1 might be effective in treating this disease.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> When post-operative levels of TGF-&#x003b2;1were compared with the pre-operative values, we found these values to be significantly higher in the PEEP group. However, although there was a difference between the PEEP and ZEEP groups in terms of the levels of TGF-&#x003b2;1 in the post-operative values, this difference was not statistically significant. Inflammation is an event, which begins and progresses locally, and it seems difficult to detect it in the serum samples.</p><p>In conclusion, in this study we found that PEEP application of 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O PEEP has no effect on the serum levels of cytokines compared with the groups in which PEEP was not applied in laparoscopic cholecystectomies with pneumoperitoneum application. Therefore, we believe that given its positive effect on the respiratory functions, PEEP of 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O would be applied in the laparoscopic cholecystectomy operations without worrying about cytokine activation.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>
