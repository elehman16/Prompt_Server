To prevail over microbial drug resistant, researchers are looking forward for the development of alternative and novel drugs in pursuit to discover new antibacterial agents.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Plants are in use as medicinal resource since prehistoric age. Plants contain loads of biologically active molecules with diverse medicinal properties. The traditional and folk medicinal system uses the plant products for the treatment of various infectious diseases.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Plant-produced compounds are of more interest in recent past as they are a source of safe and more effective substitutes against the synthetically produced antimicrobial agents.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The World Health Organization has estimated that about 80% of people living in various Asian and African countries still rely on medicines derived from plant products for some part of their major health care needs. Utilizing the healing powers of plants is an ancient idea, more so in India. At present, 25%&#x02013;50% of all pharmaceuticals dispensed around the world are of plant origin, and only few among them have been used as antimicrobials.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Dental caries is a familiar microbial disease affecting humans. It is an infectious, chronic disease of multifaceted etiology resulting in destruction of tooth structure by acid produced by microorganisms found in dental plaque, leading to early loss of tooth structure in children and young adult.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] It has been established that cariogenic microorganisms, especially <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>, play a decisive role in the pathogenesis of dental caries as it is involved in the initiation of almost all carious lesions of enamel.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Research in the field of caries prevention has been focusing on ways of reducing or totally eliminating cariogenic microflora from the oral cavity. Numerous studies have shown that caries can be prevented by regular toothbrushing and flossing. Nevertheless, most of the studies have revealed that it is difficult to eliminate <italic>S. mutans</italic> from pits, fissures, and proximal surfaces by mechanical means alone. Consequently for effective caries control, these methods should be combined with the chemotherapeutic agents.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The use of broad-spectrum antimicrobial mouth rinses as an additive to patient's oral hygiene and in delivery of active agents to teeth and gums has assumed greater importance with the recognition that most individuals are unable to maintain sufficient oral hygiene with mechanical means alone.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>The bisbiguanide chlorhexidine is considered as the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; in anticariogenicity, and has been researched at wide span. It is currently the most potent chemotherapeutic agent in use against <italic>S. mutans</italic>. It has bactericidal activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Another mouth rinse Listerine is a product which is about 115 years old and is also a broad-spectrum antiseptic mouth rinse, whose active ingredients are the four essential oils, namely, thymol, menthol, eucalyptol, and methyl salicylate. Listerine is also extremely effective against a wide range of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms, commonly found in dental caries.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] These two mouth rinses chlorhexidine and Listerine are widely used as chemotherapeutic agents in plaque control; even then, the incidence of dental care is high. Furthermore, these being modern medicines, it has its own side effects such as altered taste perception, metallic taste, alcohol content, staining of teeth, and many others. All of which is leading to its nonfavorable among many individuals.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Consequently, the onus is on researchers to come up with robust, novel, effective, feasible, and newer strategies to manage this disease.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] One such strategy would be to verify the colossal wealth of medicinal plants. <italic>Calotropis gigantea</italic> is a traditional medicinal plant belonging to the family of &#x0201c;Asclepiadaceous,&#x0201d; habitat of Asian countries that includes India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, China, and others, and it is bestowed with enormous medicinal property.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] There are reports of tribal people using this plant parts to cure numerous illnesses such as toothache, earache, sprain, anxiety, pain, epilepsy, diarrhea, and mental disorders.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The root bark of this plant is used as medicine in the treatment of leprosy, piles, wounds, tumors, parasitic infections, and dysentery. In literature, it was also reported that alcoholic root extract of <italic>C. gigantea</italic> showed analgesic, anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and sedative effect in albino rats.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Literature review reveals that no studies have been conducted to assess the antimicrobial activity of <italic>C. gigantea</italic> against <italic>S. mutans</italic>. As researches related to herbal mouth rinses are scarce and as clinicians, we are at cross road when patient seek our opinion about such herbal mouth rinses. There is a need for research in this area to generate the requisite evidence to proclaim the helpfulness of these herbal products.</p><p>Hence, the current study was conducted with an aim to assess and compare the effect of <italic>C. gigantea</italic> extract mouth rinse, 0.2% chlorhexidine mouth rinse and Listerine mouth rinse individually on salivary <italic>S. mutans</italic> level on 14&#x02013;15 years schoolchildren of Jaipur.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design and population</title><p>The present <italic>in vivo</italic>, experimental, crossover study (within participants utilizing Latin square design) was conducted among selected school children aged between 14 and 15 years.

The containers were then directly transported to the oral pathology laboratory, where it was processed straight away.</p><p>Using a stirrer, the collected saliva sample was manually stirred and homogenized. Hundred microliter of this saliva sample was diluted with 1 ml of normal saline (1:10 dilution). Using an inoculation loop (2 mm inner diameter), 5 &#x003bc;l of the 1:10 diluted saliva sample was streaked on a mitis salivarius-bacitracin agar (MSB) which is the selective medium for <italic>S. mutans</italic>. The MSB agar plates were then incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 48 h in an atmosphere consisting of 95% nitrogen and 5% carbon dioxide. After the incubation period of 48 h, <italic>S. mutans</italic> appeared on the culture plate as small, rough, raised, and adherent colonies. Those colonies which were atypical were further confirmed by mannitol and sorbitol test. Electronic colony counter was used for counting of colonies.

From the beginning of civilization, human beings have worshiped plants and such plants are conserved as inherited resources and were used as food, fodder, fiber, fertilizer, fuel, and febrifuge and in every other way possible.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In modern days, medicinal plants are being probed and explored as an alternate resource to get therapeutic compounds based on their medicinal properties.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] C. Gigantea is one such plant with many therapeutic principles and other economic values.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>In ancient ayurvedic medicine, the plant <italic>C. gigantea</italic> is known as &#x0201c;Sweet Arka.&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] <italic>C. gigantea</italic> is a traditional medicinal plant; it belongs to the family of <italic>Asclepiadaceous</italic> habitat of Asian countries. The plant grows up to 2&#x02013;4.5 m long. It has light green leaves and milky stem. The leaves are very much tender in nature.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] <italic>C. gigantea</italic> is scientifically acknowledged for its cytotoxic, antipyretic, antimicrobial, and wound healing properties. <italic>C. gigantea</italic> has been medicinally used to treat ailment such as fevers, cough, cold, nausea, vomiting, rheumatism, indigestion, eczema, asthma, elephantiasis, leprosy, and diarrhea.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Microorganisms are the foremost etiologic agents of numerous medically important infectious diseases occurring in man and animals. Dental caries is one such dreaded microbial infectious disease occurring in oral cavity on the hard surfaces of teeth and predominantly affecting all the populations of the world.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Researchers have confirmed that teeth are demineralized when they are exposed to salivary bacteria and carbohydrates <italic>in vivo</italic>. <italic>S. mutans</italic> constitutes a majority of the total bacteria present in dental caries samples.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Reducing their levels in the oral cavity would provide a rationale for the prevention of dental caries. Mouth rinses obtained from artificial products are extensively used as adjuncts to oral hygiene and in the delivery of active agents to the teeth and gums. The ability of these rinses to influence plaque formation and to alter the course of gingival inflammation has been studied at length.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Natural products of plant origins have shown to possess abundant pharmacological properties such as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and cytostatic effects, and they are been used as folk medicine throughout the world since ancient times. The presence of bioactive compounds comprising saponins, tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, and many others is attributed for their effectiveness against microorganisms.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] <italic>C. gigantea</italic> is one such plant; it is drought resistant, saline tolerant to a fairly high degree, grows natural all over the world. Various parts of this plant encompass an immense potential ability in treating a wide range of diseases and disorders. Its phytochemical components constitute alkaloids, tannins, flavonoids, terpenoids, amino acids, saponins, steroids, cardiac glycosides, and many more.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Tannins form irreversible complexes with proline-rich protein 33 resulting in the inhibition of cell protein synthesis. Alkaloids are one of the largest groups of phytochemicals in plants; they have remarkable effects on decreasing pain perception in humans; this has led to the development of powerful painkiller medications. Flavonoids, another constituent, exhibits a wide range of biological activities such as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antiallergic, cytostatic, and antioxidant properties.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>The present study was designed to evaluate the anticariogenic efficacy of natural product of plant <italic>C. gigantea</italic> extract in mouth rinse form against salivary <italic>S. mutans</italic> and compare with two other commonly use artificial mouth rinses 0.2% chlorhexidine and Listerine.

Furthermore, researches should be directed on various other herbs that can possess significant antimicrobial properties which can be developed as effective cariostatic agents.</p><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Karthik</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Rao</surname><given-names>KV</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Antibacterial activity of aqueous extract of <italic>Calotropis gigantea</italic> leaves &#x02013; An <italic>in vitro</italic> study</article-title><source>Int J Pharm Sci Rev Res</source><year>2010</year><volume>4</volume><fpage>141</fpage><lpage>4</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Karthik</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Rao</surname><given-names>KV</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Antimicrobial activity of latex of <italic>Calotropis gigantea</italic> against pathogenic microorganisms &#x02013; An <italic>in vitro</italic> study</article-title><source>Pharmacol Online</source><year>2010</year><volume>3</volume><fpage>155</fpage><lpage>63</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hemalatha</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Arirudran</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Thenmozhi</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Rao</surname><given-names>US</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Antimicrobial effect of separate extract of acetone, ethyl acetate, methanol and aqueous from leaf of milkweed (<italic>Calotropis gigantea</italic>)</article-title><source>Asian J Pharm Res</source><year>2011</year><volume>1</volume><fpage>102</fpage><lpage>7</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bharathi</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Krishnan</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Ravi</surname><given-names>TK</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Anti bacterial activity of leaf extracts of <italic>Calotropis gigantea</italic> linn. against certain Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria</article-title><source>Int J Chem Sci</source><year>2011</year><volume>9</volume><fpage>919</fpage><lpage>23</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Agarwal</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Nagesh</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Murlikrishnan.
