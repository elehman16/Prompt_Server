Levocetirizine is classified as a second generation antihistamine and is available for the treatment of allergic disorders, such as allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria<sup><xref rid="C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. The antihistaminic activity of cetirizine is primarily due to levocetirizine<sup><xref rid="C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, which has high affinity and selective antagonistic activity against histamine (H<sub>1</sub>) receptors and inhibits eosinophil chemotaxis<sup><xref rid="C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. A large number of clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy, tolerability, long-term safety, and patient satisfaction of levocetirizine<sup><xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref></sup>. Levocetirizine has been reported to be rapidly and extensively absorbed following oral administration of levocetirizine 5&#x02009;mg and 10&#x02009;mg as a tablet formulation in healthy Japanese male subjects, where time to reach the maximum concentration (<italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub>) was achieved between 0.8&#x02013;1&#x02009;h after administration and declined with the terminal half-life (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>) of 7.3&#x02013;7.6 h<sup><xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Levocetirizine is eliminated predominantly by renal excretion, with limited metabolism<sup><xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.</p><p>Levocetirizine is available only as a 5&#x02009;mg oral tablet and is used in adults and children aged 7&#x02013;14 years in Japan while cetirizine dry syrup (DS) has been marketed since 2009 and has proven a preferred dosage form for children below the age of 6 years<sup><xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. When used in pediatric patients under the age of 15 years with allergic disorders, a levocetirizine 5&#x02009;mg oral tablet must be divided in half. Due to the prevalence of allergic disorders in pediatric patients, a new formulation of second generation antihistamines that can be easily taken by pediatric patients is highly desirable, such as oral solution (OS) and DS<sup><xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>.</p><p>The objective of this study was to compare exposure to levocetirizine when given as levocetirizine OS 5&#x02009;mg and as cetirizine DS 10&#x02009;mg, the latter of which contains equal proportions of levocetirizine and dextrocetirizine, in healthy Japanese male subjects.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Subjects and methods</title><sec id="S0008-S2001" disp-level="2"><title>Subjects</title><p>The key inclusion criteria were as follows: age 20&#x02013;55 years with body mass index (BMI) in the range 18.5&#x02013;24.9&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and good general health as determined by medical history, clinical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram (12-lead ECG) and clinical laboratory tests.

Eligible subjects were allocated to one of two groups. Each participant received one treatment of either levocetirizine OS 5&#x02009;mg or cetirizine DS 10&#x02009;mg under fasting conditions and received the alternate treatment after a 7-days washout period. Ten milliliters of levocetirizine 0.5&#x02009;mg/mL oral solution (lot no. 623C22, GlaxoSmithKline K.K., Japan) containing 5&#x02009;mg of levocetirizine was administered with 140&#x02009;mL of water. 0.8&#x02009;g of cetirizine dry syrup 1.25% (lot no. 623C21, GlaxoSmithKline K.K., Japan) containing 10&#x02009;mg of cetirizine was dissolved in 100&#x02009;mL of water, and was administered with 50&#x02009;mL of water. All participants stayed at the unit until the completion of pharmacokinetic and safety assessments 48&#x02009;h post-dose, and returned to the unit 7 days after the second dose for follow-up assessment.</p><p>The study was undertaken at CPC Clinical Trial Hospital, Medipolis Medical Research Institute (Kagoshima, Japan) in compliance with the Good Clinical Practice Guidelines after the protocol was approved by CPC Clinical Trial Hospital Institutional Review Board.

Plasma samples were prepared within 60&#x02009;min of blood collection and kept frozen below &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until analysis. Levocetirizine concentrations in plasma were determined by using an LC-MS/MS method validated at Shin Nippon Biomedical Laboratories, Ltd (Japan) based on a previously reported method<sup><xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> with slight modification: less plasma volume and different calibration range.

Extracts were analyzed by an LC-MS/MS system (API3000, AB Sciex, Japan) using an APCI interface and multiple reaction monitoring, and transition mass for levocetirizine and internal standard were 389.1&#x02013;201.1 and 397.2&#x02013;201.1, respectively. The calibration range was 2&#x02013;1000&#x02009;ng/mL with 1/x weighted linear regression, and the correlation of coefficient of the curves were greater than 0.9900.

The area under the plasma concentration-time curve from dosing until 48&#x02009;h post-dose (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;48</sub>) was calculated with the linear trapezoidal rule.

The plasma levocetirizine concentration profiles were similar following administration of both preparations. Levocetirizine was absorbed rapidly and subsequently declined steadily with comparable <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> values following administration of levocetirizine 5&#x02009;mg OS and cetirizine DS 10&#x02009;mg. The 90% CIs for the geometric mean ratios of the plasma levocetirizine AUC<sub>0&#x02013;48</sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> were 1.024&#x02013;1.094 and 0.968&#x02013;1.091, which were within the range &#x02018;0.80&#x02013;1.25&#x02019; as required to declare bioequivalence in Japanese Guideline for Bioequivalence Studies of Generic Products<sup><xref rid="C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Thus, levocetirizine exposure in plasma of the healthy Japanese male subjects following a single oral administration of levocetirizine OS 5&#x02009;mg was equivalent to that following cetirizine DS 10&#x02009;mg, suggesting that the pharmacological effects and clinical efficacy of levocetirizine administered as levocetirizine OS 5&#x02009;mg are similar to those when administered as cetirizine DS 10&#x02009;mg. A study in non-Japanese male and female healthy subjects<sup><xref rid="C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> identified statistically significant differences in dose adjusted pharmacokinetic parameters for levocetirizine between male and female subjects, but concluded the discussion by saying that the differences are of no clinical relevance. Although the pharmacokinetics of levocetirizine in females was not investigated in this study, it is unlikely that any clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters would be observed between Japanese males and females.</p><p>In a previous report<sup><xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, pharmacokinetics after oral administration of levocetirizine 5&#x02009;mg and 10&#x02009;mg were investigated in healthy Japanese male subjects. Mean <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> value was 232.6&#x02009;ng/mL and achieved within 1.0&#x02009;h (median) after dosing of a levocetirizine 5&#x02009;mg tablet. Mean <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> of levocetirizine from the 5&#x02009;mg tablet was 7.3 h and mean AUC<sub>0&#x02013;48</sub> value was 1791.5&#x02009;ng.h/mL. The pharmacokinetic results in this study are consistent with the findings in the previous study with Japanese subjects. In view of the levocetirizine investigations<sup><xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> previously published for clinical safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and satisfaction scores by patients and physicians, levocetirizine OS is a promising, and one of the suitable treatment options for pediatric patients who currently must divide a tablet to relieve the histamine-mediated symptoms associated with allergic disorders.</p><p>No AE or clinically significant finding in clinical laboratory tests was reported during the study.
