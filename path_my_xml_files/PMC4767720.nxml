The active metabolite of fostamatinib, R406, is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The aim of this study was to characterize hepatic microsomal metabolism of R406 and confirm the role of CYP3A4 in R406 metabolism, determining whether co-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors (ketoconazole, verapamil) or inducers (rifampicin) affects R406 pharmacokinetics.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>R406 stability was determined using human hepatic microsomes. The CYP450 isoforms responsible for R406 metabolism in humans were identified using expressed CYP450 isoforms and specific chemical inhibitors. The ketoconazole interaction study (double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-period crossover) involved fostamatinib administration (single 80-mg dose), alone and with ketoconazole (200&#x000a0;mg twice daily). The verapamil and rifampicin interaction studies (open-label, two-period, fixed-sequence) involved fostamatinib administration (single 150-mg dose), alone and with immediate-release verapamil (80&#x000a0;mg three times daily) or rifampicin (600&#x000a0;mg once daily). Standard pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated in all studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Results/Discussion</title><p>Hepatic microsomes showed time-dependent loss of R406 and formation of para-O-demethylated R406. Microsomal metabolism of R406 was markedly inhibited by CYP3A4 inhibitors and, in the expressed CYP450 studies, the rate of R406 disappearance was greatest with CYP3A4. In the clinical studies, co-administration of ketoconazole caused a 2-fold (CI 1.77&#x02013;2.30) increase in R406 exposure. Verapamil increased R406 exposure (39&#x000a0;% increase, CI 8&#x02013;80), whereas rifampicin co-administration decreased exposure by 75&#x000a0;% (CI 68&#x02013;81). Fostamatinib was well tolerated.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The oxidative metabolism of R406 is predominantly catalyzed by CYP3A4. In clinical studies, exposure to R406 is affected by concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inducers/inhibitors. These findings should be taken into account when considering co-prescription of fostamatinib with such agents.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004325</institution-id><institution>AstraZeneca</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="FPar1"><title>Key Points</title><p><table-wrap id="Taba"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left">The oxidative metabolism of R406 (the active metabolite of fostamatinib/R788) is predominantly catalyzed by CYP3A4.</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Exposure to R406 is affected by concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inducers/inhibitors; co-administration of ketoconazole caused a 2-fold increase in R406 exposure, verapamil increased R406 exposure by 39&#x000a0;%, and rifampicin co-administration decreased exposure by 75&#x000a0;%.</td></tr><tr><td align="left">The findings from these studies should be taken into account when considering co-prescription of fostamatinib with such agents.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fostamatinib (previously known as R788) is an orally dosed spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] that has completed phase III clinical trials as a therapy for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients who have shown inadequate response to traditional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs or parenteral tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; antagonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Fostamatinib is a prodrug that is metabolized to its active metabolite, R406, by intestinal alkaline phosphatase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. R406 undergoes both direct glucuronidation and CYP3A4-mediated para-O-demethylation to form the major metabolite, R529 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. R788 and R529 are much less active against syk than R406. Subsequent O-demethylations and dehydroxylation of R529 by gut bacteria lead to formation of the major excretory metabolite of R406, 3,5-benzene diol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Activity of CYP3A4 is therefore integral to the metabolism of fostamatinib. Drugs can alter the activity of CYP3A4, acting either as inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole [potent inhibitor], verapamil [moderate inhibitor]) or inducers (e.g. rifampicin [potent inducer]). These drugs may therefore alter the pharmacokinetics of any co-administered drug that is metabolized by this enzyme. Given the increased risk of co-morbidities for patients with RA, polypharmacy is commonly required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The variety of concomitant medications may often include inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4.</p><p>We report here the results of a series of in vitro studies designed to characterize the hepatic microsomal metabolism of R406 and to confirm the role of CYP3A4 in the metabolism of fostamatinib. We also performed clinical studies in which the CYP3A4 inhibitors ketoconazole (a potent inhibitor) and verapamil (a moderate inhibitor) and the CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin were co-administered with fostamatinib to healthy subjects to assess the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions. This was also intended to determine if any changes in the fostamatinib dose regimen would be needed if fostamatinib was co-administered with any of these three compounds in clinical practice. Ketoconazole, verapamil, and rifampicin are regarded as prototypical CYP3A4 modulators and are typically used in drug interaction studies that aim to determine the effect of CYP3A4 modulation on drug pharmacokinetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>In Vitro Experiments</title><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials</title><p>Human hepatic microsomes were obtained from Xenotech (Lenexa, KS, USA) and expressed CYP1A2, CYP2C9*1 +OR, CYP2C19 +OR, CYP2E1+OR+ cytochrome b5, CYP2D6*1+OR, and CYP3A4 +OR were purchased from Gentest (Woburn, MA, USA). The designation &#x02018;+OR&#x02019; signifies that the preparation contained supplemental, cDNA-expressed cytochrome P450 reductase. Ketoconazole, dextromethorphan, dextrorphan, diclofenac, phenacetin, acetamidophenol, testosterone, 6-&#x003b2;-hydroxy-testosterone, midazolam, quinidine, sulfaphenazole, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) were acquired from Sigma Chemical Co (St Louis, MO, USA).

Metabolic reactions were initiated by addition of the NADPH solution and stopped at 0, 15, 30, and 50&#x000a0;min. R406 concentrations were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography, followed by mass spectrometry in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode.</p><p>Metabolites were determined following incubation of 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M R406 with human hepatic microsomes (1&#x000a0;mg protein/mL). Reactions were terminated after 15&#x000a0;min. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation and 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of the supernatant was analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry with ultraviolet (254&#x000a0;nm) detection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Metabolic Phenotyping</title><p>Studies using expressed CYP450 isoforms and specific chemical inhibitors were performed to identify the CYP450 isoforms responsible for metabolism of R406 in humans. The chemical CYP450 inhibitors were ketoconazole (1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M, CYP3A4), troleandomycin (100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M, CYP3A4), furafylline (10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M, CYP1A2), quinidine (10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M, CYP2D6), sulfaphenazole (10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M, CYP2C9), and 3-<italic>N</italic>-benzylnirvanol (5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M, CYP2C19). Incubation conditions for these microsomal metabolism studies were similar to those described above. All inhibitors were added in 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of methanol. Because of the time-dependent inactivation of CYP450 produced by furafylline and troleandomycin, these inhibitors were pre-incubated with the microsomes and NADPH for 15&#x000a0;min prior to addition of R406. Reactions were terminated at 0, 15, 30, and 50&#x000a0;min and R406 concentrations were determined by mass spectrometry in MRM mode. First-order rate constants for R406 disappearance were calculated by linear regression using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA) and comparisons were made using these values.</p><p>For the expressed CYP450 studies, 20&#x000a0;pmol of CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2D6*1, CYP2C19, CYP2C9*1, or CYP2E1 were added in place of the hepatic microsomes. All phenotyping reactions were terminated at 0, 15, 30, and 50&#x000a0;min and analyzed by mass spectrometry in MRM mode. Rate calculations were based on the amount of R406 lost at the 15-min time point.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Clinical Studies</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Subject Populations</title><p>Healthy male subjects aged 18&#x02013;45&#x000a0;years with a body mass index (BMI) between 19 and 28&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> were eligible for enrollment in the ketoconazole study (C-935788-001).

As CYP3A4 is involved in the metabolism of a substantial percentage (30&#x02013;50&#x000a0;%) of drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] (including R406, the active metabolite of fostamatinib), it is important to establish whether concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors affects the pharmacokinetics of fostamatinib or R406.</p><p>The in vitro work reported in this paper has demonstrated that R406 can be metabolized by an NADPH-dependent process, that CYP3A4 plays a major role in the oxidative metabolism of R406, and that the primary route of hepatic microsomal metabolism of R406 is para-O-demethylation. These findings concur with results obtained by Sweeny et al., who demonstrated that R406 undergoes both direct glucuronidation and CYP3A4-mediated para-O-demethylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The product of O-demethylation&#x02014;the major metabolite of R406&#x02014;is designated R529 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. R529 is further metabolized to a 3,5-benzene diol metabolite, which is the major fecal metabolite of fostamatinib in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It is therefore evident that CYP3A4 plays an important role in the metabolism of R406. The only other isoform that was found to metabolize R406 in the current study was CYP2C9. However, hepatic microsomal levels of CYP3A4 are on average 5-fold higher than those of CYP2C9 (101.5&#x000a0;pmol/mg vs 18&#x000a0;pmol/mg) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It can therefore be estimated that CYP3A4 accounts for &#x0003e;96&#x000a0;% of total CYP450 oxidative metabolism of R406 in human liver.</p><p>This in vitro work is supported by the results of the three clinical studies that explored the clinical relevance of CYP3A4 activity in fostamatinib-treated subjects, using agents that are typically used to determine the effects of CYP3A4 modulation on drug pharmacokinetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The studies reported herein indicate that ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, is associated with a 2-fold increase in exposure to R406 after administration of fostamatinib. It is likely that this ketoconazole-induced increase in R406 exposure is mediated via inhibition of CYP3A4 metabolism. However, based on the definitions in the current US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], R406 would not be considered a &#x0201c;sensitive substrate&#x0201d; of CYP3A. This designation is reserved for substrates that show &#x02265;5-fold increase in exposure in response to co-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Since completion of this study, the FDA has recommended that clarithromycin or itraconazole be used as an alternative strong CYP3A in drug interaction studies, rather than ketoconazole, to reduce the risk of liver injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>The effect on R406 pharmacokinetics by verapamil, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, was less marked than that of ketoconazole. However, there were still increases in AUC and <italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;</sub> of approximately 50&#x000a0;%, although no consistent effect on <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub> was observed with verapamil co-administration. Co-administration of the CYP3A4 inducer, rifampicin, was associated with reductions of approximately 75&#x000a0;% in R406 AUC and 60&#x000a0;% in R406 <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>. This reduction in R406 exposure was associated with a decrease in <italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;</sub> and a shortening of median <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub>. Previous work has shown that rifampicin acts as an inducer of uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A9-mediated glucuronidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and it is therefore possible that glucuronidation of R406 was also increased by co-administration of rifampicin. It is possible that ketoconazole, verapamil and rifampicin altered expression or activity of protein transporters including P-glycoprotein that may have contributed to the interactions observed.</p><p>These studies have demonstrated that pharmacokinetic interactions occur when fostamatinib is administered in combination with ketoconazole, verapamil, and rifampicin. It is possible that the decrease in fostamatinib exposure associated with rifampicin co-administration may lead to a decrease in efficacy. This should be taken into account when considering co-prescription of fostamatinib with such agents. It is a recognized limitation of the clinical studies performed that they are single dose studies that provide indicative pharmacokinetic DDI potential but may not fully characterize the DDI risk or safety in the patient population. As ketoconazole has been withdrawn in some territories, it may not be considered as an ideal potent CYP3A4 inhibitor probe but we believe the data do provide useful information to assess DDI risk through this mechanism.</p><p>No new safety concerns were documented during these three clinical studies. It is acknowledged, however, that these studies all involved administration of a single dose of fostamatinib to a small number of subjects&#x02014;a design that is typical of DDI studies, but which is unable to explore the effects of long-term doubling of R406 exposure in humans.</p><p>It is unlikely that the difference among studies in fostamatinib formulation (ketoconazole study: suspension in orange juice; verapamil and rifampicin studies: tablets) affected the bioavailability of fostamatinib. Moreover, as no direct comparisons were made among the three studies, any difference in bioavailability would not affect the conclusions of each individual study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The in vitro work presented herein has confirmed that the primary route of hepatic microsomal metabolism for R406 is O-demethylation and that oxidative metabolism of R406 is predominantly catalyzed by CYP3A4. The studies presented in this paper demonstrate that metabolism of, and exposure to, R406 (the active metabolite of fostamatinib) is affected by concomitant administration of the stated CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers. Ketoconazole and verapamil increased exposure to R406 after administration of fostamatinib, probably via inhibition of CYP3A4-mediated metabolism. In contrast, R406 exposure was decreased after co-administration of the CYP3A4 inducer, rifampicin. It is likely that this was caused by induction of CYP3A4-mediated metabolism. Overall, fostamatinib was well tolerated when administered alone or in combination with CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers. These findings should be taken into account when considering co-prescription of fostamatinib with such agents.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was sponsored by AstraZeneca.
