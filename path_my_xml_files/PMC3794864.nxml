Given that patients with cardiovascular disease are advised to reduce dietary fat intake, potentially lowering the bioavailability and therapeutic benefit, the hypothesis that FFA forms provide for higher bioavailability compared with EE forms under low-fat diet conditions was tested where the pharmacokinetics of the FFA form (Epanova&#x02122;) were compared with those of an ethyl ester form (Lovaza&#x000ae;) following repeat dosing. Fifty-two healthy male and female subjects were equally allocated to one of two open-label, parallel-group cohorts. Following a Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes diet for a minimum of 7 days, blood samples were drawn for endogenous values for EPA and DHA over a 24-hour period. Subjects were then administered 4 &#x000d7; 1 g capsules of either Epanova (OM3 FFA) or Lovaza (OM3 EE) once daily for 14 days, following which serial blood samples were drawn over a 24-hour period to characterize the bioavailability of EPA and DHA from the respective formulations. In addition, changes from baseline in lipid profile were explored. Systemic bioavailability, as measured by area under the curve from time zero to 24 hours (AUC<sub>0-&#x003c4;</sub>) and the maximum measured plasma concentrations during the 0&#x02013;24 hour dosing interval (C<sub>max,ss</sub>) of unadjusted total plasma EPA + DHA were approximately 3-fold and 3.9-fold higher, respectively, for Epanova relative to Lovaza. Following baseline adjustment, the magnitude of difference in bioavailability was approximately 5.8-fold and 6.5-fold higher in AUC<sub>0-&#x003c4;</sub> and C<sub>max</sub>, respectively, for Epanova relative to Lovaza. Serum triglycerides were reduced by a significantly greater extent (<italic>P</italic> = 0.013) for Epanova relative to Lovaza (21% versus 8%). The bioavailability of the FFA forms of EPA and DHA in Epanova are significantly greater than the bioavailability from the EE forms present in Lovaza under low-fat dietary conditions normally recommended for patients with cardiovascular disease. This increased bioavailability may lead to improved triglyceride-lowering in patients with hypertriglyceridemia.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>hypertriglyceridemia</kwd><kwd>eicosapentaenoic acid</kwd><kwd>docosahexaenoic acid</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Hypertriglyceridemia is increasing in the US and throughout the world with an estimated prevalence of four million Americans meeting the definition of severe hypertriglyceridemia (&#x02265;500 mg/dL).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-vhrm-9-563">1</xref> The risk of pancreatitis is clinically significant in severe hypertriglyceridemia, and actions to prevent acute pancreatitis are warranted.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-vhrm-9-563">2</xref> Clinical guidelines for management of severe hypertriglyceridemia recommend that the patient be admitted to hospital, if symptomatic, to secure a careful follow-up of the patient&#x02019;s triglyceride values.

The hypothesis being tested was that the EPA and DHA delivered in the OM3 FFA product (Epanova) would produce higher blood levels of EPA, DHA, and EPA + DHA than those from the comparator OM3 EE product (Lovaza&#x000ae; GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA), which would provide evidence to support greater EPA and DHA bioavailability from the free fatty acid formulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design and procedures</title><p>This was an open-label, single-site investigation (Celerion Inc, Tempe, AZ, USA) to compare the relative oral bioavailability of unadjusted and baseline-adjusted total EPA, total DHA, and total EPA + DHA following repeated dose administration of Epanova compared with repeated dose administration of Lovaza. Additionally, comparisons of changes in lipids between Epanova and Lovaza, and their relationship to plasma EPA + DHA, were evaluated in an exploratory manner. Another objective of this study was to assess the effects of repeated-dose Epanova on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single 25 mg dose of warfarin, the results of which will be reported in a separate publication.</p><p>Prior to the first procedure conducted on any subject, the ECLIPSE II protocol underwent review by the Celerion Institutional Review Board in compliance with US Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR 56) and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines, (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.ich.org">www.ich.org</ext-link>; ICHE6 Good Clinical Practice), and a signed informed consent form was obtained from all subjects, who were informed of their right to withdraw from the study at any time. The study was conducted according to Good Clinical Practice and in accordance with the ethical requirements referred to in the European Union directive 2001/20/EC and the principles enunciated in the Declaration of Helsinki (Seoul, 2008).</p><p>Within 28 days prior to receiving the first dose of investigational product, medical history and demographic data (including name, sex, age, race, and tobacco use) were recorded. Each of the 52 subjects enrolled received a physical examination, including complete vital signs and a 12-lead electrocardiogram. Laboratory screening tests included hematology, coagulation, serology, urinalysis, and clinical chemistry tests, which included a lipid panel for total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), and triglycerides.</p><p>The study employed an open-label, two-cohort, parallel design. In both cohorts (n = 26 per cohort), subjects received either 4 g (4 &#x000d7; 1 g) of Epanova or 4 g (4 &#x000d7; 1 g) of Lovaza once daily for 14 consecutive days. In terms of free fatty acid composition per 1 g capsule, the Epanova formulation was assayed as containing 550 mg EPA and 200 mg DHA, whereas the Lovaza was assayed to contain 465 mg EPA and 375 mg DHA. The ECLIPSE II study design is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-vhrm-9-563">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>Subjects in both cohorts were maintained on a low-fat diet throughout the entire study (from check-in [9 days prior to the first dose of Epanova or Lovaza] until release from confinement) consistent with the recommendations of the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC, National Cholesterol Education Program [NCEP] Adult Treatment Panel III) diet.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-vhrm-9-563">3</xref> They were also educated on, and requested to maintain, a constant diet with respect to vitamin K intake through study completion (vitamin K instruction started 2 weeks prior to the first dose). Subjects were confined in the clinical research unit from the evening before the first dose through to the final blood draw for pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic assessment and any end of study procedures. All food consumed after check-in was prepared by study staff under the supervision of a registered dietitian to ensure consistency with the TLC diet recommendations. The subjects received the same breakfast on all days where a breakfast was served; lunch, dinner, and snacks differed each day, but all meals were consistent between cohorts. Beginning approximately 30 minutes prior to each dose, a breakfast containing less than 10% of energy as fat was consumed daily. The breakfast consisted of one cup of oatmeal, one cup of fat-free milk, one quarter of a cup of raisins, one cup of honeydew melon, and one cup of calcium-fortified orange juice. Subjects were required to fast for a minimum of 10 hours overnight prior to the breakfast and continue to fast for at least 4 hours thereafter. The proportion of each consumed meal was recorded in the subject&#x02019;s case report form.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion/exclusion criteria</title><p>Non-tobacco-using males and/or females aged 18&#x02013;55 years and with a body mass index of 18&#x02013;29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were allowed to participate if they were considered medically healthy; defined as having no clinically significant abnormalities in terms of clinical chemistry laboratory values, electrocardiography, and physical examination results. Female patients assigned to the Epanova cohort were to be of non-childbearing potential due to the exposure to warfarin in this cohort. Non-childbearing potentia was defined as: having undergone a sterilization procedure at least 6 months prior to check-in, ie, basal tubal ligation, hysterectomy, hysterectomy with unilateral or bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral oophorectomy; or having been postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months prior to check-in, with a screening follicle-stimulating hormone level &#x0003e;40 mIU/dL. Female subjects assigned to the Lovaza cohort could be of childbearing potential, but had to remain sexually inactive or be using an appropriate method of contraception for the entire duration of the study. In addition to a willingness to comply with the prescribed TLC diet, subjects were not to have consumed fish oil or other EPA and/or DHA containing supplements within 2 months prior to study start.</p></sec><sec><title>Compliance and exposure</title><p>Epanova 1 g capsules containing a mixture of polyunsaturated free fatty acids were provided by Omthera Pharmaceuticals Inc. Lovaza 1 g capsules were sourced from a pharmacy wholesaler. All expiry dates were confirmed to be within the appropriate shelf-life throughout the entire study period. All investigational products were administered under the supervision of the principal investigator and clinical research staff to ensure compliance. All doses were administered with 240 mL of water, following which clinical staff performed hand and mouth checks of subjects to ensure the dose was completely swallowed. Subjects remained ambulatory or seated upright for the first 4 hours following dosing and were to avoid unusual, unaccustomed, or strenuous physical activity (eg, weightlifting, running, bicycling) from prestudy (screening) through study completion.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetic blood samples</title><p>For both the Epanova and Lovaza cohorts, samples (n = 7) for analysis of total EPA and DHA in plasma were collected for 24-hour baseline assessment prior to the first dose.

Lipoprotein lipid parameters were collected at screening, check-in, prior to the initial dose, and at the end of the dosing period or prior to release from the clinic or upon early withdrawal.</p><p>For both cohorts, the blood sample for total EPA and DHA analysis was drawn into 4 mL chilled evacuated tubes containing K2EDTA and stored at room temperature for up to 60 minutes until centrifugation. Plasma aliquots were placed in storage at &#x02212;&#x00fe0;80&#x000b0;C within 60 minutes of collection. Sample analysis for total EPA and total DHA in human plasma was performed at Cetero Research (Toronto, ON, Canada). Briefly, the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method employed deuterated forms of EPA and DHA as internal standards with linear ranges of 1&#x02013;200 &#x003bc;g/mL and 2&#x02013;400 &#x003bc;g/mL for EPA and DHA, respectively.

Serum lipoprotein lipid parameters reported included triglycerides, LDL-c, HDL-c, and non-HDL-c. Non-HDL-c was calculated as the difference between measured concentrations of total and HDL-c. LDL-c was calculated as non-HDL-c minus one fifth of the measured triglyceride concentration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Pharmacokinetic analysis</title><sec><title>Total EPA and DHA</title><p>Using noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis of the actual sample collection time, parameters were derived for the unadjusted and baseline-adjusted plasma total EPA, total DHA, and total EPA + DHA concentration-time data using WinNonlin&#x000ae; version 5.2 (Pharsight Corp, Mountainview, CA, USA), and SAS&#x000ae; version 9.1.3 (SAS&#x000ae; Drug Development Platform, version 3.4; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA), as appropriate.

Molar ratios were then used to calculate unadjusted total EPA + DHA concentrations in SAS&#x000ae; version 9.1.3 (SAS&#x000ae; Drug Development Platform, version 3.4).

All analyses of lipid parameters were performed using SAS&#x000ae; version 9.3. Percent change from baseline in lipid parameter levels after 2 weeks of dosing was summarized for each treatment cohort using all subjects. For each treatment cohort, baseline lipid levels were defined as the average of the values from 7 days prior to the day 1 dose and the day 1 predose value. For each lipid parameter, comparisons of percent change from baseline in lipid levels between the two treatment cohorts were performed using analysis of covariance with treatment cohort as a factor and baseline lipid value as a covariate in the model.

Baseline total EPA + DHA levels were defined as stated above for pharmacokinetic parameter calculations. End-of-treatment total EPA + DHA levels were defined as the average of three predose values from the 11th, 12th, and 13th day of dosing for both cohorts.

Fifty-two subjects entered the study and were assigned to one of the two study cohorts. Fifty-one subjects completed the study, with one subject having withdrawn for personal reasons following the fifth dose of Epanova. Baseline DHA levels of the women in both cohorts in this study were comparable (45&#x02013;50 &#x003bc;g/mL [Epanova cohort] and 47&#x02013;53 &#x003bc;g/mL [Lovaza cohort]). The average daily energy intake during the study was approximately 2,410 kcal, with approximately 16.6% (approximately 399 kcal) coming from protein, 61.7% (about 1,490 kcal) coming from carbohydrates, and 21.7% (about 523 kcal) coming from fat.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetic and statistics</title><p>Mean unadjusted plasma total EPA + DHA concentrations were similar prior to the first dose and markedly greater following repeat dosing with Epanova than with Lovaza from day 11 through to 24 hours following day 14 dosing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-vhrm-9-563">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>After 7 days following a TLC diet, subjects in both cohorts exhibited relatively similar baseline concentrations of total EPA + DHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-vhrm-9-563">Figure 2</xref>) with arithmetic mean concentrations ranging from 175&#x02013;197 nmol/mL and 172&#x02013;193 nmol/mL for Epanova and Lovaza, respectively, over a 24-hour interval. Following single daily doses of either Epanova or Lovaza for 14 days, the unadjusted total EPA + DHA C<sub>avg,ss</sub> in the Epanova cohort was approximately three-fold that of the Lovaza cohort, suggesting a substantially higher relative bio-availability of Epanova. When EPA, DHA, and EPA + DHA were corrected for endogenous EPA and DHA from dietary sources, the magnitude of the difference was even more apparent, with the greatest difference being evident in plasma EPA concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-vhrm-9-563">Figures 3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-vhrm-9-563">5</xref>).</p><p>Based on the coefficient of variation for the geometric mean pharmacokinetic parameters, when adjusting for baseline EPA, DHA, and EPA + DHA, the variability of Epanova was approximately half of that observed for Lovaza (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-vhrm-9-563">Table 3</xref>), suggesting that Epanova provides more consistent delivery of omega-3 fatty acids under low-fat dietary conditions. In terms of relative bioavailability (as measured by the geometric least-squares means for AUC<sub>0-&#x003c4;</sub>), Epanova resulted in approximately 733%, 309%, and 576% of the values for total EPA, DHA and EPA + DHA, respectively, compared with Lovaza (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-vhrm-9-563">Table 4</xref>). The magnitude of the difference can be better appreciated by considering the 90% confidence intervals of the geometric least-squares means ratios for the main measures of oral bioavailability (ie, AUC<sub>0-&#x003c4;</sub> and C<sub>max,ss</sub>), where, in all cases, the lower tail exceeded 200% and the upper tail ranged from 390% to greater than 1,000% (for total EPA C<sub>max,ss</sub>).

Although no formal assessment of dietary compliance was completed prior to the confinement, at baseline both treatment arms had similar levels of plasma total EPA + DHA. However, at steady-state after 14 days of repeat dosing, subjects receiving Epanova had substantially higher and less variable trough levels of unadjusted total EPA + DHA compared with Lovaza. These observations support the view that after repeated administration in conjunction with a low-fat diet, the absorption of OM3 EE is significantly lower than that of OM3 FFA. This is likely attributable to the reduced amount of pancreatic lipase released in response to a low-fat diet. In addition, after 14 days of repeat dosing in conjunction with a low-fat diet, the rate and extent of systemic exposure over the normal dosing interval was also significantly improved with Epanova compared with Lovaza (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-vhrm-9-563">Table 4</xref>).</p><p>In this 2-week study, the percent increases from baseline in plasma total EPA (253%) and DHA (41%) in the Lovaza cohort were consistent with the plasma changes in previous clinical trials with Lovaza that measured steady levels of omega-3 fatty acids. In nine previous Lovaza clinical studies in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, the range of percent change for EPA was 139%&#x02013;361% with a mean of 236% and for DHA the range was 10%&#x02013;77% with a mean of 36%. Therefore, the healthy volunteers on a low-fat diet in this trial in the Lovaza cohort had similar changes in omega-3 levels compared with patients with hypertriglyceridemia treated with Lovaza.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-vhrm-9-563">14</xref></p><p>Omega-3 fatty acids produce their triglyceride-lowering properties, at least in part, by acting on nuclear receptors in the liver.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-vhrm-9-563">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-vhrm-9-563">16</xref> Delivery of omega-3 fatty acids to the liver is dependent on their absorption through the intestines and subsequent incorporation into chylomicron particles. Chylomicron remnants are ultimately removed from the circulation by the liver, delivering EPA and DHA into hepatic tissues in addition to those that are taken up by the liver as free fatty acids released during triglyceride hydrolysis of lipoprotein and adipose triglycerides.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-vhrm-9-563">17</xref> In healthy subjects, plasma levels of total EPA + DHA are reliable markers of intestinal absorption and liver exposure, and higher total plasma levels of EPA and DHA are consistent with increased bioavailability, although the authors acknowledge that other methods such as tracer studies would be needed to directly demonstrate enhanced bioavailability. ECLIPSE II evaluated a 4 g/day dosage of an OM3 FFA and OM3 EE formulation. After 2 weeks of treatment, Epanova reduced triglycerides by 21%, which was significantly greater than the 8% reduction achieved with Lovaza <italic>(P</italic> = 0.013). This suggests that the increase in bioavailability associated with Epanova may lead to better triglyceride reductions when administered at equivalent dosages. This is also supported by the significant correlation <italic>(r</italic> = &#x02212;0.3240, <italic>P</italic> = 0.020) between the percent change in serum triglycerides and percent change in plasma total EPA + DHA.</p><p>The study population was mostly Hispanics who had low baseline levels of omega-3 fatty acid compared with those observed in other studies. Hispanics may have reduced levels of omega-3 due to a low fish intake, and a high prevalence of fatty acid desaturase gene polymorphism, which is associated with decreased conversion of short-chain to long-chain fatty acids.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-vhrm-9-563">18</xref> Approximately two thirds of Hispanics have the fatty acid desaturase polymorphism associated with decreased conversion of alpha-linolenic acid to EPA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-vhrm-9-563">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-vhrm-9-563">19</xref> However, fatty acid desaturase gene polymorphisms are unlikely to affect EPA and DHA absorption, and steady-state plasma levels of total EPA and DHA in the present study were similar to those observed in other studies where Epanova was used as a treatment for hypertriglyceridemia, suggesting that the present results are generalizable to other ethnic groups and to hypertriglyceridemic patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-vhrm-9-563">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-vhrm-9-563">21</xref> A potential limitation of this study was the use of a nonrandomized, open-label design, which was necessary due to the warfarin component of the study, ie, subjects were recruited to specific cohorts based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the respective cohorts. However, as the main endpoints were pharmacokinetic in nature, the risk of bias is considered very low by the authors.</p><p>JELIS (the Japan Eicosapentaenoic Acid Lipid Intervention Study) demonstrated that, in Japanese subjects, 2 g of EPA/day decreased cardiovascular events by 19% and that the on-treatment E PA levels correlated with the event reduction (levels greater than 100 &#x003bc;g/mL were associated with a clinical benefit).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-vhrm-9-563">22</xref> The baseline levels of EPA in this study population were approximately one ninth the on-treatment level of the JELIS study population. The steady-state levels of unadjusted total EPA of 33&#x02013;35 &#x003bc;g/mL in the Lovaza cohort versus 145&#x02013;156 &#x003bc;g/mL in the Epanova cohort prior to the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th doses suggest that in order to achieve the omega-3 levels associated with cardiovascular benefits in the JELIS trial, in a US population, either much higher doses of OM3 EE are required, or a free fatty acid formulation is needed, to maximize the potential cardiovascular benefits associated with omega-3 fatty acids.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Free fatty acid formulations of omega-3 fatty acids provide significantly higher plasma levels of total EPA + DHA compared with ethyl ester formulations after 14 days of repeat dosing in subjects on a low-fat diet. The higher apparent bioavailability of free fatty acid forms suggests that triglyceride-lowering efficacy with free fatty acid formulations may be higher than with ethyl ester formulations at equivalent daily dosages.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>EO and TM are paid employees of Celerion Inc.
