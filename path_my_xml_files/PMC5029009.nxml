We used an illustrative example to test three different approaches: (1) short version, (2) &#x0201c;average weight&#x0201d; version and (3) &#x0201c;worm prophylaxis&#x0201d; version. Interviews were conducted using think-aloud and teach-back approaches to test feasibility and analysed using qualitative content analysis. To assess comprehension of confidence intervals, a six-item multiple choice questionnaire was developed and tested in a pilot randomised controlled trial using the online survey software UNIPARK. Here, the average weight version (intervention group) was tested against a standard patient information version on confidence intervals (control group). People with multiple sclerosis were invited to take part using existing mailing-lists of people with multiple sclerosis in Germany and were randomised using the UNIPARK algorithm. Participants were blinded towards group allocation. Primary endpoint was comprehension of confidence intervals, assessed with the six-item multiple choice questionnaire with six points representing perfect knowledge.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Feasibility of the patient information versions was tested with 16 people with multiple sclerosis.

The way statistical information is presented and explained has a high impact on understanding and interpretation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In addition to information on absolute and relative risk reduction, thoughtfully developed information on confidence intervals (CI) for comparing treatment effects of immunotherapy options may be useful for communicating with people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS).</p><p>To correctly interpret study results, patients need to understand that study findings are effect estimates generated in a limited sample, which is assumed to represent the total population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. CI provide information about how accurate estimates are and thus add important information about the uncertainty of point estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Understanding the relevance of CI in addition to basic event rates and absolute risk reductions may support patients and clinicians when evaluating study results and making informed choices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The current Cochrane Handbook recommends to communicate both relative and absolute measures of risk and CI, which should be displayed in a &#x02018;Summary of findings&#x02019; table [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, approaches to explain CI to patients and consumers are rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and no systematic evaluation exists.</p><p>For PwMS informed decision-making on disease-modifying drugs is highly relevant for self-managing their lives with this chronic progressive disease. PwMS are confronted with different choices concerning disease-modifying drugs, which are only partially effective but also bear relevant risks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Adherence rates to disease-modifying drugs are as low as 30&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] indicating deficits also in the decision-making process. Communicating uncertainties may be an important step towards a better patient-medical-professional communication to achieve informed choices to which patients adhere to. Recent work has shown that addressing uncertainties does not induce anxiety and fear, but increases involvement and even adherence to disease-modifying drugs in MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In order to make informed medical decisions, PwMS not only need information about treatment effects in numbers, such as absolute risk reductions, but also information on the certainty of these estimates from clinical studies.</p><p>Therefore, this study aims to develop and pilot-test patient information (PI) materials to explain CI to PwMS. As currently no validated questionnaire assessing knowledge on CI is available, we aimed to develop and pilot-test a multiple-choice questionnaire to assess comprehension of CI.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>Different PI materials were developed and pilot-tested according to the Medical Research Council&#x02019;s framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Development</title><p>A systematic literature search was performed to identify studies evaluating approaches to explain CI. In total three different versions of PI materials were developed to explain CI to PwMS. The recommendations concerning the construction of evidence-based PI were considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Different approaches were applied to explain CI; using the illustrative example of an apple farmer in two PI versions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Feasibility/piloting</title><p>Assessment of feasibility included testing acceptability of PI materials and exploring to what extent the PI was judged suitable and attractive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Practicability of the PI was tested by assessing the time needed to process the information, composition of text and graphic illustration as well as understandability. Feasibility of PI was tested in two consecutive stages. In a <bold>pre-test phase,</bold> three different PI versions were tested with non-academic staff members from the MS day hospital in Hamburg and a consumer representative from a self-help initiative. In a subsequent <bold>pilot-test phase</bold>, the three PI versions were piloted with a sample of PwMS. The multiple-choice questionnaire was tested with pilot-test phase participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Finally, in a <bold>pilot-RCT,</bold> one PI (average weight version, see below for details) was piloted together with the questionnaire in 64 PwMS (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study Flow</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12911_2016_362_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Participants</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Pre-test and pilot-test phase</title><p>A convenience sample was used in the pre-test phase. In total three female staff members of the MS day clinic and one female consumer representative participated in the study.</p><p>In the pilot-test phase, a purposeful sampling strategy was applied to cover different distinct characteristics. In total 21 PwMS aged 18&#x000a0;years or older were selected from the MS day hospital, of whom eight declined to take part in the study due to timing issues. In total six of 13 PwMS received&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;12&#x000a0;years of education and thereof access to higher education Germany. Disease durations varied from 1 month to 19&#x000a0;years. Seven participants (54&#x000a0;%) were female. One patient dropped out at the beginning of the interview, because she expected a different input. Therefore, the final sample consisted of 12 PwMS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Pilot RCT</title><p>Participants were recruited using mailing-lists of the MS day hospital, the local MS self-help society and other self-help initiatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>After assessing the web-survey platform, participants were informed about the study and asked to provide demographic and disease specific data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and answer five questions on numeracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Participants were excluded with a notification by the system in case they filled in to be less than 18&#x000a0;years old or that they are not diagnosed with MS. After that, they were randomly allocated, using the UNIPARK randomisation sequence, to receive either the newly developed information or standard information. Directly after the intervention, they were asked to fill in the multiple-choice questionnaire.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Setting and procedure</title><p>A think-aloud approach combined with semi-structured interviews was used to evaluate the PI and the questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Participants (4 (staff members/consumer representative) and 12 (PwMS)) were asked to read the PI via a computer screen and verbalise their thoughts afterwards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The teach-back method was employed to allow further improvement and clarification of the PI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>All interviews, except one pre-test interview (telephone-interview), were held face-to-face and were audio-recorded at the MS day hospital by FF. There was no professional relationship between interviewer and participants. Interviews were not interrupted and recordings were of very good audio quality. Interviews ranged from 30 to 70&#x000a0;min.</p><p>The multiple-choice questionnaire with closed questions was developed following the recommendations by Haladyna et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and evaluated in the pilot-test phase and in the pilot-RCT. The average weight version on CI was tested against standard information on CI based on a formerly developed decision aid for PwMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] using the online survey software UNIPARK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The average weight version, where a farmer wants to estimate the average weight of his apples, was chosen because this version was preferred by PwMS and contains all information considered to be important to understand confidence intervals (see 3.2.3 for details). The minimum sample size was set to 60 people, assuming that this would allow gaining sufficient information for the planned evaluation of the questionnaire and the PI in a larger sample. It was not aimed to reach a statistical significant difference between the two groups, yet to use the results after successfully piloting for the sample size calculation of a future RCT to evaluate the PI in a larger sample.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Feasibility and pilot-phase</title><p>Interview recordings were transcribed using consistent rules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and transcripts were content analysed using Burnard&#x02019;s approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The coding tree (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) was developed along the gathered data and the structure of the interview guides.

The introduction starts with a question from a virtual patient and is supposed to give participants an idea in which context and why CI are used. For the main part three versions were developed to cover different levels of complexity and different approaches to explain CI. The final part aims to transfer the gathered knowledge about CI to MS specific medications. While in the short version, CI are explained as briefly as possible without using an example, in the average weight and worm prophylaxis versions the story of an apple farmer is used to explain CI. In the average weight version, the farmer wants to estimate the average weight of his apples and CI are illustrated using small and large random samples of apples to estimate the average weight. In contrast, in the worm prophylaxis version, the farmer wants to test whether an anti-worm treatment is effective to prevent his apples from worm infestation. At first he tries to treat a small sample of apples, then a larger one, while he compares the results to untreated apples.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Pre-Test phase written patient information</title><p>During the pre-test the PI versions were revised before they were shown to the next participant. Significant changes were made in order to clarify contents. The narrative line was optimised and sentences were shortened. A statistician was introduced as a second virtual character, apart from the farmer, to better structure the information.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Pilot-test phase written patient information</title><p>For the pilot-test interviews, participants were first shown the average weight version, followed by the short and the worm prophylaxis version. We chose to present the short version between the other two versions to allow participants to rest between the two longer and more complex versions. In general, participants&#x02019; reactions ranged from positively interested on the one end, to being overwhelmed on the other (interview no. 8 and 11). In total four PwMS (interview no. 3, 5, 8 and 12) did comment on the need of explaining CI to patients. It was considered as important and PwMS wanted to read more about it, but there were also contrary voices (interview no. 5). Please see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref> for example quotes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Understandability</title><p>In total five PwMS (interview no. 1, 3, 6, 8, and 10) stated that the information on CI was easy to understand and one person that it was well described (interview no. 9). Other points, raised by one PwMS respectively, were: too many pages with same content making it difficult to stay attentive (interview no. 9); the information was partly confusing, a lot at once and some parts had to be read more than once (interview no. 11); and that some sections need shorter sentences to be better understood (interview no.10). No PwMS expressed that the content was not understandable.</p><p>In general, the presentation of numbers was described as a burden by four PwMS (interview no. 4, 5, 9 and 10). One PwMS reported that he found it difficult to tell whether numbers were derived from calculations of real figures or were made up as an example (interview no. 8). Two PwMS also stated that their numerical skills and their competencies in mathematics were weak (interview no. 4 and 8). On the contrary, another PwMS pointed out to remember the content visually presented, but later stressed to have problems with numbers (interview no. 9).</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Different versions and comparison of the different versions</title><p>In total six PwMS were positive about the apple farmer approach (interview no. 1, 3, 6, 8, 10 and 12). While five PwMS clearly expressed that they preferred the average weight version; three PwMS liked the worm prophylaxis version better and one PwMS liked the short version most. Another PwMS stated that he could not choose one, because every version yielded different information and only all three versions combined gave a complete picture of CI. Information about the favourite version was missing for two PwMS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Confidence intervals and multiple sclerosis specific medications</title><p>PwMS did not comment much on the final part of the PI.

We developed and pre-tested three different PI versions on CI and piloted them successfully following the Medical Research Council&#x02019;s guidance for developing and evaluating complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Our pilot data indicate that CI can be made understandable through adequate PI interventions. PwMS contributed valuably to improve readability as well as understandability and enhanced comprehension. The majority of PwMS preferred either the average weight version or the worm prophylaxis version. The worm prophylaxis version was more difficult, but mirrored the setting of clinical trials very well, because of the treatment example. Therefore, this example could ease the transfer to immunotherapy decision making, as emphasised by some PwMS.</p><p>Statistical illiteracy by physicians and patients can result in misunderstanding study results, especially of numbers and verbal frequency statements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. CI are beneficial for judging on the clinical relevance of statistical reporting and to reduce the chance of results being misinterpreted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], because point estimates are complemented. Therefore, our graphical PI on CI, displaying both absolute risk reduction and significance of results, may be a step forward in patient education. The communication of CI could help to judge on the validity of the estimate by giving additional information to simply reporting point estimates. For example, the CI for the absolute risk reduction of glatiramer acetate (Copaxone&#x000ae;) concerning disability over 2 years ranges from zero to 21 and can be compared to other treatment options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, not every patient needs to process and understand point estimates and CI as roles within decision making process have to be clarified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and thus might lead to a physician-led decision. Nonetheless, comprehensive information has to be made accessible in order to allow patients to get involved as much as they want based on the bioethical principle of autonomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Therefore, medical management should always strive for the highest possible degree of patient autonomy. This study is embedded in an ongoing project, in which a nurse-led decision-coaching intervention is evaluated to enable PwMS to make informed treatment choices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The patient information will be made accessible on the online information platform after its evaluation in an RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Limitations of this study</title><p>There are some shortcomings of this study. PwMS of this pilot-study had the advantage of comparing all three versions with each other. The teach-back of the content indicated that some PwMS benefited from going through more than one version as they could teach back more information correctly after they had read the average weight and worm prophylaxis version. However, as the average weight version was always seen first by PwMS, the results might differ to another possible order. To account for this in a future RCT to evaluate all PI versions in larger sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], PwMS can watch a second video after having answered the questions. Due to the length and dense of information and drop-out rates it is not scheduled that PwMS see more than one PI material.</p><p>Caused by the small sample, the percentage of females in our pilot trial was imbalanced between the groups. However, we do not believe that this effected study results. Nevertheless, we will investigate on the impact of sex on the outcomes in the larger study.</p><p>Internal consistency and discriminatory power of the questionnaire were lower than aimed. For a high internal consistency, Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha should have been over 0.70 and discriminatory power should have ranged between 0.40 and 0.70 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], which was not reached for any question in the CG, whereas it was reached in two out of six questions in the IG. However, because the questionnaire consists of six questions only aiming to evaluate disease specific knowledge and comprehension on confidence intervals in general, high internal consistency would have been difficult to reach. Higher Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha level in the IG indicates that gained knowledge leads to more consistent replies. The lack of a correlation of correct answers with numeracy in the IG might be due to the fact that a high score in numeracy is not necessarily helpful to understand the topic. However, this needs further evaluation.</p><p>With a mean difference of one question between groups clinical and practical relevance is an open question. Nevertheless, with more than two thirds of the questionnaire answered correctly by the IG it could be assumed that this kind of information on treatment options is understandable for PwMS. However, results need to be confirmed in a larger sample. Further, other presentation formats as for example videos might be a more attractive format for the user to receive information on CI than written information.</p><p>Finally, recruitment for the pilot-RCT was conducted via mailing-lists of the MS day hospital and self-help initiatives. Therefore, only PwMS, who are potentially interested in being updated by those institutions, were reached. Being aware that not all people read the newsletter, to us the response rate with 64 replies out of 115 who did login into the survey seemed sufficient for a pilot study and our recruitment target of 60 PwMS was fulfilled. However, a large study with a less biased sample is needed to evaluate the PI on CI.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The pilot-phase shows promising results concerning acceptability and feasibility of different information materials on CI. PwMS may benefit from understanding CI, because they will be able to better compare different therapy options.</p><p>Understanding CI and other numerical data is of high importance for an informed treatment decision making process. Therefore, further research should focus on possibilities to explain numerical data of different formats in different patient groups.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec31"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12911_2016_362_MOESM1_ESM.doc" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>Coding tree.
