The population approach provides the opportunity to deal with sparse data obtained in patients treated during usual care. In our study, we will include patients with renal failure as compared to major trials. In order to identify the pathophysiologic factors that cause changes in the dose-concentration relationship, non-restrictive inclusion criteria will be applied.</p><p>In patients treated with enoxaparin for unstable angina, a slightly higher plasma half-life about 5 hours was however is also found. A similar increase has been reported in patients with other extremes conditions (obese patients or pre-dialyzed patients). The half-life increase is thus related to a reduction of the elimination rate (i.e., clearance) of enoxaparin. As enoxaparin shows a predominant renal elimination, this result could be linked to age-related decline in renal function. However, in the final model, age (but not creatinine clearance nor serum creatinine level) could be the only covariate related to low molecular weight heparin clearance. Due to the Cockroft and Gault mathematical formula for old patients and the inclusion of younger patients with renal failure, mean creatinine clearance could be lower in our study. Furthermore, it has been suggested by several previous studies that the Cockroft and Gault formula is not reliable for the correct assessment of the glomerular filtration rate, particularly in the elderly. Thus, the reduction of apparent clearance with age may be related to a reduction of renal filtration which is not accurately estimated by the surrogate marker creatinine clearance but only by the age of patients.</p><p>In prior studies, fixed (1 mg/kg twice a day) weight-adjusted dosing of enoxaparin is appropriate for most patients, our findings establish that a dosage reduction of 25% to 33% of the usual recommended dose would be needed in elderly patients and patients with renal failure in order to achieve the recommended therapeutic range of 0.5 to 1.0 IU/mL for anti-Xa activity. Even if the optimal level of anti-Xa neutralization has not been clearly stated, most trials have shown benefit of enoxaparin within this range and evidence suggests an increased risk of bleeding for maximal levels above 1 IU/ml[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>In addition, clinical observations also suggest a need for dosage reduction in particular population. Collet et al 9 have thus found that the therapeutic range of 0, 5&#x02013;1 IU/ml for anti-Xa activity will be reached with only 0, 64 mg/kg of enoxaparine in patients with severe renal failure (creatinine clearance &#x0003c; 30 ml/min) and 0, 85 mg/kg for those with a creatinine clearance between 30 and 60 ml/min.</p><sec><title>Questions to be answered</title><p>Mildly elevated serum creatinine concentration has been proposed to be a marker of increased risk for mortality due to cardiovascular disease[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. It has also been shown to be associated with the extent of coronary atherosclerosis independently of conventional risk factors; in this case, it is thought to indicate generalized vascular disease denoting early nephrovasculopathy in correlation with established atherosclerotic risk factors. In other studies, high serum creatinine concentration has been associated with increased mortality in hypertensive patients, elderly patients, and in those with myocardial infarction or stroke.</p><p>An increase on mayor bleeding was found as renal dysfunction worsened. Patients with renal impairment have decreased platelet function and elevated procoagulant activity, as reported by the National Kidney Foundation Task Force, but it is reasonable and strongly recommended to prescribe aspirin (75 to 325 mg/day) to reduce the risk for subsequent events in patients with coronary artery disease[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Studies are lacking regarding revascularization management in renal dysfunction patients, mainly because they have been excluded or were nor studied as a subgroup in the clinical trials. The criteria on which renal patients should undergo invasive diagnostic and therapeutics procedures have not been outlined yet. Paradoxically, overall utilization of antiplatelet agents like aspirin or clopidrogrel, beta blockers and statins were less frequently prescribed in renal disfunction patients, since it is well documented that the National Kidney Foundation Task Force strongly recommend them to disminish cardiovascular events at follow up[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Since the heparins are metabolized by the kidney, facing renal dysfunction these type of heparins could not be correctly eliminated inducing an inadequate accumulation of them in blood.</p><p>Unfortunately, the optimal dose in patients with renal dysfunction and acute coronary syndrome, has not yet been established.</p><p>Thus, we propose in the present study to test the hypothesis that a minimal useful dose may be achieved in the frame of renal dysfunction avoiding bleeding complications and or loosing efficacy in an acute coronary event.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Supported: by Fundaci&#x000f3;n Favaloro</p></sec></ack><ref-list><ref id="B1"><citation
