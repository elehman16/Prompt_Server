Participants maintained their usual marihuana intake until Quit Day after which they were required to cease intake of THC products for 14 days. A Withdrawal Discomfort Score revealed that for 7 days immediately following cessation, placebo-treated subjects reported more symptoms than bupropion-treated subjects. Self-reported craving for marihuana increased for the placebo-treated group but not for those treated with bupropion. Measures of sleep and cognitive performance were not different between the two groups. Participants in the bupropion treatment arm were more likely to complete the study than those randomized to the placebo arm (50% completion for bupropion vs. 33% completion for placebo). These results suggest that bupropion may be useful for alleviating marihuana withdrawal symptoms and be useful in subject retention during long-term cessation programs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>marihuana</kwd><kwd>withdrawal</kwd><kwd>pharmacotherapy</kwd><kwd>bupropion</kwd><kwd>cognitive performance</kwd><kwd>sleep</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>This research studied the effectiveness of the anti-depressant bupropion (in the sustained release formula&#x02014;Zyban<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> SR) to alleviate withdrawal symptoms in chronic marihuana users. Although evidence of a marihuana withdrawal syndrome has existed for many years<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-sart-6-2012-063">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-sart-6-2012-063">2</xref> the clinical significance of the condition and the role of the symptoms in relapse has been debated. Recently, the time course of the withdrawal syndrome has been documented<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-sart-6-2012-063">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-sart-6-2012-063">4</xref> and it has now been demonstrated that the marihuana withdrawal syndrome may very well be an important factor in maintaining use and relapse.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-sart-6-2012-063">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-sart-6-2012-063">7</xref> Several components of the withdrawal syndrome are believed to affect the ability of users to quit and to thwart the success of cessation attempts. For example, many users could not quit or quickly relapsed because they experienced significant physical tension, anxiety, irritability and insomnia. Resuming marihuana smoking alleviates these symptoms, which are very similar to those observed after tobacco withdrawal&#x02014;a condition for which bupropion has been shown to be effective.</p><p>Bupropion&#x02019;s effects on withdrawal symptoms observed during marihuana cessation were reported by Haney et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-sart-6-2012-063">8</xref> In an elegant in-patient crossover design with non-treatment seeking individuals, marihuana users smoked marihuana cigarettes repeatedly over 5 days then underwent abrupt cessation and observed for 12 days while being treated with either bupropion or placebo. They concluded that bupropion worsened the marihuana withdrawal syndrome. Participants&#x02019; self-ratings of irritability, feeling miserable, restless, unmotivated, and depressed were all greater in the bupropion phase than in the placebo phase. These authors conclude that bupropion may not be an effective pharmacotherapy for treating marihuana dependence.</p><p>Preliminary data from our laboratory (unpublished data) indicated that bupropion may be effective in reducing increases in dysphoric mood following marihuana withdrawal in a different paradigm. In an out-patient setting of 21 days of verified abstinence, ratings of anxiety, irritability, and physical tension were collected. These mood effects were attenuated relative to the historical cohort of subjects who were withdrawn without bupropion.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-sart-6-2012-063">4</xref> Given the success of bupropion in tobacco/nicotine cessation programs and our preliminary findings, we embarked to test whether bupropion would alleviate withdrawal symptoms in treatment-seeking cannabis-dependent individuals in a cessation paradigm similar to that used for tobacco cessation programs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>Treatment seeking, chronic, heavy users of marihuana between the ages of 18 to 50 years old were recruited via newspaper advertisements, internet ads, and advertisements on a local radio station. After giving informed consent, potential participants received a physical examination and a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-IV).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-sart-6-2012-063">9</xref> Participants had to be physically healthy and meet SCID-IV criteria for marihuana abuse and/or dependence. Additionally, they had to have had at least 3 years of heavy use (smoke 5 out of 7 days per week or greater than 25 times per month) and have experienced 2 or more negative symptoms in previous quit attempts. They could not meet abuse or dependence criteria for any other drug (including nicotine). Forty-five (45) men and women signed informed consent and were screened. Fifteen were found ineligible or declined to participate further; another 8 withdrew consent after the baseline week leaving 22 to be randomized to either active medication or placebo treatment. Of the 22 randomized, 9 completed the study through the 14 day withdrawal assessment period and were used for data analysis. These 9 completers consisted of 5 men, 4 women, aged 31.2&#x000b1;9.6 years old (range 20 to 44 years). Two met criteria for marihuana abuse while the remaining met criteria for abuse and dependence. They were at least daily smokers of marihuana with 1 smoking 2 to 3 times/day and 3 others reporting smoking 3&#x02013;4 times per day, and had smoked regularly for 3 to 20 years. All had attempted to quit at least once previously. All were regular, light to moderate drinkers of alcohol (1 or 2 drinks per week to 1&#x02013;2 drinks per day), moderate caffeine users (less than 300 mg per day), and 2 were light tobacco users (less than 5 cigarettes per day). The study was approved by the McLean Hospital Institutional Review Board. Participants provided written informed consent before beginning and they were paid for their participation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><sec><title>Daily diary</title><p>The diary contained a section for recording any and all drug use in the past 24-hour period (including the study medication), a sleep log, and the Marijuana Withdrawal Checklist.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-sart-6-2012-063">5</xref> The sleep log contained 5 questions and 2 visual analog scales. The questions were: &#x0201c;What time did you go to bed last night?&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;How quickly did you fall asleep (in minutes)?&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;How many times did you wake up during the night for more than just a minute or two (list number and total time awake)?&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;What time did you wake up this morning?&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;What time did you get out of bed this morning?&#x0201d;. The two visual analog scales assessed the characteristics of the previous sleep period. In response to the question of &#x0201c;When you got up this morning, you felt:&#x0201d;, participants placed a mark along a 100 mm line anchored with &#x0201c;exhausted&#x0201d; on the left end and &#x0201c;refreshed&#x0201d; on the right end.

The Marijuana Withdrawal Checklist assessed mood and withdrawal symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-sart-6-2012-063">5</xref> It is comprised of 29 items rated on a 4-point scale (0-none to 3-severe). A withdrawal discomfort score is computed from 10 of the items found to be most sensitive to subjective states following withdrawal from chronic marihuana use (maximum score of 30). The 10 items for the discomfort score are: anger, craving for marihuana, depressed mood, decreased appetite, headaches, irritability, nervousness, restlessness, sleep difficulty, and strange dreams.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment tests</title><p>A computerized performance assessment battery was used to assess a variety of cognitive performance abilities including memory, reaction time, and spatial recognition.

The University of Rhode Island Change Assessment (URICA) Scale<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-sart-6-2012-063">14</xref> (24-item version) was administered on the first and last day of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Actiwatch</title><p>A wrist-worn activity monitor (Actiwatch<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Score, Respironics, Bend, OR) was used for measurements of activity and verification of sleep periods.

This regimen is consistent with the manufacturer&#x02019;s and FDA guidelines for treating tobacco/nicotine addiction. Bupropion tablets were repackaged into gelatin capsules for blind administration. Placebo consisted of identically appearing gelatin capsules that contained gelatin filler (Nature&#x02019;s Way, 10 gr/650 mg). Additionally, with each medication administration, participants consumed an identically appearing capsule that contained 25 mg of vitamin B2 (riboflavin). Riboflavin can be detected in the urine through the use of ultraviolet light fluorescence and was used as a measure of medication compliance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-sart-6-2012-063">16</xref></p></sec></sec><sec><title>Procedure</title><p>The study was a between-subjects design where participants were randomly assigned to receive either bupropion or placebo following a 7 day baseline period (days &#x02212;7 to &#x02212;1; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-sart-6-2012-063">Fig. 1</xref>). A double-blind regimen of either placebo or bupropion began on Day 1 and continued for 21 days. Participants were allowed to continue their usual marihuana use until Day 8&#x02014;Quit Day, after which no further intake was allowed. Allowing for a one week of treatment with medication before cessation of marihuana use is consistent with established guidelines for the use of bupropion in treating tobacco/nicotine addiction. Female participants were not using oral birth control medication but were required to use other forms of contraception. Urine pregnancy tests were performed at each laboratory visit. Women completed a menstrual cycle diary and began the study on days 5&#x02013;14 of their cycle. Participants who used tobacco and caffeine continued their use at prestudy levels throughout the study. Participants were trained on the computerized performance tasks during the baseline week in order to establish stable performance, and instructed on how to complete the daily diary.</p><p>Participants came to the laboratory daily Monday through Friday. They gave a urine sample that was analyzed quantitatively for THC metabolites (see below) and for the presence/absence of other drugs of abuse (Instant-View<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Multi-Drug Screen Urine Test, Alfa Scientific Designs, Inc). The urine was viewed under ultraviolet light for riboflavin fluorescence by two observers. Participants completed a computerized performance assessment battery.

Urine creatinine concentrations were also measured to assess urine concentration. A threshold for detection of THC-COOH was 20 ng/mL. Samples positive for this metabolite underwent further analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) to obtain quantitative THC-COOH concentration. Samples after Day 8 (Quit Day) were further assessed for evidence of new marihuana use. The operational definition for this criterion was that the cannabinoid/creatinine ratio on a given day could not be greater than 50% higher from the ratio obtained in the previous day&#x02019;s urine sample. This definition of new marihuana use is based on data from controlled clinical studies of urinary excretion profiles of creatinine and marihuana metabolites following marihuana administration in humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-sart-6-2012-063">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-sart-6-2012-063">19</xref> and was used in a previous study in this laboratory.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-sart-6-2012-063">4</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Psychosocial support</title><p>Participants underwent weekly sessions of a motivational enhancement therapy (MET) that was adapted and used for marihuana dependence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-sart-6-2012-063">20</xref> This treatment was adapted from manuals used in Project Match<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-sart-6-2012-063">21</xref> and the CSAT Multi-Site Marihuana Treatment Project. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-sart-6-2012-063">22</xref> Three individual MET sessions (once during the week before Quit Day and then once during each week of abstinence) were conducted by a psychologist trained in MET.

These changes were not statistically significant. Both groups showed similar patterns and there were no significant differences between the groups. Latency to fall asleep did not vary by drug group or study week, but during the first week of withdrawal, once participants fell asleep, those in the bupropion group tended to sleep better: wake after sleep onset (WASO) analysis showed that the bupropion group was awake 10.1% of the sleep period vs. 14.2% for the placebo-treated group. This difference was not statistically significant. Visual analog scale ratings of sleep quality remained steady throughout the study. Average weekly ratings of feeling exhausted to refreshed upon awakening were between 61 and 65 (on a 100 mm line). Average weekly ratings of feeling exhausted to refreshed upon awakening were between 61 and 65 (on a 100 mm line). Average weekly ratings of restless to sound overall sleep were between 66 and 73.

Carpenter et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-sart-6-2012-063">29</xref> concluded that bupropion did not lessen withdrawal symptoms (specifically irritability) during a 13-week outpatient treatment study.

We wanted to maximize our efforts to study individuals who had experienced discernable (and unpleasant) withdrawal efforts in previous attempts to cut down or stop using marihuana. We felt that the best opportunity to assess bupropion&#x02019;s effects would be in individuals who had problems in the past and not simply including individuals who met DSM-IV criteria.</p><p>A limitation of the study is its small sample size. We designed the assessment to include only individuals who completed the 14-day withdrawal period. A more definitive assessment of bupropion&#x02019;s ability to alter marihuana withdrawal effects will need to include a larger sample size of completers and perhaps the incorporation of more sophisticated statistical methods to handle the data from the non-completers.</p><p>Long-term, chronic marihuana intake has been shown to affect cognitive abilities. Solowij et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-sart-6-2012-063">30</xref> compared performance on 9 standard neuropsychological tests of attention, memory, and executive functioning in three groups of subjects: long-term users with a mean of over 20 years of regular use (at least twice per month), short-term users with a mean of 10 years of use, and nonusers. In comparison to nonusers or short-term users, long-term users performed significantly poorer on verbal learning and time estimation tasks. Despite these demonstrated effects of such use, it appears that they are not permanent. Pope et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-sart-6-2012-063">31</xref> for example, studied cognitive performance in long-term, chronic users recruited to stop smoking and refrain from all THC intake for 28 days. Tests included assessments of memory, attention, abstraction ability, and ability to learn and recall visuospatial information. Current users performed poorer than former users or control subjects for the first 7 days of withdrawal, consistent with residual levels of THC remaining in the body. By day 28 however, there were no differences among the groups, indicating that impaired cognitive performance is a function of recent marihuana use. The results of the present study are in agreement with gradual improvements in psychomotor and cognitive performance reported following cessation of chronic drug intake. Performance on the tests included in the battery used in the current study did not show any withdrawal-related decrease: performance was not poorer during withdrawal for either treatment group. These results show that the ability of these tests to be indicative of an acute withdrawal syndrome appears to be limited, but may be more useful for assessing long-term changes following cessation of use.</p><p>Changes in sleep patterns have long been associated with withdrawal from chronic drug use. Early studies by Feinberg et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-sart-6-2012-063">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-sart-6-2012-063">33</xref> Jones et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-sart-6-2012-063">1</xref> and Karacan et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-sart-6-2012-063">34</xref> showed sleeplessness associated with an increase in rapid eye movement sleep following the abrupt termination of access to marihuana. More recently, Budney et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-sart-6-2012-063">6</xref> reported that &#x02018;sleep difficulties&#x02019; were recorded by over 40% of their subjects, although the exact nature of these difficulties were not detailed. Haney et al&#x02019;s<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-sart-6-2012-063">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-sart-6-2012-063">35</xref> in-patient studies reported that withdrawal from 4 days of oral THC administration, but not 4 days of smoked marihuana, produced significant disruptions in sleep: decreases in self-reported quantity and quality of sleep were observed. The changes observed during withdrawal in the current study were not statistically significant. This is somewhat surprising given the previous reports of sleep alterations during withdrawal. The reasons for the lack of significant changes need further examination.</p><p>The higher completion rate by the bupropion group is encouraging. It is possible that those treated with placebo experienced more severe withdrawal symptoms overall and thus were more likely to drop out, but this will require additional experimentation. Success in cessation treatment is often related to the ability to keep patients enrolled and keep receiving pharmacotherapy and psychosocial support.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-sart-6-2012-063">36</xref> If bupropion is alleviating some of the withdrawal symptoms, this may contribute to improved retention. Bupropion is a prescription medication that should not cause problems in marihuana-dependent but otherwise healthy individuals. When prescribed at the recommended doses for nicotine withdrawal, side effects included a low incidence of reported dry mouth, skin rashes, shakiness, and dizziness. Insomnia was reported by 31% of those taking the medication in a dose-response trial.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-sart-6-2012-063">37</xref> More serious side effects such as seizures are possible and therefore the medication is not recommended for individuals with a history of seizures or in bulimia patients, especially at higher than the recommended doses. Our experience (in an admittedly small sample) would indicate that when prescribed at the recommended doses, bupropion is well tolerated in marihuana using individuals.</p><p>This small sample study indicates that bupropion may be effective in relieving some withdrawal symptoms that occur following cessation of chronic marihuana use. Changes observed in withdrawal discomfort scores and cravings in the placebo-treated group were not observed in the bupropion-treated group. These are preliminary but encouraging results for the use of bupropion as a potential pharmacotherapeutic agent in the treatment of marihuana withdrawal.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Author Contributions</bold></p><p>Conceived and designed the experiment: DMP, SEL.
