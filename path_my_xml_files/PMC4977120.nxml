Individually, hyaluronan, or hyaluronic acid (HA), and vitamin C have been shown to reduce scarring by means of different mechanisms. The authors evaluated the efficacy and safety of an HA sponge system containing an active derivative of vitamin C to determine whether the use of this product promotes healing and reduces inflammation and scarring after surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This double-blind, randomized, prospective study was approved by the local institutional review board. Participants who had unilateral or bilateral surgical scars more than 1 month but less than 18 months old were enrolled. Surgical scars were randomly assigned to receive placebo or HA sponge with vitamin C. Three blinded evaluators reviewed photographs of the incision lines and assessed the scars using a visual analog scale. A patient satisfaction survey was also administered.

Six patients dropped out of the study, for a total of 17 patients included in final analysis. Mean (range) age of patient was 43.5 (25&#x02013;67) years. Mean (range) body mass index was 27.4 (18&#x02013;36.9) kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The mean visual analog scale score for scars receiving HA sponge with vitamin C was slightly lower than the scars receiving placebo, but the difference was not statistically significant (<italic>t</italic> test; <italic>P</italic> = 0.9).

Scar contracture, hypertrophic scar, or keloid can lead to physical deformities, which can be disabling.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The annual economic burden of this problem has been conservatively estimated at more than $4 billion in the United States. Each year, 100 million US patients acquire scars as a result of surgical procedures, with approximately 55 million elective operations and 25 million operations after trauma performed annually.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Scar management strategies have traditionally focused on the biologic components of wound healing with the goal of identifying a single gene or transcription factor responsible for scar formation. To date, however, such strategies have not been successful.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>Skin repair after injury in adult humans follows 4 distinct phases: homeostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Primary, secondary, and tertiary stages of wound healing occur simultaneously in differing degrees of intensity; it is important for wounds to go through all 3 healing stages for the resultant scar to be aesthetically pleasing.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>Three main areas of scar control are scar support to decrease skin tension, hydration, and accelerated scar maturation. Scar support during the maturation phase, which starts at 3 weeks and can last for years, has been studied for years with various available commercial products,<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> but no product has been found to provide optimal standard outcomes over various skin types and scar types. Silicon sheeting is one commonly used product which provides hydration, and negative charge and occlusion of the scar, as a mechanism of action, but there is no clear support that this product will actually modulate inflammation and intrinsic factors of scar maturation.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>Scarless fetal healing is thought to be influenced by the abundance of hyaluronic acid (HA),<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> which has been shown to modulate inflammation.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> On the contrary, we have limited knowledge about its exact mechanism of action in accelerating scar maturation and improvement of the appearance of scars.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Although scar maturation can be accelerated by conversion of immature collagen to mature collagen, other factors that modulate inflammation and control the orientation of collagen fingers may play a role in overall aesthetic appearance of the scars.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>One scar management product, the hyaluronan or HA sponge (HylaSponge System, Matrix Biological Institute, Fort Lee, N.J.), uses polymerization methods to produce a network of small and large HA molecular chains bound into large coils (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). These coils form spheroidal particles that can absorb and release large volumes of water or water-soluble molecules. This process in turn improves hydration and other mechanisms of a more desirable scar maturation such as delivering HA molecules and other water-solvable molecules to the scar.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Hyaluronan sponge system.

Magnesium ascorbyl phosphate (MAP) is a water-soluble, nonirritating, stable derivative of vitamin C. It has the same potential as vitamin C to boost skin collagen synthesis, but it is effective in significantly lower concentrations and can be used at concentrations as low as 10% to suppress melanin formation (in skin-whitening solutions). Of note, MAP may be a better option than vitamin C for persons with sensitive skin and those wishing to avoid any exfoliating effects, as many vitamin C formulas are highly acidic (and therefore produce exfoliating effects).<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Skin enzymes transform MAP into ascorbic acid (vitamin C), an antioxidant and a cofactor for an enzyme essential in the synthesis of collagen. As an antioxidant, vitamin C scavenges and destroys reactive oxidizing agents and other free radicals. It can thus provide important protection against damage induced by ultraviolet radiation (and the DNA mutations and cancer that may result from it).<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Vitamin C also helps to improve skin elasticity, decreases wrinkles by stimulating collagen synthesis, reduces redness, promotes wound healing, and suppresses cutaneous pigmentation. Because body control mechanisms limit the amount of ingested vitamin C available to the skin, topical application is an efficient way to target vitamin C antioxidant therapy directly to the skin. This topical antioxidant is a more stable form of ascorbic acid that can stimulate collagen synthesis.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of an HA sponge system containing MAP (ie, HA sponge with vitamin C).

Noninvasive options include compression therapy (eg, pressure garments with or without gel sheeting); static and dynamic splints; acrylic casts; masks and clips; oils, lotions, and creams; antihistamine drugs; hydrotherapy; and psychosocial counseling and advice.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Silicon sheeting, with or without adhesive, has become a popular option for scar management.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Massage therapy is often recommended but lacks evidence of benefit.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Without proper trials, however, benefits are difficult to quantify objectively, although even a placebo benefit may be appreciated by patients. Invasive treatments include surgical excision and resuturing. Intralesional corticosteroid injection is widely used but is prone to complications (eg, fat atrophy, dermal thinning, pigment changes). Other treatments that have been advocated with variable outcomes include injections of fluorouracil, interferon gamma, bleomycin, radiotherapy, laser therapy, and cryosurgery.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p><p>Hydration, 1 of 3 main areas of scar control (the others being scar support and accelerated scar maturation), reduces water loss and restores homeostasis to the scar, thereby reducing capillary hyperemia, collagen deposition, and hypertrophic scar.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> The HA sponge plays a role in maintaining hydration near the scar. The HA sponge is also different from all other forms of HA available today because of its content design and hydrating properties. Because of the water-retaining capacity of HA sponge, it facilitates the transport of metabolites and preserves tissue hydration, especially in the dermal layer. Hyaluronan likely plays a multifaceted role in the mediation of cellular and matrix events during wound healing. In addition, the larger and smaller molecules of HA penetrate the scar and contribute to accelerated wound healing, simulating fetal scarless healing by increasing the amount of HA in the area of the scar.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup></p><p>In another prospective study (unpublished data, Monali Mahedia, Nilay Shah, Bardia Amirlak, 2015), we evaluated the HA sponge with zinc and found benefit with wound healing and obtaining a better scar when therapy was initiated immediately after surgical procedures. To our knowledge, this study is the first randomized controlled prospective trial showing significant patient satisfaction by using HA sponge with vitamin C in more mature scars. We also showed the ease of use of the micro-roller in this study. The micro-roller is safe and painless and activates microcirculation by stimulating the skin with microneedles on the rotating head. It has 192 surgical steel microneedles, which create microchannels that allow the ingredients to better penetrate the skin surface and acts in synergy with HA sponge with vitamin C. These channels remain open for 1 to 2 hours, and skin is able to absorb products more efficiently.<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup></p><p>Campos et al<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> found photoprotective, hydration, and viscoelastic effects of a cosmetic formulation containing a dispersion of liposome with MAP, alpha-lipoic acid, and kinetin in their in vitro and in vivo experiment on hairless mouse skin and human volunteer forearm skin. After 4 weeks of application on human volunteer forearm skin, stratum corneum skin moisture and hydration of deeper layers of skin were enhanced. They concluded that the formulation can have potential antiaging effects. Before that, they had shown that MAP can cause alteration in the viscoelastic:elastic ratio, suggesting that MAP can affect the deeper layers of the skin. Vitamin C is important for the normal cutaneous metabolism and preventing early aging.<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> The formulation of the HA sponge allows delivery of MAP and similar products to maturing scars.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>No adverse reactions were reported in our study, consistent with previous findings supporting the safety of ascorbic acid. In safety studies in animal models, the use of ascorbic acid on damaged skin was not associated with any adverse effects. In addition, repeat-insult patch test findings using 5% ascorbic acid were negative, supporting the finding that this group of ingredients does not present a risk of skin sensitization.</p><p>Although differences were noted in the VAS analysis due to limited number of patients, the statistical significance was not achieved. These preliminary data can lay the groundwork to larger prospective multicenter trials. However, even with these limited data, our patient satisfaction results were statistically significant and strong enough to support the routine use of this product. Another limitation of the study is the use of a VAS. Although this type of scale has been validated and is commonly used when assessing scars, it is subjective, which is the limitation in all scar assessment studies.</p><p>The method of randomization also deserves further clarification as it can be confusing to the reader why this method of randomization was used for this study. It was done to balance internal randomization and to further blind the reviewers to the potential bias. It made statistical analysis more difficult but did not affect the results overall. Two groups were internally balanced because of method of randomization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The HA sponge with vitamin C is safe to use in all types of scars older than 4 weeks.
