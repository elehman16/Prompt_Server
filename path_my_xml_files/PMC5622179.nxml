This study compared gemcitabine and docetaxel versus doxorubicin as first-line treatment for advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The GeDDiS trial was a randomised controlled phase 3 trial done in 24 UK hospitals and one Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (SAKK) hospital. Eligible patients had histologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma of Trojani grade 2 or 3, disease progression before enrolment, and no previous chemotherapy for sarcoma or previous doxorubicin for any cancer. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive six cycles of intravenous doxorubicin 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1 every 3 weeks, or intravenous gemcitabine 675 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1 and 8 and intravenous docetaxel 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 8 every 3 weeks. Treatment was assigned using a minimisation algorithm incorporating a random element. Randomisation was stratified by age (&#x02264;18 years <italic>vs</italic> &#x0003e;18 years) and histological subtype. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients alive and progression free at 24 weeks in the intention-to-treat population. Adherence to treatment and toxicity were analysed in the safety population, consisting of all patients who received at least one dose of their randomised treatment. The trial was registered with the European Clinical Trials (EudraCT) database (no 2009&#x02013;014907&#x02013;29) and with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial registry (ISRCTN07742377), and is now closed to patient entry.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Between Dec 3, 2010, and Jan 20, 2014, 257 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the two treatment groups (129 to doxorubicin and 128 to gemcitabine and docetaxel). Median follow-up was 22 months (IQR 15&#x000b7;7&#x02013;29&#x000b7;3). The proportion of patients alive and progression free at 24 weeks did not differ between those who received doxorubicin versus those who received gemcitabine and docetaxel (46&#x000b7;3% [95% CI 37&#x000b7;5&#x02013;54&#x000b7;6] <italic>vs</italic> 46&#x000b7;4% [37&#x000b7;5&#x02013;54&#x000b7;8]); median progression-free survival (23&#x000b7;3 weeks [95% CI 19&#x000b7;6&#x02013;30&#x000b7;4] <italic>vs</italic> 23&#x000b7;7 weeks [18&#x000b7;1&#x02013;20&#x000b7;0]; hazard ratio [HR] for progression-free survival 1&#x000b7;28, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;99&#x02013;1&#x000b7;65, p=0&#x000b7;06). The most common grade 3 and 4 adverse events were neutropenia (32 [25%] of 128 patients who received doxorubicin and 25 [20%] of 126 patients who received gemcitabine and docetaxel), febrile neutropenia (26 [20%] and 15 [12%]), fatigue (eight [6%] and 17 [14%]), oral mucositis (18 [14%] and two [2%]), and pain (ten [8%] and 13 [10%]). The three most common serious adverse events, representing 111 (39%) of all 285 serious adverse events recorded, were febrile neutropenia (27 [17%] of 155 serious adverse events in patients who received doxorubicin and 15 [12%] of 130 serious adverse events in patients who received gemcitabine and docetaxel, fever (18 [12%] and 19 [15%]), and neutropenia (22 [14%] and ten [8%]). 154 (60%) of 257 patients died in the intention-to-treat population: 74 (57%) of 129 patients in the doxorubicin group and 80 (63%) of 128 in the gemcitabine and docetaxel group. No deaths were related to the treatment, but two deaths were due to a combination of disease progression and treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Doxorubicin should remain the standard first-line treatment for most patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma.

We used the following search terms: &#x0201c;soft tissue&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;sarcoma&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;chemotherapy&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;doxorubicin&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;gemcitabine&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;docetaxel&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;randomised&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;trial&#x0201d;. We identified six published randomised controlled trials, none of which showed a survival advantage for any schedule over single-agent doxorubicin. We identified a further randomised controlled study comparing single-agent doxorubicin versus doxorubicin and ifosfamide chemotherapy, which was recruiting at that time, and which has since been published in 2014, showing an advantage for the combination for progression-free survival but not overall survival. We also searched for randomised controlled trials comparing doxorubicin versus gemcitabine and docetaxel. Although we identified three phase 2 studies (one of which was a randomised phase 2 study comparing gemcitabine versus gemcitabine and docetaxel), we were unable to find any phase 3 trials comparing this combination with doxorubicin.</p><p><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first randomised controlled trial that compares two commonly used treatments&#x02014;doxorubicin versus gemcitabine and docetaxel&#x02014;as first-line treatment in advanced soft-tissue sarcoma. We have shown that gemcitabine and docetaxel was not superior to doxorubicin for either progression-free survival or overall survival. Furthermore, planned subgroup analyses have not identified any subgroup for which gemcitabine and docetaxel was superior, and in particular we did not observe superiority for either leiomyosarcoma or uterine leiomyosarcoma, for which gemcitabine and docetaxel has previously been believed to be particularly active. We found worse treatment adherence with gemcitabine and docetaxel compared with doxorubicin, with more dose delays, lower dose intensity, and more patients stopping treatment early due to toxicity, and lower quality-of-life scores.</p><p><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p>These results provide evidence for clinicians to consider with patients when selecting first-line treatment for advanced soft-tissue sarcoma. Although the observed similar progression-free survival and overall survival of gemcitabine and docetaxel and doxorubicin might support a conclusion that either schedule can be used according to patient or clinician preference, our results indicate the need for caution with such an approach given the greater difficulty in delivery and toxicity of gemcitabine and docetaxel, and indeed the higher cost of this combination regimen. The data support the conclusion that doxorubicin should remain standard of care as first-line treatment for most patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma, and that there is no subgroup of patients for whom gemcitabine and docetaxel should be routinely recommended.</p></boxed-text></p><sec id="cesec10"><title>Introduction</title><p>Soft-tissue sarcoma comprises a number of rare malignancies, with 3298 patients newly diagnosed with the disease in the UK in 2010.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Surgery with radiotherapy is the most common treatment for localised disease, with associated 5-year overall survival of 55% in 2006&#x02013;10.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Survival outcomes for locally advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma are poor, with a median overall survival of 12&#x000b7;8&#x02013;14&#x000b7;3 months after diagnosis.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Doxorubicin has been used as first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma for more than 40 years.

Toxicity was predictably higher in the combination group, and the authors concluded their results &#x0201c;do not support the use of intensified doxorubicin and ifosfamide for palliation of advanced soft-tissue sarcoma unless the specific goal is tumour shrinkage&#x0201d;. Subsequently, two first-line phase 3 trials<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> have combined doxorubicin with novel agents (doxorubicin and palifosfamide compared with doxorubicin and placebo,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> and doxorubicin and evofosfamide compared with doxorubicin alone<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>), and neither study was able to show improved progression-free survival or overall survival for the combination treatments. Thus, no regimen has proved to be unequivocally superior to doxorubicin as first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma.</p><p>Gemcitabine and docetaxel was first reported as a treatment for locally advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma in 2002. Hensley and colleagues<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> did a phase 2 study in patients with leiomyosarcoma and reported that 53% of patients achieved an objective response. This study also compared plasma levels of gemcitabine achieved with a 90-min infusion versus a 30-min infusion, and showed that the 90-min infusion was associated with a longer duration of plasma gemcitabine concentrations above 10 &#x003bc;mol/L, which is the threshold for saturation of intracellular accumulation of the active form of the drug, gemcitabine triphosphate. A further retrospective review of gemcitabine and docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease included an in-vitro study to investigate the dosing sequence of gemcitabine and docetaxel, finding that gemcitabine followed by docetaxel was synergistic, whereas docetaxel followed by gemcitabine was antagonistic.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Hence, the currently used schedule of gemcitabine and docetaxel in locally advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma was established. Subsequently, several retrospective studies and phase 2 studies, in both leiomyosarcoma<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and unselected soft-tissue sarcoma,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> have all showed activity of the combination. The observed responsiveness of leiomyosarcoma in particular has led to some clinicians adopting gemcitabine and docetaxel as a first-line treatment option for locally advanced or metastatic leiomyosarcoma, in the absence of evidence from phase 3 trials. With increasing use of the combination in both leiomyosarcoma and locally advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma, robust evidence is needed to establish the roles of gemcitabine and docetaxel and doxorubicin as first-line treatments for this disease.</p><p>The GeDDiS trial aimed to compare the efficacy of gemcitabine and docetaxel versus doxorubicin in the first-line setting for locally advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma. We also compared toxicity and quality of life for the two regimens to aid clinical decision-making in treatment selection for individual patients. A pharmacogenomics study was also done to investigate the influence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on treatment efficacy and toxicity.</p></sec><sec id="cesec20"><title>Methods</title><sec id="cesec30"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>GeDDiS was a multicentre, randomised, phase 3 trial, which recruited patients from 24 UK hospitals, and one Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (SAKK) hospital in Switzerland (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 1</xref>).

Gemcitabine was administered over 90 min and docetaxel was administered over 60 min. Dose capping according to sites' local policy and dose banding to within plus or minus 5% of the calculated dose were permitted. Pre-treatment and post-treatment anti-emetics were given for all trial treatments, as per local anti-emetics policy. In both groups, patients completed up to six cycles of treatment in the absence of disease progression, intolerable side-effects, or withdrawal of consent.</p><p>Laboratory monitoring (blood count and biochemistry) was done within 72 h of day 1 of each cycle, with additional monitoring on day 8 (blood count only) for gemcitabine and docetaxel treatment. To proceed with treatment on day 1 of each cycle (both groups) the following were required: absolute neutrophil count of at least 1&#x000b7;0&#x02008;&#x000d7;&#x02008;10<sup>9</sup> per L, platelet count of at least 100&#x02008;&#x000d7;&#x02008;10<sup>9</sup> per L, bilirubin of up to 1&#x000b7;5&#x02008;&#x000d7;&#x02008;ULN, and aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, or both of up to 3&#x000b7;0&#x02008;&#x000d7;&#x02008;ULN. For administration of treatment on day 8 (in the gemcitabine and docetaxel group) the following were required: absolute neutrophil count of at least 1&#x000b7;0&#x02008;&#x000d7;&#x02008;10<sup>9</sup> per L and platelets of at least 75&#x02008;&#x000d7;&#x02008;10<sup>9</sup> per L. Dose modifications for adverse events were made according to prespecified criteria: dose reductions of 20% (first occurrence) ND then 33% (second occurrence) were permitted for doxorubicin (in the case of grade 3 or worse febrile neutropenia) and gemcitabine and docetaxel (for grade 3 or worse febrile neutropenia, grade 2 neuropathy, or any grade pulmonary toxicity); a third occurrence required the patient to be withdrawn from treatment. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was permitted after an episode of febrile neutropenia, at the discretion of the treating investigator and according to local policy. Dose delays of up to 2 weeks for haematological toxicity and up to 3 weeks for non-haematological toxicity were allowed; delays longer than this required the patient to be withdrawn from treatment. For doxorubicin, patients were advised to be withdrawn from treatment if left ventricular ejection fraction was less than 45% or reduced by 20% from baseline (cardiotoxicity monitoring was done according to local institutional policies). For gemcitabine and docetaxel, patients were withdrawn for the following events: grade 3 pulmonary fibrosis, any grade 4 pulmonary toxicity, grade 3 or 4 hypersensitivity reactions (docetaxel only), or grade 3 weight gain.</p><p>Adverse events were assessed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03, from informed consent until 30 days after last trial treatment administration. Serious adverse events were reported from informed consent until 30 days after last trial treatment administration, or later if the investigator felt that an event was related to trial treatment.</p><p>Disease status was assessed by CT scan, MRI scan, or both at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks after randomisation, and then every 12 weeks until disease progression (including patients who discontinued treatment for any reason other than disease progression). Response was assessed by local investigators according to RECIST 1.1. Additionally, scans for 15% of recruited patients were centrally reviewed at University College Hospital. At least one patient from every site had a central scan review (10% of patients for sites recruiting ten patients or more). All scan images (baseline and subsequent disease assessments) available for these patients were reviewed.</p><p>Quality of life was assessed at baseline and at 12, 18, and 24 weeks after randomisation, using the EORTC QLQ-C30, and fatigue-specific FA-13 questionnaires. Health economic assessment was also done at the same timepoint using the EuroQoL EQ-5D questionnaire, and by prospectively collecting information about health-care resource use.</p><p>For the pharmacogenomics analyses, DNA was extracted from 4 mL whole blood using a QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi kit (Qiagen, Manchester, UK), according to the manufacturer's instructions. All samples were diluted to 10 ng/&#x003bc;L DNA in AE buffer, before being genotyped by Taqman PCR on a 7900HT PCR machine.

We plotted Kaplan-Meier curves for progression-free survival and overall survival; treatment effect HRs (with 95% CIs and p values) were obtained from Cox proportional hazards regression models, adjusted for randomisation stratification factors.

Insufficient questionnaires were returned to be able to assess quality of life at 18 weeks and 24 weeks (83 [32%] of 257 questionnaires were returned at both 18 weeks and 24 weeks, compared with 132 [51%] of 257 at 12 weeks). Quality-of-life measures did not differ between the treatment groups at 12 weeks postrandomisation (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>). However, the mean Global Health Status score at 12 weeks was 63&#x000b7;8 (SD 22&#x000b7;5) in the doxorubicin group (based on 64 [50%] of 129 patients) and 59&#x000b7;1 (SD 21&#x000b7;8) in the gemcitabine and docetaxel group (based on 63 [49%] of 128 patients). After adjusting for baseline score and histological subtype, the mean treatment difference was 5&#x000b7;1 (99% CI &#x02212;4&#x000b7;7 to 15&#x000b7;0; p=0&#x000b7;17; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4</xref>).<fig id="fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Quality-of-life outcomes at 12 weeks post-randomisation</p><p>The plotted points represent the mean treatment effect between the groups (a positive number for the treatment effect indicates a better quality of life on gemcitabine and docetaxel than doxorubicin).

The remaining 196 (77%) patients received at least one additional treatment: chemotherapy for 139 (71%) of 196 patients (62 [62%] of 100 patients in the doxorubicin group and 77 [80%] of 96 patients in the gemcitabine and docetaxel group), and local therapies for 57 (29%) of 196 patients (38 [38%] and 19 [20%]). Local therapies consisted of radiotherapy for 44 (22%) of 196 patients (28 [28%] and 16 [17%]) and surgery for 13 (7%) of 196 patients (ten [10%] and three [3%]).

Similarly, we found no significant difference in overall survival between the two treatment groups. Soft-tissue sarcoma is recognised to be a very heterogeneous disease with a large number of histological subtypes, and indeed our trial included 22 different subtypes, with very small numbers of patients with many of these subtypes. This heterogeneity is an inevitable feature of most large soft-tissue sarcoma trials, and as such we believe that the GeDDiS trial population is representative of the general population with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma.</p><p>Gemcitabine and docetaxel has been used in locally advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma since 2002, and has been investigated in several small studies, which have shown activity of the combination therapy.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> A randomised phase 2 study compared gemcitabine and docetaxel with gemcitabine alone in 122 patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma who had received between zero and three previous chemotherapy regimens, and reported superior median progression-free survival for gemcitabine and docetaxel compared with gemcitabine alone (6&#x000b7;2 months <italic>vs</italic> 3&#x000b7;0 months) and overall survival (17&#x000b7;9 months <italic>vs</italic> 11&#x000b7;5 months).<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> A subsequent randomised phase 2 study compared gemcitabine and docetaxel versus gemcitabine alone as second-line treatment in 90 patients with leiomyosarcoma, reporting that both schedules were effective second-line therapies, with similar proportions of patients achieving a response.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Gemcitabine and docetaxel has therefore become an accepted treatment option in metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma after first-line therapy.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Subsequent phase 1b/2 studies have combined gemcitabine and docetaxel with bevacizumab showing feasibility and activity,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and also with pazopanib,<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> although that trial closed early because of slow accrual and substantial toxicity.

Indeed, several studies<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> have restricted the use of gemcitabine and docetaxel to leiomyosarcoma and uterine leiomyosarcoma. However, the results of the GeDDiS trial refute these claims of superior activity in particular histological subtypes of locally advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma versus others, since our results show no evidence that treatment effect was influenced by histological subtype. We did planned subgroup analyses to investigate whether patients with either leiomyosarcoma or uterine leiomyosarcoma responded better to gemcitabine and docetaxel than other soft-tissue sarcoma histological subtypes, but found no indication of a superior response to gemcitabine and docetaxel in either of these subgroups.</p><p>We chose 13 years as the minimum age for the trial, specifically to try to increase participation of the teenage and young adult population, because clinical trial recruitment of this age group is recognised to be poor.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> However, only one patient younger than 18 years of age was recruited, which we believe reflects the differing approaches to treatment of advanced soft-tissue sarcoma by UK paediatric and adult oncologists&#x02014;with paediatric oncologists using more intensive chemotherapy regimens than those used in this trial. Additionally, competing paediatric trials in this population were running in the UK at the time of recruitment to GeDDiS, such that we believe that younger patients were preferentially recruited to those paediatric trials.</p><p>Why did gemcitabine and docetaxel fail to show superiority to doxorubicin? This outcome might have been partly due to the choice of lower dose and fewer cycles of treatment; the 2002 study by Hensley and colleagues<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> delivered more cycles (eight <italic>vs</italic> six), at higher doses (gemcitabine 900 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and docetaxel 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup>
<italic>vs</italic> gemcitabine 675 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and docetaxel 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) than in GeDDiS. Our regimen was chosen on the basis of the randomised phase 2 study of Maki and colleagues,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> which had used the higher dose schedule, and had reported high frequency (46%) of dose reductions for gemcitabine and docetaxel, lower dose intensity than gemcitabine, and more than 40% of patients on gemcitabine and docetaxel stopping within 6 months of starting therapy, for non-haematological toxicities such as fatigue and myalgias, despite dose reductions. The authors concluded that &#x0201c;this dose and schedule&#x02026;are too high for long-term use&#x0201d;. Additionally, a previous phase 2 study<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> that the GeDDiS chief investigator had led using this schedule had found that quite substantial toxicity was experienced in the UK population, such that eight (18%) of 45 patients stopped treatment early due to toxicity, and only ten (20%) patients received the full eight cycles. We therefore made a pragmatic decision to dose modify the schedule to make it more suitable for patients receiving palliative chemotherapy. The lower doses used are reflected by the absence of grade 3&#x02013;4 thrombocytopenia recorded (no patients on gemcitabine and docetaxel experienced this toxicity) compared with a 40% frequency in the previous randomised phase 2 study.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> It might be suggested that the gemcitabine and docetaxel doses we selected were too low. However, despite modifying the gemcitabine and docetaxel schedule for the GeDDiS trial, our results were similar for gemcitabine and docetaxel to those of Maki and colleagues' study,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> with median progression-free survival of 5&#x000b7;5 months versus 6&#x000b7;2 months, and median overall survival of 15&#x000b7;5 months versus 17&#x000b7;9 months, respectively.</p><p>An additional factor in the lack of superiority of gemcitabine and docetaxel over doxorubicin at least for overall survival might be the lower overall exposure of patients to gemcitabine and docetaxel, as first-line and second-line treatments combined. Of 96 patients in the gemcitabine and docetaxel group receiving a subsequent treatment, 60 received doxorubicin, whereas of 100 patients in the doxorubicin group receiving a subsequent treatment, only 18 received gemcitabine and docetaxel. This difference is because for many UK hospitals at the time of the GeDDiS trial, the combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel was not funded and thus unavailable to clinicians.</p><p>Despite the use of a modified gemcitabine and docetaxel schedule in our study, treatment adherence to gemcitabine and docetaxel was inferior to that for doxorubicin. Patients in the gemcitabine and docetaxel group experienced more dose delays and lower dose intensity than those in the doxorubicin group, with fewer patients in the gemcitabine and docetaxel group receiving all six cycles of chemotherapy and more patients stopping treatment early due to toxicity. These findings might have a number of explanations. A proportion of patients (4% to 10%) at each cycle did not receive day 8 docetaxel, thus affecting dose intensity. Docetaxel was omitted at these points according to protocol criteria for low neutrophils or platelets, or toxicity leading to a clinical decision to omit docetaxel (notably, the most common non-haematological grade 3&#x02013;4 toxicity in the gemcitabine and docetaxel group was fatigue). The excess of patients stopping gemcitabine and docetaxel early might also have reflected a bias in clinicians to stop treatment earlier in the experimental group, in the knowledge that patients could go on to receive standard doxorubicin-based treatment. It could be argued that the gemcitabine and docetaxel doses that were delayed or missed represent undertreatment in this group, which could explain the separation of the progression-free survival curves in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>.</p><p>Although no significant difference was seen in any of the individual quality-of-life parameters between the treatment groups, the global health status was numerically lower for gemcitabine and docetaxel than in the doxorubicin group. Potential contributing factors are that gemcitabine and docetaxel requires an additional visit to hospital in each 3-week cycle, and gemcitabine and docetaxel takes longer to deliver than doxorubicin, prolonging each hospital visit and resulting in an added burden on patients with incurable disease receiving palliative chemotherapy. The implication of these results is that gemcitabine and docetaxel was more difficult to deliver (lower dose intensity, more treatment delays, and more patients stopping early due to toxicity), and was associated with a worse global health status than doxorubicin. Thus, there does seem to be a disadvantage to patients in receiving gemcitabine and docetaxel as first-line treatment. Furthermore, there are economic, as well as personal, disadvantages to gemcitabine and docetaxel because it is a more expensive treatment regimen than doxorubicin because of higher drug costs, more frequent and longer hospital visits are needed for treatment, and increased requirements for supportive medications (data not shown).</p><p>Importantly, the results of the current study are consistent with two other first-line studies in locally advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma that included doxorubicin as the control group, with the median progression-free survival of 23&#x000b7;3 weeks in the doxorubicin group in the current study similar to the 22&#x000b7;5 weeks<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> and 26 weeks<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> reported in the other studies. This is also true of median overall survival, which was 76&#x000b7;3 weeks in the doxorubicin group in the current study, compared with 73&#x000b7;2 weeks<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> and 82&#x000b7;3 weeks<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> with doxorubicin in the other studies. Interestingly, all three studies showed an improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival compared with the preceding published trial of Judson and colleagues<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> (progression-free survival of 19&#x000b7;9 weeks and overall survival of 55&#x000b7;4 weeks), which had recruited patients several years earlier, suggesting that outcomes have improved for patients with locally advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma in recent years. The explanation for this is likely to be multifactorial. Clinicians might be better at selecting patients most likely to benefit from palliative chemotherapy for advanced soft-tissue sarcoma, and are treating patients more aggressively in terms of minimising dose reductions and treatment delays, with greater use of supportive medications such as growth factors. A further factor might be increasing use of local therapies such as radiotherapy and surgery for patients with metastatic disease, which has been associated with longer overall survival than for patients not receiving such therapies.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> Indeed, 57 patients on the GeDDiS trial went on to receive surgery or radiotherapy after completing study treatment.</p><p>The pharmacogenomics data obtained in the current study suggest that SNPs in the organic cation transporter <italic>SLC22A16</italic> are associated with reduced efficacy and decreased toxicity following doxorubicin treatment. These findings are in keeping with previously published data from a breast cancer patient cohort and are consistent with a loss of function in the transporter that results in reduced intracellular influx of doxorubicin.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Validation of these effects in an independent cohort of sarcoma patients would be valuable to ascertain the potential for this SNP to influence clinical decision-making. Two other SNPs, <italic>SLC29A1</italic> rs9394992 and <italic>PRDX4</italic> rs518329, were also associated with outcomes in the doxorubicin group; however, these genes are not known to be involved in the pharmacology of doxorubicin, so further investigation is required to understand these effects. There were indications that three SNPs predicted to affect gemcitabine pharmacokinetics were associated with an effect on overall survival, most notably the <italic>CDA</italic> rs2072671 SNP, which was associated with reduced overall survival in the gemcitabine and docetaxel group, with worse survival in patients homozygous (rather than heterozygous) for the minor allele (this is referred to as a gene-dose effect). However, the same SNP was not associated with a difference in progression-free survival, and insufficient evidence is currently available to advocate routine testing of these SNPs to influence clinical decision-making.</p><p>Limitations of the current study include the fact that we used a gemcitabine and docetaxel schedule that used fewer cycles and lower doses than in the originally published schedule,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> which is widely used in other countries. Although we had a clear rationale for this decision, nevertheless we acknowledge that some might conclude that this limits the applicability of the trial results to the wider population of patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma beyond our trial. Additionally, more patients stopped treatment early on gemcitabine and docetaxel than doxorubicin, which might have reflected the fact that clinicians knew that patients could go on to receive doxorubicin, whereas the reverse was not true due to the limited availability of gemcitabine and docetaxel in the UK at that time outside of clinical trials.</p><p>How should these results inform our discussions with patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma? The data do not support superiority for gemcitabine and docetaxel over doxorubicin on survival outcomes. Subgroup analyses have not identified any subgroup for which gemcitabine and docetaxel was superior, and in particular we did not observe superiority for either leiomyosarcoma or uterine leiomyosarcoma. Although the similar progression-free survival and overall survival of gemcitabine and docetaxel and doxorubicin might support a conclusion that either schedule can be used according to patient or clinician preference, our results indicate the need for caution with such an approach, in that gemcitabine and docetaxel is more difficult to deliver than doxorubicin, and patients find it more toxic than doxorubicin, with some effects on quality of life. Furthermore, economic factors should be considered with the higher cost of the gemcitabine and docetaxel schedule. Thus, the overall clinical conclusion should be that doxorubicin remains standard of care as first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma, and that gemcitabine and docetaxel is not recommended as routine first-line treatment. There might of course be occasions when different choices are made depending on patient factors and preferences, such as using combination doxorubicin and ifosfamide for selected patients who need to optimise chances of tumour shrinkage, or using gemcitabine and docetaxel in patients with cardiac dysfunction that contraindicates use of doxorubicin. However, for most patients, these results will hopefully provide evidence for clinicians to consider with their patients when selecting first-line treatment for advanced soft-tissue sarcoma. The study also highlights the importance of doing randomised trials in rare cancers to rigorously compare new treatments with established standard treatments, rather than extrapolating promising results from smaller non-comparative trials.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="other" id="sbref10"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Francis</surname><given-names>MDN</given-names></name><name><surname>Charman</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Lawrence</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Grimer</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Bone and soft tissue sarcomas UK Incidence and Survival: 1996 to 2010.
