practice program can affect the gross motor performance and activities of daily living for
children with spastic diplegia and provides an effective and reliable clinical database
for future improvement of motor performances skills. [Subjects and Methods] This study
randomly assigned seven children with spastic diplegia to each intervention group
including that of a control group, task-oriented training group, and a high-variability
practice group. The control group only received neurodevelopmental treatment for 40
minutes, while the other two intervention groups additionally implemented a task-oriented
training and high-variability practice program for 8 weeks (twice a week, 60&#x02005;min per
session). To compare intra and inter-relationships of the three intervention groups, this
study measured gross motor performance measure (GMPM) and functional independence measure
for children (WeeFIM) before and after 8 weeks of training. [Results] There were
statistically significant differences in the amount of change before and after the
training among the three intervention groups for the gross motor performance measure and
functional independence measure. [Conclusion] Applying high-variability practice in a
task-oriented training course may be considered an efficient intervention method to
improve motor performance skills that can tune to movement necessary for daily livelihood
through motor experience and learning of new skills as well as change of tasks learned in
a complex environment or similar situations to high-variability practice.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Spastic diplegia</kwd><kwd>Task-oriented training</kwd><kwd>High-variability practice</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cerebral palsy is a persistent but changeable neurodevelopmental disorder that causes
limitations in activity due to a multifocal non-progressive disorder or damage of a
developing brain of a fetal or infant<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Children with spastic diplegia constitute the majority of children with cerebral palsy<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> in which they experience muscle weakness,
co-contraction of antagonist muscles as well as muscle coordination damage<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The low tone of the torso also causes
postural instability, lack of mobility, and muscle stiffness in the legs<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In other words, due to lack of antigravity
movement when performing functional activities, different parts of the body are involved,
particularly compensatory movements such as lifting the upper limbs or overly extending the
upper trunk<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>An effective task-oriented training to improve muscle strength or functioning of patients
with neurological disorder<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> is to provide
repetitive practices of well-organized important functional activities or related components
by including specific tasks into the training program<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therapeutic intervention for
children with cerebral palsy should be composed of goal-directed, functional, and meaningful
activities by considering the clinical type, degree of disability, cognitive level and
interest of the child. As such, to motivate and more easily induce functional movements from
children with cerebral palsy, interesting tasks related to daily livelihood should be
repetitively provided through task-oriented training<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, performing functional skills should also be trained, since
children with cerebral palsy show damage not only in the function and an ability to
accomplish tasks, but also in the quality of movement<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, if many changes are applied into the course of
repetitively practicing tasks to perform exact motor activity, children with cerebral palsy
may learn other performances from the same motor form and contribute to maintaining his/her
basic movement pattern while direction, velocity, position, and target is available<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, implications for the
training and performance of motor skills that have high motor control demands and require
precisely coordinated movement<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, it
helps to better maintain learning behavior, and allows for improved performance within the
boundaries of similar movement form, even if there is a change of task<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study investigates how a task-oriented training and high-variability practice program
could affect gross motor performance and activities of daily living for children with
spastic diplegia and provides an effective and reliable clinical database for future
training protocols to improve motor performance skills.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted through a two- group pretest-posttest control design to
investigate how task-oriented training and high-variability practices affect the gross motor
performance and activities of daily living for children with spastic diplegia. Specific
selection criteria for choosing the subject for this study includes children with cerebral
palsy of age 4&#x02013;7 all of whom have been diagnosed with spastic diplegia from a rehabilitation
medicine/neurosurgery (or neurology) specialist, children in phase II&#x02013;III of gross motor
function classifications (GMFCs), and children who are able to perform tasks as ordered by
the investigator and may engage in proper conversations. Exclusion criteria include children
with unstable seizures, children who have recently gone through chemoneurolysis or surgical
procedure for muscle stiffness within 6 months, and children with other illness or under
anticonvulsive medication. The purpose, method, and procedure of this study, as well as
information on direct/indirect discomfort or possible danger was explained to the subjects
before implementing this study (incl. legal attorney) and &#x0201c;informed consent&#x0201d; which stated
the voluntary participation of the subjects was obtained. Also, this study has been approved
by IRB of the Busan Catholic University Hospital and shall bear the responsibility of
protecting human rights, dignity, and safety of the subjects (IRB No. CUPIRB-2014-022).</p><p>This study randomly assigned seven children with spastic diplegia to each of the
intervention groups including the control group, the task-oriented training group, and the

receiving neurodevelopmental treatment. Task-oriented training was designed to improve body
locomotion ability, muscle strength and coordination based on normal motor development, and
allowed for interaction of the interest and participation of the children. The
high-variability practice group was designed to induce interest and active participation
from the children based on knowledge on the results from extrinsic feedback which was given
in random order after each task was completed throughout the course of the task-oriented
training program. In particular, given orders that were easy for the children to understand
were used to improve precision of motor skills and repertoire when combining verbal orders
to the complete task. All two training programs are composed of a 5 minute preparatory
exercise, a 50 minute main exercise, and a 5 minute of finishing exercise. During the main
exercise, each task was given to be performed within 10 minutes, including transfer time.
Therapeutic intervention was facilitated by a pediatric physiotherapist having completed
neurodevelopmental treatment education with more than 5&#x02005;years of clinical experience and an
adequately trained sub-investigator for task-oriented training and the high-variability
practice program whom aided correct posturing and movement of children with cerebral
palsy.</p><p>GMPM, a measuring tool used in this study, can measure supplementary skills, developmental
phases and muscle coordination of children aged 5&#x02013;12 in less than an hour using minimum
capability. This study observed five distinct features of body alignment, stability, muscle
coordination, weight shifting and dissociated movement through 20 items deducted from the
gross motor function assessment. The assessment score for each item was measured from
individualized criterion from 1 (severely abnormal) through to 5 (consistently normal),
after which the relative score for each performance items were shown in percentages of
maximum performable score (%)<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
validity coefficient for applying GMPM on children with cerebral palsy was 0.74&#x02013;0.84 and the
measurement tool was reported to be useful<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Functional independence measure for children, a revised version of
functional independence measure, was developed to measure the functional level of
independence of normal children (6 months&#x02013;8 yrs), developmental disorder (6 months&#x02013;12 yrs)
or children under 7&#x02005;years of mental age, and it can be used regardless of one&#x02019;s health
condition, development stage, level of education, and environment of the local

total of 18 items affiliated with six major assessment items of self-care, sphincter
control, mobility, transfer, communication, and social cognition. Each item has a 7-score
criterion (score 6&#x02013;7 does not need help, score 3&#x02013;5 needs help, score 1&#x02013;2 fully dependent)
with a total score ranging from 18 to 126. This measurement tool does not assess damage, but

significance level (&#x003b1;) used for statistical verification was set as 0.05. General features
of the subjects were calculated through descriptive statistics, and normality for measuring
variable was verified through a Shapiro-Wilk test. In order to analyze the difference of
gross motor performance and activities of daily living for the three intervention groups
before and after 8 weeks of training, a paired t-test was conducted. Moreover, a one-way
ANOVA was implemented to compare the difference in the amount of change before and after the
training among the three intervention groups. A post-hoc results were completed using the

movements which do not induce any interest and lacks any feedback for each movement, leading
to improper movements and thereby undermining training effects<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Children with cerebral palsy lack dissociated movement
due to spasticity, muscle weakness and decreased selective motor control<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, poor body alignment and
abnormal weight shifting may occur due to contracture development from pelvic asymmetry and
spaticity<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. As such, in order to
minimize the effect of the musculoskeletal system and neuromuscular system damage, it should
be recommended to learn motor control strategies that allows for maximum energy efficiency
and functional adjustment. Since children with cerebral palsy can receive more information
that is usable in an environment aside from direct tasks, they can more easily perform
precise perception activities than those that are more abstract, even if they involve the
same movement<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Task-oriented training provides interesting tasks to children with cerebral palsy in
objective functional aspects<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, and
repetitive training in an environment that can stimulate activity and participation which
may ultimately enhance motor performance. In addition, by applying high-variability practice
into the course of the task-oriented training course, this may induce the trainee to better
adjust to his/her ability to cope with errors involving distance, speed, direction or
relative timing of motor movement within activity phases through different practices in
which action variables or part of a task change when each practice is similar in
general.</p><p>Since high-variability practice allows for the pediatric physiotherapist to induce rapid
change in motor procedure, it can stimulate interest in movement forms suitable to the task
and adapt to selective diversity, thereby coordinating motor activities in a harmonious
manner. A study conducted by Latas et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>, showed that diverse tasks were practiced to improve finger muscle
coordination of adolescents suffering from down syndrome. As such, high-variability practice
can improve stability and muscle coordination which allows for the trainee to intentionally
perform precise, smooth, and efficient movements that are appropriate in each situation by
exercising mutual supplement and revision of movements based on speed, direction, magnitude
of force production, and biomechanical efficiency during the course of acquiring motor
skills.</p><p>Recent literature on motor control disability focuses on tasks that are important in daily
functioning and for all kinds of environments, and accepts the importance of frequent and
diverse tasks in motor tasks<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Children
with cerebral palsy receive inherent information from perception receptors, and other
information through various forms of extrinsic feedback receiving information from external
causes, and through this knowledge, children with cerebral palsy can understand the
principles and features of movement processes<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. In other words, the ability to conduct a safe and independent
daily life can be improved as the subjects independently find solutions for new tasks after
observing movements through internal/external physical stimulations and compiling them to
cope with the changing environment.</p><p>Limitations in the play of children with physical disabilities may affect the experiential
learning derived from play and may result in decreased independence, motivation,
imagination, creativity, assertiveness, social skills, and self-esteem<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Like in the case of children with cerebral palsy with
difficulty in their learning movement, they should be trained to remember solutions and use
them even when their ability to cope with new environments may be limited. As such,
pediatric physiotherapists should conduct challenging and meaningful treatment that can help
such children not only in their functioning but also their cognition so that they can
connect directly to their daily lives. High-variability practice can improve cognitive
ability by observing functional tasks and different environments through a feed-forward
mechanism, finding solutions for new tasks on his/her own, and making attempts to change
according to various situations. In other words, trainees can learn concepts, perceptions,
and language and improve his/her cognition and social skills by understanding the influence
of men and objects surrounding him/her through repetitive sessions on changes in attention
grabbing and functional tasks.</p><p>Pediatric physiotherapists should provide therapeutic intervention upon considering that
children with cerebral palsy suffer from not only difficulty in accomplishing tasks, but
also from limitations in the quality of movement with which they can perform a specific
activity in a precise manner. Applying high-variability practice into the course of the
task-oriented training course allows repetitive and diverse motor on objectives connected
with a functional task. Therefore, it may be considered as an efficient intervention method
to improve motor performance that can tune in with movements necessary in daily lives based
on experience and learning new skills and changes in a task learned in complex environment
or similar situations.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Rosenbaum</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Paneth</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Leviton</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>A report: the definition and classification of cerebral
