Ten percent of the world population at admission are affected by renal colic that is secondary to urolithiasis.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Men are affected 3&#x02013;4 times more than women.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] To relieve pain, the renal colic opioids are the first-line agents. Opioids&#x02019; effects are faster than nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, higher side effects of opioids have led to decreased use of opioids as analgesic agents without combination with other agents.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The combination therapy with NSAIDs and opiates could be a good choice for reducing the pain intensity and shortening the length of hospitalization in patients with acute renal colic caused by urolithiasis.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Fentanyl is a rapid-onset opioid with 90 times stronger analgesic potency than morphine. Over the past few years, various applicable forms of fentanyl have been developed. Fentanyl has few side effects such as hypotension, bradypnea, bradycardia, and apnea.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Entonox (mixture of 50% oxygen and 50% nitrous oxide) is effective and safe analgesic agent used for many years in different clinical conditions. Entonox is a rapid-acting inhalatory analgesic agent with central mechanism.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The most common side effect of entonox is transient nausea and headache.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The efficacy of entonox for pain relief has been evaluated and approved in the previous studies for many clinical conditions.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] However, there are few studies about the efficacy of entonox in acute renal colic.</p><p>Another pain-relieving agent that is used for many years is oxygen. Oxygen is used as a standard treatment for chest pain.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) can enhance antioxidant activity, accelerate the clearance of free radicals, increase blood oxygen content, improve microcirculation, and repair injured nerve tissue. Recently, HBO has been used in the treatment of fibromyalgia, complex regional pain syndrome, spasmodic headache, and postradiotherapy pain.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>After all, till now, no optimal drug regimen for pain relief in renal colic patients has been introduced. In this study, we aimed to compare combination of fentanyl + nitrous oxide with fentanyl + oxygen, as analgesic agents in patients with acute renal colic secondary to urolithiasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This prospective double-blinded clinical trial was performed in the emergency department of Alzahra and Kashani Hospitals in Isfahan, Iran, between April 2015 and March 2016. The study design was approved by the Ethics Committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, and all patients gave informed consent before taking part in this trial (IRCT code: IRCT2013020512369N1).</p><p>Using sequential sampling, we included a total number of 120 adult patients with acute renal colic, presenting to the emergency department of our center, during the study period [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Consort diagram of studied population</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JRMS-23-18-g001"/></fig><p>Inclusion criteria are as follows: age &#x0003e;18 years, high probability of renal colic diagnosis based on clinical signs and symptoms, stable hemodynamic (pulse rate = 60&#x02013;100, systolic blood pressure &#x0003e;100, blood oxygen saturation level [SPO<sub>2</sub>] &#x0003e;90%, respiratory rate = 8&#x02013;22), no use of analgesics during the last 24 h, absence of these conditions in patients history: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, intestinal obstruction, hypertension, heart failure, history of previous surgery on kidney and urinary tract, peptic ulcer, gastrointestinal bleeding, previous history of allergy to fentanyl or other analgesic agents, loss of consciousness, head or chest trauma, pneumocephalus, pneumothorax, drug abuse, retard menstruation, abdominal tenderness, rebound tenderness or guarding, and fill informed consent form.</p><p>Patients were excluded if the patient hemodynamic becomes unstable during the process of hospitalization, hypersensitivity reaction to analgesic drugs occurred, and the diagnosis was changed during the further investigations.</p><p>In the beginning, 50 &#x003bc;g fentanyl was infused for all the patients. The proper dose of fentanyl is 1&#x02013;2 &#x003bc;g/kg, but due to the condition that patients were resenting from pain and also need of urgent action, we infused 50 &#x003bc;g fentanyl for all patients. Before admission before the intervention, each patient was given a number based on a coincidental computer-based random digit generator. Afterward, according to this random numbering, we divided our patients into two groups: Group 1 (fentanyl + entonox) who had received odd numbers and Group 2 (fentanyl + O<sub>2</sub>) who had received even numbers. Group 1 inhaled gas of cylinders with number 1 labeled on them; Group 2 inhaled gas of number 2 cylinders. These cylinders appeared quite similar in shape, size, terms, and conditions and only differed in their contents and number. Group 1 was received mask of entonox and Group 2 was received mask of oxygen. Neither the patient nor the interviewer did not know which cylinder was contained which drug. Only supervisor was aware of this issue, but he was not involved at the time of the intervention.</p><p>Quantitative measurement of the pain was performed according to visual analog scale (VAS),[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] before the intervention and after 3, 5, 10, and 30 min of that. Pain scores were based on a standard 10-cm VAS. For numeric measurement of pain, patients were asked to give a number from 0 (completely painless) to 10 (the worst pain that has been experienced). Patients were asked to remove the mask if their pain was relieved. If the pain was not relieved after 30 min, 50 &#x003bc;g fentanyl was infused again and then pain severity was measured again by VAS. Finally, if the patient was still suffering from pain, another usual pain-relieving agents such as ketorolac and ketamine were administered to decrease the severity of patient's pain according to the patient's status and if there was no contraindication for usage of ketorolac and ketamine.</p><p>Patient's demographics as well as information about the patient's condition such as location of pain, family history of renal stone, and vital signs were obtained before the hospitalization. After all, data about the dosage of fentanyl and duration of hospitalization were recorded. The duration of hospitalization and severity of pain at specified times (at admission and 3, 5, 10, and 30 min after the intervention) were measured and compared between patients in two groups.</p><p>For pain relief consideration, VAS score should have reduced 3 score or changed to mild.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>All the statistical analyses were performed by SPSS V.19 (Chicago, IL, USA). The duration of hospitalization and pain scores were compared within groups by independent samples <italic>t</italic>-test.

First, analgesic drugs should not cause negative effects on chronic syndromes such as renal failure, coronary artery disease, and heart failure. Second, these drugs should not interfere with concomitant treatment, including antiplatelet drugs.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] In this study, we aimed to compare the efficacy of entonox + fentanyl versus O<sub>2</sub>+ fentanyl in the management of renal colic pain in emergency department (ED).</p><p>The first priority in renal colic is providing pain control. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids, and entonox (pain-relieving agents) are effective in pain killing. Recent studies clearly declared that mortality is greater among patients using NSAIDs as a pain-relieving agent in ED. Effect of opioids is faster than NSAIDs despite higher incidence of side effects.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>Entonox leads to rapid and effective analgesia with less sedation.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Entonox may be associated with adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting, dizziness, dry mouth, and buzzing in the ears in few patients ranging from 0% to 30%.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Nitrous oxide may cause cardiac depression and should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure and in those with chronic obstructive airway disease.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Entonox causes suppression of the central nervous system as well. Nitrous oxide (the effective agent in entonox) contributed to opioid system of the brain, particularly medial thalamic area and spinal cord, that have a lot of morphine-sensitive cells.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Entonox can be as effective as fentanyl in pain relieving with similar rate of side effects.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] A recent clinical trial performed by Kariman <italic>et al</italic>. showed that inhalation of entonox is an effective and safe analgesic regimen for acute renal colic and is more potent in relieving renal colic pain in comparison with morphine sulfate.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Oxygen is used as a standard treatment for chest pain. HBO can enhance antioxidant activity, accelerate the clearance of free radicals, increase blood oxygen content, improve microcirculation, and repair injured neural tissue.

Furthermore, the rate of pain relief by entonox and fentanyl was more rapid than that by O<sub>2</sub> and fentanyl. Both combination therapies showed a significant process of healing according to pain severity during 30 min. For those patients with no significant relief in their pain after 30 min, second dose of fentanyl was infused. After second-dose infusion, 11 patients were still suffering from severe pain.
