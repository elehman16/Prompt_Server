Evidence shows associations of physical activity and sedentary behaviour with health-related quality of life (HRQoL), however, these findings are based predominantly on duration measures of physical activity and sedentary behaviour (e.g., minutes/week), with less attention on frequency measures (e.g., number of bouts). We examined the association of HRQoL with physical activity and sedentary behaviour, using both continuous duration (average daily minutes) and frequency (average daily bouts&#x02265;10 min) measures. Baseline data from the WALK 2.0 trial were analysed. WALK 2.0 is a randomised controlled trial investigating the effects of Web 2.0 applications on engagement, retention, and subsequent physical activity change. Daily physical activity and sedentary behaviour (duration = average minutes, frequency = average number of bouts &#x02265;10 minutes) were measured (ActiGraph GT3X) across one week, and HRQoL was assessed with the &#x02018;general health&#x02019; subscale of the RAND 36-Item Health Survey. Structural equation modelling was used to evaluate associations. Participants (N = 504) were 50.8&#x000b1;13.1 (mean&#x000b1;SD) years old with a BMI of 29.3&#x000b1;6.0. The 465 participants with valid accelerometer data engaged in an average of 24.0&#x000b1;18.3 minutes and 0.64&#x000b1;0.74 bouts of moderate-vigorous physical activity per day, 535.2&#x000b1;83.8 minutes and 17.0&#x000b1;3.4 bouts of sedentary behaviour per day, and reported moderate-high general HRQoL (64.5&#x000b1;20.0). After adjusting for covariates, the duration measures of physical activity (path correlation = 0.294, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) and sedentary behaviour were related to general HRQoL (path coefficient = -0.217, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). The frequency measure of physical activity was also significant (path coefficient = -0.226, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) but the frequency of sedentary behaviour was not significantly associated with general HRQoL. Higher duration levels of physical activity in fewer bouts, and lower duration of sedentary behaviour are associated with better general HRQoL. Further prospective studies are required to investigate these associations in different population groups over time.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>589903</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9223-3324</contrib-id><name><surname>Kolt</surname><given-names>Gregory S.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This trial was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council (Project Grant number 589903).

In addition, physical activity participation has been shown to enhance health-related quality of life (HRQoL), a multidimensional measure of physical, functional, mental and social wellbeing [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In the general adult population, higher levels of physical activity have been associated with enhanced HRQoL outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In clinical populations, physical activity has also shown to be associated with HRQoL in survivors of colon cancer [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], adults with type-2 diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and breast cancer survivors [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Despite this evidence, a substantial proportion of Australian adults fail to participate in levels of physical activity conducive to health benefits [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Time constraints are one of the most commonly reported barriers to being physically active [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Evidence suggests, however, that shorter bouts of physical activity (i.e., &#x02264;10 minutes) accumulated across the day can provide similar health benefits to longer, sustained sessions of physical activity [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. As such, the World Health Organization [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] encourages adults to accumulate aerobic activity in bouts of at least 10 minutes, and current Australian physical activity guidelines encourage accumulation of 150 to 300 minutes of moderate intensity or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous intensity physical activity each week [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In many cases, these shorter bouts are likely to be more achievable for people with time constraints.</p><p>A growing body of evidence has also emerged suggesting an association between increasing sedentary behaviour and poor health outcomes, including increased risk of a range of chronic health conditions [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. To reduce the deleterious effects of sedentary behaviour on health, research findings suggest that benefits can be gained from breaking up prolonged periods of sedentary time [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and current Australian guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] suggest that adults minimise the amount of time they spend sitting, and break up long periods of sitting as often as possible.</p><p>Compared with physical activity, the association between sedentary behaviour and HRQoL is less established. Available evidence indicates that higher levels of self-reported leisure-time physical activity combined with lower levels of self-reported leisure-time sedentary behaviour [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and self-reported sitting [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] are associated with better HRQoL (assessed using the Spanish version of the SF-36 [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and a single item question, respectively). Similarly, when using self-reported screen time as an indicator of sedentary behaviour [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], adults reporting higher volumes of screen time paired with lower volumes of physical activity were more likely to report poorer self-reported HRQoL.</p><p>Most of the available evidence on the association between physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and HRQoL has been derived from studies using self-reported behavioural measures and have assessed physical activity and sedentary behaviour with duration measures (i.e., total time or energy expenditure). One particular study has examined the association between physical activity and HRQoL (measured by the EuroQol-5 Dimensions [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]) using both objective (ActiGraph accelerometers) and subjective (questionnaire) measures of physical activity [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Higher volumes of physical activity were associated with higher levels of HRQoL, however, the association between objectively measured physical activity and HRQoL was stronger than the association between subjectively measured physical activity and HRQoL [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Other studies have also demonstrated that higher levels of self-reported physical activity are associated with reduced coronary heart disease [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and higher levels of objectively measured physical activity are associated with reduced cardiovascular disease risk [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], regardless of whether activity is accumulated in few long bouts, or a lot of short bouts.</p><p>Loprinzi and Davis [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] examined the association between objectively measured bout (&#x02265;10 minutes in duration) and non-bout (&#x0003c;10 minutes in duration) moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and HRQoL (measured using the CDC HRQoL [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]) in 5,530 American adults aged &#x02265;20 years. Higher levels of participation in both bout and non-bout physical activity was associated with higher HRQoL, suggesting that MVPA, regardless of how it was accrued can enhance HRQoL. Differences between bout and non-bout MVPA have also been examined in relation to other health outcomes such as risk of all-cause mortality [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and cardiovascular disease biomarkers [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Loprinzi [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] found that engaging in more frequent bouts of at least 30 minutes of MVPA each day, in comparison to engaging in longer, less frequent bouts across the week, was a stronger predictor of C-reactive protein, an independent predictor of chronic disease risk. In another study, Loprinzi [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] examined the joint associations between objectively-measured physical activity and sedentary behaviour with HRQoL, as measured by the CDC HRQoL-4 [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and found that the duration measure of total daily sedentary behaviour was not independently associated with HRQoL.</p><p>As evidence continues to emerge on the benefits of shorter bouts of physical activity [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and the deleterious effect of prolonged bouts of sedentary time [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], it is important to consider whether the duration and frequency of these behaviours contribute differently to health outcomes such as HRQoL. Existing evidence suggests that both duration and frequency measures of objectively measured MVPA are associated with HRQoL [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]; and that duration measures of sedentary behaviour are not independently associated with HRQoL [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. There are no studies to our knowledge, however, that have compared duration and frequency measures of objectively measured sedentary behaviour with HRQoL.</p><p>Using baseline data from the WALK 2.0 trial [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], the purpose of this study was to examine the association of HRQoL with physical activity and sedentary behaviour, using both continuous duration (average daily minutes) and frequency measures (average daily number of bouts &#x02265;10 min).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This study utilised the baseline data from WALK 2.0, a trial investigating the effects of Web 2.0 applications on engagement, retention, and subsequent physical activity behaviour change in a web-based physical activity intervention [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><sec id="sec003"><title>The WALK 2.0 trial</title><p>The WALK 2.0 trial has been described in detail elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Briefly, WALK 2.0 is a three-arm randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing the effectiveness of two web-based interventions with a paper-based logbook physical activity intervention on a range of outcomes including: physical activity; HRQoL; anthropometric measures; website usage, engagement, and retention; internet self-efficacy, psychosocial variables, and system usability. Outcomes are assessed at baseline, and at 3, 12, and 18 months. The WALK 2.0 trial was registered prospectively with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12611000157976)&#x02013;see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=336443&#x00026;isReview=true">https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=336443&#x00026;isReview=true</ext-link>.</p><p>Participants were recruited for WALK 2.0 across 2 sites in Australia (South Western Sydney and Central Queensland). Recruitment was primarily through personalised invitation letters to an extract of individuals selected randomly from the Australian Electoral Commission electoral roll. Other forms of recruitment were through advertisement in local print media, email messages to university email lists, and through those who had registered with one of the partner universities as being interested in research participation.

Those in the Web 1.0 group participated in the existing 10,000 Steps program [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] designed to increase physical activity through the use of a pedometer, an online step log, individual self-monitoring features and electronic educational materials.

Participants were asked to wear the monitors for 7 consecutive days during waking hours, except for water-based activities or contact sports. The ActiGraph was affixed to an elastic belt to be worn on the wait with the ActiGraph positioned over the right hip. Units were initialised to collect triaxial acceleration and step count data using 1 second epochs. Prior to analyses the data were aggregated to 60 second epochs using Actilife software 6.6.3. Based on activity counts per minute, a customised Microsoft Excel macro, written in visual basic, was used to provide daily measures of MVPA (more than 1951 counts/min) or sedentary (less than 100 counts/min) behaviour [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], bouts of MVPA, bouts of sedentary time and wear time. Non-wear time was defined as 60 minutes of consecutive zero counts and included a 2 minute spike tolerance of 50 counts per minute of movement. Valid wear time was defined as a minimum of 10 hours of wear time on at least 5 days in the 7 day period, and was required to be included in the analysis. The average daily time spent in each of these activities was used as the duration measures of MVPA and sedentary behaviour. A bout was classified as any consecutive 10-minute period of MVPA or sedentary behaviour, and the average number of daily bouts was used as the frequency measures of MVPA and sedentary behaviour.</p><p>HRQoL was assessed using the 5-item &#x02018;general health&#x02019; subscale of the RAND 36-Item Health Survey (RAND-36), a license-free instrument developed from the original SF-36 Medical Outcomes Study survey [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Although both instruments contain the same survey items, the scoring algorithms for the body pain and general health subscales are slightly different in the RAND 36 [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. This has been discussed in detail elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], but briefly, all items are scored on a scale of 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating a more favourable health state. Missing data are excluded, and the scores are averaged for each construct to generate 8 separate scores. The RAND 36 has been validated for measuring HRQoL in Australian populations [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and has been shown to be suitable for use in general populations [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180072.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Data analyses</title><p>Descriptive analyses were completed and presented as means and standard deviations (SD) for continuous variables and as frequencies and proportions for categorical data. The duration and frequency measures of sedentary behaviour were highly correlated, as were the duration and frequency measures of physical activity, so regression modelling was not appropriate for this analysis. To account for multicollinearity, path analysis, a special case of structural equation modelling [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180072.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] was used to model the complex associations between duration and frequency measures of sedentary behaviour and physical activity and HRQoL. Due to positive skewness, log transformations of physical activity minutes and bouts were performed, and the log-transformed variables were used in the path analysis to evaluate whether the duration and frequency measures of physical activity and sedentary behaviour were associated with general HRQoL. This analysis also included covariates of age, gender, BMI, level of education, and activity monitor wear time. To evaluate the overall performance of this analysis, Chi square test statistic, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) index, Goodness of Fit Index (GFI), and the Bentler Comparative Fit Index (CFI) [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] were adopted as model fit indices. Typically, a Chi square test with a <italic>p</italic>-value of &#x0003e;0.05, RMSEA with a value close to zero, and CFI (or GFI) with a value close to one indicate a good model fit [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180072.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In addition to several overall model fit indices, we also examined the variance-covariance matrix to evaluate the model fit. Observation of the variance-covariance matrix of the path analysis facilitates further understanding of the relationships among the exogenous variables and provides additional information about the data. Path analysis was performed using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) 9.4 with the procedure CALIS, and path coefficients were evaluated for statistical significance with a <italic>p</italic>-value of &#x0003c;0.05.

Additionally, the physical activity bouts variable was significantly inversely related to HRQoL, suggesting that for a given level of physical activity duration, being active in fewer bouts was associated with better health. This result reinforces current physical activity guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180072.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] that are based on the findings of previous studies that have examined the association between physical activity and HRQoL [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. For example, higher levels of participation in objectively measured bout and non-bout physical activity was shown to be associated with higher HRQoL [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and both objective and subjective duration measures of physical activity were associated with better HRQoL [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] in adults aged 40&#x02013;60 years. Like our study, physical activity was objectively measured using validated activity monitors in those previous studies. In the study by Anokye and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], however, participants were categorised as &#x02018;physically active&#x02019; (i.e., achieving a minimum 90 minutes of moderate physical activity per week) or &#x02018;not physically active&#x02019; across a range of physical activity categories. By dichotomising the physical activity data, the extent of the variance in physical activity may be underestimated [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] and it can be difficult to compare these findings to those in the current study. Despite some heterogeneity of measurement tools used to assess HRQoL, our results show concordance with previous literature on the independent contribution of both duration and bouts of physical activity. In the current study, the general health subscale of the RAND 36 was used, while other studies have used instruments including the CDC HRQoL-4 [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], and the EuroQol-5 Dimensions [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] to measure HRQoL.</p><p>The small positive association between the bouts measure of sedentary behaviour and general HRQoL, however, was not significant, suggesting that the duration measure of sedentary behaviour may be more influential on general HRQoL. This finding is consistent with other studies that have examined the association between self-reported duration of sedentary behaviour and HRQoL [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], but diverges from recent literature that emphasises the importance of breaking up sedentary time for decreasing health risks [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. It could be that self-report measures are less accurate in assessing sedentary behaviour, and as such, influence findings. Interestingly, the current finding differed from the results of an earlier study that examined the joint associations of objectively-measured physical activity and sedentary behaviour with HRQoL [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. After adjusting for covariates, Loprinzi found that continuous sedentary behaviour was not independently associated with HRQoL [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><sec id="sec009"><title>Implications for practice</title><p>These findings indicate that both higher physical activity and lower duration of sedentary behaviour are associated with improved HRQoL. Both duration and frequency measure of MVPA are associated with HRQoL.

However given the limitations of this research, further studies are needed to replicate these observations and identify potential mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Implications for research</title><p>The use of path analysis allows researchers to test complex models over time, and allows for comparison with similarly complex models.

Although our hypothesised model showed excellent fit to the data in this sample, such a model should be tested in longitudinal studies and other populations. Further research should consider both duration and frequency measures of sedentary behaviour and physical activity.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Many of the studies that have examined the association between physical activity, sedentary time and HRQoL have focussed on older adults [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], or adults with chronic conditions [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In a systematic review of the literature, Bize et al. [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] recognised that older adults and individuals with chronic disease often present with particular challenges and needs related to their HRQoL profile, and identified a need for further evidence regarding the benefits of physical activity on HRQoL in healthy populations. This study builds upon the earlier findings of Loprinzi [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] in examining key differences between duration and frequency measures of physical activity and HRQoL, and adds to the limited body of evidence examining the association between sedentary behaviour and HRQoL.</p><p>The results of the current study should be interpreted in light of the potential limitations. The eligibility criteria used to assess participants&#x02019; eligibility to enrol in the study purposefully excluded those who were engaging in more than 30 minutes of physical activity on five or more days of the week [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. This may have restricted the true physical activity variability that exists within a general population, and may have influenced the findings of the study. The cross-sectional nature of the analysis only provides evidence of associations between physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and HRQoL, and cannot determine causal relationships. Although this study is cross-sectional, unlike many of the studies included in an earlier systematic review of the literature [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], this study used objectively measured data on physical activity and sedentary behaviour. This is an important strength of the current study, as objective measures of physical activity and sedentary behaviour are less prone to measurement error and recall bias, and are often more representative of an individual&#x02019;s true physical activity and sedentary behaviour. One potential limitation of the use of objectively measured data is that we could not delineate domain-specific physical activity and sedentary behaviour, and as such, the amount of time spent in specific domains of physical activity and sitting time (e.g., leisure, occupational, transportation, socialising) could not be established. A final potential limitation relates to the lack of consensus on what the minimum duration should be to be considered a &#x0201c;bout&#x0201d; of physical activity or sedentary behaviour. Whilst in this study we used 10 minutes, further research is still needed to establish whether this length of bout is the most appropriate for both physical activity and sedentary behaviour. It could be that examining pattern distribution of bouts of physical activity and sedentary behaviour provides a more robust measure by which to relate to health outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].</p><p>The use of path analysis (a special case of structural equation modelling or SEM) is a further strength of this study, as this particular modelling procedure addresses issues of multicollinearity, and allows for identification of direct and indirect effects. SEM can be used to evaluate the underlying association structure of variables, especially for complex models [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180072.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. This approach often requires a large sample size for a precise model estimation, because a regular SEM usually includes latent variables in the model, generating more parameters [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. With the sample size of this study, it could have been unsatisfactory to use a regular latent structure SEM that involved more parameters. In this study, we adopted path analysis, which did not require latent variables in the model. Thus, the path analysis was well suited to address our research questions with available data, and to provide more reliable statistical inferences.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec012"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Previous evidence suggests that duration and frequency measures should be considered as different components of behaviour, rather than as corresponding or equivalent measures of the same behaviour [<xref rid="pone.0180072.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. This study is one of the first to examine the association of HRQoL with objectively-measured physical activity and sedentary behaviour, using both continuous duration (total minutes) and frequency (number of bouts &#x02265;10 min) measures of these behaviours. There was a significant association between both the frequency of physical activity, the duration measures of physical activity and sedentary behaviour and the outcome of HRQoL.
