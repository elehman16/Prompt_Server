The control group was given the usual care and conventional drug therapy after PCI. The examinational group was given the CR on the basis of the routine therapy. GPs formulated individualized program of aerobic exercise, which depended on the patients&#x02019; clinical condition and the cardiovascular risk stratification. CR could be performed on outpatients at their homes or at specialized rehabilitation facilities in the community. This could be supervised by GPs and accompanied by family members. Phase II CR should be optimally initiated at the second week after patients were discharged, which had 2 courses, each course required 3 to 4 weeks. The most available and simple form of exercise was walking, however, other forms of aerobic exercises were acceptable. The following approaches were used in CR to set the acceptable workload: heart rate (HR) was acceptable lower than 130 bpm or resting HR plus 30 bpm, exercise intensity could be measured subjectively by the Borg scale. The recommended rating of perceived exertion (RPE) score was no more than 11 to 15, from the beginning 50&#x0200a;kcal/time to the next course 250 to 300&#x0200a;kcal/time. The patients should exercise 2 to 3&#x0200a;times/wk, they could take interval or continuous training for 15 to 30&#x0200a;minutes. Regardless of the form of physical activity, the main training session of phase II and III would start following a 10-min warm-up, and finish with a 10-min cool-down exercise. HR, BP, energy consumption, movement distance, and RPE were supervised by the GPs before and after the exercise. Phase III started from the 3rd month to 1 year (in our study the endpoint was the 6th month). The target HR was 60% to 75% of the maximal HR, the RPE score was no more than 12 to 16, and exercise intensity was 300 to 400&#x0200a;kcal/time. The intensity was 30 to 45&#x0200a;min/time, not less than 3 to 5 times a week. Phase II and III exercise should be terminated or modified if the patient had any uncomfortable symptoms.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> In this study, we monitored the exercise capacity by a 6-minute walk test (6-MWT) in rehabilitation group, by using a pedometer (model for Japanese omron MBB-HJ-105) to record the total effective steps, the distance, and the calories (kcal). Out-of-hospital early rehabilitation (Phase II, end of 2nd month): started from the second week after discharge from hospital, for a total of 2 courses, 1 course lasting 3 to 4 weeks; out-of-hospital late rehabilitation (Phase III, end of 6th month): started from the 3rd month to the 6th month. We examined the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by the echocardiography and detected the cardiovascular risk factors, including body mass index (BMI), BP, lipid, blood sugar (BS) levels, myocardial necrosis markers in the course of 2nd month (phase II) and 6th month (phase III).</p></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>EpiData 3.1 (The Epidata Association, Odense, Denmark) statistical software was used for database design and data entry.

After 50 years of research and development, the benefit of CR was now fully supported by clinical research evidence. Meta-analysis confirmed that exercise-based CR was associated with significant reductions in cardiac mortality, post-MI reinfarction, and all cause mortality.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> Mortality was negatively correlated with the participation time of rehabilitation. As an independent intervention factor after myocardial infarction, CR can reduce the incidence of cardiac events and mortality, significantly improve patient's body function (e.g., vo2 Max)<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> and their quality of life.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup></p><p>The conception of CR has been gradually applied in clinical treatment. It was clearly put forward in the 5 prescriptions in Chinese expert consensus about rehabilitation and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease,<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> which was consisted of medication, exercise, psychological counseling, education, and smoking cessation. As a core part, exercise rehabilitation has many advantages, such as reducing the vascular inflammation,<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> enhancing vascular endothelial function, and increasing the coronary collateral blood flow.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> It has been confirmed that exercise rehabilitation could significantly reduce the incidence of in-stent restenosis for AMI patients who underwent PCI.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> Community-based rehabilitation supervised by GPs is not widely used because of lacking in convenient and feasible technology. This study was to explore possible ways to be carried out in the community. The pedometer method was implemented for exercise rehabilitation with quantitative monitoring, the 6-MWT and the RPE index were used to evaluate AMI patients&#x02019; exercise capacity. The formulation of exercise prescription was based on the evaluation of risk stratification of CHD, heart function, physical storage, and the general condition of the patients and their preferences. Through phase II and III of exercise rehabilitation, the LVEF and NYHA classification were significantly improved.</p><p>6-MWT is safe, reliable, and also has practical value. It is an objective examination to evaluate the exercise tolerance and exercise capacity of AMI patients in the community, and it can assess the extent of patients&#x02019; recovery during the rehabilitation.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> Instead of using the submaximal exercise test, the low power 6-MWT is simpler and safer which is more similar to the patients&#x02019; daily activities and encourage more patients to take part in. Our study was a community-based rehabilitation program, so the technical monitoring method was based on the implementation of the conditions, the level of health services and patients&#x02019; health situation. Therefore, 6-MWT and the RPE index were used to evaluate AMI patients&#x02019; exercise capacity and the methods were used to guide the rehabilitation. The results of this study reflected the patients&#x02019; physical changes after the rehabilitation, and cardiac adverse events did not occur in the trial. Therefore, we believed that this method could be used to evaluate the cardiac function and physical fitness under close monitoring, and to guide the formulation and adjustment for the exercise prescription.</p><p>Walking is the most popular, basic, and important physical activity. The Pedometer is the most important tool as an intervention to heighten physical activities. Pedometer can record the steps in a day, and convert the data to corresponding kilometer and consumed energy. Patients can know their rehabilitation progress with the help of a pedometer. They can adjust exercise intensity and increase the confidence of rehabilitation. Besides, it can also help the GPs to improve the exercise rehabilitation plans. In this study, it showed that patients could easily use the pedometer, and the results reflected patients&#x02019; physical improvement. By using pedometer, AMI patients could set up their own rehabilitation plans and supervise themselves to take part in physical activities.</p><p>After this study, we found improvements of BP and BMI in rehabilitation group compared with control group, but they all had improvement in BS. Compared the effect of secondary prevention between 2 groups, rehabilitation group was better than control group. The result has close relation with the exercise rehabilitation. Although the exercise intensity of rehabilitation group was not vigorous, it was good for reducing cardiovascular risk factors. We also can&#x02019;t deny the important impact of comprehensive intervention in controlling the cardiovascular risk factors, such as health education and nutrition guidance. Therefore, we should pay more attention to use multiple measures in CR. In a word, comprehensive rehabilitation including exercise, health education, and psychology rehabilitation are all absolutely necessary.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup></p><p>Above all, the community-based CR for AMI patients can improve cardiac ejection fraction, increase exercise tolerance, improve the patient's physical status, reduce cardiovascular risk factors. It must be emphasized that the good result should be established by the foundation of close cooperation between cardiologists and general practitioners, also the importance of cooperation of patients and their families should not be ignored. In this study the use of pedometer and 6-MWT is safe and effective, the feasibility is high by GPs in the community, it can be used as an important part of the overall treatment for myocardial infarction. The sample of this study is small, problems such as the insufficiency of health education and the training of GPs still exist, we expect more studies with large samples and multicenters of CR program to promote and improve the community-based rehabilitation program.</p><p>Treatment of AMI patients has always been the spotlight-subject.
