Optimising community-residing stroke survivors&#x02019; capability to self-manage their health is integral. Recent systematic reviews have shown that stroke self-management programmes were associated with significant improvement in stroke survivors&#x02019; health-related quality of life and self-efficacy. However some programmes were not designed with an underpinning theoretical framework. The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a nurse-led stroke self-management programme with usual care on recovery of community-residing stroke survivors.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A single-blinded, two-arm, randomised controlled trial will be conducted. Patients with a history of first or recurrent ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke who will be discharged to home settings will be recruited from acute stroke units of three acute public hospitals in Hong Kong. The estimated sample size is 160 (80 participants per group). Eligible participants will be randomised to receive either usual care or a 4-week nurse-led community-based self-management programme plus usual care after discharge. The programme, underpinned by Bandura&#x02019;s constructs of self-efficacy and outcome expectation, includes one individual home visit, two community-based group sessions, and three follow-up phone calls. Primary outcomes include stroke survivors&#x02019; self-efficacy and outcome expectation of performing self-management behaviours. Secondary outcomes include health-related quality of life, satisfaction with performance of self-management behaviours, depressive symptoms, and community reintegration. Participants will be assessed at baseline and at 8 weeks after randomisation. Generalised estimating equations will be performed to evaluate the significance of changes in outcomes over time by treatment condition. Research ethics approvals were obtained.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>It is expected that stroke survivors receiving the stroke self-management programme will have improved self-efficacy, outcome expectation, and performance of stroke self-management behaviours. Enhanced quality of life and level of community reintegration, and decreased depressive symptoms are also expected. The study results will provide valuable evidence to inform future identification and evaluation of best approach to deliver stroke self-management programmes to enhance community-residing stroke survivors&#x02019; recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02112955">NCT02112955</ext-link>; date of registration: 09/04/2014</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Disease management</kwd><kwd>Self-efficacy</kwd><kwd>Community-dwelling</kwd><kwd>Quality of life</kwd><kwd>Community reintegration</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Stroke is the second leading cause of global death with the death toll amounting to 6.7 million (11.9&#x000a0;% of all deaths) in 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In Hong Kong, stroke was the fourth leading cause of death in 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Stroke is a significant cause of disability with survivors having a higher risk of depressive symptoms and a lowered quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Indeed stroke recovery is long-term and demanding, encompassing not only physical rehabilitation, but also coping with cyclic frustrations and adapting to new life roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Previous studies found poorer functional ability, more depressive symptoms, and lower self-esteem were significantly associated with participation restriction 12&#x000a0;months post-stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The period for optimal recovery inevitably extended far beyond in-patient rehabilitation. The level of complexity in managing physical and psychosocial needs after stroke is intensified when stroke survivors return home and healthcare professionals are not immediately available to provide support. Furthermore when at home support from family may decrease as they return to their normal life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Provision of effective community-based interventions to optimise stroke survivors&#x02019; capability to manage their post-stroke challenges is important to foster independence and early reintegration to pre-stroke life.</p><p>Self-management refers to an individual&#x02019;s active participation in managing the symptoms, treatment, physical and psychosocial consequences of a chronic illness. There are three main components of chronic disease self-management including medical, emotional and role management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. To attain effective self-management, practicing core self-management skills including goal-setting, problem-solving, decision-making, resources utilisation and communication with healthcare professionals is crucial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A recent systematic review of nine randomised and six non-randomised studies reported benefits of stroke self-management programmes in physical outcomes, quality of life, and confidence in recovery among stroke survivors. However the essential contents and the best approach to deliver the programmes for stroke survivors are yet to be determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Stroke self-management programmes are complex interventions given the interaction of multiple components of interventions with varying strengths, doses, or contents. According to the Medical Research Council guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], designing complex interventions with an underlying theoretical premise enables its systematic development and implementation, and informs selection of appropriate outcome indicators. Furthermore it helps predict and explain the mechanism of change in target behaviours or the relationship between interventions and outcomes. A recent systematic review was conducted to examine the effectiveness of theory-based stroke self-management programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The review included three randomised controlled trials examining three community-based programmes based on the Stanford Chronic Disease Self-management programme underpinned by Bandura&#x02019;s construct of self-efficacy. The results showed potential benefits of the programmes in improving stroke survivors&#x02019; self-efficacy and health-related quality of life. However only two of the three included studies explicitly described how the theory informed programme design and implementation, and measured stroke survivors&#x02019; changes in self-efficacy. The other study neither linked the programme to Bandura&#x02019;s four sources of self-efficacy nor measured self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. There is also insufficient evidence on effectiveness of different strategies to enhance community-residing stroke survivors&#x02019; self-efficacy in managing their health conditions. All studies were conducted in Western countries and were delivered by healthcare professionals or trained peer leaders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. There has been no study which assessed the effectiveness of stroke self-management programmes delivered by nurses for Chinese stroke survivors.</p><p>In Hong Kong, stroke patients, after having their acute medical conditions stabilised, are either transferred to rehabilitation hospitals for continued rehabilitation, or discharged directly to their homes, old aged homes or other residential care homes depending on their progress. Community-based support for stroke survivors, particularly for those after returning home, often includes stroke support groups, private physiotherapy or occupational therapy, and social services offered by non-government organisations such as vocational training. However, support programmes for community-residing stroke survivors to promote their psychological and social well-being, as well as to enhance their knowledge and skills for better reintegration into the community and assumption of post-stroke social and life roles are relatively insufficient. Given the potential programme benefits, it would be worthwhile to determine the effectiveness of a community-based nurse-led stroke self-management programme underpinned by a theoretical framework for Chinese stroke survivors. The findings of such a study would inform future identification and evaluation of best strategies to deliver effective stroke self-management programmes.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Research aim</title><p>To examine the effectiveness of a nurse-led community-based self-management programme for improving recovery among Chinese community-residing stroke survivors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Research objectives</title><p>To determine the effectiveness of the programme on improving community-residing stroke survivors&#x02019;<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>self-efficacy, outcome expectation, and satisfaction with performance of self-management behaviours;</p></list-item><list-item><p>health-related quality of life;</p></list-item><list-item><p>depressive symptoms; and</p></list-item><list-item><p>community reintegration.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>A two-arm, single-blinded randomised controlled will be conducted (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

The programme is aimed at enhancing community-residing stroke survivors&#x02019; capabilities in self-managing their post-stroke health conditions. It includes one 1.5-hour individual home visit, two 1.5-hour group sessions held in a community centre, and three follow-up phone-calls (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The programme is underpinned by Bandura&#x02019;s constructs of self-efficacy and outcome expectation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The programme will be delivered by the principal investigator who is a registered nurse experienced in stroke care and chronic disease management. Each participant will receive a programme booklet and two DVDs specifically designed for this programme. The booklet provides information about stroke recovery and self-management, and records participants&#x02019; goals and action plans. The DVDs contain video clips of experience sharing by 15 stroke survivors who have successfully managed their stroke. A panel of experts including two nurse academics, two advanced practice nurses, one nurse manager and one physician who are experienced in stroke care has reviewed the programme contents and the booklet. A protocol detailing the programme contents and delivery methods have been developed to ensure consistent delivery of the programme. The programme will commence when six participants have been assigned to the intervention group and repeated to accommodate all participants assigned to this band. Family members or informal carers of each participant who are interested may join the programme as an accompanying person.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Overview of the nurse-led community-based self-management programme for community-residing stroke survivors</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Week</th><th>Programme components</th><th>Key contents</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Home visit (at participant&#x02019;s home)</td><td>- Perform an individualised assessment.<break/>- Provide information about stroke self-management.<break/>- Establish a short-term goal and an action plan.<break/>- Video viewing.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Group sessions (in a community centre)</td><td>- Discuss the physical and psychosocial consequences of stroke.<break/>- Discuss the practical tips of managing post-stroke challenges.<break/>- Facilitate reflection and experience sharing among the group.<break/>- Explore alternative ways to better implement the action plans.<break/>- Practice the use of core self-management skills.<break/>- Video viewing.</td></tr><tr><td>3 &#x00026; 4</td><td>Three follow-up phone calls</td><td>- Review progress towards goal attainment.<break/>- Provide individualised feedback and positive reinforcement.<break/>- Encourage to continue, revise, or set a new short-term goal.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Theoretical framework of the self-management programme</title><p>Bandura&#x02019;s construct of self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] will be adopted to guide the proposed programme design and implementation. Self-efficacy refers to an individual&#x02019;s confidence to perform an action to reach a desired goal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Judgment of one&#x02019;s self-efficacy determines the course of action required, degree of effort, and perseverance to continue an action even in face of obstacles. Self-efficacy is developed through four sources of information namely mastery experience, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and minimising physiological or emotional arousal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Substantial literature reported increased self-efficacy leads to modification of health behaviours, and better patient outcomes such as quality of life or perceived health status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Outcome expectation, another central construct of Bandura&#x02019;s social cognitive theory, refers to an individual&#x02019;s judgement of the likelihood that performance of a particular action will produce a certain outcome. It takes three major forms including physical, social and self-evaluative effects. Within each form, positive expectations serve as incentives while negative expectations serve as disincentives to one&#x02019;s performance of an activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Bandura suggests that the initiation and continuation of a particular activity or behaviour would be best predicted by the combined influence of self-efficacy beliefs and types of outcome expectation. The stronger one believes in own ability to perform a specific activity and the outcome of that activity, the more likely that one will initiate and maintain the behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In this study, the influences of self-efficacy and outcome expectancy beliefs on stroke survivors&#x02019; performance in stroke self-management behaviours will be addressed when designing the programme. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> outlines the theoretical framework of the programme.

A card indicating participants&#x02019; involvement in the study and means of urgent contact will be provided to each participant after obtaining the consent. The consented participants&#x02019; demographic and clinical information will be retrieved from their medical records. Baseline and follow-up assessments will be conducted by two research assistants. The participants will be scheduled via phone by a research assistant for baseline assessment within one month after their discharge from hospital. Immediately after baseline assessment is completed, the participants will be randomly assigned to either the intervention or the control group. At 8 weeks after randomisation, the participants will be scheduled via phone by the research assistant again for follow-up assessment. The research assistants will administer the assessment tools in a face-to-face interview at the participants&#x02019; homes. The administration of the questionnaires has been pilot tested among six Chinese community-dwelling stroke survivors (mean age 55&#x000a0;years, SD 10.35, range 35&#x02013;64 years).

This study adopts Bandura&#x02019;s constructs of self-efficacy and outcome expectation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] which considers both efficacy and outcome expectancy beliefs and the methods for improving these, as the underlying theoretical premise to guide the programme design, implementation and evaluation. Maintaining hopes for positive outcomes would be important incentives to stroke survivors&#x02019; pursuance in stroke self-management behaviours given a certain level of physical functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It is expected that stroke survivors receiving the stroke self-management programme will have improved self-efficacy, outcome expectation, and performance of self-management behaviours. Enhanced health-related quality of life and level of community reintegration, and decreased depressive symptoms are also be expected. The study results will provide valuable evidence to inform future identification and evaluation of best approaches to deliver stroke self-management programmes to enhance community-residing stroke survivors&#x02019; recovery.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ADL</term><def><p>Activities of Daily Living</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GEE</term><def><p>Generalised Estimating Equation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MMSE</term><def><p>Mini Mental State Examination</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NIHSS</term><def><p>National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SSEQ</term><def><p>Stroke Self-Efficacy Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SSQOL</term><def><p>Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>Not applicable.</p><sec id="FPar5"><title>Funding</title><p>There is no sources of funding for the research reported.</p></sec><sec id="FPar6"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>Not applicable.</p></sec><sec id="FPar7"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>SHSL, AMC and JPCC contributed to the conception and design of the study.
