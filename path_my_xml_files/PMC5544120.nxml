Relevantly, enduring improvements in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms have been found in response to 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy. There is evidence that lasting changes in the personality feature of &#x0201c;openness&#x0201d; occur in response to hallucinogens, and that this may potentially act as a therapeutic mechanism of change. The present study investigated whether heightened Openness and decreased Neuroticism served as a mechanism of change within a randomized trial of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD. The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) Global Scores and NEO PI-R Personality Inventory (NEO) Openness and Neuroticism Scales served as outcome measures. Results indicated that changes in Openness but not Neuroticism played a moderating role in the relationship between reduced PTSD symptoms and MDMA treatment. Following MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, increased Openness and decreased Neuroticism when comparing baseline personality traits with long-term follow-up traits also were found. These preliminary findings suggest that the effect of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy extends beyond specific PTSD symptomatology and fundamentally alters personality structure, resulting in long-term persisting personality change. Results are discussed in terms of possible mechanisms of psychotherapeutic change.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>MDMA</kwd><kwd>posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</kwd><kwd>NEO personality</kwd><kwd>openness</kwd><kwd>treatment outcome</kwd><kwd>psychotherapy</kwd><kwd>pharmacotherapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-0269881117711712"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III) formalized the modern conceptualization of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by providing unifying criteria for symptoms intrinsically linked to a catastrophic event and characterized by persistent re-experiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal causing psychological distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (<xref rid="bibr1-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>). Although there have been minor revisions to these criteria in subsequent DSM versions, this definition has largely been unchallenged despite controversies (<xref rid="bibr19-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Friedman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr48-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Spitzer et al., 2007</xref>). Many critics have questioned whether the DSM diagnosis of PTSD encompasses the full spectrum of symptoms often associated with PTSD (e.g. psychological fragmentation, loss of a sense of safety, trust, and self-worth, loss of a coherent sense of self) (<xref rid="bibr27-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Herman, 1992</xref>). Specifically, the current diagnostic criteria do not capture the profound alterations in personality reported by a subset of individuals exposed to the most severe trauma.</p><p>As such, the concept of &#x0201c;complex PTSD&#x0201d; has been introduced to capture pervasive personality change associated with PTSD (<xref rid="bibr27-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Herman, 1992</xref>, <xref rid="bibr28-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). While this distinction is not formally recognized within the DSM, the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) includes a provisional concept that is in relative accord with this notion, classified as &#x0201c;enduring personality change following a catastrophic experience&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bibr55-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 1992</xref>). Similarly to DSM-III PTSD, this diagnosis requires a precipitating extreme stressor but also notes changes in personality to include pervasive hostility, mistrust, withdrawal, feelings of emptiness, hopelessness, and estrangement. Indeed, impulsivity, negative self-perception, somatization, survivor guilt, hostility, disturbed emotional responses, and low self-esteem have been identified as persisting personality changes that emerge as a result of extreme trauma (<xref rid="bibr4-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Beltran and Silove, 1999</xref>). Supportive of these diagnostic criteria, hostile and/or mistrustful attitudes specifically have been identified as prominent symptoms following catastrophic experience in a qualitative analysis conducted with 24 trauma clinicians (<xref rid="bibr5-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Beltran et al., 2008</xref>). Beltran and colleagues addressed critics&#x02019; ongoing concerns regarding the reliability, validity, and clinical utility of this diagnostic category, as well as skepticism that personality could be fundamentally altered by events in adulthood (<xref rid="bibr5-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Beltran et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>To our knowledge, no study has investigated change in personality associated with PTSD treatment response. While many personality theorists would argue that personality trait is a relatively stable construct throughout much of adulthood and not subject to change, there is evidence that links certain personality features to trauma experience. Specifically, extremely high Neuroticism scores on the NEO Personality Inventory (NEO PI) were found in a sample of Vietnam veterans with combat-related PTSD (<xref rid="bibr30-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Hyer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bibr49-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Talbert et al., 1993</xref>). Similarly, higher NEO PI Neuroticism scores were significantly associated with a history of childhood sexual, physical, and emotional abuse in undergraduate college students (<xref rid="bibr39-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Mathews et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, a study examining PTSD symptoms in older adults who had suffered myocardial infarction reported a positive correlation between NEO PI (Revised) (NEO PI-R) Neuroticism and re-experiencing, avoidant, and hyperarousal symptoms (<xref rid="bibr11-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Chung et al., 2006</xref>). Overall, there is a paucity of studies investigating personality change associated with PTSD. Most studies to date have been descriptive, and it is hard to determine the degree to which change is related to underlying premorbid personality (i.e. vulnerability to PTSD) and whether there are changes that are specific to PTSD.</p><p>Work dating back to the 1960s&#x02013;1970s investigating mechanisms of personality change suggests that classic psychedelics, when used in a therapeutic context, can cause lasting beneficial change in personality with possible therapeutic implications (<xref rid="bibr23-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Greer and Tolbert, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bibr37-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">McGlothlin and Arnold, 1971</xref>). In modern research, Griffiths and colleagues studied the effects of oral psilocybin on psilocybin-naive normal volunteers (<xref rid="bibr25-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Griffiths et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bibr24-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). In this study, subjects rated the experience positively as causing substantial insight about personal meaning and spiritual growth. Furthermore, sustained positive changes in attitudes and behavior that were reported were validated by similar changes rated by observers familiar with the subjects. Fourteen months later, the same participants rated the psilocybin-occasioned experience as being among the five most personally meaningful and among the five most spiritually significant experiences of their lives, with 64% indicating that the experience increased well-being or life satisfaction. Extending these findings, the effect of psilocybin on changes in the five broad domains of personality using the NEO PI-R found that personality traits of &#x0201c;Openness&#x0201d; increased following a high-dose psilocybin session and were generally sustained in those who had a &#x0201c;mystical&#x0201d; experience during their session more than one year after the session (<xref rid="bibr38-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">MacLean et al., 2011</xref>). These authors speculated about the potential clinical application and therapeutic benefit of change in the personality variable of Openness as result of pharmacologically induced &#x0201c;mystical&#x0201d; experiences. Consistently with this notion, a correlational link between spirituality and improved functional outcomes in relation to substance use and symptoms of anxiety and depression in cancer patients has been found (<xref rid="bibr33-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Kelly et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr36-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">McCoubrie and Davies, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, &#x000b1;3, 4- methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), which shares some properties with psilocybin and other classic psychedelic compounds, has been used in clinical trials as an adjunct, or enhancing agent, for therapeutic change in combination with psychotherapy for PTSD. Initial findings from our group have been promising, showing significant reductions in PTSD symptoms that are on average sustained up to 45.4 &#x000b1; 17.3 months post treatment after several sessions of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy (<xref rid="bibr42-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Mithoefer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bibr44-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Oehen et al., 2013</xref>). While the pharmacological mechanism of action of MDMA as a PTSD treatment is not well understood, MDMA is known to cause serotonin release and release of the neurohormones oxytocin, prolactin, and cortisol (<xref rid="bibr16-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Dumont et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr31-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Hysek et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bibr32-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr52-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">van Wel et al., 2012</xref>). It is possible that this pharmacology might augment exposure-based therapy by temporarily reducing avoidance, allowing patients to tolerate feelings associated with revisiting the trauma memory and fully engage in the exposure (<xref rid="bibr40-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Mithoefer, 2013</xref>). In controlled trials studying MDMA administration in normal volunteers, subjects have reported that the drug produces distinctive subjective pleasurable effects (<xref rid="bibr8-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Cami et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bibr26-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Harris et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bibr50-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Tancer and Johanson, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bibr53-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Vollenweider et al., 1998</xref>), and seems to reduce activity in the left amygdala, a brain area associated with anxiety and stress reactivity (<xref rid="bibr21-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Gamma et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Psychological research suggests that MDMA increases prosocial feelings and behaviors, which, in turn, appears to reduce negative mood when subjects are asked to think of a difficult memory (<xref rid="bibr3-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Bedi et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bibr2-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr10-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Carhart-Harris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr20-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Frye et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr31-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Hysek et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bibr32-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Others have proposed inhibition of the fear response to a perceived emotional threat that allows the patient to place the emotional sequelae of past experiences into a realistic perspective in their current emotional lives and relationships as another potential psychological mechanism of change for MDMA (<xref rid="bibr23-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Greer and Tolbert, 2007</xref>).To date, no study has investigated the relationship between MDMA and personality changes in subjects with PTSD. While a single catastrophic event can result in PTSD and/or &#x0201c;complex&#x0201d; PTSD with enduring adverse personality changes, it would seem possible that the converse might also be true (i.e. changes in certain personality features could reduce PTSD symptoms). The present study theorized that the profound therapeutic effect of MDMA in PTSD-treatment resistant individuals is influenced by its ability to broaden characteristics of the way an individual feels, thinks, and interacts (as measured by personality changes in Openness). We have previously reported that MDMA treatment is effective at reducing PTSD symptoms. The present study reanalyzed data from <xref rid="bibr41-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Mithoefer et al. (2011</xref>, <xref rid="bibr42-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) to investigate whether personality changes were associated with PTSD symptom reduction. Given the strong relationship between PTSD and personality change, it was hypothesized that changes in Openness and Neuroticism would interact with PTSD symptom reduction. Group differences (MDMA-assisted psychotherapy vs. therapy only) in Openness and Neuroticism at baseline and 2-month follow-up also were investigated to test the hypothesis that there would be greater increases in Openness and decreases in Neuroticism in the MDMA treatment group. Lastly, Openness and Neuroticism at baseline and long-term follow-up (LTFU) (following the drug crossover trials) were examined to test the hypothesis that changes in personality following MDMA-assisted psychotherapy would persist.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section2-0269881117711712"><title>Methods</title><p>The current study is a secondary investigation of purported mechanisms of psychological change associated with our previously reported data of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy (<xref rid="bibr41-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Mithoefer et al., 2011</xref>).

A great deal of research supports the psychometric properties of this personality inventory. The NEO PI-R was created through pooling hundreds of trait measures from self-report questionnaires, peer ratings, and other psychological indices that collectively identified an underlying factor structure of personality traits.

Those who score low on the Openness facet of personality are described as conventional, pragmatic, and traditional in outlook and beliefs. On the other hand, those who score high in Openness tend to be liberal in political beliefs, imaginative, and sensitive to inner feeling and the feelings of others, and generally have a higher need for variety in their lives.

Our primary finding is that persistent changes in Openness and Neuroticism were found following MDMA treatment. These results provide initial support for the notion that the effect of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy extends beyond specific PTSD symptomatology and fundamentally alters personality structure, resulting in long-term persisting personality change.</p><p>The present study indicates that Openness plays an important role in PTSD symptom reduction (as measured by the CAPS), such that those who had the greatest increase in Openness concomitantly demonstrated greater decreases in PTSD symptoms, with this effect being greater in the MDMA-assisted psychotherapy group. These findings are consistent with the notion that increased openness may be a mechanism of therapeutic change. Notably, decreases in Neuroticism also associated with PTSD symptom reduction. It can be argued that the clinical improvement seen on the CAPS and the NEO PI-R may be due to the fact that both instruments are measuring the same clinical phenomenon. While this is possible, there is extensive psychometric data demonstrating the validity and reliability of both the NEO PI-R and CAPS. By definition, personality traits are stable over a lifetime. Our data and others suggest that change in personality plays an influential role in resolution of PTSD as measured by the CAPS. These results provide preliminary support for the specific role of Openness as a psychological mechanism by which MDMA exerts its therapeutic effects.</p><p>In the literature, the study of personality change in the laboratory is difficult because it is hard to create a significant life event, and there have been mixed results. <xref rid="bibr34-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Kipper et al. (2009)</xref> tested whether the psychopharmacological treatment of panic disorder changed personality patterns. These authors found that even after successful treatment of panic disorder, as measured by a Panic Inventory and Clinical Global Impression, panic disorder patients who were asymptomatic continued to differ from controls in terms of pre/post scores on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory showing persisting anxious and neurotic personality characteristics, which they argued were traits of vulnerability. <xref rid="bibr46-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Piedmont (2001)</xref>, on the other hand, showed personality change on the NEO PI-R in a subset of individuals at 15-month follow-up after successful treatment in a drug rehabilitation program. <xref rid="bibr14-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Costa et al. (2005)</xref> also showed personality change as measured by the NEO PI-R after antidepressant treatment for depression, arguing that personality data were capturing concurrent symptoms and functioning beyond that which would be predicted from severity of depression rating scores. These authors argued that the temporal stability of personality trait is defined biologically and gives rise to characteristic psychological adaptations and maladaptation. Lastly, <xref rid="bibr51-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al. (2009)</xref> argued that high neuroticism is a personality risk factor that reflects genetic vulnerability for depression, and tested whether patients taking an SSRI versus placebo report greater changes in neuroticism. Regression analysis supported the state effect hypothesis that change in personality was more than a mere change of depression-related measurement bias, thereby providing further support for the notion that changes in personality would be expected following successful treatment of PTSD.</p><p>Overall, subjects showed a significant reduction in Neuroticism and an increase in Openness personality traits related to MDMA-assisted psychotherapy that was sustained up to 45.4 months post-treatment. Within the field of psychological research, neuroticism has been considered a fundamental personality trait that has long been the focus of much study. Neuroticism has been considered a milder form of psychopathology where there is an enduring pervasive tendency to experience negative emotion sufficient to interfere with effective life adjustment. In this study, there was an overall trend for all subjects to have lower scores on neuroticism post-treatment. Given the relationship between PTSD and heightened negative affect, whether lower scores obtained on the CAPS are a reflection of lower neuroticism, or vice versa, is an open question. More interesting is the effect of change in Openness and the overall trend for all subjects to have higher scores on openness post-treatment. Individuals scoring higher on Openness tend to seek out new experiences and be open to self-examination, factors that can serve to enhance therapeutic change in both behaviors and cognitions. Qualitatively, and consistently with previous work, therapeutic change seemed to be associated with an epiphany-type experience that subjects consistently reported following the MDMA-assisted psychotherapy sessions and reiterated in the long-term follow-up.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first published report of the therapeutic use of MDMA associating with persisting personality change. There are multiple lines of evidence that suggest personality should be stable throughout life. Behavior genetic research on individual differences of personality, as measured by the NEO in particular, have suggested a strong genetic component that accounts for much common variance in certain personality phenotypes, which argues for relative personality stability throughout life (<xref rid="bibr6-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Bergeman et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bibr47-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Riemann et al., 1997</xref>). Similarly, research on the genome (<xref rid="bibr15-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">de Moor et al., 2012</xref>) has found links between NEO personality factors and specific genes, which suggests that personality is stable throughout life. Yet our data, and those of others (<xref rid="bibr38-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">MacLean et al., 2011</xref>), have shown that personality is susceptible to change. We speculate that there may be epigenetic factors involved in personality change whereby environmental factors such as profound experiences related to trauma or cathartic psychological insight can permanently influence underlying personality traits. Indeed, research indicates that early childhood adversity is associated with DNA methylation at the BDNF promotor region, which is associated with an increased risk of psychopathology (<xref rid="bibr35-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Kundakovic et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>There are several limitations of this study. First, although this study was intended to be a double-blind trial, as previously noted, many participants and the therapists were able to correctly guess treatment conditions (<xref rid="bibr41-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Mithoefer et al., 2011</xref>), which can influence expectancies about therapy. Possible expectancy effects are particularly interesting in light of the finding that there were initial decreases in Openness but not increases in Neuroticism in the placebo group. Even so, as we previously reported (<xref rid="bibr42-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Mithoefer et al., 2013</xref>), the treatment effect was again demonstrated in an open-label crossover study and maintained at the 45.4-month follow-up, and once all participants crossed over to the MDMA condition, there were sustained personality changes. As well, subject ratings were obtained via an independent rater, who was not present during psychotherapy. These facts would be highly inconsistent with a placebo effect; nonetheless, it is possible. Thus, in an ongoing replication trial, we are investigating MDMA as an active placebo in dose response studies to address this question. Second, the main outcome measures of PTSD symptoms and personality traits are based on subjective report. Unfortunately, this limitation is not specific to this study, as clinical diagnosis and assessment of these factors are almost entirely based on subjective report. Lastly, given the investigational nature of the drug, the sample size in the current study was small; nevertheless, despite this limitation, significant group effects were found.</p><p>How MDMA-assisted psychotherapy can result in rather abrupt and lasting personality change is a perplexing question. Qualitatively, a consistent subjective theme emerged, with our subjects reporting a profound cathartic experience, often described as going to a &#x0201c;place&#x0201d; (in their mind) where they had never been before. It is interesting to speculate that MDMA acts as a catalyst, increasing openness, and thereby reducing PTSD-related symptoms and associated negative neuroticism. As such, MDMA, and its ability to facilitate personality change, may prove to be a frontline treatment for those with &#x0201c;complex&#x0201d; PTSD. While therapeutic experiences with psychedelic drugs do seem to result in lasting pervasively positive personality change, <xref rid="bibr45-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Pahnke and Richards (1966)</xref> had cautioned that the mystical experience is necessary, but not sufficient, for personality change to occur. Likewise, we would argue that the MDMA experience is only therapeutic in the context of psychotherapy. In a non-therapeutic context, it is quite possible that the reverse effect could occur. We speculate that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy facilitates, or &#x0201c;primes,&#x0201d; a profound susceptibility for increased openness to experiences, which, in turn, enhances therapy&#x02019;s effectiveness. This notion was supported by our findings that those who had the greatest personality changes following treatment also had significantly greater decreases in PTSD symptoms. Considering that MDMA has been shown to acutely elevate oxytocin levels, it is of interest that personality is affected by pharmacological administration of oxytocin (<xref rid="bibr9-0269881117711712" ref-type="bibr">Cardoso et al., 2012</xref>). Future research intends to investigate potential links between reported cathartic experience with MDMA-assisted psychotherapy-linked symptom reduction and personality change.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of conflicting interests:</bold> The author(s) declared the following potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Mark Wagner received compensation from the sponsor for acting as an independent rater on this study.
