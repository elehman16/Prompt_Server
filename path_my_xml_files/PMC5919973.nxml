This randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) in reducing menopause-related symptoms by comparing with an active control group, the menopause education control (MEC). Symptomatic peri-menopausal and post-menopausal women with mild to moderate symptoms were recruited. The primary outcome was overall menopausal symptoms measured by modified Greene Climacteric Scale (GCS). Secondary outcomes include subscales of the GCS perceived stress, mindfulness and health related Quality of Life. All outcome measures were collected at baseline, 2 months (immediately post intervention), 5 and 8 months (3 and 6 months post intervention respectively). Both MBSR (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;98) and MEC (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;99) groups reported a reduction in total GCS score at 8 months. Between group analysis show significant symptom score reduction in MBSR group on Anxiety and Depression subscales of GCS. No differences were found between groups on other GCS subscales and majority of the secondary outcome measures. The findings show that menopausal symptoms in both MBSR and MEC significantly reduced over the study period. MBSR show a greater reduction of psychological symptoms of depression and anxiety above active controls but do not reduce other somatic, urogenital and vasomotor symptoms.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The menopause transition can cause psychological and somatic disturbances in a woman&#x02019;s life, and over 75% of women may experience some if not all of menopause related symptoms which may include vasomotor symptoms, sleep difficulties, depression and anxiety and urogenital symptoms and sexual dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, negative emotions such as depression and anxiety symptoms and increased social and psychological stress were associated with increased reporting of physical symptoms in menopausal women. It has been suggested that women&#x02019;s psychological reactions to vasomotor and somatic symptoms may exacerbate these physical symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, and the National Institutes of Health convened panels recognized the need to evaluate psychological and behavioural interventions which can potentially mediate the reaction to and increase resilience and coping of menopause-related symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Recent studies of psychological interventions to improve coping such as cognitive behavioral strategies and relaxation techniques have suggested positive effects on vasomotor and depression symptoms. However, studies have been limited by a lack of well-designed randomized controlled studies with adequate sample size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Mindfulness-based therapies offer an alternative approach to increase self-acceptance and coping by providing systematic training in mindfulness meditation as a self-learned approach to stress reduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a clinical program which utilizes skills such as sitting and walking meditation, yoga and a somatically focused skill named the body scan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In peri- and post-menopausal women, MBSR trains women to recognize and discriminate accurately the various components of daily life experiences such as thoughts, feelings, and sensations while at the same time, developing a nonreactive awareness and acceptance towards these thoughts, feelings and sensations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Mindfulness based therapies has been effective in improving physical and psychological outcomes in a variety of clinical and non-clinical settings in the last three decades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, although few studies focus on women with menopausal symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The first pilot study of MBSR was conducted in 2006 and 15 women with moderate or severe hot flushes using MBSR showed a reduction in the severity of hot flushes and significant changes on the psychosocial scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However this study lacked a control group.

Results showed a reduction in feeling &#x02018;bothered&#x02019; by hot flushes, improved sleep quality, decreased anxiety and perceived stress and improved quality of life. Interestingly, there were no reductions in the severity or frequency of hot flushes. This suggests that reducing negative emotions such as anxiety and stress may help women cope in the menopausal transition. However, due to the lack of an active control group for comparison, it was difficult to delineate the independent effects of MBSR from the non-specific effects of group interactions and additional attention received from instructor and group members.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims and Objectives</title><p id="Par6">The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of MBSR in reducing menopause-related vasomotor, psychological and somatic symptoms among peri-menopausal and post-menopausal women by comparing the intervention a menopause education control (MEC) group.</p><p id="Par7">We hypothesized that patients randomized to the MBSR group would show a reduction both of menopause-related psychological and somatic symptoms when compared to active controls (MEC).</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study Design</title><p id="Par8">This was a randomized controlled trial with two study arms: (1) an MBSR program led by a trained instructor; and (2) a menopause-education control group. Both MBSR and MEC lasted for eight weeks and the outcome measures were collected at similar time points baseline, 2 months (immediately post intervention), 5 months and 8 months (3 months and 6 months post intervention respectively). The MEC intervention controls for nonspecific factors including instructor attention, group support and physical activity. The MBSR and MEC intervention were both conducted in groups with matching group size and instructor attention of 2.5&#x02009;hr-session weekly for 8 weeks. Physical activity/techniques consisted of at least 60&#x02009;minutes. For MEC group, simple stretching exercises were taught for better posture and aiming to improve joint mobility; whilst for MBSR group, mindful exercises were introduced to cultivate nonjudgmental awareness of physical sensations. In both groups, participants were asked to complete the same amount (40&#x02009;minutes) of home practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par9">Patients were recruited from community and primary care settings: (1) advertisements invited women between the ages of 40&#x02013;60 with menopausal symptoms were posted in local newspaper columns; (2) internal emails were sent to the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) staff, students and alumni; (3) recruitment articles were posted in newsletters of Centre of Research and Promotion of Women&#x02019;s Health (CRPWH) and Women&#x02019;s clubs of the Family Planning Association of Hong Kong; (4) posters and leaflets were also distributed in General Outpatient and Family Medicine Clinics of the New Territories East Cluster of the Hospital Authority and the Prince of Wales Centre of the Hong Kong Society for Rehabilitation. The invitation described briefly an 8-week program which involved mindfulness or psychoeducation.</p><p id="Par10">All recruited participants fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: (1) Chinese women aged 40&#x02013;60 years, who were peri-menopausal or post-menopausal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Peri-menopausal status was defined as the period with changes in menstrual pattern and irregular cycle with changes in frequency compared with 12 months ago. Post-menopausal status was defined as absence of periods for at least 12 months; (2) women who were willing to maintain their present exercise and dietary pattern; and (3) women having a somatic symptom score of six or above on the Greene Climacteric Symptom Score. The average complaint on somatic subscale was reported to be 6.16 (SD 4.25) based on 200 Scottish women aged 40&#x02013;55 years from menopause clinics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Since somatic symptoms have been found to be more common among Hong Kong Chinese women as compared to Caucasians<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, and local studies showing with a mean score of 5.4&#x02013;6.4, the score of six on somatic subscale was chosen as one of the inclusion criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Interested participants were excluded if they: (1) had psychiatric and medical comorbidities that were potentially life-threatening (i.e., psychosis, suicidal ideation, terminal medical illness) or conditions expected to severely limit patient participation or adherence (e.g., psychosis, current substance or alcohol abuse, dementia, and currently pregnant); or (2) had medical conditions or medications that might affect menopausal symptoms including hot flushes (such as the presence of thyroid disease or the use of selective estrogen receptor modulator, hormone therapy, or the use of traditional Chinese medicine for the menopause); (3) women who had previously practiced or were currently practicing meditation. Participants who were using any anxiolytic or antidepressants were asked to keep their present dosage stable and to immediately report any change of medication during the study period; and (4) had hysterectomy or oophorectomy.</p><p id="Par11">All interested subjects were initially screened over the phone by our trained research staff to determine their eligibility. Those who were eligible, individual face-to-face interviews were scheduled to further confirm the inclusion and exclusion criteria by the clinician investigator. The objectives of the study were further explained and informed consent was obtained. All interviews were conducted at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the treatment groups by using a list of computer-generated random numbers. The generation of random numbers and assignment was performed by a statistician who was not part of the research team to ensure concealment of randomization. The allocation to the two groups was 1:1. Recruitment stopped when the target sample size was reached. Between Feb 2014 and Jan 2015, six batches of study intervention and active control groups were conducted. Group sizes ranged from 11 to 21. Participants were blinded to the study hypotheses. Ethical approval for the study was granted by the Joint Chinese University of Hong Kong &#x02013; New Territories East Cluster Clinical Research Ethics Committee (approval number: CRE-2011.561), and procedures were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Interventions</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR)</title><p id="Par12">The MBSR program utilized stress-reduction skills which included sitting and walking meditation, yoga and body scan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.

Three instructors (two clinical psychologists and one nurse) were employed to deliver the MBSR programme. All three instructors had received trainings at the UMass Center for Mindfulness, attended retreats and have more than 2 years of teaching experience in MBSR. The recruitment of three instructors was to increase the generalizability (external validity) of the findings and to show that it is not the therapist per se but the therapeutic modality that accounted for changes in outcomes. The Chinese MBSR program followed the standard MBSR protocol, only that it was conducted in Chinese<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The Chinese MBSR program has been successfully applied in other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. It consisted of two-and-a-half-hour weekly sessions for eight weeks with a total of 20&#x02009;hours. The program included 40-minute daily homework exercises that consisted of guided (audiotaped) or unguided awareness exercises directed at increasing moment-by-moment non-judgmental awareness of bodily sensations, thoughts and feelings, together with exercises designed to integrate the application of awareness skills into daily life. The curriculum included training in mindfulness through (1) a body scan, the gradual moving of attention through the body from head to feet while lying on a mat on the floor, bringing awareness particularly to bodily sensations; (2) sitting meditation, in which attention is brought to breathing sensations and the flow of bodily sensations, thoughts, and emotions; and (3) mindful stretching exercises, to cultivate awareness during simple stretching movement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The key themes of MBSR included the empowerment of participants and a focus on awareness and acceptance of experience of the present moment. Participants were guided to develop a &#x0201c;decentered&#x0201d; perspective on thoughts and feelings, in which these were viewed as passing events in the mind. The study MBSR protocol utilised a general approach similar to previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Menopause Education Control (MEC)</title><p id="Par13">Psychoeducational programs deliver health information on the menopausal transition in combination with education and exercise in small support groups.

Three nurses were employed to lead these sessions and all have at least two year clinical experience in conducting psychoeducation sessions. Each sessions were supplemented with discussion with respect to the content of the educational presentation as well as mutual sharing. Active control group participants were taught simple stretching techniques which focused on physical techniques only and did not require the level of attention and awareness mindfulness practices require.

However, these studies were limited by small sample sizes (all n&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;35).

Despite positive effects of MBSR on psychological symptoms, we have demonstrated no significant reduction of somatic and vasomotor symptoms above active controls (MEC).

Mindfulness levels (FFMQ) increased in both the MBSR and MEC groups. This phenomenon has also been demonstrated in other studies of mindfulness and active controls which used self-reported questionnaire to measure the levels of mindfulness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The improvement of overall menopausal symptoms and psychological symptoms in MBSR may be facilitated by other mediatory mechanisms such as relaxation, paced respiration or other unmeasured complex psychological pathways e.g. increase in acceptance. An alternative explanation is the complexity and difficulty in assessing outcomes in mindfulness levels and/or other mechanisms. Some have also argued that mindfulness is a difficult construct to be measured by questionnaire and there is a need to improve the existing scales with higher discriminant ability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. MEC components may also elicit constructs of MBSR in acceptance and psychological processes through small group support, information giving and physical exercise. Menopausal symptoms declined in both MBSR and MEC groups in our study. Numerous studies on psychoeducation programs have show positive effects from baseline symptoms, although none utilised an RCT approach to compare with usual care or no treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>.

Our study is the largest trial for psychological therapies for menopausal symptoms and is the first to encompass an active control group, with the longest follow up of 6 months post intervention. In addition, we included both peri-menopausal and post- menopausal women with non-selective approach to menopausal symptoms.</p><sec id="Sec20"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par34">The women in our study may not be representative of the general female population with menopausal symptoms within the region of Hong Kong.

Self- selection bias is likely as the program require regular attendance and time commitment of participants. Characteristics of self-selection bias e.g. social support, loneliness may be further explored in further studies. Meanwhile, those attending are likely representative of those most willing to attend should such programs become available.</p><p id="Par35">Although a clinician investigator excluded those who had life threatening psychiatric illness and assessed participants as being stable on current medication for depression and anxiety, no validated screening tools were used to assess psychological symptoms apart from the GCS depression and anxiety subscales. In addition, there has been a lack of studies in comparing GCS anxiety and depression subscales with validated scales of anxiety and depression. A cut-off score of 10 had been recommended for clinically anxious or depression according to a study comparing the GCS and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Using this cut off, there were no significant differences of clinically relevant anxiety and depression symptoms between MBSR and MEC groups. The mean score was presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>.</p><p id="Par36">In addition, the time effects in reduction of anxiety, depression, somatic, vasomotor and urogenital subscales may in part be due to the natural course of menopause rather than the interventions. This is difficult to assess, as there was no inactive control group in our study.</p><p id="Par37">Meanwhile, the research intervention was delivered by experienced personnel (MEC) and may require highly trained personnel (MBSR), which may limit the feasibility of these interventions in the community.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par38">This large randomized control trial of MBSR and active controls (MEC) in symptomatic peri-menopausal and postmenopausal women show that menopausal symptoms in both MBSR and MEC significantly reduced over time of the study period of 8 months (6 months post intervention). MBSR show a greater reduction of psychological symptoms of depression and anxiety above active controls but similar reduction in somatic, urogenital and vasomotor symptoms.</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>Trial Registration</title><p id="Par39">Centre for Clinical Trials, Clinical Trials Registry &#x02013; Chinese University of Hong Kong, trial number: CUHK_CCT00365 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www2.ccrb.cuhk.edu.hk/registry/public/204">https://www2.ccrb.cuhk.edu.hk/registry/public/204</ext-link>) and Chinese Clinical Trials Registry, trial number ChiCTR-TRC-13003192 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chictr.org.cn/showprojen.aspx?proj=6367">http://www.chictr.org.cn/showprojen.aspx?proj=6367</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's note:</bold> Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank all the participants who were involved in this study.
