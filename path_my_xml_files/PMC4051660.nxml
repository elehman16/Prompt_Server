Participants were assigned to citalopram (target dose of 30 mg/day) or placebo in a 1&#x02236;1 ratio. 186 people, 181 of whom were over the age of 60, having probable AD with clinically significant agitation were recruited from September 2009 to January 2013. After the FDA safety communication about citalopram, ECG was added to the required study procedures before enrollment and repeated at week 3 to monitor change in QTc interval. Forty-eight participants were enrolled after enhanced monitoring began.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Citalopram treatment was associated with a larger increase in QTc interval than placebo (difference in week 3 QTc adjusting for baseline QTc: 18.1 ms [95% CI: 6.1, 30.1]; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.004). More participants in the citalopram group had an increase &#x02265;30 ms from baseline to week 3 (7 in citalopram versus 1 in placebo; Fisher's exact p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.046), but only slightly more in the citalopram group met a gender-specific threshold for prolonged QTc (450 ms for males; 470 ms for females) at any point during follow-up (3 in citalopram versus 1 in placebo, Fisher's exact p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.611). One of the citalopram participants who developed prolonged QTc also displayed ventricular bigeminy.

The QT interval shortens as heart rate increases. The QTc interval is a standardization of the QT interval correcting for heart rate. Many formulae have been developed for calculating the QTc value and there is no consensus on the correct conversion <xref rid="pone.0098426-Habib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098426-Luo1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> but most formulae provide similar results for diagnosis of QT prolongation with heart rates in the range of approximately 60&#x02013;90 beats/minute <xref rid="pone.0098426-Goldenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Extreme QTc prolongation (QTc&#x0003e;500 milliseconds) can result in electrical instability during repolarization, increasing the risk of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (<italic>Torsade de pointes</italic>; TdP) and sudden cardiac death <xref rid="pone.0098426-Yap1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098426-AlKhatib1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. A review of the literature found consistent associations between prolonged QTc and death in high risk populations <xref rid="pone.0098426-Montanez1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and a meta-analysis of observational data found that the pooled estimates support associations between prolonged QTc and death in the general population <xref rid="pone.0098426-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Although QT prolongation can be caused by heritable disorders in cardiac ion channel expression, numerous marketed drugs are also known to lengthen the QT interval (QTdrugs.org) in people without genetic abnormalities.</p><p>Citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant that is frequently used in older adults <xref rid="pone.0098426-Bergh1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098426-Coupland1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. On 24 August 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a Drug Safety Communication <xref rid="pone.0098426-Food1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> regarding the dose dependent risk of QT prolongation with citalopram. The communication was issued because of post-marketing reports of QT prolongation and TdP and results of an unpublished, randomized, controlled, multi-center, double-blind, crossover study that enrolled 119 healthy, non-depressed adults. Participants in the FDA QT study received citalopram 20 mg/day and 60 mg/day. The mean change in QTc interval was 8.5 milliseconds (ms) for 20 mg/day and 18.5 ms for 60 mg/day <xref rid="pone.0098426-Food1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The FDA QT study included adults aged 19 to 45 (Thomas P Laughren, personal communication). The 2011 FDA communication stated that 20 mg per day was the maximum recommended dose for patients greater than 60 years of age <xref rid="pone.0098426-Food1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, but this language was not changed on the FDA label for Celexa (brand name for citalopram) at that time. The Pharmacovigilance Working Party of the European Medicines Agency also recommended the same changes to maximum dose in summaries of product characteristics and package leaflets of citalopram products in the EU <xref rid="pone.0098426-European1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and these were accepted by the co-ordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures (CMDh) agency in October 2011 <xref rid="pone.0098426-Coordination1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK issued a similar advisory regarding citalopram use in December 2011 <xref rid="pone.0098426-Medicines1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>Seven months later, on 28 March 2012, the FDA issued another Drug Safety Communication and again updated the citalopram labeling <xref rid="pone.0098426-Food2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The revised warning recommended that citalopram not be used by patients who have one or more of the following conditions: congenital long QT syndrome, bradycardia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, recent acute myocardial infarction, or uncompensated heart failure. This 2012 communication accompanied new changes to the Celexa label, and recommended a maximum dose of 20 mg in individuals over age 60.</p><p>Following the FDA warnings, an observational study of data from a large New England healthcare setting also found dose-response associations between citalopram, escitalopram and amitriptyline with QTc prolongation but no associations for other antidepressants examined including other SSRIs fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline as well as other antidepressants duloxetine, venlafaxine, buproprion, mirtazapine and nortriptyline. The New England study included adults ages &#x02265;18 and the mean age was 58 (SD&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;16) years <xref rid="pone.0098426-Castro1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>In contrast, an observational study of data from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) National Registry for Depression found no increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia or mortality with citalopram doses of greater than 40 mg/day. 41% of the VHA cohort was age &#x02265;60 <xref rid="pone.0098426-Zivin1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. No QTc data were presented.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, no other trials have published on the relationship between citalopram and QT interval in older adults participating in a placebo-controlled trial. The Citalopram for agitation in Alzheimer's Disease (CitAD) trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy of citalopram for the treatment of clinically significant agitation in patients with AD. Following the FDA safety warnings regarding citalopram, CitAD investigators added safety monitoring for QT prolongation and the objective here is to show the differences in QT interval for citalopram versus placebo in older adults with AD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>CitAD design</title><p>CitAD was an investigator-initiated clinical trial funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) than enrolled participants from August 2009 to January 2013. CitAD is registered at clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00898807. The study had eight recruiting clinical centers (seven in the U.S. and one in Canada) and two resource centers (the chair's office and the coordinating center). Study participants were recruited from memory clinics, geriatric psychiatry clinics, Veterans Administration geriatric clinics, nursing homes, community outreach, and Alzheimer Research Centers. CitAD participants had probable Alzheimer's disease as defined by NINCDS-ADRDA <xref rid="pone.0098426-McKhann1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> criteria, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) <xref rid="pone.0098426-Folstein1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> scores of 5&#x02013;28 inclusive, and clinically significant agitation. The detailed list of eligibility criteria for CitAD has been published previously <xref rid="pone.0098426-Drye1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The protocol for CitAD and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0098426.s002">Protocol S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0098426.s003">Checklist S1</xref>.</p><p>Participants were randomized using a plan developed by the coordinating center in a 1&#x02236;1 ratio to receive citalopram or matching placebo in parallel. The treatment assignment was given in form of a medication kit identification code only after eligibility was confirmed (allocation concealment). A detailed description of the randomization and concealment methods has been published <xref rid="pone.0098426-Drye1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. A starting dose of 10 mg was titrated up over 2 weeks to the target of 30 mg daily, provided as a single dose in the morning of three capsules each containing 10 mg. Citalopram was purchased on from commercial wholesale drug suppliers on the open market and over-encapsulated to facilitate participant and study staff masking.</p><p>Participants were followed via in-person study visits at weeks 3, 6, and 9 following enrollment and telephone contacts at weeks 1, 2, 4.5 and 7.5 weeks following enrollment. The data collection schedule was described in detail previously <xref rid="pone.0098426-Drye1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Adverse events were primarily collected via systematic, close-ended questions regarding known or expected side effects or complications of citalopram, and through the measurement of electrolyte levels. Serious adverse events were collected on an individual basis at the time of the event and when updated information became available.</p><p>The primary results of the CitAD trial have been reported <xref rid="pone.0098426-Porsteinsson1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and in short, citalopram (at target does of 30 mg/day) improved agitation, global function, and caregiver burden but was associated with cognitive worsening and increased anorexia, diarrhea, fever and falls.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the ethics committee at each clinical center and the coordinating center: New York State Psychiatric Institute Institutional Review Board (Columbia), University Of Pennsylvania Office Of Regulatory Affairs Institute Institutional Review Board, Centre For Addiction And Mental Health Research Ethics Board (Toronto), Stanford University Panel On Human Subjects In Medical Research, University Of Southern California Keck School Of Medicine Affairs Institute Institutional Review Board, Medical University of South Carolina Institute Institutional Review Board For Human Research, Johns Hopkins Office Of Human Subject Research Institute Institutional Review Boards, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Institutional Review Board, University of Rochester Research Subjects Review Board.</p><p>Participants provided written consent if they were capable of providing consent. If the participant is not fully capable of providing consent, then written consent was obtained from an authorized legal representative and the participant was asked to provide assent.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>QTc monitoring</title><p>In September 2011, the CitAD Steering Committee (SC) decided that active subjects should be informed about the FDA advisory and that participants on 3 study capsules per day (corresponding to 30 mg daily for those in the citalopram group) have an ECG as soon as was practical. New dose increases over 20 mg were temporarily halted while the SC waited for the updated Celexa label to be released.</p><p>When the changed label became available shortly after the first safety communication, there was no change regarding the use of the medication in individuals over age 60. As a result, the SC concluded that no change in the dosing scheme was needed but added an exclusion criterion for individuals with a prolonged QTc, defined as &#x0003e;450 ms for men and &#x0003e;470 ms for women, as measured on an ECG conducted at the study's screening/enrollment visit using equipment available at the clinical centers; there was no central calibration of machines or central reading facility. The cutoffs for prolonged QTc were based on recommendations from an SC-appointed study cardiologist and are consistent with standard thresholds <xref rid="pone.0098426-Yap1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098426-Committee1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. No other change in the inclusion or exclusion criteria was deemed necessary. The SC also added ECG monitoring at the week 3 visit, when the target dose of 30 mg/day was expected to have been reached in most participants, and also at the first visit after a dose increase to 30 mg for participants on slower titrations. Other ECGs could also be performed at any time at the discretion of the study physician. Electrolytes were already being regularly monitored in CitAD, but magnesium was added to the set of measures. These modifications were reviewed and approved by the DSMB, funding agency and by the ethics committee at each center and became effective in November 2011, after 142 CitAD participants had already been enrolled.</p><p>Following the second revision to the citalopram label in March 2012, the SC reviewed the new label and decided to make no further changes to the study entry criteria and procedures. However, the template consent form was revised to state that the dose of citalopram used in CitAD was higher than the FDA maximum recommended dose for people over 60.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The CitAD sample size requirements were based on the primary outcomes and have been published <xref rid="pone.0098426-Drye1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098426-Porsteinsson1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Enrollments following the introduction of the new ECG monitoring procedures in 2011 continued to be balanced between the citalopram and placebo groups. All participants were counted in the group to which they were assigned regardless of treatment adherence (&#x0201c;intention-to-treat&#x0201d;). Baseline characteristics of participants enrolled during the entire trial and for those enrolled after ECG monitoring began are summarized by treatment group using means and standard deviations for continuous variables and counts and proportions for categorical variables.</p><p>For participants enrolled after November 2011, QTc at week 3 was compared by treatment group using linear regression controlling for baseline QTc and 95% confidence intervals and t-tests were calculated. A similar model for change from baseline in QTc was created and a treatment by enrollment QTc interaction was included to test for differences in relationship between enrollment QTc and change in QTc by treatment group. We defined &#x0201c;prolonged&#x0201d; QTc as QTc&#x0003e;450 ms for men or 470 ms for women <xref rid="pone.0098426-Yap1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098426-Committee1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. &#x0201c;Clinically significant increase&#x0201d; in the QTc was defined as an increase &#x02265;30 ms from enrollment to week 3, consistent with FDA guidance <xref rid="pone.0098426-Food3" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The proportion of patients with prolonged QT and change in QTc&#x02265;30 ms from enrollment to week 3 were compared by Fisher's exact test. These analyses were not planned at the beginning of the trial because the FDA advisory and corresponding protocol changes occurred well into the second half of the trial.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2; copyright &#x000a9; 2002&#x02013;2008 by SAS Institute Inc Cary, NC, USA, and R version 2.13.1; copyright &#x000a9; 2011 by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing.

The original target enrollment was 200 but was not met due to slow enrollment at the end of the trial. The flow of participants with respect to ECG monitoring is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098426-g001">Figure 1</xref>. Between the August 2011 FDA advisory and November 2011, 27 patients who were in active follow-up were monitored informally while protocol changes were drafted and reviewed by the DSMBs and ethics committees and subsequently implemented. We did not require that ECGs performed during this interim period be retrospectively recorded on data collection forms, although some were captured. In November 2011 changes were formally implemented, the patients currently in active follow-up (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3) and the 48 subsequently enrolled patients had ECG recorded as described previously. However, one participant was enrolled without an ECG, one patient refused the week 3 ECG and three patients missed the week 3 visit.</p><fig id="pone-0098426-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0098426.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Participant flow* related to ECG monitoring.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0098426.g001"/></fig><p>Baseline characteristics of all participants as well as the subset that enrolled after new ECG monitoring procedures were implemented are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0098426-t001">Table 1</xref>.

However, the relationship between enrollment QTc and change in QTc did not differ statistically between treatment groups (interaction p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.372), indicating that the difference in change in QTc between treatment groups was fairly constant across varying values of enrollment QTc.

More information about serious adverse events is available in the primary report of CitAD <xref rid="pone.0098426-Porsteinsson1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. No participants in either group had a cardiovascular related death or other cardiovascular related serious adverse events. The single reported death, in the placebo group, was from a previously undetected lung cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The mean QTc for CitAD participants at enrollment was similar to that seen in other studies of older adults <xref rid="pone.0098426-Tran1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0098426-Reardon1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Compared with placebo, the increase in QTc interval for citalopram was approximately 18 ms longer and the difference between the groups was independent of the baseline QTc value. This increase is higher than what we would expect based on the data in the FDA drug safety communication <xref rid="pone.0098426-Food1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> but older patients have diminished clearance of citalopram; in a pharmacokinetic analysis of 106 subjects (ages 22&#x02013;93), investigators found that citalopram clearance decreased 0.23 L/h for every year of age <xref rid="pone.0098426-Bies1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p><p>Although the study was not designed to examine differences in QTc, the blocked randomization scheme produced comparable groups after the ECG monitoring procedures were added. In the placebo group, the difference between the baseline and week 3 QTc intervals were centered close to zero (at &#x02212;3 ms) indicating fairly stable measurements on average, although one participant had a large change in QTc in the placebo group. Any noise added because of inherent variability in ECG reads or in differing QT to QTc conversions, or because the ECGs were done at different times of the day <xref rid="pone.0098426-Yap1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098426-AlKhatib1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> should be equally distributed in the citalopram and placebo groups, and in fact, variance estimates were similar in the two groups. The lack of standardization of QTc calculation could affect the classification of &#x02018;prolonged QT&#x02019; although the mean resting heart rate in the CitAD participants was 68 (SD&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10) and the various formulae give similar conversions in this range <xref rid="pone.0098426-Goldenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. This lack of precision in estimating QTc also reflects the reality of using this equipment and is important for generalization to clinical practice.</p><p>QT prolongation is a surrogate measure for arrhythmia <xref rid="pone.0098426-Habib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Many drugs are known to cause QT prolongation and the degree of QT prolongation caused by citalopram in the current study was comparable with increases in QTc due to other drugs known to interfere with myocardial repolarization <xref rid="pone.0098426-Harrigan1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098426-Wilton1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. FDA guidance for industry states that drugs that are associated with mean increases of &#x0003e;20 ms &#x0201c;have a substantially increased likelihood of being proarrhythmic&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0098426-Food3" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and our observed difference is approaching that magnitude of increase. Whether citalopram was directly responsible for any adverse clinical outcomes in our cohort is unclear. A study with a larger sample size would be needed to determine if these changes in QTc were indicative of changes in incidence of arrhythmia and cardiac events. Even in this small sample, two patients in the citalopram group had unexplained syncope (prior to the onset of ECG monitoring) and one citalopram patient experienced profound QTc prolongation and bigeminy (frequently a harbinger of impending TdP), suggesting the possibility of a real and worrisome citalopram-induced effect. The latter patient was also taking alfuzosin, a drug that should be used with caution in patients who are taking other medications that prolong the QT interval, such as citalopram <xref rid="pone.0098426-Sanofiaventis1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. We did not allow enrollment of men with QTc&#x0003e;450 or women with QTc&#x0003e;470 after the FDA advisory so it is possible that we are underestimating the proportion of older adults who might develop prolonged QTc after initiating citalopram.</p><p>Our results provide data to support the FDA warning against the use of citalopram in doses higher than 20 mg/day in people over 60. Citalopram, at 30 mg/day, was associated with improvement in agitation in patients with AD but also with concerning cognitive effects and QT prolongation.</p><p>Resource center representatives:</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0098426.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
