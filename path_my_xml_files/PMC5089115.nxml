First, we used a random numbers table to select 3 primary healthcare centers from the 20 healthcare services in the study area. These centers formed the main clusters and were randomly assigned as the intervention centers (2 centers in which mothers received one of the interventions plus standard prenatal care) or the control center (in which only mothers received standard prenatal care). Next, eligible pregnant women from the selected primary healthcare centers were invited by phone to participate in this study based on a convenience sampling method.</p></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Instruments</title><p>Data were collected through an 18-item demographic and obstetrical information check list and the Speilberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. This 40-item inventory is a well validated self-report questionnaire designed to screen for state (20 items) and trait anxiety (20 items). It has a standardized alpha coefficient of 0.79 for state anxiety and 0.94 for trait anxiety. Total scores range from 20 to 80.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[36]</sup></xref>
</p></sec><sec><label>2.4</label><title>Procedure</title><p>GCBT was delivered in 3 groups of 12 to 13 participants. Each group received 4 group counseling sessions, with 2 sessions per week. Sessions were led by a midwife with a Master of Science in counseling in midwifery as the therapist/counselor, and a psychiatrist as a group leader and co-therapist. Before the start of the study, the midwife underwent a 12-h training session provided by a licensed psychologist who specialized in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). To establish initial interaction, the counselor started the first session by introducing the research team and the objectives of the study and asking the participants to introduce themselves. Next, anxiety and its characteristics were explained. After that, with participation from the group, a common definition of anxiety was offered, and the anxiety state, thoughts, feelings, and behavior cycle were explained. As homework, group participants were asked write down their cycle of thoughts, feelings, and behavior. They were invited to examine negative thoughts and emotionally charged situations in their lives, and apply the alternative techniques that were discussed. Sessions 2 and 3 also had homework assignments, involving participants identifying their anxiety. The fourth session focused on a review of the previous sessions and how participants could continue to implement what they had learned, and included questions and answers. Each GCBT session lasted 120 to 150 min.</p><p>Four lectures (2 sessions/wk) were conducted with the IL group (n = 38), each lasting 120 to 150 min. In the first session, the counselor introduced herself and the objectives of the study, asked participants to introduce themselves, and described the characteristics of the IL. The lectures discussed the concept of anxiety and whether pregnancy was stressful. The cycle of state, thoughts, feelings, and behavior was described at the end of the first session. Participants were asked to study this cycle for the next session. In the second session, the discussion about the content of the first lecture was recorded and causes of anxiety were explained. The third session covered the effects of anxiety on mother, baby, and pregnancy outcomes, and the fourth session focused on ways to control and manage anxiety. All IL sessions were held by the same midwife who provided the GCBT.</p><p>Four weeks after completion of the interventions, participants in the CBT and IL groups completed the Speilberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory a second time. The control group (who received standard prenatal care) completed the Speilberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory at the start of the study and 4 weeks after completion of the initial questionnaire.</p></sec><sec><label>2.5</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS for Windows Version 18.0 (PASW Statistics for Windows, Version 18.0, SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).

They were provided with contact details for the research team at Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences and its deputy research ethics committee (Ethical code: IR.MAZUMS.REC.94.1411) to allow them to discuss any concerns regarding the study. Data confidentiality was emphasized and they were asked to complete an informed consent form. This form noted that the information collected would remain confidential and that they could withdraw from the study at any time. After control group participants completed the second Speilberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, they were provided with education about anxiety management. The study was registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.irct.ir/">www.irct.ir</ext-link>), registration number: IRCT2015071022609N1.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>3</label><title>Results</title><p>Data were collected from 91 pregnant women, with gestational ages ranging from 13 to 26 weeks (CBT group: n = 31; IL group n = 30; and control group: n = 30) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

GCBT is a practical, effective, and affordable approach for the management of a number of disorders, including depression and anxiety.<sup>[</sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><sup>]</sup> To our knowledge, this study is one of the few studies to investigate the effectiveness of GCBT on maternal anxiety compared with IL and routine prenatal care.</p><p>The results of this study are consistent with previous studies<sup>[</sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>

<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><sup>]</sup> that found GCBT reduced anxiety in pregnant women. This method, involving identifying the cycle of the situation, thoughts, feelings, and behavior, and identifying inefficient thoughts and cognitive errors and replacing them with rational thoughts was effective in reducing maternal anxiety. Changing peoples&#x02019; thoughts and beliefs may help them to think more positively about themselves and the world around them. However, other studies have not found group counseling to be effective in reducing maternal anxiety.<sup>[</sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>]</sup> It may be that the number of sessions and quality of counseling are important factors. Implementing 3 to 6 sessions of group behavioral counseling with a psychiatrist or psychologist is considered to be effective.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[33]</sup></xref>
</p><p>Consistent with other studies,<sup>[</sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>
<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref><sup>]</sup> our study showed that IL reduced maternal anxiety. By increasing maternal knowledge about pregnancy and clarifying uncertainties about aspects of pregnancy and delivery, education can have a profound impact on maternal anxiety. Although a study reported that the reduction in maternal anxiety in an education group versus a control group was not significant.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[29]</sup></xref> In that study, education was implemented in 2 sessions; 1 over the phone and 1 individual session. It may be that more education sessions may have a more significant effect.</p><p>Dunnett post hoc test results showed that there was no significant difference in the mean state and trait anxiety scores between the CBT and IL groups after the intervention. Both the GCBT and the IL had beneficial effects on reducing maternal anxiety.</p><p>A limitation of this study was that the 4-week follow-up period was too short to allow conclusions about the long-term effect of the interventions. A larger study with more weeks follow-up is recommended to confirm results. In addition, participants&#x02019; demographic characteristics (e.g., nulliparity) might limit the generalizability of the findings. Finally, we determined anxiety based on the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; however, gains in well-being and life functioning should also be part of treatment evaluation in future studies.</p><p>In conclusion, the psychological status of pregnant women should be investigated in prenatal care services, and either CBT or IL implemented depending on available resources. This issue is particularly important in healthcare services in developing countries where access to psychologists and psychotherapists experienced in CBT is limited.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors thank all participants in this research project.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: CBT = cognitive behavioral therapy, GCBT = group cognitive behavioral therapy, IL = interactive lectures.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>This article is adapted from a thesis for a Master of Science in Midwifery (project no. 1411), funded by the Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
