Although evidence indicates that dietary intake plays an important role, few studies have focused on the effect of fruit and vegetable consumption on early markers of vascular function. Therefore, we hypothesised that supplementation with capsules containing a combination of fruit and vegetable extracts over 12&#x000a0;weeks can significantly modulate biomarkers of vascular function compared with a control group receiving placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This is a double-blind, randomised controlled trial that includes overweight and obese but otherwise healthy participants. Participants are randomly allocated to one of two groups: active supplementation (encapsulated fruit and vegetable powder) or placebo taken twice daily for 12&#x000a0;weeks, whereas both groups will be given the &#x02018;5-A-Day&#x02019; dietary advice. The primary outcome is to measure changes to the carotid intima media thickness (cIMT) between the two groups from baseline (test visit 1) to 12&#x000a0;weeks later (test visit 2). The secondary outcomes include macro- and microvascular changes and changes to blood markers.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In addition to the primary and secondary objectives, this explanatory trial incorporates potential novel biomarkers such as trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS).</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN14315618?q=nntv&#x00026;filters=&#x00026;sort=&#x00026;offset=1&#x00026;totalResults=1&#x00026;page=1&#x00026;pageSize=10&#x00026;searchType=basic-search">ISRCTN14315618</ext-link>.

A number of epidemiologic and observational studies regularly report that consuming fruit and vegetables (F&#x00026;Vs) can lower CVD risk. Among several studies that have looked into the beneficial effects of F&#x00026;Vs in lowering CVD risk, Yusuf and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] reported that the population attributable risk for acute myocardial infarction given irregular consumption of F&#x00026;Vs was 12.9 %. Also, Crowe and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] reported that participants consuming at least 80&#x000a0;g of F&#x00026;Vs per day had a 22 % lower risk of fatal ischaemic heart disease. Berry fruits have also been shown a reduction in blood pressure as well as a reduction in the levels of pro-inflammatory markers and adhesion molecules, which are both markers of endothelial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Endothelial dysfunction is emerging as a potential set of early markers of cardiovascular disease risk. It is considered to play a principal role in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, and it is also present in later stages of vascular disease. Many studies have used a variety of tests in order to measure endothelial function as well as to assess the impact of potentially therapeutic interventions on the vasculature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In a placebo-controlled crossover study, a short fruit extract intervention study led to improved endothelial vasodilation measured by flow mediated dilatation (FMD) in individuals at risk for CVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Evidence suggests that dietary flavonoids work in various ways and reduce oxidative stress, which is caused by factors such as smoking, obesity, hypertension and other pathological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Specifically, phytonutrients in F&#x00026;Vs may have specific cardio-protective effects partially mediated through favourable effects on endothelial function, inhibition of angiogenesis and cell migration and proliferation in blood vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Although recent health and public reports focus on the five portions of a range of F&#x00026;V as being cardio-protective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], clear dose-response relations are poorly defined, which has resulted in major inconsistencies in F&#x00026;Vs recommendations. Overall, the body of evidence is growing on the modulation of endothelial, as well as macro- and microvascular function (predictive of cardiovascular risk), due to interventions using different categories of F&#x00026;Vs or chronic ingestion of selected phytonutrients. However, a paucity of studies have examined the vascular modulatory effects of chronic unselective exposure to a high dose of a very wide range of phytonutrients derived from F&#x00026;Vs, and it is currently not known whether this can bring about similar magnitudes and patterns of vascular change as compared with exposure to selected F&#x00026;Vs. We hypothesize that a high dose of unselective phytonutrients derived from F&#x00026;Vs, when ingested chronically, will result in potentially beneficial changes (compared with placebo) to both macro- and microvascular measures, through modulation of endothelial and conduit function of arteries, thus mitigating cardiovascular risk.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Aim/Objectives</title><p>The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of supplementation with encapsulated fruit and vegetable powder compared with placebo on vascular and endothelial function before and after 12&#x000a0;weeks of intervention when they are both given with &#x02018;5-A-Day&#x02019; dietary advice verbally and in writing.</p><p>Specifically, the primary objective of this trial is to assess whether there is a change in the carotid intima media thickness (cIMT) between the two groups.</p><p>The secondary objectives are to assess the following:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Dynamic macrovascular and microvascular changes.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Changes in laboratory blood markers, including endothelial cell function and oxidative stress.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Changes in Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) using the Five-a-day Community Evaluation Tool (FACET).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Changes to safety indicators: liver function, routine bloods (including full blood count) and ECG.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design</title><p>This study is a double-blind, randomised controlled trial for overweight and obese but otherwise healthy participants. It is being conducted at the Medical Research Council (MRC), Human Nutrition Research (HNR) unit in Cambridge, United Kingdom.

Consent is obtained before any measurements are taken. Height is measured to the nearest 0.1&#x000a0;cm using a stadiometer, and weight to the nearest 0.1&#x000a0;kg using calibrated mass scales. BMI is calculated using these measurements. Two blood pressure readings are recorded while the patient is in a seated position. A third BP measurement is performed if the first two readings have a discrepancy of more than 10&#x000a0;mmHg.</p><p>A full eligibility assessment is carried out using the HNR volunteer health screening and demographics questionnaire. Medical history and any recent changes in medication since the pre-screening questionnaire are also assessed and evaluated at this stage. In addition, female participants are also asked about the timing of their menstrual cycle as this can affect the vascular measurements in the study. Fasting blood samples are collected by venepuncture to measure blood lipids, glucose, and liver function as a routine safety measure and as an indicator of normal metabolism. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> summarises all the blood markers that are examined during the study. At the end of the visit, the volunteers are asked to complete two short questionnaires: the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and the Five-a-day Community Evaluation Tool (FACET) and are provided with &#x02018;5-A-Day&#x02019; dietary advice. If successfully screened, the participant is invited back to complete test visits 1 and 2. Ineligible participants are thanked for their time and are offered to join the HNR volunteer database.

At the end of the visit, participants are thanked for their time and given forms for reimbursement.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Analytic vascular measurements procedures</title><sec id="Sec20"><title>Carotid intima media thickness (cIMT)</title><p>cIMT is performed using a B-mode ultrasound imaging of the right and left carotid arteries with 7.5&#x000a0;MHz linear array transducer. In a dark, quiet room, participants are in a supine position with their head turned 45 <sup>o</sup> in the direction opposite to the carotid artery being measured. Eight longitudinal images of the distal common carotid arteries (CCA) are obtained, four from each side. On completion of the measurements, the images are analysed by two members of the research team. The outcome variable is the mean CCA-IMT defined as the average of four measurements of the far wall IMT of the right and left CCA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Pulse wave analysis (PWA)</title><p>Aortic augmentation index (AIx) is derived from the right wrist (radial pulse) using the SphygmoCor Vx version 7.01 (AtCor Medical, Sydney, Australia). The SphygmoCor device provides a quality index (QI), which represents reproducibility of the waveform, and any recordings with a QI&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;80 are excluded. Because the AIx changes with heart rate, the software adjusts this value for a heart rate of 75 beats per minute (AIx@HR75).</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Laser Doppler imaging following iontophoresis</title><p>Vascular changes related to microcirculatory flow and endothelial function are identified using the laser doppler imaging (LDI) technique (Moor Instruments, UK) with iontophoresis of acetylcholine (Ach) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP). The room temperature is set at 22 to 23&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, and the measurement is taken from the participant&#x02019;s right arm while he/she is in a seated position. Each drug is administered at increasing currents of 0&#x000a0;&#x003bc;A, 40&#x000a0;&#x003bc;A, 60&#x000a0;&#x003bc;A and 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;A for 5, 10, 30 and 60&#x000a0;seconds, respectively. Cumulative dose response curves are analysed automatically by the built-in software (MoorVMS-PC software).</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Electrocardiogram (ECG)</title><p>A 12-lead ECG is recorded in each participant with a 12-channel ECG machine (GEM MED, GEM heart one+, Cambridge, UK) on a paper with a speed of 25&#x000a0;mm/sec and 10&#x000a0;mm/mv standardisation. ECG waveforms are also saved in the gem heart viewer software (GEM MED, Cambridge, UK) for further examination and analysis if needed. ECG is performed once during test visits 1 and 2.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Flow-mediated dilatation and induced vasodilation using glycerol trinitrate</title><p>FMD is assessed in the brachial artery by high-resolution ultrasound and computerised edge detection system (FMD studio, Quipu srl, Pisa, Italy). All FMD measurements are performed while the participants are in a supine position with their right arm extended and in a quiet, darkened room kept at a relatively constant temperature (22 to 23&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) to minimise the possible negative effect of environmental and physiological influences. The blood pressure cuff is placed on the right forearm, 1 to 2&#x000a0;cm distal to the elbow crease, and an ultrasound probe holder is used to hold the probe stable on the antecubital fossa. The brachial artery is continuously imaged using a 7.5-MHz probe in B-mode (Accuson X300, Siemens UK; with a VF 8-3 probe) at a depth of 3&#x000a0;cm. The brachial artery diameter is measured on acquired frames using Quipu software (Quipu srl, Pisa, Italy). Baseline brachial artery images and blood-flow velocity prior to occlusion cuff inflation are recorded for 1&#x000a0;minute. The occlusion cuff is then inflated to 200&#x000a0;mmHg for 5&#x000a0;minutes and released, thereby inducing reactive hyperaemia and endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation, which is monitored for 4&#x000a0;minutes. Following a 10-minute recovery period, endothelium independent dilation is monitored over a 5-minute period after sublingual administration of 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g glycerol trinitrate (GTN) spray. Flow-mediated and GTN-induced dilatation of the brachial artery are expressed as maximum percent dilatation following cuff deflation and GTN administration, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Side effects and safety assessments</title><p>All participants are provided with a booklet where they can record any potential side effects. In case they develop severe side effects, they are advised to stop the supplementation and will be excluded from the study. All serious and non-serious adverse events and/or reactions involving capsules supplementation are logged by a member of the study team in a password protected database. In addition, any abnormal results of clinical importance detected during the course of the study (screening, test visits 1 and 2) will be reported by the HNR clinical team to the participant&#x02019;s general practitioner (GP).</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Biological sampling</title><p>A 15-ml blood sample will be collected from each participant at the screening visit and approximately 40&#x000a0;ml will be collected during test visits 1 and 2. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> outlines the blood parameters that are analysed in each study visit.</p><p>Participants collect-24&#x000a0;hour urine samples, which will be used to investigate the bioavailability of key polyphenol compounds present in the capsules. In addition, hydration status is measured using urine osmolality and urine dip stick from both the urine collected over 24&#x000a0;hours and from the single urine sample collected during test visits 1 and 2.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Data analysis</title><p>A consort flowchart of enrolled participants will be provided, and the demographic characteristics recorded at the time of randomisation will also be described. Descriptive analysis will be conducted for all baseline variables to compare participants in both study groups. Results will be reported as means and standard deviations for continuous variables and frequencies with percentages for categorical variables. Two group comparisons for changes in primary and secondary outcome measures following 12&#x000a0;weeks of intervention will be made, assuming similar levels of variance between the two treatment groups and using two-tailed t-tests for normally distributed data. Paired t-tests will be used to assess within-group changes in study outcomes. Multiple linear regression models will be used to assess whether changes from baseline to 12&#x000a0;weeks were significant between the study groups. Regression analysis will be conducted, with adjustment for potential baseline confounding variables. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis will be performed, exploring variation in the standard deviation between the differences of the mean change in cIMT measurements. Exploratory within-group changes will also be assessed for each outcome measure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study was designed to test the hypothesis that supplementation with capsules containing a combination of fruit and vegetables, in addition to dietary advice to consume five portions of fruit and vegetables daily, will significantly modulate biomarkers of vascular and metabolic function in overweight and obese adults, compared with a control group receiving identical dietary advice to consume &#x02018;5-A-Day&#x02019; and placebo capsules. The particular population was chosen for this study as overweight and obese individuals have increased cytokines free fatty acids and inflammation markers. These increases can lead to early endothelial dysfunction due to increased inflammation and other mechanisms associated with overweight and obesity.</p><p>This study was powered with cIMT as a primary outcome. However, as cIMT is a dynamic but structural measurement, a number of functional measurements, including those assessing vascular endothelium and smooth muscle tone, as well as both factors together, form part of the panel of outcome measures used in this mechanistic trial. These measures were designed to provide novel insights into vascular function pathways and the prediction of cardiovascular risk. In addition to vascular measurements, waist circumference, blood pressure and hydration status are expected to provide complementary information.</p><p>In particular, this explanatory trial also incorporates potential novel biomarkers such as trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Polyphenolic compounds have recently been found to modulate TMAO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Evaluating the ability of the NNTV study interventions on TMAO concentrations might be useful to understand if the polyphenolic fraction of this extract acts as a gut microbial modulator, reducing cardiovascular disease risk through the control of trimethylamine production.</p><p>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), also known as endotoxin, is a component of the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria that may normally reside in the colon of humans. Additionally, polyphenolic compounds have been attributed to modulation of the gut microbiome, through mechanisms involving their bacteriostatic activity and the inhibition of microbial fermentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Assessing the ability of the fruit and vegetable extract to change levels of LPS can help explain if the polyphenolic fraction of this extract acts as a gut microbial modulator, reducing future disease risk through the control of endotoxaemia.</p><sec id="Sec29"><title>Trial Status</title><p>This clinical trial was registered in February 2014. At the time of manuscript submission, the enrolment of volunteers was ongoing. The estimated study completion date is December 2015.
