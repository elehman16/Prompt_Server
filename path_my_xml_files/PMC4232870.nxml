It has been hypothesized that early initiation of treatment with the combination of oral anti-diabetes agents with complementary mechanisms of action can increase the durability of glycaemic control compared with metformin monotherapy followed by a stepwise addition of oral agents. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors are good candidates for early use as they are efficacious in combination with metformin, show weight neutrality and a low risk of hypoglycaemia.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors increase the availability of endogenous glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and are good candidates for early use in combination with metformin as they are oral agents increasing glucose-sensitive insulin secretion with a very low risk of hypoglycaemia <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. The combination of the two treatments has no deleterious impact on weight control <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>.</p><p>One of the known causes of deteriorating glycaemic control is the gradual failure of &#x003b2;-cell function. This is conventionally addressed by adding additional agents over a period of time&#x02014;often years&#x02014;to maintain acceptable glycaemia. Different agents may modify the progression of glycaemic failure differently, as was shown in the Diabetes Outcome Progression Trial (ADOPT), which compared thiazolidinedione monotherapy, sulphonylurea monotherapy and metformin monotherapy <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>.

After the screening visit, approximately 2000 eligible participants will enter a run-in period, during which metformin will be up titrated to a target dose of 1500 mg or maximum tolerated dose. At the end of the run-in period, participants who are able to tolerate a dose of 1000 mg or higher will be randomized 1:1 to the addition of vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily or placebo and will enter period 1. Dose adjustment of metformin in both treatment arms will continue during the first 4 weeks of period 1, with the aim of reaching a dose of 2000 mg, or the maximum tolerated dose. HbA<sub>1c</sub> will be determined approximately every 3 months. While in period 1, when measurements of HbA<sub>1c</sub> from two consecutive scheduled study visits are &#x02265; 53 mmol/mol (7.0%), participants in the metformin group will add vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily (period 2). Participants in the early initiation vildagliptin&#x02013;metformin group will continue the same treatment, so that participants in both treatment groups will receive vildagliptin and metformin during period 2. The blinding to the study group allocation at randomization will be maintained. If during period 2 local diabetes guidelines require treatment intensification with insulin, participants will start insulin treatment in addition to the vildagliptin&#x02013;metformin combination treatment (period 3). Open-label insulin treatment will be initiated with an insulin type and regimen at the investigator&#x02019;s discretion, although the protocol expresses a preference for once-daily basal insulin. If an alternative anti-diabetes medication is considered necessary for intensification during period 2, the participant will be discontinued from the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Study population</title><p>Key inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in Table<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>.

This calculation used a bivariate <italic>t</italic>-statistic with a correlation of 0.5 for the test statistics corresponding to the two primary efficacy variables.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Addressing the defects in insulin secretion and the increased insulin resistance with appropriate treatments early in the course of Type 2 diabetes could be more beneficial than the existing paradigm of stepwise introduction of treatments only when glycaemia deteriorates <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. VERIFY&#x02019;s main objective is to test that hypothesis</p><p>Time-to-failure determination has often been based on a patient&#x02019;s glycaemia exceeding a single threshold value, with analysis by the use of survival (Kaplan&#x02013;Meier) analysis <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. Coefficient of failure analysis examines, by means of least-squares regression, the trend in deterioration with the time to failure estimated by intersection of this line through a predetermined threshold <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. This has the advantage that HbA<sub>1c</sub> data can be utilized from all participants to assess rate of failure, as both the slope and the intercept can be used. A specific HbA<sub>1c</sub> cut-off value for insulin initiation is not specified in VERIFY because of the multinational character of the study and the existing differences in national and local recommendations about insulin treatment in Type 2 diabetes. The threshold will be nationally determined and reported. The coefficient of failure is independent of threshold levels. We aim to use both conventional Kaplan&#x02013;Meier and regression analysis as co-primary analyses for durability.</p><p>The time-to-failure approach was used in the ADOPT study, which compared the durability of glycaemic control between rosiglitazone, metformin and glibenclamide <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. In that study, the criterion for treatment failure was based on fasting plasma glucose &#x0003e; 10.0 mmol/l [corresponding to an HbA<sub>1c</sub> of approximately 64 mmol/mol (8.0%)] and, based on that criterion, the risk reduction in the cumulative incidence of treatment failure with rosiglitazone vs. metformin was approximately 30%. In VERIFY, the time to treatment failure with the vildagliptin&#x02013;metformin combination vs. metformin monotherapy will be determined based on the HbA<sub>1c</sub> target of 53 mmol/mol (7.0%), reflecting changes in treatment guidelines <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>.</p><p>VERIFY will also assess time to insulin with the early vildagliptin&#x02013;metformin combination vs. the stepwise introduction of the two therapies. Time to insulin initiation is an important clinical endpoint. Insulin therapy is complex, expensive, has significant educational requirements, and can cause hypoglycaemia. Any systematic delay in glycaemic deterioration will have cost and healthcare provision benefits.</p><p>Pooled data from clinical trials conducted in drug-naive participants with Type 2 diabetes who received 24-week treatment with vildagliptin monotherapy have shown consistent improvements in both fasting and meal test-derived measures of &#x003b2;-cell function <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. The synergistic effect of vildagliptin and metformin in increasing active GLP-1 levels may result in long-term improvement and preservation of &#x003b2;-cell function in people with Type 2 diabetes initiated with vildagliptin&#x02013;metformin combination therapy early in the course of the disease. In VERIFY, HOMA-B will be determined in all participants and dynamic measures of &#x003b2;-cell function will be assessed during a standard meal test in a subgroup of participants at yearly intervals. These tests will demonstrate whether the enhancement of GLP-1 levels by the vildagliptin&#x02013;metformin combination started early in the course of Type 2 diabetes would result in preservation of &#x003b2;-cell function. Studies with vildagliptin have suggested the possibility of extra-pancreatic effects on insulin resistance and triglyceride metabolism that have not been reported with other DPP-4 inhibitors. Vildagliptin has been shown to directly reduce overnight hepatic glucose production, leading to an additional effect on fasting plasma glucose, and to reduced lipotoxicity-induced insulin resistance <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. VERIFY will evaluate if these extra-pancreatic effects will be maintained with long-term treatment with the vildagliptin&#x02013;metformin combination.</p><p>The VERIFY study population is early in the diabetes progression and therefore at relatively low risk of micro- or macrovascular complications. VERIFY is not powered to detect differences in diabetic complications. Other trials of DPP-4 inhibitors have demonstrated, in high-risk groups, no cardiovascular differences in outcome with a study period of approximately 2 years <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. However, with 2000 participants exposed for up to 5 years to the vildagliptin&#x02013;metformin combination vs. metformin monotherapy, followed by the addition of vildagliptin and, eventually, insulin, it is of interest to explore for trends in the development of micro- and macrovascular complications. Therefore prognostic markers for diabetic complications such as microalbuminuria, as well as trends in cardiovascular, events will be assessed. In addition, development of microaneurysms will be assessed in a subset of participants. Results from the Diabetic Retinopathy Candesartan Trials (DIRECT) suggest that microaneurysm counts are important prognostic indicators for worsening of retinopathy <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and that changes already occur relatively early in the disease. Any differences observed could be predictive for future risk for more advanced retinopathy or other micro- or macrovascular complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The 5-year VERIFY study will investigate if addressing the different pathophysiological defects in Type 2 diabetes mellitus by early initiation of vildagliptin&#x02013;metformin combination treatment will result in lower treatment failure rate or in lower HbA<sub>1c</sub> progression over time, compared with metformin monotherapy, followed by the addition of a second oral anti-diabetic agent (vildagliptin). The study will also provide long-term data on &#x003b2;-cell function and insulin resistance, diabetic complications and the effect on health status under treatment with a vildagliptin&#x02013;metformin combination.</p><sec><title>Funding</title><p>The study is being funded by Novartis.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>SDP has participated in advisory panels for Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Merck, Roche Pharmaceuticals, Roche Diagnostics, Pfizer, Eli Lilly, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol-Myers Squibb, AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi-Aventis and Takeda Pharmaceuticals; received fees for speaking by Eli Lilly, Sanofi-Aventis, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Bristol-Myers Squibb; received research support from Merck, Sanofi-Aventis and Takeda Pharmaceuticals.
