reality-based Otago exercise on balance, gait, and falls efficacy of elderly women.
[Subjects] The subjects were 21 elderly women, who were randomly divided into two groups:
an augmented reality-based Otago exercise group of 10 subjects and an Otago exercise group
of 11 subjects. [Methods] All subjects were evaluated for balance (Berg Balance Scale,
BBS), gait parameters (velocity, cadence, step length, and stride length), and falls
efficacy. Within 12 weeks, Otago exercise for muscle strengthening and balance training
was conducted three times, for a period of 60 minutes each, and subjects in the
experimental group performed augmented reality-based Otago exercise. [Results] Following
intervention, the augmented reality-based Otago exercise group showed significant
increases in BBS, velocity, cadence, step length (right side), stride length (right side
and left side) and falls efficacy. [Conclusion] The results of this study suggest the
feasibility and suitability of this augmented reality-based Otago exercise for elderly
women.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Augmented reality</kwd><kwd>Otago exercise</kwd><kwd>Falls efficacy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Falls occur more often in women than in men, and the rate of falls in people older than
65&#x02005;years is greater than 33%<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Falls are
affected by many causes; for example, culture, sex, social services regarding health,
physical activities, healthy intake, drug intake, behavior that increases dangerous causes,
attitudes, fear of falls, treatment after falls, and personal factors, like race, social
environment, and economic strength, are factors affecting personal life and are taken as
having a negative effect on quality of life<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, these fall factors can be good prevention factors that
decrease</p><p>danger of falls in the elderly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Loss of muscle
strength in the weak elderly occurs more on the upper part of the body than the lower part;
special knee supporting muscle strength shows a decrease, so that the body sways even when
standing with two feet supported on a bearing surface<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, gait is also affected, so that decrease in step
length, stride length, gait speed, and toe off and double support time increase. Therefore,
elderly persons should increase muscle and maintain balance, and prevent falls through
experimental factors like exercise<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Research on fall prevention exercise for the elderly has been proposed, which includes
balancing exercise while standing on a hard and soft surface<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, resistive exercise that increases muscle strengthening exercise
using a Thera-band<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, endurance exercise
riding on a stationary exercise bike<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>,
and maintenance of a maintain static body posture that can improve flexibility, like
yoga<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup> and t&#x02019;ai chi ch&#x02019;uan, which is
effective for balance and motor sensation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, all these studies suggest different methods, and there is
no typical method.</p><p>The Otago exercise program is composed of muscle strengthening, balance training, and
walking, which suggests a specific training method<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>; in an experiment using this training program, males and females
aged older than 70 were randomly divided into an experimental group and control group; the
results showed an increase in balance, muscle strength, and falls percentage, and the danger
rate of falls was decreased<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>On the other hand, recent rehabilitation research has introduced a new rehabilitation
training method using various forms of tasks that fit the patient&#x02019;s personal purpose and is
performed using virtual reality and augmented reality; the results showed significant
functional improvement<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Augmented reality provides reality and additional
information using external projection equipment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup> combined with an imagine target, which turn increases the reality
effects, which increases feedback, making flexible imagined changes become reality and vice
versa<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the treatment
environment when using augmented reality increases task complication gradually and also
helps in increasing the effects of the education<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Thus, this study was conducted in order to investigate the effect of application of
augmented reality-based Otago exercise on the elderly for fall prevention and to provide
basal information.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> Characteristics of the participants (N=21)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">VR based Otago exercise group (n=10)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Otago exercise group (n=11)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (y)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">72.90 (3.41)<sup> a </sup></td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">75.64 (5.57)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">151.08 (3.31)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">151.80 (9.74)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">57.51 (4.87)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">57.36 (8.73)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.20 (2.02)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24.82 (2.11)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup> mean (SD).

this study. The selection criteria were sufficient cognitive ability to participate, as
indicated by a mini-mental state examination score of 24 or higher. The exclusion criteria
were 1) disabilities in visual, auditory sensation, and vestibular organs; 2) defects in
extremities; and 3) fracture in the past year. All of the subjects received an explanation
of this study and agreed to participate. A total of 21 elderly women were selected and
divided into an augmented reality-based Otago exercise group, which included 10 subjects,
and an Otago exercise group, which included 11 subjects; exercise was performed for 12
weeks. General characteristics of the augmented reality-based Otago exercise group and Otago
exercise group are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>This study was conducted in order to provide an augmented reality environment for training
of elderly women, provide the graphic and vision-based web-camera recognition handling
technique, provide the vision and auditory expression technique for emotional feedback,
build up vision and auditory models and a recognition information database, and provide a
handling technique for situational perception and its reactions as a way of improving
balance, gait, and physical factors in falls; in particular, real-time motion recognition
was performed using a preserved modeled movement for measurement of speed of the movement
and its accuracy. The first week of research started with a moderate intensity exercise
program that subjects could perform five times. Subjects stood in front of a computer with a
web camera, which had an SVGA resolution (800 &#x000d7; 600) head-mounted display (i-visor FX601,
Dae-Yang E&#x00026;C Co, Korea, 2008) and followed the movement displayed. The computer sensed
the movement of the subjects and sent the information to the head-mounted display in order
to repeat the task and move to the next level, which increased the speed.</p><p>Otago exercise was developed at Otago Medical School to prevent falls in the elderly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The muscle strengthening exercises
include knee extension exercise for front knee strengthening, knee flexion for back knee
strengthening, hip joint abduction for side hip strengthening, plantar flexion for calf
raises of the ankle, and dorsiflexion for toe raises of the ankle; the balance training
includes backward walking, walking and turning around, heel to toe walking, one leg stand,
heel walking, toe walk, heel to toe walking backward, sit to stand, and stair walking.
Muscle training and balance training are performed for a period of 40 minutes each, three
times per week, according to the level of the subjects, and after the exercise, there was a
10-minute cooling down period<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Balance ability was measured using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS). The BBS is a valid and
reliable instrument for measuring both the static and dynamic aspects of balance in elderly
people with stroke<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. BBS scores range
from 0 to 56 points, and the higher the score, the better the balance.</p><p>Gait function was measured using a GAITRite system (GAITRite, CIR systems Inc., Havertown,
PA, USA). The GAITRite system was used to measure spatiotemporal parameters, including gait
velocity, cadence, step length, and stride length. Subjects were asked to walk at a
comfortable speed, without the use of an assistive device, along a 10&#x02005;m hallway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Fall efficacy was measured using the short Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I)
version, which is a tool for measuring confidence regarding prevention of falls. Kempen et
al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref><sup>)</sup> selected seven items for the
Short FES-I out of the 16 items of the FES-I. The original questionnaire contains 16 items
scored on a four-point scale. Lower scores indicate higher confidence in prevention of
falls<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The SPSS statistical package, version 18.0, was used in performance of all statistical
analyses. The dependent variables were balance test, gait function and falls efficacy test.
General characteristics of the subjects and variables followed a normal distribution. The
paired t-test was used to determine changes between before and after the balance test, gait
function, and falls efficacy test. The independent t-test was used for analysis of changes
between groups of dependent variables. Results were considered significant at p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title> Comparison of balance, gait and fall efficacy within groups and between groups

functions, and falls efficacy of elderly women. As one grows older, anatomically,
physiological aging and degeneration of proprioception and the vestibular system occurs. In
addition, muscle mass decreases and postural sway increases, so the reaction time of the
motor nerve becomes slower until changes ultimately occur in balance control, which
increases the frequency of falls<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Liu-Ambrose et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup> randomly divided 74
elderly people older than 70&#x02005;years of age into an experimental group, which included 36
subjects, and a control group, which included 38 subjects. Otago exercise was performed in
the experimental group for six months; for static balance, postural sway showed a decrease,
from 360.3&#x02005;mm to 305&#x02005;mm, and dynamic balance, which was tested using the Timed Up and Go
Test, decreased from 14.2&#x02005;s to 13.6 s. In addition, Campbell et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref><sup>)</sup> divided 233 elderly women into an experimental group,
which included 116 subjects, and a control group, which included 117 subjects. Otago
exercise was performed for six months; the 4-test balance score showed a significant
difference, from 0.42 to &#x02212;0.01 (p&#x0003c;0.05). In this study, the BBS score for the augmented
reality- based Otago exercise group showed a significant increase, from 47.60 to 53.70
(p=0.000); a significant increase, from 48.91 to 52.45 (p=0.001), was observed in the Otago
exercise group, corresponding to findings of previous research. This means that Otago
exercise might affect improvement in the ankle strategy and hip strategy. In the ankle
strategy, the body can move as a single entity about the ankle when the foot muscle is
activated on the ground<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref><sup>)</sup>; Otago exercise
was helpful in walking, standing erect, control of the body when it moves in a small range
of area, and regaining balance when moving unconsciously. The hip strategy is used when the
body moves faster as the velocity increases along with the distance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref><sup>)</sup>; Otago exercise helped walking posture with regard to
movement correction and muscle activation pattern and the helped with balance control with
regard to the base of support. Finally, we assume that augmented reality is a medium for
helping the ankle and hip strategy by allowing individuals to visually compare the modeled
motion and self motion.</p><p>An independent gait makes life productive, and is the most efficient method of moving from
one place to another<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. As the elderly
age, aerobic capacity, joint flexibility, muscle strength, and bone mass decrease, so that
gait velocity and cadence decrease, step length and stride length decrease, double leg
support time increases, and heel off and arm swing decrease, resulting in an unstable gait
pattern<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. Binns<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref><sup>)</sup> divided women older than 80&#x02005;years into an experimental
group, which included 19 subjects, and an control group, which included 18 subjects; Otago
exercise was performed in the experimental group for six months; gait velocity increased
from 0.80 m/s to 1.10 m/s. In this study, the augmented reality-based Otago exercise group
showed a significant increase, from 0.79.8 m/s to 0.99.2 m/s (p=0.001), which corresponded
with results of previous research. We assume that this is affected by backward walk, walking
and turning around, heel to toe walking, and stair walking in the Otago exercise program.
The subjects worked on speed, distance, direction, rhythm and muscle tone, and strength
while walking. In addition, through stair walking, the subjects practiced with a fixed foot
support, acceleration, balance control, extension and contraction of the lower limb, and
ankle dorsiflexion to move the center of gravity to control the afferent, efferent, and
contraction of the lower limb muscles. As a result, coordination and weight shifting were
learned through movement of the lower limbs, and this improvement resulted in an increase in
step length of the right lower limb and stride length of both lower limbs, thereby improving
gait velocity and cadence.</p><p>Self-efficacy is the self-belief or capability to create a plan and implement it. This
efficacy also affects elderly, and decreases as people grow older, and it can be a hazardous
factor for falls<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>; in addition, fear,
which is the most significant complication of falls, should be regarded as an important
matter<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. Campbell et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref><sup>)</sup> divided 233 women older than 80&#x02005;years of
age randomly into an experimental group, which included 116 subjects, and a control group,
which included 117 subjects; Otago exercise was performed in the experimental group for six
months; fall efficacy showed a significant difference, from 93.3 to 91.9 (p=0.009). Two
years later, Campbell et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref><sup>)</sup> traced 41
subjects in the experimental group, and 61 subjects in the control group and found that the
falls efficacy changed from 91.0 to 89.4, which was statistically significant (p=0.03). In
this research, the falls efficacy in the augmented reality-based Otago exercise group showed
a significant difference (p=0.019), from 14.50 to 11.80, which corresponded with the
previous research. This was the result of repeated training with the augmented reality
program and the head-mounted display, which isolated the subjects from the external
environment in order to increase concentration. Thornton et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref><sup>)</sup> have shown that virtual reality participants had greater
improvements in quantitative measures and made more comments expressing enjoyment and
improved confidence. An augmented reality environment can provide users with direct visual
feedback to control their movement and watch their own movement at the same time<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. It implies that Otago exercise based on
augmented reality can draw a user&#x02019;s interest and influence the falls efficacy. In addition,
the improved gait of subjects in the augmented reality-based Otago exercise group resulted
in increased mobility, which helped in performance of activities of daily living and social
activities and was also related to positive physical activity. In this study, we assume that
the augmented reality program represented repeated feedback, and the Otago training
represented a goal of the subjects, which they could achieve by succeeding at each level,
and that self-pride increased. The increase in self-pride was related to self-efficacy,
which leads to an increase in falls efficacy. Therefore, repetitive training using the
augmented reality-based Otago exercise for fall prevention leads to a decrease in the fear
of falls in elderly women and even changes their behaviors.</p><p>This research showed that augmented reality-based Otago exercise is effective for improving
balance, gait, and falls efficacy of elderly women and that application of augmented
reality-based Otago exercise is meaningful. We expect that this augmented reality-based
Otago exercise will be used in elderly care centers as a physical therapy for effective
training for balance, gait, and falls efficacy, and it could be used as a database for
rehabilitation. We also hope that augmented reality-based rehabilitation research will be
conducted continuously.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Nevitt</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name><name><surname>Cummings</surname><given-names>SR</given-names></name><name><surname>Kidd</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><etal> et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Risk factors for recurrent nonsyncopal falls.
