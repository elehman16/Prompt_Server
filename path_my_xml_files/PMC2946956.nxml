We recruited 496 infants hospitalized for first-episode acute bronchiolitis between October 2004 and January 2008. Patients were randomly allocated to receive from physiotherapists three times a day, either IET &#x0002b; AC (intervention group, <italic>n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;</italic>246) or nasal suction (NS, control group, <italic>n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;</italic>250). Only physiotherapists were aware of the allocation group of the infant. The primary outcome was time to recovery, defined as 8 hours without oxygen supplementation associated with minimal or no chest recession, and ingesting more than two-thirds of daily food requirements. Secondary outcomes were intensive care unit admissions, artificial ventilation, antibiotic treatment, description of side effects during procedures, and parental perception of comfort. Statistical analysis was performed on an intent-to-treat basis. Median time to recovery was 2.31 days, (95&#x00025; confidence interval [CI] 1.97&#x02013;2.73) for the control group and 2.02 days (95&#x00025; CI 1.96&#x02013;2.34) for the intervention group, indicating no significant effect of physiotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.09, 95&#x00025; CI 0.91&#x02013;1.31, <italic>p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;</italic>0.33).

A third of all children have bronchiolitis during their first year of life. The illness begins with stuffiness, a runny nose, a mild cough, and mild fever. Then, as the smallest airways in the lung (the bronchioles) become inflamed (swell) and blocked with mucus, the cough worsens, and the infant may develop a wheeze, shallow breathing, and a rapid heartbeat. Most cases of bronchiolitis are mild and clear up within two weeks without any treatment but some infants develop severe disease. Such infants struggle to get enough air into their lungs, drawing in their chest with each breath (chest recession). They have trouble eating and drinking, and the oxygen level in their blood can drop dangerously low. About 1&#x00025; of previously healthy infants need hospitalization because of severe bronchiolitis. These severely affected infants are not normally given any medications but, where necessary, they are given oxygen therapy, fed through a tube into their stomach, and given fluids through a vein.</p></sec><sec id="s1a2"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>In some countries, chest physiotherapy is routinely given to infants with bronchiolitis even though this is not a recommended treatment internationally. In France, for example, virtually all outpatients with bronchiolitis receive a form of chest physiotherapy known as increased exhalation technique with assisted cough (IET &#x0002b; AC). IET&#x02014;manual chest compression&#x02014;is designed to clear mucus from the bronchioles whereas AC&#x02014;coughing triggered by applying pressure to the top of the breastbone&#x02014;facilitates clearance of the large airways. But is IET &#x0002b; AC an effective treatment for bronchiolitis? In this study, the researchers undertook a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial to answer this question. A randomized trial is a study in which patients are randomly allocated to receive either the treatment under study or a control treatment. Usually in such trials, noone is aware of the treatment allocations until the trial has been completed. This is called blinding and avoids unconscious biases being introduced into the results. In this trial, although the parents, caregivers, and outcome assessors were blinded, the physiotherapists and the infants were aware of treatment allocations. The physiotherapists were not involved in patient assessment, however, and the infants were sufficiently young that their knowledge of their treatment was unlikely to bias the results.</p></sec><sec id="s1a3"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers enrolled nearly 500 children aged 15 days to 2 years who were admitted to seven French hospitals for a first episode of acute bronchiolitis. They randomly allocated the patients to receive IET &#x0002b; AC (intervention group) or nasal suction (control group) three times a day from a physiotherapist working alone in a room with blacked-out windows. The primary outcome of the trial was the patients' time to recovery. Infants were judged to have recovered if they had not had oxygen therapy or showed signs of chest recession for 8 hours and had ingested more than two-thirds of their daily food requirement. Infants in the control group took an average of 2.31 days to recover whereas those in the intervention group took 2.02 days. However, this difference in recovery time was not statistically significant. That is, it could have happened by chance. The researchers also recorded several secondary outcomes such as admission to an intensive care unit, help with breathing, antibiotic treatment, and parental perceptions of their child's comfort. There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups for any of these secondary outcomes, although the parents did report that the IET &#x0002b; AC treatment was harder on their children than nasal suction while not reducing their overall comfort.</p></sec><sec id="s1a4"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings show that IET &#x0002b; AC had no significant effect on the time to recovery of a large population of French infants admitted to hospital with severe bronchiolitis. These results cannot be extrapolated, however, to infants with mild or moderate bronchiolitis, and further studies are needed to assess whether chest physiotherapy is of any benefit in an outpatient setting. Three small trials of a different form of chest physiotherapy have also previously failed to find any effect of chest physiotherapy on recovery time. Thus, none of the currently available results support the routine use of chest physiotherapy in infants admitted to a hospital for severe bronchiolitis.</p></sec><sec id="s1a5"><title>Additional Information</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000345">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000345</ext-link>

Chest physiotherapy aims to clear airway obstruction, thereby decreasing airway resistance, improving gas exchange, and making breathing easier. International recommendations do not recommend chest physiotherapy for the management of bronchiolitis <xref rid="pmed.1000345-SIGN1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000345-Subcommittee1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. These recommendations are based on a recent Cochrane review analyzing three clinical trials evaluating chest physiotherapy in infants with bronchiolitis <xref rid="pmed.1000345-Perrotta1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>; however, these studies have several limitations. Most importantly, these studies were based on percussion and vibration techniques, which are very different from the increased exhalation technique (IET) with assisted cough (AC) that might be more appropriate in this context. IET is designed to clear the distal airways, whereas AC is known to facilitate large-airway clearance <xref rid="pmed.1000345-King1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000345-Sivasothy1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.

Medical history was obtained from parents or guardians, on a standardized data-collection form including questions about personal history of eczema, family history of asthma or eczema in parents and siblings, and tobacco smoke in the home environment.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Randomization</title><p>Randomization involved the chest physiotherapist opening a sealed sequentially numbered envelope containing a random allocation computer generated with SAS (SAS Inc.) software packages in advance by the biostatistician. Randomization was stratified according to center and according to age (&#x0003c;2 mo, &#x02265;2 mo) at each center, using permutation blocks with a block size of four that was not mentioned to the physicians involved in the patient recruitment.</p><p>All pediatric department staff, parents, and guardians were blind to treatment assignment. Randomization codes were kept secure until data entry was complete. Thus, those involved in the evaluation of primary outcome or in the decision of the cointerventions were blinded to group assignment.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Study Intervention</title><p>The treatment, either intervention or control, was performed by the physiotherapist staying alone with the infant, in a room with a covered window pane, to ensure that clinicians and parents could not observe treatment, thus preserving blinding in the trial. All infants received treatment three times daily. In each center, four to six physiotherapists, specially trained to carry out chest physiotherapy in children, participated in the study. The therapists were not involved in the evaluation of time to recovery.</p><sec id="s3d1"><title>Intervention group</title><p>The intervention was defined as the IET followed by AC, with gentle nasal suction (NS).</p><p>Just before the start of the study, a senior physiotherapist presented this technique at each center and all physiotherapists received formal training in these techniques. During the study, a referent physiotherapist at each center ensured that chest physiotherapy was consistent and standardized.</p><p>IET involved the generation of synchronized thoracic-abdominal movement by the hands of the physiotherapist at the beginning of expiration with one hand on the thorax, meanwhile, with the other on the abdomen, centered on the umbilicus, the physiotherapist applied an abdominal counter-weight. This maneuver allowed to create a passive expiratory flow. The maneuver began at the end of the inspiratory plateau and was pursued until the end of expiration, according to the infant's thoraco-pulmonary compliance and up to his or her chest wall and lung resistance limits. The resulting dynamic compression of the respiratory system increased expiratory airflow. The procedure was repeated until meeting auscultation-efficacy criteria (decrease or disappearance of wheezing and/or increase of ronchi), but did not last longer than 10 to 15 min. The procedure was stopped in the case of respiratory status aggravation. If no spontaneous coughing occurred, coughing could be triggered by pressure on the suprasternal notch. Gentle NS with a flexible probe was used to remove mucous secretions at the end of the procedure. All patients were closely monitored by continuous pulse oxymetry during chest physiotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="s3d2"><title>Control group</title><p>Similarly to the intervention group, the control group also spent 10&#x02013;15 min in a room alone with the therapist three times daily. In this group of infants, the physiotherapists performed only gentle NS to remove mucous secretions for few minutes and stayed inside the room for the remaining time without performing any maneuver on the infants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Other Treatments</title><p>All children enrolled in this study followed the same clinical treatment pathway to ensure consistent care and minimal variability of the results. Guidelines for the use and termination of oxygen supplementation and orogastric feeding or intravenous fluids were followed.</p><p>Oxygen supplementation was administered if oxygen saturation was below 95&#x00025; when awake and 92&#x00025; when asleep. It was stopped when oxygen saturation was consistently above 95&#x00025; when awake and 92&#x00025; when asleep. Nurses interrupted oxygen supplementation three times per day to assess saturation in room air.</p><p>Enteral feeding was administered when possible, with orogastric feeding offered to infants spontaneously ingesting less than two-thirds of their daily needs or with significant signs of chest recession, tachypnea (&#x0003e;60/min) or hypoxemia, or a worsening of respiratory signs during feeding. Intravenous fluids were preferred over oral feeding if respiratory conditions did not improve with orogastric feeding or oral feeding was insufficient (particularly if vomiting occurred during orogastric feeding). The use of intravenous fluids stopped when the infant was able to tolerate oral feeding. A physician and nurses reevaluated the need for orogastric feeding and intravenous fluids twice daily.</p><p>Other treatments, such as bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics, are not recommended in national and international guidelines <xref rid="pmed.1000345-Bush1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000345-Smyth1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000345-Subcommittee1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000345-Yanney1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, but could be prescribed freely if physicians felt it appropriate.

An infant was considered to be cured if no oxygen supplementation had been given for 8 h and the child had minimal or no chest recession and was ingesting more than two-thirds of daily needs. The nursing staff recorded respiratory and heart rates, oxygen saturation, and signs of chest recession when the patient was quiet, at least once every 8 h.

As parents were not allowed to be present during the physiotherapy procedure, their opinion was a global one, based on their observations before and after each procedure, and on their global evaluation of their child. Parents answered several questions: (1) During hospitalization, how would you evaluate the comfort of your child? Analogical visual scale ranging from 0 (very bad) to 10 (excellent); (2) How would you evaluate how arduous the physiotherapy procedure was for your child? Analogical visual scale ranging from 0 (not arduous at all) to 10 (very arduous); (3) Do you think that the physiotherapy procedure has really worsened, rather worsened, not changed anything, rather improved, or really improved the comfort of your child (choose one answer)?; and (4) Do you think that the physiotherapy procedure has really worsened, rather worsened, not changed anything, rather improved, or really improved your child's breathing (choose one answer).</p><p>Finally, secondary PICU admission and artificial ventilation, antibiotic treatment were recorded.

Therefore, to determine the sample size, we used the duration of hospitalization for bronchiolitis recorded in the study hospitals during previous years (mean duration of hospitalization, 6.5 d, and standard deviation [SD], 3.5 d). For a type I error of 0.05 and a power of 0.80, for detecting a 20&#x00025; decrease in time to recovery in the IET &#x0002b; AC group, we needed to include 228 infants (114 infants in each group). One of the aims of this trial was to investigate possible interactions with age. We therefore set up two groups of 228 children (under and over the age of 2 mo), giving 456 children in total. We planned to include an additional 10&#x00025; of patients to ensure that we had sufficient subjects for analysis (due to potential study dropouts or consent withdrawals).

In this seven-center trial, no evidence of any difference in time to recovery between the IET &#x0002b; AC group and the NS group was found, with no interaction with age group. The CIs around estimates of effect excluded a clinically meaningful difference in time to recovery between groups in the whole population.</p><p>Otherwise, there was no evidence of any difference in secondary outcomes between children with and without IET &#x0002b; AC except for vomiting and transient respiratory destabilization during the procedure. This significant difference of vomiting and respiratory destabilization frequency was expected and in accordance with our physiotherapists'experiences. However, it is worth noting that these side effects of IET &#x0002b; AC were transient and resolved as soon as the procedure was interrupted. Although not statistically significant, the percentage of bradycardia during a procedure was three times higher in the group EIT &#x0002b; AC. This side effect of IET is rare but known, and it is important to note that bradycardia quickly disappeared in all children.</p><p>For parents, predictably, the perception of the arduousness of the procedure was significantly higher for IET &#x0002b; AC as compared to NS. Indeed, IET &#x0002b; AC is a tiring procedure for children even though the recovery is quick once the procedure is over. This perception may explain the absence of difference between both groups for the evaluation of the global comfort.</p><p>Although we preplanned an economic analysis, it was not conducted given the negative findings on efficacy outcomes.</p><p>Chest physiotherapy is recommended in infants with bronchiolitis by the French national consensus guidelines <xref rid="pmed.1000345-Consensus1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The rationale for such a recommendation is that physiotherapy could enhance the clearance of bronchial secretions, thereby decreasing respiratory distress and chest recession and increasing oxygenation. Airflow has not been assessed in infants undergoing IET, but the feasibility of achieving maximal flow (i.e., flow limitation at low lung volumes) has been demonstrated in sleeping healthy infants wearing an inflatable jacket compressing the thorax at the end of normal inspiration <xref rid="pmed.1000345-Marsh1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000345-Hoskyns1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> or after lung inflation to total pulmonary capacity <xref rid="pmed.1000345-Feher1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000345-Hayden1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. When the thorax was compressed from total pulmonary capacity to residual volume, flow limitation at low lung volumes (distal airways) was achieved for lower transpulmonary pressure than flow limitation at high lung volume (large airways) <xref rid="pmed.1000345-Feher1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000345-Hayden1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, but further increase in transpulmonary pressure could have a negative effect on flow limitation at low lung volumes. These studies conducted in healthy sleeping infants do not mimic IET &#x0002b; AC applied in infants with bronchiolitis. In the present study, pulmonary distension could alter chest wall compliance and therefore transpulmonary pressure transmission. Infants were awake with the possibility to decreased thoraco-pulmonary compliance in response to manipulations, and most of all interindividual variability in IET &#x0002b; AC application could not be avoided despite the optimal training and continuous survey of IET &#x0002b; AC during the study. However, IET &#x0002b; AC is routine practice in France and physiotherapists were substantially experienced and trained. Therefore, the study reflects the effectiveness of physiotherapy in infants with bronchiolitis in real life practice as recommended by guidelines.</p><p>Previous studies on chest physiotherapy included smaller numbers of subjects, with physician-assessed clinical scores as the primary outcome and nonrelevant variables as secondary outcomes (durations of oxygen supplementation and hospitalization duration stay) <xref rid="pmed.1000345-Bohe1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1000345-Webb1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Duration of oxygen supplementation was clearly not a relevant outcome because it was required in only 56.5&#x00025; of the infants studied. The results of any study including only infants requiring oxygen supplementation should therefore not be extrapolated to infants not requiring oxygen.</p><p>We tried to determine the time to recovery as accurately as possible. It was therefore necessary to assess the conditions of the infants around the clock, and not only when physicians were present. Nurses recorded respiratory signs, heart rate, and SpO<sub>2</sub> at least every 8 h, as previously performed <xref rid="pmed.1000345-Wainwright1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Thus, the 0.3-d (which is almost equivalent to 8 h) difference observed between the two randomized groups in median time to recovery could be related to the study design, which hampered the detection of a smaller difference. However, a smaller gain of healing time would not have any clinical relevance. Otherwise, we have previously shown that the clinical signs used for monitoring (respiratory rates and retraction signs) were recorded similarly by all physicians, nurses, and physiotherapists, with a high level of interobserver reproducibility <xref rid="pmed.1000345-Gajdos1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. We compared IET &#x0002b; AC with NS, because NS provides temporary relief for nasal congestion and is routinely used.</p><p>Age, which was thought to be a possible determinant of IET efficacy, did not influence treatment effect. We used a cut-off point of 2 mo to allow stratifying randomization according to previous recommendations that set the age limit for severe bronchiolitis between 6 and 8 wk. Indeed, although such a dichotomization achieved some loss of information, the effectiveness of chest physiotherapy could have been decreased in the youngest owing to their highest risk of severe disease. Airway size increases with age, and we thought that it would be difficult to increase the clearance of bronchial secretions from very small airways by physiotherapy. The lack of documented specific mechanisms of pulmonary change after IET makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions concerning the age-related efficacy of physiotherapy.</p><p>Post hoc analyses showed no significant quantitative interaction between IET &#x0002b; AC effect on the main endpoint and personal atopy or history of atopy in first-degree relatives, the type of virus, or the presence of baseline hypoxemia. Although exploratory, our findings for infants without personal atopy or history of atopy in first-degree relatives and for those without hypoxemia were close to statistical significance as shown by the CIs around estimate of effect for these subgroups (respectively [0.99&#x02013;1.58] and [0.96&#x02013;1.56]) and deserve further investigations.</p><p>Infants included in the present study represent a spectrum of bronchiolitis phenotype including infants prone or not prone to experience repeated wheezing episodes. Reynolds et al. <xref rid="pmed.1000345-Reynolds1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> suggested that there might be two different groups of patients: those with obstructive disease resulting entirely from infection, thickening of the bronchiolar walls, and intrabronchial secretions, and those with a predisposition to asthma, who develop obstruction because of both inflammation and bronchospasm. It is still currently impossible to determine which of the infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis will subsequently develop asthma, even though family history of atopy and atopic dermatitis in the infant have been shown to be predictive of asthma <xref rid="pmed.1000345-CastroRodriguez1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. It is possible that future studies will lead to recommendations for bronchiolitis treatment according to the phenotype of the infant, rather than merely being based on current disease diagnosis alone <xref rid="pmed.1000345-Frey1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Our study was not designed to address this issue and atopic status was not found to influence the effect of IET &#x0002b; AC.</p><p>The physiopathology of bronchiolitis remains unclear, but the need for oxygen supplementation is considered as a marker of considerable ventilation heterogeneity, due to a large number of units with poor ventilation (obstructed) and good perfusion or overdistension and poor perfusion. In the absence of segmental or lobar lung atelectasia, ventilation heterogeneity is a peripheral phenomenon unlikely to be affected by physiotherapy. Infants requiring oxygen supplementation may not benefit at all from physiotherapy, but the benefits of physiotherapy for nonhypoxemic infants did not reach significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-1000345-g003">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-1000345-t005">Table 5</xref>). Studying a mixture of patients may provide unclear or misleading results. This perspective raises questions about limiting studies to homogeneous populations, making it impossible to extrapolate the results obtained to patients with a different clinical status. The heterogeneity in concerned patient populations may contribute to the difficulty of definitively evaluating physiotherapy in clinical trials and in making clear recommendations on its benefit in practice.</p><p>The &#x0201c;interphysiotherapist&#x0201d; variability is an important issue in our study. Despite having taken great care in optimizing the training, some variability in the way compression was applied may remain and is difficult to evaluate. We deliberately chose to have more than one physiotherapist by center to mimic as closely as possible real-life conditions, and to be able to extrapolate our results, should they have been positive. The problem of practitioner variability for complex interventions is common in nonpharmacological trials. We standardized the cessation of the intervention on the same auscultation-efficacy criteria in order to reduce interphysiotherapist variability.</p><p>In summary, this large, randomized, controlled, outcomes assessor-blind and parent-blind trial of three daily chest physiotherapy sessions with the IET technique in infants hospitalized for a first episode of bronchiolitis provided no evidence that this treatment shortened time to recovery. Our results did not support the recommendation that chest physiotherapy be routinely performed in hospitalized infants with acute bronchiolitis. Our conclusions in infants with severe bronchiolitis cannot necessarily be extrapolated to infants with mild or moderate bronchiolitis. Further studies would be required to assess chest physiotherapy in outpatients and for infants without history of atopy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1000345.s001"><label>Alternative Language Text S1</label><caption><p>French translation of the article by VG.</p><p>(0.34 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1000345.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1000345.s002"><label>Text S1</label><caption><p>Trial protocol.</p><p>(0.30 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1000345.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1000345.s003"><label>Text S2</label><caption><p>CONSORT checklist.</p><p>(0.11 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1000345.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank our Independent Safety Monitoring Board, namely, P.
