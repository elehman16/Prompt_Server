HCV is classified into six different genotypes (G1&#x02013;6), each with a distinct geographic variation and responsiveness to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] hepatitis C virus genotype 4 (HCV G4) makes up 20% of HCV infections worldwide, but in general is relatively uncommon in the US and Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, there is an increase in HCV G4 in certain parts of Europe, probably driven by immigration from Africa and the Middle-East, where HCV G4 is the most common genotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Telaprevir is a protease inhibitor approved for the treatment of treatment-na&#x000ef;ve and treatment-experienced G1 HCV-infected adult patients with compensated liver disease in the US and Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In telaprevir phase 3 trials, sustained virologic response (SVR) rates were significantly higher with a regimen of 12&#x000a0;weeks of telaprevir in combination with either 24 or 48&#x000a0;weeks of pegylated interferon/ribavirin (Peg-IFN/RBV) than with 48&#x000a0;weeks of Peg-IFN/RBV alone, both in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve and treatment-experienced G1 HCV-infected patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. During treatment with direct-acting antivirals (DAA) such as telaprevir, there is the potential for selection of preexisting viral variants with decreased susceptibility to DAAs with a similar mechanism of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In HCV G1 patients a consistent, subtype-dependent resistance profile was observed in patients who did not achieve an SVR with telaprevir-based treatment, with emergence of resistant variants at NS3 amino acid positions V36, T54, R155, and A156 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Limited <italic>in vitro</italic> data suggests that telaprevir has activity against HCV G4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. HCV G4 is highly heterogeneous with up to 18 subtypes identified so far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This large variation in subtype can affect disease pathology and also increase the potential for resistance to treatment, making HCV G4 potentially difficult to treat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The current standard treatment for HCV G4 infection is 48&#x000a0;weeks of Peg-IFN/RBV, with variable results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Overall SVR rates have reportedly been higher for patients with HCV G4a compared to HCV G4b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Patients with HCV G4 who do not achieve an SVR with Peg-IFN/RBV currently lack other treatment options.</p><p>Study C210 was a Phase IIa trial designed to examine the activity of telaprevir on HCV early viral kinetics in patients with G4 HCV infection.

In this study, the <italic>in vivo</italic> intrinsic activity of telaprevir monotherapy against HCV G4 was modest; HCV RNA levels decreased slowly between baseline and Day 15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Larger, more rapid declines were reported for patients who received telaprevir plus Peg-IFN/RBV, suggesting synergy between telaprevir and Peg-IFN/RBV against HCV G4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

For virology analyses, samples were also tested for subtype with a more accurate HCV genotyping method based on sequencing of a 329-bp region within NS5B, followed by semi-automatic blast-based alignment to reference sequences.

However, Patient 1 had an emerging V170A/V substitution at the time of vBT (Day 15). An increase in telaprevir FC was noted with the biochemical assay but not the replicon assay (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>a).</p><p>A number of other amino acid changes from baseline were identified in patients who experienced vBT in the T or TPR group, including: V18I/V, T63I/T, I64I/M, A95A/T/V and P129A (G4a). These mutations were not consistently seen across patients and no statistical analyses were performed due to the low number of HCV G4 comparator sequences available from non-exposed samples in public or in-house databases.</p><p>For the single patient with HCV G4h in the T arm who relapsed after standard therapy, sequence analysis was not available at the time of relapse. However, sequence analysis of the follow-up Week 24 sample did not identify known resistant variants.</p><p>Along with Patients 3 and 5 in the T arm who had vBT, emergence of a T54A/T mutation was also detected at Day 15 in a patient in the T treatment group. This patient did not have vBT but the mutation was associated with an 2-fold increase in telaprevir FC compared to baseline using a replicon-based phenotypic assay. One other patient in the TPR group also reported a T54A/T mutation although this was not associated with vBT or any change in telaprevir FC. Both these patients achieved SVR.</p><p>Paired phenotype data at baseline and time of vBT/end of telaprevir treatment were available for eight patients in the study. Of these, 3/4 patients with an emerging T54A/T mutation had a 2- to 4-fold increase in telaprevir FC compared with baseline according to the replicon-based phenotypic assay.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we report the virologic characterization of variants emerging in the Phase IIa C210 study, the first clinical trial investigating telaprevir in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve, chronically-infected HCV G4 patients. Telaprevir combined with Peg-IFN/RBV had greater antiviral activity against HCV G4 than telaprevir monotherapy or Peg-IFN/RBV alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Telaprevir monotherapy had limited antiviral activity over 15&#x000a0;days; HCV RNA levels decreased only slightly and five of eight patients had vBT (no patients in the TPR group had vBT during this time). The remaining three patients treated with telaprevir monotherapy had detectable HCV RNA at Day 15.</p><p>As mentioned above, all vBTs in the investigational, telaprevir treatment phase occurred in the T group. HCV RNA levels only decreased slowly with telaprevir monotherapy compared with combination therapy. These findings are in line with the results of other studies investigating telaprevir monotherapy versus telaprevir plus Peg-IFN/RBV in HCV G1, G2, and G3 patients, and show better results with combination therapy compared to telaprevir monotherapy to control the emergence of resistant variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In this regard, 4/5 patients with vBT after 2&#x000a0;weeks of telaprevir monotherapy in our study achieved undetectable HCV RNA with subsequent Peg-IFN/RBV treatment and three achieved SVR (one patient had missing follow-up Week 24 data but had undetectable HCV RNA at follow-up week 12).</p><p>Analysis in this study focused on detecting previously reported HCV G1 amino acid mutations in the NS3&#x02022;4A region; including single change V36A/M, T54A, R155I/K/M/T, and A156S which have been associated with lower level in vitro resistance to telaprevir (3- to 25-fold increase in replicon 50% IC<sub>50</sub>), and single change A156T/V and double change at positions V36M&#x02009;+&#x02009;R155K which have been associated with higher level <italic>in vitro</italic> telaprevir resistance (&#x0003e;25-fold increase in replicon IC<sub>50</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. None of the 23 patients with sequences obtained by population sequencing in this study had mutations associated with decreased telaprevir susceptibility at baseline, although a leucine (L) substitution in HCV G4 patients was detected in place of a V present in HCV G1 patients at position 36. The functional ramifications of this substitution are as yet unknown, though the V36L substitution in HCV G1 has been shown to exhibit a 2-fold change in telaprevir susceptibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Sequences were available for four of the five patients who had vBT during the investigational phase of the study (baseline to Day 15). In two of these patients, T54A/T emerged, which is a mutation known to moderately (FC ~6) increase telaprevir resistance in patients with G1 HCV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Two other T54A/T mutations were also detected, one in a patient in the T group who did not have vBT but who had detectable levels of HCV RNA at the end of telaprevir treatment, and one in a patient in the TPR group who also had detectable levels of HCV RNA at the end of telaprevir treatment. Overall, paired phenotype data at baseline and time of vBT or end of telaprevir treatment indicated that the emergence of the T54A/T mutation in this study population was associated with a 2- to 4-fold increase in telaprevir FC compared with baseline. Importantly, this mutation was not associated with failure of subsequent Peg-IFN/RBV treatment and all patients with a T54A/T mutation subsequently achieved SVR.</p><p>Taken together, these findings suggest that vBT and the emergence of resistant variants following telaprevir monotherapy had little or no impact on the efficacy of subsequent treatment with Peg-IFN/RBV. However, additional data on the clinical relevance of resistance with DAAs are required. In this regard, interim results from EXTEND, a multinational, 3-year follow-up study of patients treated with telaprevir-based regimens in Phase II and Phase III clinical trials, showed that, after ceasing telaprevir treatment, levels of resistant variants can rapidly decline as they are outcompeted by other, potentially more fit wild-type variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Additional research is needed to ascertain whether these patients can be successfully retreated with the same DAA class. Nevertheless, the presence of some mutations can still be detected years later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and it is therefore important to limit potential for resistant variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The rationale for combination therapy is due to the non-competing mechanisms of actions of the different agents used, which means that viruses associated with resistance to one class of agent are often susceptible to another class [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This is supported by data in this study, as no variants known to be associated with resistance to telaprevir were detected in patients treated with TPR therapy.</p><p>Several other mutations were also detected in HCV G4 infected patients in this study. The variant V170A (HCV G4a) was observed in one patient at the same time as vBT in the T arm. This mutation has been previously observed in the HCV G1 population, although not at high frequency. It has also been linked with low-to-moderate levels of resistance to boceprevir [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Another patient (HCV G4c) had three mutations detected at the time of vBT (including I170I/M and T54A/T). However, the importance of the combination of these mutations is not well defined and needs to be investigated further. Other mutations identified as emerging from baseline in patients with vBT were: V18I, T63I, I64M, A95T/V, P129A, and L135F. Due to the limited sample size, the lack of consistency of the mutations across patients and the scarcity of HCV G4 comparator sequences, the relevance of these mutations is currently not understood. Consequently, on the basis of this study, new HCV G4-specific mutations could not be identified.</p><p>Although few mutations known to be associated with reduced susceptibility to telaprevir in HCV G1 were observed in this study, this may be due to sample size limitations. Other viral mutations that affect DAA activity in HCV G1 may also be relevant for patients with HCV G4, since active site residues in HCV G1 and HCV G4 in NS3 protease domains are similar. Genotypic polymorphisms in the HCV NS3&#x02022;4A proteases inter- and intra-genotypes are in general located on the protease surface, far from the telaprevir binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Telaprevir FC at baseline ranged from 2.5 to 8.9 using the replicon-based assay and from 1.7 to 11.9 using the biochemical phenotypic assay. A correlation was observed between the telaprevir FC at baseline and change in HCV RNA from baseline to Day 3. However, as mentioned below, this finding needs to be interpreted with caution.</p><p>Conclusions inferred from the result of this study are limited due to small sample size and insufficient power to perform appropriate statistical analysis. The small population of this study also means that discrepancies in baseline data (i.e., gender and race) may exert an effect on study results, along with baseline differences in HCV G4 subtype between treatment groups. Unfortunately, sequencing and virologic response data could not be obtained for some patients in this study, further compounding the issue of small sample size. Despite these limitations, it should be noted that the size of this study is not unusual for an exploratory, proof-of-principle study investigating molecular consequences of antiviral activity.</p><p>In summary, the results of this study indicates that the <italic>in vivo</italic> intrinsic activity of telaprevir monotherapy against genotype 4 HCV is modest after 2&#x000a0;weeks of treatment, and suggests synergy between telaprevir and Peg-IFN/RBV against genotype 4 HCV compared with Peg-IFN/RBV alone. Whether the synergy between telaprevir and Peg-IFN/RBV translates in higher SVR rates than Peg-IFN/RBV alone or not, needs to be further investigated. During the telaprevir/placebo treatment phase of this study, all cases of vBT occurred with telaprevir monotherapy, highlighting the importance of combination TPR therapy. Despite this, most patients who experienced vBT with telaprevir monotherapy achieved SVR, indicating that vBT and the emergence of resistant variants do not preclude successful Peg-IFN/RBV treatment. The most common mutation selected in G4 patients during telaprevir therapy was T54A, a mutation previously described for telaprevir in the context of G1 infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The methodology for the C210 exploratory study, including full exclusion and inclusion criteria, have been described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This study was a Phase IIa, partially blinded, randomized, multiple-dose trial conducted from January 2008 until January 2010 at a single French center in male or female, treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients, aged 18&#x02013;65 years, who were chronically infected with HCV G4. The study was approved by the center&#x02019;s institutional review board and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines (CPP Ile De France VI, 10 Pavillon Jacquart, 47 Boulevard de l&#x02019;hopital, 75013 Paris, France).

Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three treatment arms: during the investigational phase, patients received telaprevir 750&#x000a0;mg every 8&#x000a0;hours (q8h) alone (T arm), telaprevir plus Peg-IFN alfa-2a (180&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g once weekly) and weight-based RBV 1,000&#x02013;1,200&#x000a0;mg/day (TPR arm), or placebo q8h plus Peg-IFN/RBV (PR arm). During the standard treatment phase, all patients received Peg-IFN/RBV for 48&#x000a0;weeks (T arm) or 46&#x000a0;weeks (TPR and PR arms). The present analysis focused on the T and TPR arms since the primary goal was to characterize HCV variants detected in telaprevir-treated patients infected with G4 HCV.</p><p>Primary and secondary endpoints of this study have been reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

Patients were considered to have had a relapse when they had confirmed detectable HCV RNA during the follow-up period, despite having undetectable HCV RNA at EOT. vBT and relapse were considered confirmed when respective criteria were fulfilled at two or more consecutive time points or at the last observed time point in case of trial termination. For patients in the T arm, no confirmation of vBT was needed during the investigational treatment phase.
