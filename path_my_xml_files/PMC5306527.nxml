<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> There is wide variation in reported rates of perineal trauma wound infections. Some reports provide rates of 0.3&#x02013;10% in perineal trauma wounds in general,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;6</xref> while others quote infection rates in association with perineal wound dehiscence, as high as 39&#x02013;79%.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9</xref> Moreover, identifying the actual prevalence of perineal wound dehiscence has been equally challenging with reported rates ranging from 0.4%<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> to 13.5%<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> being published.</p><p>Perineal wound dehiscence is a cause of major physical, psychological and social problems. An infected perineal wound is a potential route for systemic infection whereby sepsis and septic shock may ensue.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In England and Wales, between 2006 and 2008, sepsis was identified as the leading cause of maternal mortality.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> During this triennium, one of the seven women who died from sepsis after a vaginal delivery had an infected perineum following with a second-degree tear. While subsequent confidential enquiries have demonstrated a reduction in the rates of deaths from sepsis, it remains one of the leading direct causes of mortality in women following vaginal delivery.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Morbidity associated with perineal wound dehiscence poses a serious threat to the woman's general well-being and quality of life due to persistent pain and discomfort at the perineal wound site, urinary retention, defaecation problems, dyspareunia, psychological and psychosexual issues from embarrassment and altered body image.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>

<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> have suggested that secondary perineal repair is a possible alternative management option even in the presence of infection. However, methodological inadequacies of the two studies included in a recent Cochrane review led the authors to conclude that there was an urgent need for a comprehensive clinical trial to identify the best management strategy for dehisced perineal wounds following primary repair of the initial trauma.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>The overall aims of this study from the outset were to assess the feasibility of conducting a definitive RCT comparing the effectiveness of resuturing versus expectant management for dehisced perineal wounds and pilot the processes of such a trial.

<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In addition, a bespoke operating record data collection sheet was developed to enable the assessment of compliance with protocol recommendations. For the primary outcome of wound healing, participants had an assessment of their perineal wound at 2&#x02005;weeks and 6&#x02013;8&#x02005;weeks following randomisation. While for the secondary outcomes, participants were asked to complete a postal questionnaire at 6&#x02005;weeks, 3&#x02005;months and 6&#x02005;months following trial entry. Perineal pain was also assessed by the participants at 2&#x02005;weeks.</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Sample size</title><p>At the initial stage of designing this pilot feasibility trial, sample size considerations were based on precision of estimates of recruitment rate, attrition rate, proportion with healed wound (primary outcome) and preliminary estimate of effect size. A full discussion of sample size considerations for the PREVIEW study was previously published.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> However, we unexpectedly encountered strong patients' and clinicians' preferences for the type of management. As a consequence, the actual numbers recruited fell considerably below the initial anticipated sample size of 144 women, despite a formal extension of recruitment period and increasing the number of recruiting centres. Therefore, following discussions with the trial data monitoring committee, results from a reduced sample size of 40 women were deemed adequate to address the main aims of this feasibility study. Rather than the 80% recruitment rate originally assumed, experience in the first part of the trial suggested the true figure was likely to be nearer 25%, which with 40 recruited women would be estimated with a precision (defined as twice the SE) of &#x000b1;7%. An attrition rate of 20% (producing outcome data on 32 women) would be estimated with a precision of &#x000b1;12%, healing at 6&#x02013;8&#x02005;weeks (assumed to be around 50%) measured on 16 women with outcome data in each arm of the study would be estimated with a precision of around &#x000b1;25% (&#x000b1;17% for both arms combined).</p></sec><sec id="s3h"><title>Consent and randomisation</title><p>All study participants provided valid written informed consent. Women who did not wish to participate in the study were managed in accordance with their local hospital practice. Web-based/telephone-based randomisation was used to allocate study participants. The randomisation schedule was developed by Bristol Randomised Trials Collaboration. The allocation ratio was 1:1 and randomisation was in blocks, stratified by centre.</p></sec><sec id="s3i"><title>Blinding</title><p>Owing to the nature of the interventions, it was not feasible to blind outcome assessors, care providers or participants themselves. However, the follow-up perineal wound assessments were undertaken by independent practitioners whenever possible.</p></sec><sec id="s3j"><title>Statistical methods of analysis</title><p>Recruitment rate, attrition rate and proportion of women with healed perineal wounds at different time points were estimated (with 95% CIs). Analysis of effect size was undertaken on an intention-to-treat basis, to limit the possibility of bias associated with women not receiving the allocated intervention. Reminder letters and phone calls were used to ensure data on the outcome measures were as complete as possible. No imputation methods were used in the case of missing data.</p><p>Statistical analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS 2012 software, V.21, except where otherwise indicated. Baseline characteristics of the comparative groups were summarised using standard descriptive statistics only. Owing to the much smaller than anticipated sample size, spread across a larger number of sites, a simplified version of the analysis described in the published protocol was conducted. For dichotomous data, such as the primary outcome of healed wound at 6&#x02013;8&#x02005;weeks, effect size was estimated using ORs (95% CI) calculated using RevMan 5.2 (Review Manager (RevMan) (Computer program). Version 5.2. Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, <italic>The Cochrane Collaboration</italic>, 2012.) and statistical significance tested using Fisher's exact test.

Sixteen women were randomised to expectant management and all participants received their allocated intervention. All participants were included in the statistical data analysis unless they were lost to follow-up (n=5).

However, it is important to emphasise that the main aim of this study from the outset was to assess the feasibility of conducting a full-scale definitive RCT and to pilot the study procedures. We acknowledge that any effect size estimate derived from this study must be interpreted cautiously, and may be imprecise because of the small sample size. Nevertheless, the study provided the most robust clinical evidence to date that should inform any future definitive trials addressing a similar research question with regards to the following issues.</p><sec id="s5a"><title>Feasibility issues for any future trial</title><p>Prior to starting the study, we expected some health service delivery issues in relation to resuturing. These included: location for secondary resuturing (delivery suite or gynaecology theatres), categorisation of the procedure (emergency or elective), engagement with the anaesthetic team and arrangements for baby care while women were in the hospital for the procedure. We also aimed to include units with dedicated perineal clinics to facilitate recruitment. However, following active recruitment, the study still faced several organisational barriers including wide variations in referral pathway to their perineal care service, frequency of clinics and service provision outside normal clinic hours. It is for the above reasons that we strongly recommended involving local hospital managers, clinical leads and anaesthetists prior to trial set up and ensure the availability of clear integrated referral pathways between primary and secondary care with regards to postnatal perineal wound problems.</p><p>We were only able to recruit 26% of the potentially eligible women despite adopting numerous multifaceted strategies in line with other studies.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27&#x02013;30</xref> The main reasons for non-randomisation were secondary to patients' and clinicians' preferences. Our Cochrane review<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> on the management of dehisced perineal wounds demonstrated the degree of uncertainty with regards to treatment options for dehisced perineal wounds. This confirms that currently, the management of this complication is very much based on custom and tradition rather than evidence. It is plausible that long-standing traditions and previous experience may have resulted in a loss of this uncertainty among some clinicians and hence the equipoise which drives recruitment into clinical trials. Although only speculative, it is possible that this was a potential barrier to clinicians' engagement and subsequent failure to recruit eligible women. Indeed, this has been acknowledged by Preston <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> who suggest that healthcare professionals can intentionally or unintentionally act as &#x02018;gatekeepers&#x02019;, the consequences of which may potentially introduce bias to patient selection, or affect the rate of patient identification and therefore recruitment. It is important to consider this issue in any future trial to ensure that the cohort of multiprofessional clinicians involved in delivering care for women with such complications are in actual equipoise.</p><p>We made concerted efforts, at each participating centre, to ensure the availability of a member of the PREVIEW trial team to randomise participants at the point of review of their dehisced wound. Reducing the time a woman spent at the hospital and avoiding a significant increase in workload for staff were crucial towards enhancing recruitment opportunities. However, at times this proved to be challenging. Many National Health Service (NHS) organisations have been undergoing a management of change over recent years and clinicians and researchers in post during study set up and site initiation visits in some sites were moved to other areas or left to take up alternative positions of responsibilities. In addition, as women sometimes presented for review out of normal working hours, there were, potentially, missed recruitment opportunities if a researcher or clinician, who had completed his/her good clinical practice (GCP) training, was not available to consent the woman. This is a particular issue in obstetrics and acute care environments such as accident and emergency and was the focus of a paper by Kenyon <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> leading to the development of a standardised tool kit for training clinic staff in GCP activities. In relation to the PREVIEW RCT, it is unrealistic and, indeed, was not favoured by the trial team to expect women at such an early postnatal period to return to the hospital just for the purpose of recruitment into the study.</p><p>It is not unexpected that studies, such as PREVIEW, with quite distinct treatment options may face additional challenges with recruitment.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33&#x02013;36</xref> Women and clinicians in PREVIEW expressed strong preferences for either resuturing or expectancy of the dehisced perineal wound and one solution towards addressing women's preferences would be to include a patient preference trial alongside the traditional RCT conducted when women are in equipoise, thus resulting in a &#x02018;four-armed&#x02019; trial as suggested by some authors.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Nevertheless, critics of this approach have argued that comparing non-randomised groups is unreliable particularly if confounding variables are not controlled for and that preferences may change during the trial period.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38&#x02013;40</xref> Moreover, there is the potential for unbalanced arms of the trial, as Tincello and associates experienced in their study,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> and this would need to be factored into any discussions and sample size calculations. It has also been suggested in some surgical trials that if there is lack of equipoise, where clinicians have preference for particular management techniques, alternative methods of randomisation could be considered where women would be randomised to a treating clinician.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Indeed, the above alternative or additional methods of recruitment should be carefully considered when designing a future definitive trial to mitigate the risk of failure to recruitment. Nevertheless, it is also possible that following the dissemination of information of this study and the potential benefit of resuturing compared with expectant management for dehisced perineal wounds that more stakeholders would, at least, be in equipoise to evaluate either treatment intervention.</p><p>PREVIEW had prespecified outcome variables and a control group, although not essential requirements in a pilot study. We acknowledge the on-going debate surrounding hypothesis testing and prespecified outcome variables for pilot and feasibility research. However, a review of pilot and feasibility studies reported that the majority of studies included control groups and conducted and reported hypothesis testing for one or more of the outcome variables.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> In PREVIEW, we opted to present preliminary estimates of effect size that will help to inform the design of the future trial.</p><p>In general, PREVIEW revealed that the prespecified primary outcome measured was feasible to collect. However, we recommend that for a full-scale study careful consideration should be given to revising the timings of assessing this outcome because 6&#x02013;8&#x02005;weeks is probably a long duration for women to wait for a wound to heal and the majority of wounds would have healed by that time. Indeed, other studies that have reported on wound healing following secondary resuturing have evaluated this outcome at 2&#x02013;3&#x02005;weeks.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Similarly, a small RCT of infected episiotomies evaluated wound healing at &#x0003c;4&#x02005;weeks and found that women who were not resutured experienced longer healing times (&#x0003e;4&#x02005;weeks) n=4 out of 9 (44%) than women who were resutured 6 out of 8 (75%).<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> To facilitate a sample size calculation for a full-scale trial, we have pooled our results with those of Christensen<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016012766F3">figure 3</xref>).</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2016012766F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Meta-analysis of two studies for wound healing.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2016012766f03"/></fig></sec><sec id="s5b"><title>Piloting trial processes</title><p>The study protocol provided a standardised operating procedure for wound resuturing. While the authors acknowledge that this could be considered a potential disincentive towards clinicians' recruitment, the trial team felt it was important to standardise the management across participating centres. The recommended protocol was adhered to in most of the cases with minor exceptions. We recommend that additional time is dedicated to the provision of resuturing training in any future definitive trial to ensure standardisation of the intervention. The use of antibiotics in PREVIEW was left to the clinician's discretion. Over half of the women who were allocated resuturing also received an additional stat dose of intravenous antibiotics. This &#x02018;cointervention&#x02019; could be viewed as a possible source of performance bias. Nevertheless, this was designed as a pragmatic study and the variation in antibiotics use is a true reflection of what actually happens in clinical practice. Collaborative discussions with obstetricians, microbiologists and tissue viability teams need to consider how to avoid or limit this, potential, threat to internal validity in any future study.</p><p>The PREVIEW protocol recommended that perineal wound assessments at all-time points were conducted by a clinician independent from the study with the intention to limit the introduction of detection bias. In reality, this was achieved in less than half of all assessments (44%), suggesting that further consideration needs to be given towards achieving independent assessments when planning for the definitive study. Organisational constraints because of service demands and lack of capacity were the main reasons for not achieving higher compliance rates. It has been suggested that where independent assessment is not achievable, two or more individuals assess the outcomes and resolve any disagreements by consensus.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> In reality, this would need concerted efforts by committed recruiting sites to achieve in practice.</p></sec><sec id="s5c"><title>Strengths and limitations of the study</title><p>There are several strengths to PREVIEW including the design, randomisation strategy and standardised management protocol. All women randomised into the study are accounted for, with overall complete follow-up rates of 30 out of 33 women (91%) for the primary outcome measure. While these follow-up rates are slightly lower than those previously reported in studies investigating secondary perineal repair (94% and 100%, respectively),<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> they are comparable to other obstetric studies which have compared suturing or no suturing for primary perineal repair.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>
<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> It is worth considering incentive strategies<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and exploring the potential to follow-up women at their primary care centre to assess wound healing to minimise attrition rates in a future trial. However, the biggest limitation to PREVIEW was the recruitment rate making estimates of recruitment rate, attrition rate and effect size less precise than intended. Nevertheless, it is important to stress that a fully powered test of clinical effectiveness was not the intention of PREVIEW and our preliminary results will feed into deliberations regarding a plausible effect sizes to inform future sample size calculations.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The PREVIEW pilot and feasibility RCT has produced vital information for the future planning of a robust and successful definitive study. While resuturing was associated with reduced duration to wound healing and improved women's satisfaction with the outcome at 3&#x02005;months, the size and nature of the study preclude from making reliable estimates of effectiveness. A full trial, informed by PREVIEW feasibility findings, is needed to avoid missing the opportunity to prove the effectiveness of a promising intervention to women.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr Roger Beech, Reader in Health Services Research/Director, Keele University Hub, West Midlands NIHR Research Design Service (RDS) and the RDS team for their advice and guidance towards formulating the research questions, the study design, methodology and analytical strategies.
