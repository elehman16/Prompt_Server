The PlAtelet Transfusion in Cerebral Haemorrhage (PATCH) trial aimed to assess the effect of platelet transfusion in patients presenting with ICH while using antiplatelet therapy. The main hypothesis of PATCH was that platelet transfusion would reduce death or dependence by reducing ICH growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>PATCH was a multicentre prospective, randomised, open, blinded endpoint (PROBE) parallel group trial, conducted at 60 hospitals in The Netherlands, Scotland and France. Forty-one sites enrolled 190 patients with spontaneous supratentorial ICH aged &#x02265;18 years, who had used antiplatelet therapy for &#x02265;7 days preceding ICH, if Glasgow Coma Scale was &#x02265;8. Participants were randomised (1:1, with a secure web-based system using permuted blocks, stratified by study centre and type of antiplatelet therapy pre-ICH) to receive either platelet transfusion within 6 hours of symptom onset and 90 minutes of diagnostic brain imaging, or standard care without platelet transfusion. The primary outcome was modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score assessed blind to treatment allocation at 3 months after ICH. Planned secondary outcomes included ICH growth on brain imaging performed approximately 24 hours after randomisation, survival at 3 months, disability at 3 months scored using the Amsterdam Medical Centre linear disability score, heterogeneity of treatment effect on mRS and ICH growth according to presence of the computed tomography angiography spot sign, causes of poor outcome, and cost-effectiveness. Safety outcomes were transfusion reactions, thromboembolic complications, and serious adverse events occurring during hospitalisation. This statistical analysis plan was written without knowledge of the unblinded data.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>The trial was registered with the Netherlands Trial Register on 29 April 2008 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=1303">NTR1303</ext-link>).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Intracerebral haemorrhage</kwd><kwd>Platelet transfusion</kwd><kwd>Haemostatic drugs</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Statistical analysis plan</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001826</institution-id><institution>ZonMw</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>sanquin blood bank</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Le programme hospitalier de recherche clinique</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000369</institution-id><institution>Chest, Heart and Stroke Association Scotland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ref.

Spontaneous (non-traumatic) intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) caused by cerebral small vessel diseases (so-called &#x02018;primary&#x02019; ICH) accounts for two-thirds of haemorrhagic stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. ICH causes &#x0003e;2 million strokes per year, and more than one quarter of patients with incident ICH in high-income countries are already taking antiplatelet drug therapy at the time of ICH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 25 cohort studies, antiplatelet therapy use at the time of ICH was associated with an increase in the risk of death (multivariable adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.27, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.10 to 1.47) in comparison to patients with ICH not taking antithrombotic drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In observational analyses, pre-ICH antiplatelet therapy use and reduced platelet activity have been associated with early ICH volume growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], which is one of the most important determinants of poor outcome after ICH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Consequently, for people taking antiplatelet therapy shortly before ICH, restoration of platelet function may improve haemostasis, reduce ICH growth, and thereby improve outcome. Observational studies have varied in their support for this hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], but randomised controlled trials have not tested the effects of platelet transfusion on clinical outcomes for people with acute ICH associated with the use of antiplatelet therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, we designed the PlAtelet Transfusion in Cerebral Haemorrhage (PATCH) randomised controlled trial to test the hypothesis that for people with acute ICH associated with the use of antiplatelet therapy, platelet transfusion compared to standard care without platelet transfusion reduces death or dependence. One other similar trial is ongoing (NCT00699621). The PATCH trial has been registered (Netherlands Trial Register NTR1303), its protocol has been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and we now describe the final statistical analysis plan, which was written and submitted without knowledge of the outcome data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Primary objective</title><p>The primary aim of the PATCH trial was to investigate whether platelet transfusion reduced poor outcome at 3 months after ICH affecting patients who were using antiplatelet therapy at the time of ICH. The poor outcome of death or dependence was defined in the protocol as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 4 to 6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Secondary objectives</title><p>The secondary aims of the PATCH trial were to investigate whether platelet transfusion: was safe; decreased ICH growth; improved survival at 3 months; reduced poor outcome across the full ordinal scoring range of the mRS at 3 months; reduced poor outcome defined as mRS scores 3 to 6 at 3 months; and reduced disability at 3 months scored using the Amsterdam Medical Centre linear disability score (ALDS). We aimed to perform a sub-study to determine whether the presence of the &#x02018;spot sign&#x02019; on computed tomography angiography (CTA) at baseline modified the effect of platelet transfusion on the primary outcome and ICH growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

The analysis will be based on the intention-to-treat principle. The effect size will be expressed in a relative risk estimates and absolute risk reduction. Additionally the primary outcome will be analysed using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting (if necessary) for clinically relevant baseline imbalances and treatment characteristics. The effect size will be expressed in an adjusted OR. With regard to the range of secondary outcome parameters we will use simple 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 tables, two-group <italic>t</italic> tests, Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> tests, and multivariable linear and logistic regression models, when appropriate.

In all analyses, statistical uncertainty will be quantified with 95 % CIs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Interim analyses and safety reporting</title><p>The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB &#x02013; see Appendix) consisted of three independent trial experts (one statistician, one neurologist, and one expert in vascular medicine) to monitor safety and perform an analysis of unblinded effectiveness data at one time point after inclusion of 100 patients in the trial. At the time of inclusion of the 100<sup>th</sup> patient, SAEs needed to be recorded and reported to the trial coordinating centre, and the DSMB needed to be reconstituted (Appendix), by which time 160 patients had been included in the trial and an interim analysis could be performed on the first 154 patients for whom both outcome and SAE data were available. The DSMB were provided with a report prepared by an independent statistician that included baseline variables [gender, age, antiplatelet therapy, and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score], SAEs, the primary outcome, and a distribution of the mRS in each of the arms of the trial unblinded to the treatment group. The DSMB was instructed in a charter to look at safety (deaths and the number of SAEs in both groups) and efficacy (primary outcome, dichotomised 0&#x02013;3 vs. 4&#x02013;6, using a Haybittle-Peto stopping rule with a <italic>p</italic> value set at 0.001 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]). The DSMB assessed the unblinded data in a closed session, independent of the investigators, in October 2015. The DSMB had not been provided with a pre-specified threshold for futility. Additionally the DSMB was asked to advise the executive committee on possible continuation of the trial beyond its pre-specified sample size if analyses showed a possible signal of efficacy. By the time the DSMB gave its final advice to the executive committee, the trial had just reached its pre-specified sample size of 190 patients. The verdict of the DSMB was that their advice was without consequence for the study and to not include more patients beyond the pre-specified sample size. There was a separate DSMB in France that performed ongoing safety monitoring for patients included in France (see Appendix).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Statistical analysis plan</title><sec id="Sec19"><title>Overall principles</title><p>The data analysis will start after the 3-month follow-up data of the last included patient has been obtained, and after the clinical trial module of the study database has been cleaned and locked.</p><p>The analyses will be done by a co-investigator (MIB) supervised by the principal investigator (YBWEMR) and an independent epidemiologist/statistician of the Amsterdam Medical Centre Clinical Research Unit.

The table will describe the following variables: age, sex, vascular co-morbidities, history of coagulopathy, type of antiplatelet therapy (as used for stratification), use of a statin, Glasgow Coma Scale score, NIHSS score, platelet count, ICH location and volume on baseline imaging, presence/extent of intraventricular blood on baseline imaging, and the ICH score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Protocol deviations and violations</title><p>All substantial protocol violations will be listed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Adherence to allocated treatment</title><p>Adherence will be reported descriptively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Primary outcome</title><p>We have chosen to quantify the effect of platelet transfusion on the primary outcome of the mRS at 3 months with the common OR and 95 % CI from an ordinal logistic regression analysis of the shift of all categories of the mRS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], rather than using the pre-specified fixed dichotomous approach. We have explained our rationale for this below. First a &#x0201c;crude&#x0201d; OR with 95 % CI will be calculated after which multivariable regression analysis will be used to adjust for the following:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>&#x025aa; Type of antiplatelet therapy used (stratification variable: cyclooxygenase inhibitor only vs. ADP receptor inhibitor only vs. cyclooxygenase inhibitor in combination with an adenosine reuptake inhibitor vs. cyclooxygenase inhibitor in combination with ADP receptor inhibitor).</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025aa; ICH severity, quantified by the ICH score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025aa; Any large, chance imbalances at baseline between intervention and control groups in covariates that might have a major influence on the primary outcome.</p></list-item></list></p><p>We will not correct for the number of centres that recruited patients, although this was a stratification variable. This because many centres included only a small number of patients and adjusting for all centres might lead to unreliable estimates of the treatment effect. We will perform a separate sensitivity analysis to evaluate modification of treatment effect by centre, as described below.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>Survival of patients and the proportion of patients with poor outcome according to the different fixed dichotomous analyses of the mRS (score 4&#x02013;6 or 3&#x02013;6), at 3 months will be expressed as proportions for each treatment group and the difference will be tested using the chi-square test and quantified using OR with 95 % CI. ICH volume will be expressed in absolute mL and the difference in this volume (i.e. growth) between imaging at baseline and after 24 hours will be calculated in mL, where a positive figure will represent growth and a negative value will represent shrinkage of ICH. The median difference in ICH growth will be compared between treatment groups using the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. The ordinal distribution of the mRS will be shown for patients that received platelet transfusion within 3 hours and between 3 and 6 hours of symptoms separately.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Safety outcomes</title><p>Safety outcomes will be reported in the intention-to treat and as-treated populations. Proportions will be tested for between-group differences using the chi-square test and expressed in OR with 95 % CI. For all continuous variables either means with standard deviation or medians with interquartile range will be calculated where appropriate and testing for difference will be performed with either the two-group <italic>t</italic> test or Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test where appropriate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Subgroup analyses</title><p>We will test for modification of the effect of platelet transfusion on the primary outcome using ordinal regression analyses for the following subgroups:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>&#x025aa; Pre-ICH antiplatelet therapy used: single vs. dual therapy</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025aa; ICH volume at baseline, trichotomised according to the distribution of ICH volume on the baseline diagnostic scan</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025aa; country of randomisation (The Netherlands vs. Scotland vs. France)</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Sensitivity analyses</title><p>Using ordinal regression we will test for heterogeneity in the effect of platelet transfusion on the primary outcome in the centres that randomised at least five patients (eight in The Netherlands, three in Scotland, and three in France), representing 66 % of all patients included. Inclusion of at least five patients was chosen so that it was likely that there would be at least one outcome in each treatment arm of the trial in each centre.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Differences between the protocol and the statistical analysis plan</title><p>The principal difference from the analysis plan specified in the trial protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] is the analysis of the primary outcome (mRS) using ordinal logistic regression to calculate the common OR (which was originally specified as a secondary analysis), rather than a fixed dichotomous analysis (originally specified as a primary analysis). We have made this decision for several reasons. First, common practice in the analysis of ordinal scales like the mRS as the primary outcome in stroke trials has evolved to use the ordinal logistic regression approach, because it is more statistically efficient/powerful, and treatments for acute stroke (like platelet transfusion) are likely to shift all patients somewhat on a functional outcome scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Second, recent trials have illustrated this point, by demonstrating a small but clinically meaningful effect of thrombolysis after acute ischaemic stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and intensive blood pressure lowering after ICH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] on the mRS by using ordinal logistic regression, but not the fixed dichotomous approach. Third, the PATCH trial is particularly likely to benefit from this approach, as a small trial with a sample size of 190. The power to detect a common OR of 0.43 (as in the original sample size calculation) in a shift analysis of all pairs of mRS categories would increase from 80 % to 91 % with a sample size of 190 patients. For this calculation we assumed that the distribution of the mRS in the control arm would be similar to that in the STICH II trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], which had a similar proportion of patients with poor outcome as assumed in our original sample size calculation.</p><p>Furthermore, there are several differences in the planned secondary outcomes: ICH volume was calculated using an automated planimetric method, rather than the previously described ABC/2 formula. We had intended to perform a larger sub-study of the spot sign on CT angiography, but this was performed infrequently in clinical practice, making this sub-study too small to generate a statistically meaningful analysis of the modification of treatment effect by the spot sign. Similarly, the platelet function sub-study was only performed in a few centres in France, precluding any analyses. Funding was insufficient for the initial planned investigation of causes of poor outcome, the assessment of functional outcome using the Amsterdam Medical Centre linear disability score, and the collection of economic-related data for the purpose of cost-effectiveness analysis. Description of the distribution of the mRS in patients that received platelet transfusion within 3 hours vs. 3 through 6 hours of symptoms was added, instead of a planned subgroup analysis according to timing of treatment. This because timing of treatment was only recorded for those patients that received platelet transfusion precluding a formal subgroup analysis.</p><p>Lastly, the stratification factor &#x0201c;recruiting centre&#x0201d; could not be included as a variable to adjust for in the primary analysis because many centres included a small number of patients, which could lead to unreliable estimates of the treatment effect. To explore the impact of this variable on the primary outcome, we opted to perform a separate sensitivity analysis at a subset of centres recruiting five or more patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Current trial status</title><p>PATCH trial sites recruited from 4 February 2009 in The Netherlands, from 23 May 2011 in Scotland, and from 28 September 2013 in France, and the last patient was randomised on 8 October 2015. The last follow-up was obtained on 6 January. At the time of writing, the trial data have been cleaned and checked for completeness and internal consistency, blinded to treatment allocation.
