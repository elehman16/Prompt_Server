The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and the generalisability of Noxipoint therapy (NT), a novel electrotherapy characterised by site-specific stimulation, intensity-and-submodality-specific settings and a immobilization period, for chronic neck and shoulder pain. Ninety-seven heavily pretreated severe chronic neck/shoulder pain patients were recruited; 34 and 44 patients were randomly allocated to different treatment arms in two patient-and-assessor-blinded, randomised controlled studies. The participants received NT or conventional physical therapy including transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (PT-TENS) for three to six 90-minute sessions. In Study One, NT improved chronic pain (&#x02212;89.6%, Brief Pain Inventory, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001, 95% confidence interval), function (+77.4%, range of motion) and quality of life (+88.1%) at follow-up (from 4 weeks to 5 months), whereas PT-TENS resulted in no significant changes in these parameters. Study Two demonstrated similar advantages of NT over PT-TENS and the generalisability of NT. NT-like treatments in a randomised rat study showed a similar reduction in chronic hypersensitivity (&#x02212;81%, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) compared with sham treatments. NT substantially reduces chronic neck and shoulder pain, restores function, and improves quality of life in a sustained manner.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Chronic pain affects 115 million people and costs $600 billion annually in the United States alone, yet effective treatments are lacking<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Standard noninvasive treatments include physical therapy (PT) and analgesics. The prescription of analgesics such as opioids, which provide temporary relief from chronic pain, has increased rapidly in the past two decades, along with proportional increases in analgesic abuse and addiction. Effective noninvasive nonpharmacological remedies are highly desirable, as healthcare costs and drug abuse are mounting<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.</p><p>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a commonly used PT treatment modality for pain. Despite the long history of the use of TENS for the treatment of chronic pain conditions, its effectiveness has been inconclusive based on prior randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Multiple studies showed the benefits of TENS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, whereas others showed no significant effects of TENS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. The prevailing conclusion regarding the pain-reducing effect of TENS is that it is not medically significant (pain reduction of less than 2 on a 10-point scale), although it has been statistically significant (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) in some trials<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, particularly in the short term<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Additionally, the lack of appropriate standard guidelines for TENS may have led to variability in clinical outcomes of TENS.</p><p>Noxipoint&#x02122; therapy (NT), a novel therapy utilising electrical stimulation characterised by precise electrode placement (on &#x0201c;Noxipoints&#x0201d;), intensity- and submodality-specific settings (eliciting soreness/dull pain but not sharp pain) and brief stimulation, was preliminarily found to substantially and persistently restore function and relieve chronic pain in a large cohort of chronic pain patients over the past decade. Two independent RCT studies were conducted. The primary objective of Study One (in the U.S.) was to evaluate the efficacy of NT compared to conventional PT including TENS (PT-TENS, which included exercise, manual and heat therapies and TENS) for the treatment of chronic neck and shoulder pain based on relative changes in a patient-reported pain scale, functional impairment, and quality of life (QOL) indices from baseline (pre-treatment assessment) to follow-up (from 4 weeks after the last treatment session, or approximately 8 weeks after the baseline assessment). The secondary objective was to evaluate the incremental changes in the above outcomes during treatment. The primary objectives of Study Two (in Taiwan) were to verify the findings of Study One using similar outcome measures of chronic neck pain in a geographically different population and to evaluate the generalisability of NT performed by newly trained therapists.</p><p>In addition, a randomised study in rats was conducted to establish the translational basis for future research on the physiological mechanism of NT. This study examined the effect of NT-like treatment for induced chronic hyperalgesia via intramuscular acid injection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, a commonly used animal model of inflammatory pain that likely mimics the conditions of tissue injury such as sprains and myositis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><p>Thirty-four patients were randomly allocated to different treatment arms in Study One (24 in the NT arm and 10 in the PT-TENS arm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). The patients in the two arms exhibited similar baseline characteristics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>), and all were heavily pretreated (average pain history of 6.7 years in both arms; 2.6 and 3.0 distinct treatment classes in the NT and the PT-TENS arms, respectively). The Neck/shoulder-pain patients were distributed comparably between the NT (75%/25%) and PT-TENS arms (80%/20%). In the first stage of Study One, 30 patients receiving at least one post-baseline assessment were included in the analysis. Additionally, 44 neck-pain patients who provided written consent were randomly allocated to different treatment arms in Study Two (23 in the NT arm and 21 in the PT-TENS arm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>), and 38 patients receiving at least one post-baseline assessment were included in the analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Nearly all patients in both arms completed the assigned treatment.</p><p>None of the patients in Study One received off-protocol treatments. In Study Two, 3 of the 20 NT patients received off-protocol treatments and 13 of the18 PT-TENS patients received off-protocol treatments after the first follow-up due to on-going pain, introducing bias toward the conservative treatment in this superiority trial (see details in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Text 1</xref>).</p><p>Chronic pain, especially that of the heavily pretreated patients in Study One, was predominantly idiopathic at baseline. Based on the patient histories, seven of the 30 analysed patients in Study One reported past muscle-impairing events (e.g., car accident, sports injury, or work-related injury). Although most patients had no clear diagnosis or existing radiological evidence of injury at the beginning of this study, many patients recalled strained muscles, whiplash, pain, etc. associated with these events. Other patients reported gradual degeneration (e.g., due to bad posture at work) or a diagnosis of osteoarthritis or could not recall any specific cause of their pain. Study Two focused on chronic neck pain, excluding spondylosis with specific evidence of nerve root compression, implicating muscle or soft tissue impairment.</p><sec disp-level="2"><title>Primary analysis</title><p>The primary analysis compared the outcomes between baseline and follow-up, and the results demonstrated statistically significant (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) and clinically substantial benefits (net pain reduction on a numeric rating scale of &#x0003e;&#x02212;2.5 or a final raw score of &#x0003c;3.5 for chronic pain, as defined in<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>) of NT/crossover-to-NT (XO) compared to PT-TENS with respect to pain, function, and quality of life in both studies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">3</xref>).</p><p>The normality test in Study One (quantile-quantile plot) indicated that the data were marginally normal due to the relatively small sample size in the PT-TENS arm. Most variables associated with the determination of the changes from pre- to post-treatment in the NT group and the differences between the NT vs. PT-TENS arms passed the Shapiro-Wilk normality test (18 of the 20 variables) in Study Two; therefore, a paired t test was appropriate. Nevertheless, Wilcoxon&#x02019;s tests, nonparametric methods that make no assumptions regarding the distribution of the variables, were conducted in addition to t tests to ensure the robustness of the analysis. All p-values from the Wilcoxon&#x02019;s tests were in the same range as those from the t tests (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">3</xref>).</p><p>In the first stage of Study One (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3A</xref>), NT reduced the Brief Pain Index (BPI) &#x0201c;at its worst&#x0201d; score by 89.6% (95% confidence interval (CI), from 7.7 at baseline to 0.8 at follow-up post-NT, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001), whereas patients in PT-TENS reported no significant change (95% CI, from 8.1 to 8.2, P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.84). The between-arm comparison of BPI &#x0201c;at its worst&#x0201d; revealed a significant and substantial difference (&#x00394;&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;7.0, 95% CI, &#x02212;8.5 to &#x02212;5.6, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3A</xref>). The BPI measures of &#x0201c;average&#x0201d; (&#x00394;&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;5.3, 95% CI, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001,), &#x0201c;right now&#x0201d; (&#x00394;&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;6.0, 95% CI, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001), and &#x0201c;interference with functions&#x0201d; (&#x00394;=&#x02009;&#x02212;23.4, 95% CI, P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0021,), as well as functional impairment (&#x00394;=&#x02009;&#x02212;9.2, P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002, 95% CI), were substantially and significantly different between the treatment arms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2A</xref>). Regardless of the aetiology or history, NT substantially reduced or eliminated pain and restored function, and its benefits persisted to follow-up.</p><p>In the second stage, the average BPI &#x0201c;at its worst&#x0201d; in the crossover-to-NT patients was reduced by 84%, from 8.1 at the start of crossover to 1.3 (95% CI, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) at follow-up (an average of 5 weeks after the final treatment session). The patients who received PT-TENS maintained pain levels similar to those observed in Stage 1 after follow-up; thus, 7 of the 8 PT-TENS patients crossed over to NT. Alternatively, no patients receiving NT crossed over to PT-TENS because all NT patients reported being pain-free (74%, 14 patients, BPI&#x02009;=&#x02009;0) or nearly pain-free (26%, 5 patients, mean BPI&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.3 and all BPIs &#x02264;2) at follow-up (see additional details in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>) and thus had no motivation to cross over. Note that the patients remained blinded to their treatment throughout the study.</p><p>The patients receiving NT exhibited reductions in the &#x0201c;average&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;right now&#x0201d; BPI scores by 88% and 90% (4.6- and 4.7-point reductions), respectively, and improvements in the functional impairment score by 77.4% and in QOL by 87%. All differences were highly significant (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001, 95% CI). In contrast, PT-TENS patients showed no significant changes in all measures, except a 1.2-point reduction in BPI &#x0201c;right now&#x0201d;. After the PT-TENS patients crossed over to NT (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;7), they experienced statistically significant improvements in all measures at magnitudes similar to those observed in the NT arm (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3A</xref>). The differences in the mean changes in outcome between the NT, crossover-to-NT versus PT-TENS were clinically substantial and statistically significant across all measures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2A</xref>).</p><p>In Study Two, improvement in all measures was observed at the 4-week follow-up in both NT and PT-TENS patients (all statistically significant, except BPI &#x0201c;right now&#x0201d; in the PT-TENS arm, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2B</xref>). NT resulted in greater improvement in all measures than PT-TENS: BPI &#x0201c;at its worst&#x0201d;: improvement of 4.5 (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001, 95% CI) versus 1.8 (P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0057, 95% CI) points; BPI &#x0201c;average&#x0201d;: improvement of 3.6 (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001, 95% CI) versus 0.9 (P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.064, 95% CI) points; BPI &#x0201c;right now&#x0201d;: improvement of 3.0 (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001, 95% CI) versus 0.4 (P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.37, 95% CI) points; functional impairment: improvement of 8.1 (P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0002, 95% CI) versus 3.6 (P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02, 95% CI) points; and QOL: improvement of 27.8 (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001, 95% CI) versus 11.0 (P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0056, 95% CI) points. All differences in these improvements between the NT and PT-TENS arms were statistically significant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2B</xref>). A similar trend (with slightly smaller differences between the NT and PT-TENS arms) was observed at the 8-week follow-up, although more PT-TENS patients reported receiving off-protocol treatments before the 8-week follow-up (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2B</xref>).</p><p>Follow-ups were conducted between 2012/03/30 and 2013/01/04 in Study One and between 2013/05/29 and 2014/04/25 in Study Two.

This reduction was observed on the second day after the therapy was administered and was sustained until the end of the study (30 days). The control group, which received sham therapy, did not exhibit significant improvement until Day 30, when spontaneous recovery occurred (see details in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Text 3</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>The concordance of evidence across five measures in two different studies suggests that NT effectively and sustainably reduces pain, restores function, and improves quality of life and that NT is superior to conventional PT by one order of magnitude.

Many NT patients reported that the pain &#x0201c;moved&#x0201d; from one place to another during or after each application of electrical stimulation.

The muscle typically regained full strength within approximately 3 to 6 days and remained pain-free. No PT-TENS patient reported a similar experience. These possible effects were explained to all patients before and during the treatment. Tissue remodelling may explain this temporary weakness and subsequent recovery.</p><p>Previously unnoticed pain often became prominent as the initial pain was reduced or eliminated in the NT group. Such &#x0201c;migrating pain&#x0201d; served as both an indicator of the recovery from the initial pain and a navigational cue indicating the next set of impaired muscles/tissues requiring treatment.</p><p>The reported BPI pain level of each patient reflected the intensity of pain at the most prominent pain sites and was independent of the number of sites treated via NT.</p><p>NT was conceived and refined over the past decade based on the treatment of over a thousand patients with various types of chronic pain, such as neck, shoulder, back, or knee pain. The key characteristics responsible for the notable advantage of NT over conventional PT, including TENS, include the following.<list id="l1" list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>It was critical to apply the stimulation to the exact location of the pair of Noxipoints&#x02122;, which consistently approximated the locations of the origin and the insertion of a muscle group, coinciding with the sites containing the greatest concentration of nociceptors in the muscle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Conventional TENS stimulates the general area in which the patient identifies pain. Palpation was used to locate the problem area and the Noxipoints during NT. Each area was touched briefly (for a couple of seconds) with light or moderate pressure.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Stimulation at these paired Noxipoints must induce local soreness/dull pain (matching the characteristic sensation from C-fibres). Other induced sensations (e.g., tingling, sharp pain, or muscle contraction) in the absence soreness/dull pain did not lead to positive outcomes after stimulation in approximately 80% of cases.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patient compliance with the instruction to rest was critical in NT. Noncompliance almost always led to a need for repeated NT on the same muscle/tissue. This phenomenon suggests a role of cell remodelling/regeneration in the effects of NT. The estimation of the resting period described in the Intervention section was based on the observed duration of skeletomuscular cell repair mediated by myosatellite cells in the laboratory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> and on the empirical observation of NT in preliminary studies. Satellite cells (unipotent stem cells, or more precisely, progenitor cells) are committed to the late stage of the myotube differentiation and, thus, differentiate into muscle cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> within a few days. In contrast, in conventional PT or TENS, the patient is encouraged to actively exercise the treated muscle after each treatment, which might be one reason for its lower effectiveness.</p></list-item></list></p><p>In contrast to the modalities of PT (e.g., manual therapy, exercise, and TENS), which were independent and additive, all three elements of NT were found to be indispensable based on thousands of observations during its development. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the overall efficacy of NT and to compare it with the collective best practices of conventional PT. We did not intend to analyse individual elements/modalities of any therapy in this study.</p><p>Neither waveform nor frequency of the electro-stimulation contributed to the difference in efficacy between NT and PT-TENS. Prior studies concluded that different waveforms of TENS did not affect analgesic efficacy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Thus, various waveforms were used in the PT-TENS arm. Moreover, the effect of NT was not affected by waveform. Both high (typically 80&#x02013;150&#x02009;Hz) and low (typically 1&#x02013;10&#x02009;Hz) frequencies were used in the PT-TENS arm in Studies One and Two without any noticeable impact on the outcomes at follow-up. Although low frequencies were used more often in the NT arm in this study, high frequencies were also used. The effect of NT was not affected by the stimulation frequency. High- and low-frequency TENS activate &#x003b4;- and &#x003bc;- opioid receptors, respectively, to cause only short-term analgesia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>; thus, the frequency range was not responsible for the long-term effect of NT at follow-up. In this study, the waveform and the frequency were standardized in the protocol to facilitate the training of therapists and the clinical application of NT.</p><p>Depending on the severity and extensiveness of the pain, various neck (or shoulder) muscles could be involved. In severe cases, the Noxipoints of nearly all muscles in neck and shoulder regions were identified and treated. In milder cases, some patients had been treated at the Noxipoints related to less than ten muscle groups. In this study, muscle groups treated in most patients included trapezius, splenius capitus, rectus capitus, levator scapulae, supraspinatus and deltoid.</p><p>Often used to characterize the myofascial pain syndrome, Trigger Points (TrP, also called Myofascial Trigger Points) are defined as the tender (hyperirritable) spot in a palpable taut band of skeletal muscle fibers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Pressure stimulation of a TrP can elicit pain, referred pain, and local twitch response. Some TrPs, similar to Noxipoints, are found on the attachments (&#x0201c;Attachment TrPs&#x0201d;). The distinctive characteristics of Noxipoints are that they (1) come in pair for each muscle or soft tissue, (2) precisely approximate the two attachments of the muscle group or soft tissue and (3) do not require the presence of taut band nor twitch response for identification. TrP treatments (such as saline injection) focus on each TrP, while NT stimulates the pair of Noxipoints in the same electro-circuit to elicit C-fiber-like sensation simultaneously. If the NT stimulation is applied to one Noxipoint only or if the pair of Noxipoints is not in the same close circuit, there is little effect.</p><p>The microstructure of Noxipoints in each muscle group is assumed to be the receptive endings of nociceptors (the receptors for potentially damaging stimuli that cause the pain sensation), which have been observed to be concentrated near the two attachments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. The facts that the density of nociceptor fibres in the peritendineum (the connective tissue around a tendon) of the rat&#x02019;s tendon is multiple times higher than that in the muscle proper, and that the muscle proper is usually not supplied by any free nerve endings (including the nociceptive endings)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> are consistent with this assumption.</p><p>The proposed mechanism underlying the effects of NT departs from the conventional wisdom about chronic pain at the clinical and physiological levels. Although TENS was used in both the NT and PT-TENS arms, NT was distinct from conventional TENS with respect to its site specificity, submodality specificity and requirement for rest/immobilisation. Only induced soreness/dull pain consistently resulted in pain relief and persistent functional recovery. As the location of NT stimulation had to be at or near the two attachments of the target muscle, which contain the highest concentrations of nociceptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, and as soreness/dull pain is the characteristic sensation elicited by C-fibres<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, the C-fibre nociceptor was implicated in the NT process.</p><p>The sustained effect of substantial pain reduction and functional restoration in nearly all patients after NT could not be explained by the initial assumption that NT neurologically inhibited pain (e.g., via the activation of opioid receptors). The sustained effect, especially in patients with a history of muscle impairment, indicated that the outcome of NT involved muscle/tissue remodelling. The observed requirement for multiple-days of rest of the treated area for full functional recovery suggested the occurrence of cellular regeneration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>.</p><p>Although the exact mechanism underlying its effects is unknown, a neuroimmune signalling pathway from the nociceptive signal to the innate immune cell-mediated repair process may explain the consistent outcome induced by NT stimulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Based on the biomedical literature, a specific induced signalling pathway has been hypothesised, and physiological research is underway to verify the involvement of this pathway. The coinciding outcome of the preliminary rat study may facilitate such research.</p><p>Though these two trials and the animal study provided evidence for a promising therapy, longer-term and broader-scope studies of multiple chronic pain conditions are desirable. Further studies of the individual elements of NT are also desirable. Detailed activity monitoring after treatment may be helpful to establish the precise correlation between rest (immobilisation) of the treated area and the effect of NT. Further animal studies would be useful for investigating the mechanism underlying the effect of NT.</p><p>These studies found that NT substantially reduced pain, restored function, and improved quality of life in a sustained manner in patients with chronic neck and shoulder pain and that NT was superior to conventional PT. Study Two found that the effects of NT are generalisable with respect to different pain levels, ethnicities and therapists.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Trial design</title><p>Study One was a parallel, blinded superiority RCT with crossover comparing the effectiveness of NT to that of PT-TENS in patients with chronic neck and shoulder pain.

The 2:1 randomisation ratio was used for ethical reasons due to the positive therapeutic effect of NT observed in preliminary treatments (Exhibit 3, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Protocol 1</xref>). A person at a separate location from the trial site retained and concealed the generated sequence. Qualified patients who verbally consented on the phone were assigned a sequential number. The scheduling administrator, who had no knowledge of the random allocation sequence, sequentially assigned each patient who signed the informed consent form to a stratum based on the reported pain level. The assignment of the patient was implicitly locked in at this step. Within each stratum, a person not involved in the trial mechanically mapped patients in the sequence to the pre-computed random allocation sequence to avoid assignment bias.</p><p>In the second stage, patients were allowed to cross over to the other arm after completion of treatment in the assigned arm, followed by a washout period (minimum of 4 weeks). At both stages, patient outcomes were evaluated at baseline, at each treatment session, and at follow-up, which was performed approximately 8 weeks after baseline (at least 4 weeks after the final treatment). Note that this crossover design eliminated any potential assignment/selection bias and other known or unknown confounders, which was a key objective of the trial design.</p><p>Study Two, a parallel, blinded superiority RCT, was conducted to compare the effectiveness of NT to that of PT-TENS for chronic neck pain using the same measures as those used in Study One and following up at 4 and 8 weeks after baseline assessment. The sequence for random allocation to either arm was generated using a computerised random number generator at a 1:1 ratio and was stored by a clerk who was not involved in the trial for concealment. A scheduling administrator, who had no knowledge of the random allocation sequence, assigned a sequential number to each patient who had signed the informed consent form. Each patient was mechanically mapped to the pre-computed allocation sequence by an independent person to avoid assignment bias.</p><p>All experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.

The patients in the NT arm were treated with electrical stimulation for 90&#x02009;minutes according to the following guidelines described below. In the pain area, the therapist palpated at or near the attachment points of each muscle group and soft tissue and identified a set of pain points that were sensitive to pressure (termed Noxipoints&#x02122;). A muscle group or soft tissue was identified as a target when Noxipoints appeared at both of its attachments. Stimulation was precisely applied at the pair of Noxipoints corresponding to the impaired muscle/tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>) for approximately four minutes per application. Typical of most chronic neck- or shoulder-pain patients, most subjects had multiple groups of impaired muscles/tissues; a new pair of target Noxipoints was identified for the next stimulation. The stimulation was set up to induce the specific nociception of soreness or dull pain, but not sharp pain, based on the patient&#x02019;s confirmation during the application. Stimulus voltage, wavelength, frequency and mode were collectively adjusted to achieve the target sensation. A typical range of the settings used for NT was as follows: mode, burst; pulse frequency, 1&#x02013;3&#x02009;Hz; pulse duration, 50&#x02013;300 milliseconds; application duration, four minutes; intensity, 30&#x02013;120&#x02009;mA; and electrode characteristics, 2&#x02033;&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;4&#x02033; reusable type or, occasionally, 2&#x02033;&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2&#x02033; for small muscle groups. Skin preparation was typically not necessary, but electrolyte solution or water was sprayed on dry skin to prevent electrical arcing. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>, the actual settings were measured and shown to illustrate multiple patients&#x02019; responses in sequence. Different subjects responded differently to the current and the voltage used to attain the target for the nociceptive submodality (i.e., moderate muscle soreness/dull pain). The mode (burst) and the frequency (2&#x02009;Hz) were held constant for all subjects. Various combinations of parameters can be used to reach the target for the nociceptive submodality.</p><p>Within the 90-minute session, the objective was to apply NT to as many pairs of Noxipoints as possible; approximately 4&#x02009;minutes were required for each NT application. The balance of the session time not including the stimulation time was used for positioning and tuning (which involved locating the Noxipoints, placing the pads, slowly adjusting the intensity to avoid a sudden increase (which could trigger A<sub>&#x003b4;</sub> fibre-elicited sharp pain) and obtaining feedback from the patient before each stimulation. The time required for these activities naturally varied (about 2&#x02013;4 minutes), as each person was different. The &#x0201c;2&#x02013;5 minutes&#x0201d; of stimulation in the original protocol was later standardised to 4 minutes per stimulation during NT application. The net outcome of NT was not sensitive to the duration of each stimulation, as the total session time remained the same (approximately 90 minutes). After each treatment session, the patients were instructed not to strain the newly treated muscle or tissue during the &#x0201c;resting period&#x0201d;, which was approximately 3 to 7 days, and to use braces in moderate or severe cases of pain (see the details of the Intervention section of <xref ref-type="table" rid="t4">Table 4</xref>).</p><p>The patients in the PT-TENS arm were treated for 90&#x02009;minutes per session with conventional PT, including manual therapy (to cervical and/or rotator cuff areas), infrared heat therapy (on the pain site) and ROM exercises (foraminal opening, walking the arm on the wall, rotation of the upper arm, etc.) for 15&#x02009;minutes each in Study One (20&#x02009;minutes each in Study Two). TENS was applied to general pain areas identified by the patient and reoriented once for 45&#x02009;minutes in Study One (30&#x02009;minutes in Study Two). In both studies, the physical therapist was commissioned to optimise the treatment for individual patients within the protocol. In Study One, TENS application was set up as follows: mode, normal; frequency, 10&#x02013;90&#x02009;Hz; duration, 200&#x02013;250 microseconds; waveform, pulsed biphasic, asymmetric square wave; input voltage, 9&#x02009;V; output voltage: 30&#x02013;90&#x02009;V, intensity, maximum tolerable by the patient (typically 30&#x02009;mA&#x02013;60&#x02009;mA) up to a maximum available current of 120&#x02009;mA. In Study Two, TENS application was set up as follows: (a) mode, duration modulation; frequency, 80&#x02013;100&#x02009;Hz; duration, 100&#x02013;150 microseconds; waveform, pulsed biphasic, asymmetric square wave; input voltage, 9&#x02009;V; output voltage, 30&#x02013;80&#x02009;V; and intensity, maximum tolerable by the patient (typical 15&#x02013;60&#x02009;mA) up to a maximum available current of 120&#x02009;mA; (b) mode, strength-duration modulation 2 (SD2); frequency, 5&#x02013;60&#x02009;Hz; duration, 40&#x02013;150 microseconds; waveform, variable pulses with automatic increasing intensity and decreasing pulse duration; input voltage, 9&#x02009;V; output voltage, 30&#x02013;100&#x02009;V; intensity, maximum tolerable by the patient up to a maximum available current of 120&#x02009;mA. TENS application was set at the highest tolerable intensity and frequency based on the patient&#x02019;s feedback as recommended in prior studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. As the physical therapist was asked to optimise the PT-TENS treatment for the patient, alternative TENS settings might have been used when little progress was observed during the first several sessions (interferential current mode with crossed channel placement; frequency, 4000&#x02013;4100&#x02009;Hz with 70&#x02013;120&#x02009;Hz differential; duration, 50&#x02013;100 microseconds, waveform, sine wave; intensity, maximum tolerable by the patient (typically 15&#x02013;60&#x02009;mA) up to a maximum available current of 99&#x02009;mA). Following best PT practices, the patients were asked to follow self-care instructions including maintaining good posture (e.g., sitting up straight) throughout the day, performing stretch exercises (e.g., chin in, chin in &#x00026; slowly stretch head back, head turn over the shoulders, shoulder rolls, shoulder blade squeeze, 10 times each) and endurance training and re-educating muscles.</p><p>No skin preparation was needed for NT or PT in most cases. An electrolyte solution or water was occasionally sprayed on the dry skin or near the hairline to avoid electrical arcing.</p><p>One licensed physical therapist in each study with a minimum of 12 years of work experience and no knowledge of NT performed the PT-TENS. After the PT-TENS protocol was explained to the physical therapist, he/she was commissioned to optimise outcomes for each patient within the protocol. NT was performed by the original therapist team in Study One and by three newly trained therapists in Study Two. Each new NT therapist was trained via an NT introduction section for four hours by the original therapist followed by approximately 20 practical training sessions (approximately 4&#x02013;5 patients) before the new therapist began treating patients on her/his own to ensure consistency in locating Noxipoints and performing treatments. The six sessions allocated in Study Two, representing a standard physician&#x02019;s order for any PT, partially accommodated the inexperience of the NT therapists.</p><p>The selection of controls was based on multifaceted considerations. Nearly all patients with long-term chronic pain had undergone multiple treatment modalities, including manual therapy, active use of TENS, observation (no treatment), waiting, etc. for years. Although placebo TENS (placing electrodes on sites without applying current) was considered, this treatment was unlikely to pass the sanity check of any patient. Thus, we included TENS with current in the control arm to blind the patient to the treatment. Between TENS with random placement and TENS following conventional PT guidelines, we chose the latter to maximise the effect of the control arm, erring on the conservative side. That is, TENS in the PT-TENS arm was not a sham therapy but rather a component of active treatment.</p><p>Although little evidence suggested that any specific modality of PT had greater long-term efficacy than placebo, significant evidence showed that most modalities of PT, including placebo, &#x0201c;were almost always better than no treatment in treating chronic pain&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. PT, especially PT using multiple modalities including TENS, was therefore an ethical and robust control for this study.</p><p>The objective of the study was to investigate the overall efficacy of NT and to compare it with the best practice of conventional PT (i.e., the standard of care) as an established active comparator. We did not intend to determine which element in NT or modality in PT-TENS contributes more (or less) to treatment efficacy. Thus, multiple modalities of PT with established efficacy were included in PT-TENS as the best-practice active comparator.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome was the BPI score &#x0201c;at its worst&#x0201d;.

Missing data were imputed using last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF). Patients not receiving any post-baseline assessment were excluded. All randomised patients who received any treatment (even only one session) and one post-treatment assessment were included in the analysis to avoid potential bias introduced by excluding dropout patients. The missing outcome measures for these dropout patients (e.g., 5 patients lost to follow-up in the NT arm of Study Two) were conservatively imputed using LOCF. Thus, the number of patients analysed was greater than the number of patients observed at follow-up in both studies. All Ns are reported in the CONSORT Flowchart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). All patients who received additional, off-protocol treatments (particularly those in the PT-TENS arm) were included in the analysis to be conservative.</p><p>Patients with successful early completion (i.e., no further treatment sessions needed) reported their pain level and QOL by phone; the ROM measures had to be assessed in person and were thus missing for these sessions.

Special thanks to Professor David B. Lewis, Chief of the Division of (Paediatric) Immunology, Allergy and Rheumatology at Stanford School of Medicine, who reviewed the hypothesised signalling pathway of NT, participated in Study One as a co-principal investigator, and subsequently reviewed the manuscript. Professor Sean Mackey, Director of the Stanford Pain Management Centre, provided valuable advice during the early phase of this study. Both Professor Ming-Chih Kao of the Pain Management Centre and Professor Jill Helms of the Department of Surgery, who specialise in regenerative medicine research, at Stanford Medical Centre reviewed the proposed signalling pathway and the manuscript. Professor John TC Lee at NTU, Dr. George Bulloch, former Assistant Physician-in-Chief at Kaiser Foundation Hospital, and Matt Mesnik, former Chief Medical Officer of the Minute Clinic of CVS Pharmacy, advised on and reviewed the manuscript. The referrals of study patients from Dr. Der-Sheng Han, therapy services and data collection provided by Tseng Yi, Sue-Mei Wang, Song-Ching Lee, and Meng-Yi Hsu, and the administrative support of Susan Shao are appreciated. All investigators in Study One participated voluntarily with no funding from any companies; C.K. paid for out-of-pocket expenses during the study. Study Two was funded by the Cutting-Edge Research Fund at NTU (Project #103R104059).</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="b1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">Committee on Advancing Pain Research, Care, and E.

C.K. invented NT a decade ago. Invited by Stanford University, C.K. conceived and designed the protocol and obtained IRB approval. He conducted the randomised clinical trial of Study One between 2012 and 2013 as the principal investigator of the trial, along with Professor David Lewis (MD, PhD) at Stanford Medical Centre. C.K. conceived, designed and co-directed the second IRB-approved trial on NT (Study Two, 2013&#x02013;2014) together with T.W. and J.T. at NTU between 2013 and 2014. He conceived, designed and co-directed the rat study with C.Y. at NTU in 2014. C.K. actively participated in the acquisition, analysis and interpretation of the data in Study One and in the analysis and interpretation of the data in Study Two. He trained the participating Noxipoint therapists and ensured the accuracy of the data collection process. He wrote the manuscript, the tables, the figures and the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supporting information</xref> and revised them based on peer feedback on all versions. R.L., a biostatistician, conducted the data analysis and the interpretation of the study results for both Studies One and Two <italic>pro bono</italic>. R.L. also substantially contributed to the trial design, protocol writing, manuscript writing and revision of both studies. He helped ensure the integrity of the data collection, the blinding discipline, the statistical methodology, and the interpretation of the trial results. T.W., Chairman of the Physical Medicine &#x00026; Rehabilitation Department of National Taiwan University, was actively involved in the design of the protocol in Study Two. T.W. critically reviewed the protocol, screened the qualifications of the recruited patients for the trial, and critically reviewed the manuscript. J.T., Chairperson of the Physical Therapy Department of NTU, was actively involved in the design of the protocol in Study Two and critically reviewed the manuscript. P.Y., President of NTU (formerly Dean of the School of Medicine) and Research Fellow of Academia Sinica (the national academy of science of Taiwan), reviewed the protocol design at the beginning of Study Two. He advised on the trial throughout Study Two and critically reviewed the manuscript. C.Y., Professor of Life Science at NTU, conceived and directed the rat study after a preliminary animal study on NT-like treatment on a small group of rats and critically reviewed the manuscript. S.B., who specialises in musculoskeletal pain research at Stanford Medical Centre, participated in Study One since its early phase. S.B. contributed to data interpretation, advised on and critically reviewed the manuscript throughout the study and made in-depth revisions.</p></fn></fn-group></back><floats-group><fig id="f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>CONSORT Participant Flowchart.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Flow Diagram of Study One- United States. (<bold>b</bold>) Flow Diagram of Study Two&#x02014;Taiwan. All randomised patients except those who did not receive at least one post-treatment assessment were included in the analysis to avoid potential bias introduced by excluding dropout patients. The missing data for the outcome measures of these dropout patients (e.g., the 4 patients lost to Follow-up 1 (FU-1) and one patient lost to Follow-up 2 (FU-2) in the NT arm of Study Two) were conservatively imputed based on the LOCF method. Thus, the number of patients analysed was greater than the number of patients observed at follow-up in both studies. The analysed Ns in Study Two were the same as the Ns of the intention-to-treat populations. In Study Two, the protocol required the collection of BPI data before each session and at each follow-up, whereas ROM data was collected only at baseline and at follow-up. As the five dropout patients did not return for either follow-up, there was no ROM measure aside from the pre-treatment measure. These data were excluded from ROM analysis, as carry-over from the pre-treatment baseline data to the missing data at FU1 and FU2 would be misleading because their corresponding BPI values showed substantial pain reduction.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="srep16342-f1"/></fig><fig id="f2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Incremental Changes in Primary and Secondary Outcomes.</title><p><inline-formula id="d33e595"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e596" xlink:href="srep16342-m1.jpg"/></inline-formula>NT&#x02009;=&#x02009;Noxipoint&#x02122; therapy arm.

A muscle group or soft tissue was identified as a target when Noxipoints&#x02122; appeared at both of its attachments as shown in (<bold>a</bold>). Stimulation was precisely applied at the pair of Noxipoints corresponding to the impaired muscle/tissue. Most chronic neck- or shoulder-pain patients had multiple groups of impaired muscles/tissues. An example of applying NT to the upper trapezius is shown in (<bold>b</bold>). The illustrations were drawn by Jesse Stark.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="srep16342-f3"/></fig><fig id="f4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>NT Stimulation Settings.</title><p>Electrical stimulation was applied to the two attachments of the target muscle (e.g., deltoid) in NT. Different subjects responded differently to the current and the voltage used to attain the target for the nociceptive submodality (i.e., moderate muscle soreness/dull pain). The mode and the frequency were held constant for all subjects. Once the target nociceptive submodality was reached, the setting was maintained for approximately 4 minutes or until the corresponding Noxipoints&#x02122; disappeared. Muscle twitching/contraction and motor-nerve activation often preceded the onset of soreness during NT stimulation. The timeline shows the sequential appearance of a motor neuron response (&#x0201c;muscle contraction&#x0201d;), an A<sub>&#x003b2;</sub> fibre response (&#x0201c;tingle&#x0201d;), and a C-fibre response (&#x0201c;muscle soreness&#x0201d;). An A<sub>&#x003b4;</sub> fibre response (sharp/spiky pain) was avoided by slowly and carefully increasing the intensity. The progression of different patients followed a common pattern but reached the nociceptive submodality at different voltage/current settings for each patient. The intensity (current or voltage) of &#x0201c;moderate muscle soreness&#x0201d; was approximately twofold that of &#x0201c;muscle twitching&#x0201d;/contraction. NT resolved the pain in the treated area when soreness was perceived in the presence or absence of muscle contraction.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

A muscle group or soft tissue was identified as a target when Noxipoints appeared on both of its attachments. A three-dimensional Noxipoint&#x02122; Navigation System was provided to help the NT therapist locate Noxipoints during the treatment. The stimulation pads were precisely placed at the skin surface locations of the pair of Noxipoints corresponding to the impaired muscle/tissue for approximately 4 minutes per application. As most chronic neck or shoulder pain patients had multiple groups of impaired muscles/tissues, a new pair of target Noxipoints was identified for the next pad placement and stimulation after each application. The positioning and tuning of each stimulation took approximately 2-4 minutes, as each patient reacted differently. From ten to fifteen stimulations were applied to the patient per session. Multiple pairs of Noxipoints were stimulated at the same time in some cases. The stimulation was set up to induce the specific nociception of soreness, achiness or dull pain based on the patient&#x02019;s confirmation during the application. Stimulus voltage, wave pattern, wavelength, frequency and mode were collectively adjusted to achieve such sensations. Representative settings are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>. After the treatment session, the patients were instructed not to strain the newly treated muscle or tissue during the &#x0201c;resting period&#x0201d; (described below) and to use braces in moderate or severe cases. The duration of the &#x0201c;resting period&#x0201d; was a minimum of three days for patients below 40 years old and one additional day per 10-year increment. For example, the rest duration for a 45-year-old patient was 4 days. This estimate was suggested based on the heuristic observation of a few hundred preliminary cases. If the patient had extensively impaired muscles, he/she was instructed to take two additional days of rest of the muscles. As all participants had moderate to severe pain, they were asked to use braces (e.g., OTC Professional Orthopedic Soft Foam Cervical Collar, Futuro Soft Cervical Collar, over-the-counter arm sling or tape) to immobilise the treated area.</td><td align="center" valign="top" charoff="50">NT was performed as in Study One</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">PT:</td><td align="center" valign="top" charoff="50">Manual therapy, infrared heat therapy and ROM exercises for 15 minutes each, and TENS for 45 minutes at the general pain areas identified by the patient; the pain areas were reoriented once.</td><td align="center" valign="top" charoff="50">Manual therapy, infrared heat therapy and ROM exercises for 20 minutes each, and TENS for 30 minutes at the general pain areas identified by the patient; the pain areas were reoriented once.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">Outcome measures</td><td align="center" valign="top" charoff="50">BPI &#x0201c;at its worst&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;average&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;right now&#x0201d; (each from 0 to 10), ROM deficit, and BPI interference with functions.
