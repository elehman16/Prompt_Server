The aim was to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of antimicrobial dentifrices with herbal extracts and conventional toothpaste with no antimicrobial action for improvement of oral hygiene and reduction of gingival inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>48 volunteers with chronic marginal gingivitis were randomly divided into three groups. Groups 1 and 2 received herbal extract dentifrices. Group 3 used a conventional dentifrice. Subjects were asked to use the allocated dentifrice, three times a day, for 42 days. Values of Patient Hygiene Performance, Approximal Plaque, Gingival, and Sulcular Bleeding indices were assessed at baseline, after 14, 28 and 42 days. Data were analyzed by Student's t-test (&#x003b1; = 0.05).</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Oral hygiene (tooth brushing with dentifrices for 42 days) led to a significant decrease in plaque accumulation on smooth (by 61.2% and 57.2 in herbal test groups 1 and 2, respectively) and approximal (by 57.4 and 52.8% in herbal test groups 1 and 2, respectively) tooth surfaces, reduction of gingival inflammation (by 68.0 and 70.6% in herbal test groups 1 and 2, respectively) and gingival sulcus bleeding (by 79.5 and 81.2% in herbal test groups 1 and 2, respectively).

Although, brushing teeth twice a day and daily flossing is highly effective in plaque reduction, over 50% of adults have gingivitis on an average of 3 to 4 teeth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>.</p><p>The considerable prevalence of gingival inflammation within the general population suggests that most patients practice inadequate oral hygiene, particularly within certain regions of their mouths and in certain areas of their teeth.</p><p>At present, the prevalence of periodontal diseases in Yemen is rather high and has a tendency to grow.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> Bacteria in dental plaque are one of the main factors causing periodontal inflammation;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> therefore, careful plaque control is very important. However, mechanical plaque removal is inadequately performed by most members of the population. The need for additional help in controlling bacterial plaque provides the rationale for patients to use antimicrobial dentifrices in addition to their mechanical oral hygiene regimens.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> A number of controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that tooth brushing with herbal dentifrices reduces supragingival plaque and gingivitis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></p><p>Interest in natural-based toothpastes has increased recently. Of the various herbal dental products considered, Paradontax (GlaxoSmithKline, Middlesex, United Kingdom) has received great attention. It is composed of sodium bicarbonate, sodium fluoride (1,400 ppm), and herbal ingredients including camomile, echinacea, sage, myrrh, rhatany, and peppermint oil. Each individual component is reputed to have a variety of medicinal properties. Camomile has anti inflammatory properties, and it is supposed to decrease gingival inflammation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> Echinacea is claimed to stimulate the immune response and to activate leukocytes. Sage is reputed to decrease tissue bleeding and myrrh is a natural anti-septic.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> The medicinal properties of peppermint oil are analgesic, anti-septic, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial, among others.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></p><p>Few controlled trials have been found in the literature concerning the efficiency of this herbal toothpaste. Some studies reported that Paradontax was able to produce a significant decrease in plaque and gingivitis, as compared to a control dentifrice,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> while others found no significant advantage over a standard toothpaste.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></p><p>The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of antimicrobial dentifrices of herbal (Parodontax&#x000ae; and Silca) toothpastes for the improvement of oral hygiene and the reduction of gingival inflammation in patients with gingivitis as a whole, in comparison to commercial fluoride toothpaste with no antimicrobial action.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Forty eight patients who met the inclusion criteria and attended the dental clinic were examined during ten days by one examiner.

Final values of plaque indices in herbal test groups were significantly lower compared to baseline data and to corresponding values in the conventional group. Using the herbal extracts dentifrices increased the effectiveness of plaque control, especially in difficult interproximal areas.
