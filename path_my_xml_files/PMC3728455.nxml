Many of the EQ-5D value sets&#x02014;generated in countries ranging from the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] to the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], the Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], France [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and Argentina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]&#x02014;were elicited from the general population using TTO. With TTO one finds the value for each health state (H<italic>i</italic>) by establishing the amount of time in full health (<italic>x</italic>) that is considered equivalent to a given amount of time in a poor health state (<italic>t</italic>). That value is calculated as (<italic>x</italic>/<italic>t</italic>). In EQ-5D valuation studies, <italic>t</italic> is set at 10&#x000a0;years.</p><p>Despite its widespread application, there are some problems with TTO, especially regarding the valuation of states that are considered &#x02018;worse than dead&#x02019; (WTD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] because the trade-off procedure employed for WTD is different than the one used for states deemed better than dead (BTD). Accordingly, different TTO elicitation techniques are used for BTD and WTD. The TTO values for BTD are obtained by varying the years spent in full health (<italic>x</italic>), while the length of time spent in the health state (H<italic>i</italic>) that is to be evaluated is fixed (<italic>t</italic>). The procedure for WTD, in contrast, involves simultaneously changing both <italic>x</italic> and <italic>t</italic>.</p><p>Several researchers have noted the problems related to this approach. Above all, they question the assumption that both procedures produce utilities on the same scale, pointing out the possibility of obtaining extremely negative values for WTD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Such issues have far-reaching implications for the use of TTO values in health technology assessment and economic evaluations.</p><p>In 2006 Robinson and Spencer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] proposed a solution to these problems: a new elicitation procedure capable of yielding values both above and below zero. The method involves simply adding some additional time in full health to the time available for trading (&#x02018;Life A&#x02019;), as well as to the scenario comprising the state being valued (H<italic>i</italic>) (&#x02018;Life B&#x02019;). In the latter, the time in full health <italic>precedes</italic> the scenario of illness presented in the TTO task, hence its description as a lead-time TTO; see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The objective of the task, as in conventional TTO, is to find a point of indifference between the two options. When the health state to be valued is considered better than dead, the point of indifference will be reached when the duration of Life A is longer than the period of years in full health offered in Life B. If the health state is considered worse than dead, at the point of indifference the duration of Life A will be shorter than the years in full health presented in Life B.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Lead-time and lag-time TTO variants</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10198_2013_505_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>In lead-time TTO, the iterative trading process allows the participant to move between negative and positive values without being required explicitly to think about whether the state is worse or better than being dead. Unlike the conventional approach, lead-time TTO does not require a separate method of elicitation for these states. Thus, it avoids the &#x02018;focusing effect&#x02019; that may arise with such deliberation. The question remains whether the resulting values &#x0003c;0 concur with the states judged as worse than being dead [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Devlin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] have shown that lead-time TTO is a feasible method for the valuation of health states in EQ-5D. They have provided evidence that this method may change the values for both BTD and WTD. Some questions regarding the length of time in full health to be presented in Life A and the adequate ratio of time in full health (lead-time) to time in H<italic>i</italic> presented in Life B have been explored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Some of these issues warrant further investigation, however.</p><p>A related TTO variant called lag-time TTO has also been proposed. It places the additional time in full health <italic>after</italic> the health state to be valued instead of <italic>before</italic> it, as in lead-time TTO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The method is therefore similar to that of lead-time TTO except for the temporal repositioning of time spent in poor health in Life B. Devlin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] investigated the difference between lead-time and lag-time TTO in the UK and also investigated the effect on values of offering varying amounts of time in full health relative to the duration of H<italic>i</italic>.</p><p>Some authors suggest that, disregarding potential problems with time preference and framing effects, the valuations should theoretically be the same for both lead- and lag-time TTO. Nonetheless, it is possible for the variants to differ in other respects (i.e., the two approaches differ in the placement of the poor health state relative to dead, so preferences regarding health at the end of life may lead to differences in values) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study is to understand how the temporal placement of the additional time in full health&#x02014;either before (lead-time TTO) or after (lag-time TTO) the sub-optimal health state&#x02014;influences the valuation of EQ-5D-5L health states.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study is part of the EQ-5D-5L Multinational Pilot Study conducted in the UK, the USA, Canada, the Netherlands, Singapore, China, Spain, and Argentina. The core design compared lead-time TTO to discrete choice modeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Each of the country studies tested different aspects of the core protocol.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Sample</title><p>The sample was drawn from the general population of the city of Buenos Aires and its metropolitan area, covering individuals between 18 and 80&#x000a0;years of age. The selection of participants was entrusted to IPSOS, a private survey consultancy specialized in social and marketing research. The pilot was held in two locations, Buenos Aires City and Lomas de Zamora City (in the metropolitan area) between 30 May and 3 June 2011. In order to assure the representativeness of the sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], quota sampling by gender, age, and socioeconomic status was performed. Data were collected in group interviews using a digital aid.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design</title><p>Interview scripts and a digital aid were developed to present each variant of the TTO. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Options A and B were displayed horizontally using the same colors to represent a particular state (green for full health and blue to represent H<italic>i</italic>). The iterative process used to reach the point of indifference was automated within the EQ-VT digital aid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Additionally, the EQ-VT captured all participants&#x02019; responses to the task and the amount of time they needed to complete it.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Response tasks</title><p>The tasks, instructions, follow-up, and feedback questions comply with standard procedures for translation and back-translation from English to Argentinean Spanish. The IECS researchers (VI, LRA) attended two training workshops in the Netherlands in order to standardize the interview protocol. They replicated this protocol in three workshops in Buenos Aires with two other IECS researchers (FA, NE) and the IPSOS team of interviewers.</p><p>The protocol replicated the one that was used in the core multinational pilot study, which included lead-time TTO, a discrete choice (DC) model (paired comparisons), and the visual analog scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The informed consent form was adapted and approved by the Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires Institutional Review Board (IRB) in May 2011.</p><p>The study used a split-sample design, whereby a random half of the sample would get lead-time TTO and the other half lag-time TTO. All the tasks were administered using EQ-VT. The interview began with a warm-up exercise of self-rated health, followed by ten paired comparisons per participant. The pairs in the DC task were selected on the basis of a blocked design with 20 blocks of 10 pairs (total number of states evaluated&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;400). The DC task was followed by TTO valuations of five EQ-5D-5L states (total number of states evaluated by TTO&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10).</p><p>To conduct the Argentinean arm of the multinational study, we selected one variant of lead-time TTO and one of lag-time TTO, with a duration of 5&#x000a0;years for the health state to be evaluated and 10&#x000a0;years of full health (2:1 ratio). This ratio was selected in light of the results of a previous study conducted by Devlin et al. in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. For the TTO task, respondents were randomly assigned to one of two fixed blocks of states, each composed of mild, moderate, and severe health states. They were then instructed to use either a lead-time TTO or a lag-time TTO method.</p><p>Both the DC and the TTO tasks were preceded by a brief animation sequence designed to explain and illustrate what they were supposed to do. Upon completion of the task, the participants were asked a series of follow-up questions. They were asked to evaluate the difficulty and their understanding of the tasks, to give some background information, and to answer some structured feedback questions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Analysis</title><p>For TTO responses, the mean, median, standard deviation, and interquartile range (IQR) were calculated. To analyze the difference between lead-time TTO and lag-time TTO groups, we performed a <italic>t</italic> test. The primary comparison variable comprised the values obtained through the two TTO methods and its differences. These two variants were also compared in other aspects: (1) procedural aspects (time spent by the respondents on each task, number of steps taken to reach the point of indifference for each health state; number of times the respondent reset the protocol and how understandable it was; proportion of subjects that took a different number of steps before reaching the point of indifference); (2) logical inconsistencies between pairs of health states in each of the blocks; (3) the relationship between the health-state values and the severity of the valued states. Severity is measured using a &#x02018;misery index,&#x02019; an additive representation of the levels of the five dimensions. The misery index for the EQ-5D-5L ranges from 1&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5 (for the state of full health, 11111) to 5&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;5&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;5&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;5&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;5&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;25 (for the worst health state defined by the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system, 55555). All statistical analyses were conducted using STATA<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> MP 9.2.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 414 participants between 18 and 80&#x000a0;years old were interviewed. Twenty-seven subjects were excluded from the analysis because they had given the same value to all five health states presented. Also, 17 tasks that had been performed in less than a second were excluded under the premise that the task had not been understood. The lead-time variant was performed by 209 subjects, while 178 did the lag-time variant. There were no significant differences between the groups regarding baseline characteristics and their self-reported state of health, nor between the 27 excluded participants and the rest of the sample (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

The level of inconsistency was high (41.2&#x000a0;% in block 1 and 46.9&#x000a0;% in block 2).</p><p>A subgroup analysis was carried out, excluding the states in which the values were assessed in two steps. The goal of the analysis was to avoid potential bias. No major differences were found between lead-time TTO and lag-time TTO. The difference found in the original analysis for state 33133 disappeared, while a new one emerged for state 11145. The mean difference was 0.24 (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.02).</p><p>There were no significant differences between the lead-time and lag-time TTO groups in their responses to the follow-up questions, nor did these groups differ in the way the participants responded to the tasks (the amount of time they needed to value each health state, the number of steps they took to reach indifference in the TTO tasks, etc.). Ninety percent of the participants found the instructions clear and easy to understand, while half had some difficulty deciding on their answer. It is noteworthy that just over half of the participants indicated that when valuing the poor health states, they took into account the possibility that a new treatment or relief would be available. More details on this perspective are provided in the "<xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Appendix</xref>".</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Lead-time and lag-time TTO are relatively new variants that were developed to address problems with conventional TTO. The EuroQol Group chose to incorporate the lead-time TTO in their EQ-5D-5L pilot valuation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] study in an effort to overcome the known issues. As one of the sub-studies of the multinational EQ-5D-5L pilot study, we compared the two TTO variants (lead-time and lag-time TTO) in order to determine whether there were differences between them.</p><p>There are few studies in the literature comparing these variants; most focus on lead-time TTO exclusively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and none used the EQ-5D-5L instrument. One study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], which included three variants of lead-time TTO and one of lag-time TTO, found that none of the variants had either a systematically higher or lower proportion of values&#x000a0;&#x0003e;0 across all states. The lag-time variant gave considerably higher values for the severe states compared to its lead-time counterpart. This difference was attributed purely to the positioning of poor health first and full health later. The lag-time variant also completely eliminated &#x02018;non-trading&#x02019; responses; even in very mild health states, all participants were willing to trade at least some time.</p><p>Our pilot was conducted in a sample from the general population of Argentina. The analysis focused on testing for potential differences between the lead-time and lag-time TTO, in terms of both the EQ-5D-5L values produced and various measures of the &#x02018;process&#x02019; by which participants arrived at those values. This was a randomized study, and the population characteristics were similar across the groups, making comparisons between them more valid. Minor imbalances in the number of subjects assigned to each group&#x02014;arising from technical problems with the EQ-VT in the initial phase of recruitment&#x02014;have no bearing on the results and interpretation of the study.</p><p>We found no relevant differences in the health-state values generated by the two methods or in the process (number of steps taken by participants to reach the point of indifference and the amount of time to complete the protocol). Some of the states had higher values in the lag-time TTO group, while the opposite was true for other states. Only one state was found to be statistically different between the two variants.</p><p>An unexpected observation made in both lead-time and lag-time TTO&#x02014;and something that has also been observed in all countries in the multinational pilot study using the lead-time TTO variant&#x02014;was that a substantial peak occurred around 0 in all health states. This peak probably explains the low mean values produced for mild states in this study, but also the high level of inconsistency. This finding&#x02014;the peak in values at 0&#x02014;has not been previously reported in studies using lead-time TTO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Therefore, a likely explanation would lie in the interview protocol for this study: it used a digital aid in a group setting without personalized assistance (there was one interviewer for every ten participants who were being interviewed at the same time). The time to complete the task was also unexpectedly short, suggesting that the participants may not have had adequate concentration and could have rushed to complete the task. This conclusion is also suggested by the EQ-VT iteration process. In that process, for all states, the second step in the TTO tasks involved (as a ping-pong technique) going to a value of 0; from there, the participants had the choice of declaring indifference (in which case their value was recorded as 0) or moving between options above or below a value of 0. The large proportion choosing a value of 0 after only two steps suggests that participants were tempted to finish the task earlier. They then reached the indifference point without thinking about the fact that they were assigning the health state a value of &#x02018;as bad as being dead.&#x02019; These results should thus be interpreted bearing this fact in mind.</p><p>In conclusion, we did not find any meaningful or systematic differences between the lead-time and lag-time TTO variants. There are two alternative explanations for our findings: (1) the results are eclipsed by the nature of the group interview protocol, which produced a high number of states valued as zero; or (2) both variants are equivalent. In order to eliminate the potential noise introduced by the interview protocol, future research should administer TTO tasks in face-to-face interview settings. So doing would promote the engagement of the participants and thereby be conducive to a valid set of preference data.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec9"><title>Appendix</title><p>See Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref> and Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Blocks of states</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"/><th align="left">State no.</th><th align="left">MO</th><th align="left">SC</th><th align="left">UA</th><th align="left">PD</th><th align="left">AD</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="5">Block 1</td><td char="." align="char">1</td><td char="." align="char">1</td><td char="." align="char">2</td><td char="." align="char">1</td><td char="." align="char">1</td><td char="." align="char">2</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">2</td><td char="." align="char">5</td><td char="." align="char">2</td><td char="." align="char">2</td><td char="." align="char">2</td><td char="." align="char">1</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">3</td><td char="." align="char">3</td><td char="." align="char">3</td><td char="." align="char">1</td><td char="." align="char">3</td><td char="." align="char">3</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">4</td><td char="." align="char">4</td><td char="." align="char">4</td><td char="." align="char">1</td><td char="." align="char">1</td><td char="." align="char">3</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">5</td><td char="." align="char">5</td><td char="." align="char">3</td><td char="." align="char">5</td><td char="." align="char">5</td><td char="." align="char">5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="5">Block 2</td><td char="." align="char">6</td><td char="." align="char">2</td><td char="." align="char">1</td><td char="." align="char">1</td><td char="." align="char">1</td><td char="." align="char">1</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">7</td><td char="." align="char">1</td><td char="." align="char">1</td><td char="." align="char">2</td><td char="." align="char">2</td><td char="." align="char">1</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">8</td><td char="." align="char">5</td><td char="." align="char">2</td><td char="." align="char">3</td><td char="." align="char">2</td><td char="." align="char">4</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">9</td><td char="." align="char">5</td><td char="." align="char">5</td><td char="." align="char">5</td><td char="." align="char">2</td><td char="." align="char">3</td></tr><tr><td char="." align="char">10</td><td char="." align="char">1</td><td char="." align="char">1</td><td char="." align="char">1</td><td char="." align="char">4</td><td char="." align="char">5</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Cognitive debriefing: different levels of agreement, percentage of people who agreed (strongly agree or agree)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Questions</th><th align="left">Lead-time TTO (%)</th><th align="left">Lag-time TTO (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Instructions were clear</td><td char="." align="char">89.5</td><td char="." align="char">92.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Questions were easy to understand</td><td char="." align="char">90.0</td><td char="." align="char">90.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left">It was difficult to decide the answer</td><td char="." align="char">49.0</td><td char="." align="char">50.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left">The difference between the lives presented was easy to tell</td><td char="." align="char">82.8</td><td char="." align="char">83.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left">The time they asked to imagine was too long</td><td char="." align="char">32.7</td><td char="." align="char">34.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left">A new treatment or relief was possible</td><td char="." align="char">55.3</td><td char="." align="char">56.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left">I will get used to living with impairment</td><td char="." align="char">50.5</td><td char="." align="char">46.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left">The most important thing is if I would able to work</td><td char="." align="char">72.6</td><td char="." align="char">66.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Difficult to imagine the health states</td><td char="." align="char">56.8</td><td char="." align="char">53.1</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>Table&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>Respondents&#x02019; process in performing the task (per each health state evaluated)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"/><th align="left"/><th align="left">Lead-time TTO</th><th align="left">Lag-time TTO</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="4">No. of resets<sup>&#x0221e;</sup>
