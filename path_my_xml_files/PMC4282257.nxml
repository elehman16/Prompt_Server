A large community survey in eight European countries has shown an overall prevalence of 11.5% <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and the disease is one of the more common reasons for visiting general practitioners or gastroenterologists <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. In addition, IBS has a well-demonstrated negative impact on quality of life (QoL) and is associated with a significant burden related to both direct and indirect (inability to work) costs <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>.</p><p>The effective relief of abdominal pain or discomfort remains a clinical challenge. Different drugs from various pharmacological classes have been proposed to relieve IBS symptoms <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. Antispasmodics, low-dose tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, desipramine) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (fluoxetine, paroxetine) in association with laxatives or antidiarrhoeal agents, are recommended, whereas the efficacy of probiotics or antibiotics warrant further studies to be definitely assessed. However, a systematic review has underlined the limited evidence for the efficacy of currently available therapies for IBS in Europe <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>.</p><p>Preclinical pharmacological studies have shown the beneficial effects of alverine citrate on both intestinal motility and sensitivity <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. As a selective 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor subtype antagonist, alverine citrate inhibits the rectal hypersensitivity induced by serotonin, a mediator involved in IBS hyperalgesia <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. Simeticone is an antifoaming agent potentially able to reduce gas-related abdominal symptoms <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and, when combined with alverine citrate, to potentiate the anti-nociceptive effect of the latter drug <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled study, designed with the latest recommendations of the Rome Committee, has demonstrated that an alverine citrate/simeticone (ACS) combination was significantly more effective than placebo for the relief of abdominal pain or discomfort in IBS patients <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>.</p><p>In Hungin's survey, 69% of the IBS subjects reported that their IBS symptoms occurred twice daily, for 7&#x000a0;days a month, IBS symptoms being present in 23% of the days <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Another 12-week study examining symptom frequency, duration and severity, as well as episodes patterns in IBS, confirmed this intermittent onset with pain/discomfort on 33% of days, bloating on 28%, and altered stool form or stool passage on 25% and 18% of the days, respectively <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. If IBS symptoms occur often cyclically, an on-demand treatment during the symptomatic periods could be logical, with the additional benefit of lowering the treatment cost. This therapeutic option has not been extensively studied, particularly in patients seen in primary care.</p><p>Controlled clinical trials are either explanatory or pragmatic. Pragmatic trials measure effectiveness and the degree of beneficial effect in the real clinical setting <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>.</p><p>Therefore, to assess the effectiveness of an on-demand treatment with ACS, we designed a 6-month randomised pragmatic clinical study to compare the efficacy and effectiveness of two treatment strategies in IBS patients, on-demand long-term treatment in one arm vs. usual treatment in the other.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients selection</title><p>Men and women aged more than 18&#x000a0;years who met Rome III criteria <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> for any subtype of IBS, lasting from 1 to 10&#x000a0;years were eligible for the study if they consulted for moderate or severe IBS symptoms, defined by an IBS-severity symptom score (IBS-SSS) between 175 and 400 <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. IBS was defined according to the Rome III criteria <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. To rule out any organic cause for symptoms, patients could undergo other investigations, including colonoscopy especially for patients aged more than 50&#x000a0;years.</p><p>Main exclusion criteria were digestive disorders related to organic intestinal disease (e.g. intestinal tumour, complicated diverticulosis, inflammatory bowel disease), bowel habit disorders related to faecal impaction, laxative abuse, a history of digestive surgery in the last 18&#x000a0;months (excluding appendectomy and hernia surgery), untreated endocrine disorders (thyroid disorders, hyperparathyroidism, non-insulin-dependent diabetes) and neurological disease. Pregnant or breastfeeding women were also excluded. The final exclusion criterion was treatment with ACS combination during the previous 6&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This randomised controlled pragmatic study was performed in two parallel cohorts of IBS patients enrolled by 87 general practitioners from December 2009 to May 2011 in France. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient. The protocol was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and European GCP for biomedical research, and was approved by the local Ethics Committee (&#x02018;Comit&#x000e9; de Protection des Personnes&#x02019; Sud-M&#x000e9;diterran&#x000e9;e I&#x02019;) of Marseille University Hospital (France).

In this arm, the treatment duration was determined by the patient himself. In the usual treatment group, investigators had to prescribe what they considered the most appropriate treatment for the patient (drug, treatment duration, dosage and administration). In this arm, only the prescription of ACS was not allowed. In both groups, irritant laxatives were prohibited for IBS patients with constipation.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation</title><p>To avoid possible investigator bias in the assessment of treatment outcomes for patients treated with usual treatments (chosen by each physician) or the on-demand strategy (imposed by the study protocol), the investigators (and not patients) were randomised into the two treatment strategies. They were equally allocated to the on-demand strategy or to the usual care strategy by block randomisation, with a block size of four. The randomisation list was generated using a SAS program.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>After the inclusion visit, follow-up visits were scheduled at months 1 and 3 prior to a final visit at month 6.

IBS-SSS was filled in prior to inclusion, then at months 1, 3 and 6. Concomitant treatments and adverse events were collected at months 1, 3 and 6 visits. The delivery of treatment units (on-demand ACS group) or the drug prescriptions (usual treatment group) were renewed at months 1 and 3.</p></sec><sec><title>End-points</title><p>The primary end-point was the difference in the magnitude of change in the total score of IBSQoL from baseline to month 6 between treatment groups.

Moreover, SF-36, HAD and Epworth scores and the concomitant consumption of analgesics and psychotropic drugs were also analysed.</p><p>The IBS treatment consumption could be checked only for the on-demand ACS group, with the analysis of the patient's diary and accountability of returned study treatment units.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety assessments</title><p>All adverse events reported during the study for all patients were collected.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Assuming a standard deviation of 20 according to the study of Brun-Strang et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, it was estimated that a sample size of 234 patients per group would provide 0.90 power to detect a difference of 6 points or more for IBSQoL score using two-sided test with a 0.05 type I error. Finally, a total of 250 patients per group was planned to account for a 10% discontinuation rate.</p><p>The primary analysis was an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis.

The safety population included all patients for whom at least one safety datum was available.</p><p>For the primary criterion &#x02018;IBSQoL total score change from baseline to month 6&#x02019;, comparison between the two groups was performed using an analysis of covariance with group as fixed factor and baseline value of total score as covariate (adjustment for baseline value). This analysis was conducted after imputing missing values by last-observation-carried-forward. The same method was used for all quantitative criteria (change in scores and subscores for the different scales).</p><p>In addition for the primary criterion, to measure the magnitude of the difference between the two groups, we calculate the Cohen's <italic>d</italic> effect size: a &#x02018;small&#x02019; effect size being 0.20, a &#x02018;medium&#x02019; effect size 0.50 and a &#x02018;large&#x02019; effect size 0.80.</p><p>For qualitative criteria, &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test was performed to compare the two groups at the last follow-up visit.</p><p>Direct costs were calculated based on the following official French documents: the &#x02018;Nomenclature G&#x000e9;n&#x000e9;rale des Actes Professionnels&#x02019; for procedures and health professional fees, the &#x02018;Nomenclature G&#x000e9;n&#x000e9;rale des Actes de Biologie&#x02019; for biological tests, Vidal 2011 dictionary for price of the refunded medications.</p><p>The hospitalisation costs were calculated according to the duration of stay and based on the mean hospitalisation daily price at the &#x02018;Assistance Publique des Hopitaux de Marseille&#x02019; (Marseille University Hospital). Indirect costs (days off work) were calculated based on the mean net salary quoted from the French National Institute of Economics and Statistics (INSEE).</p><p>Direct costs were calculated for each treatment group as the sum of the treatments, physician's visits, investigations and hospitalisations costs related to IBS. Total cost was the sum of indirect (days off work) and direct costs. Costs were compared between treatment groups (Mann&#x02013;Whitney test).</p><p>All statistical tests were bilateral at the 0.05 level.

In addition to the symptomatic effect, the study demonstrated the effectiveness of the on-demand therapeutic strategy with both direct and indirect costs lowering and treatment requirement for the relief of IBS symptoms declining throughout the 6-month follow-up period. Compared with the usual treatment group, the effectiveness of the on-demand ACS strategy was observed in all IBS subgroups, but a greater difference was found in the IBS-C and IBS-M subgroups.</p><p>The efficacy of ACS was indirectly reinforced by the significantly lower consumption of pain-relieving drugs in this arm when with the usual treatment group. This efficacy of ACS and the rate of responders (abdominal pain VAS score decrease &#x02265;&#x000a0;50%) confirmed the data of the previous randomised placebo-controlled in which the rate of responders was 46.8% in the ACS group (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;205) and 34.3% in the placebo group (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;204) <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. The superiority of on-demand ACS over standard treatments was also evidenced on depression symptoms. It could be again hypothesised that the superiority of the on-demand ACS strategy on these parameters is at least partly related to the better control of abdominal pain and gas-related discomfort. This is consistent with the recently published pharmacological data on the ACS combination showing an antinociceptive and potentiating effect of both agents <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>.</p><p>A pragmatic trial does not mean that the same treatment is offered to each patient <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. Moreover, pragmatic trials are not always blinded and a placebo is not generally used, as this type of clinical trials help clinicians to assess effectiveness and to decide between a new treatment and the best current treatment. In such trials, the treatment response is the total difference between the two treatments that includes the treatment effect and the associated placebo effects. This global response is the best reflect of the clinical therapeutic response in the real life <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. A hallmark of pragmatic trials is that participants reflect the population for which the treatment is intended <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. Our results were obtained in a population of more than 400 IBS patients referring to primary medical care for moderate-to-severe symptoms. A large majority of enrolled patients have previously been treated for IBS. The mean age in our study population (53&#x000a0;years) was higher than that reported in some recent epidemiological studies <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>. This could be partly explained by the fact that these patients were included after a mean 6-year duration of symptoms. On the other hand, an age older than 50 was shown to be one of the determinant of healthcare-seeking behaviour because of the fear of the patients that their abdominal symptoms are related to cancer or other illness <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>. The characteristics of this study population were comparable with those of IBS populations enrolled in other studies carried out in France, with a female predominance (3/1 ratio) <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>. In addition, a European survey has shown that the IBS prevalence in the female general population was 22% in the 30&#x02013;39, 15% in the 40&#x02013;49 and 18% in the general population age groups <xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>. Moreover, in the Drossman's study, age was not a determinant factor influencing IBS severity <xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>. The choice to carry on the study in primary care may account for the relatively low percentage of patients with anxiety and depressive symptoms. Therefore, we can conclude that our trial was carried out in the target population.</p><p>The assessment of QoL is considered the best end-point for efficacy and effectiveness evaluation of a treatment given for several months <xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>. At baseline, scores of both QoL scales (SF-36 and IBSQoL) were comparable to those reported by Amouretti et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>.</p><p>In our study, the greater improvement of QoL was observed for most dimensions. Several years ago, the importance of all the dimensions in the QoL of IBS patients was highlighted <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. Several epidemiological surveys have reported the correlation between a poor QoL and the severity of abdominal pain in patients with IBS <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>. Our results support these observations through a significant inverse correlation between the IBS-SSS and IBSQoL total scores.</p><p>In the controlled arm, treatments were mainly represented by antispasmodics. Indeed, several antispasmodics (phloroglucinol, mebeverine, pinaverium bromide, trimebutine but not hyoscine nor otilonium bromide) are available on the French market. According to published guidelines, antispasmodics remain the first-line treatment of IBS symptoms <xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>. No patient in this study was treated by low dose of antidepressants. However, the use of tricyclics or serotonin reuptake inhibitors for the relief of IBS pain is not recommended in France. Consequently, antidepressant agents are only prescribed by gastroenterologists especially in tertiary centres. The differences observed in this study between ACS and the usual treatment group cannot be related to antispasmodics effects lower than previously reported. In Poynard's meta-analysis of the placebo-controlled studies concerning antispasmodics, the mean percentage of patients with global improvement and pain improvement was 56% (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;927) and 53% (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;567), respectively, in the antispasmodics group <xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>.</p><p>If we referred to other pathological conditions where an on-demand treatment is discussed, such as gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, the symptomatic results between continuous and on-demand treatments were similar and the benefit of the on-demand treatment was mainly related to a significant reduction in drug intake leading to lower costs of treatment. In this study, we have been able to show differences concerning efficacy and even effectiveness between the two arms, but these results do not allow us to provide an explanation of the better symptomatic results of the on-demand arm. However, we may hypothesise that an active involvement of the patient in his own symptoms management may generate a positive effect on the symptoms control as it is reported in behavioural therapy. Also, our study does not allow us to explain why the magnitude of the difference observed on QoL and IBS-SSS in the on-demand treatment was greater in the IBS-C and IBS-M subgroups than in IBS-D or IBS-U patients. The symptomatic effect of usual treatment strategy was more pronounced in IBS-D and IBS-U patients than in the two others subgroups. One hypothesis could be that the impact of the transit disturbances, mainly the postmeal diarrhoea and urgency, is an important contributor for a poor QoL of IBS-D patients. Therefore, the prescription of antidiarrhoeal agents is probably a way to induce more significant effects on QoL.</p><p>Our study has limitations. The aim of the study imposed an open-label design and only the investigators were randomised. In such conditions, efficacy assessment by the investigator may be influenced by the strategy he has to comply with: freely chosen treatment or specified study drug. However, to minimise the bias, questionnaires were self-administered, thus further limiting the investigator's bias. Investigators were all GPs. Therefore, we can suppose that they have a similar relationship with their patients who could have been different if we had mixed GPs and gastroenterologists among the investigators. However, the lack of more precise information on the profile of investigators participating to this trial, is a second limitation for this study. In addition, for practical reasons attributable to the large sample size of both investigators and patients, we were unable to control treatment observance in the usual treatment group with the calculation of the empty treatment boxes. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that treatments prescribed on a continuous basis in this arm were in fact incompletely taken, leading to an efficacy different from expected with the treatment in the usual treatment group.</p><p>In conclusion, this pragmatic study in a large cohort of IBS patients provides evidence for the effectiveness of long-term on-demand strategy in routine clinical practice.
