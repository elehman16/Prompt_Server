Eighty patients with chronic nephrotic syndrome were admitted to our hospital. The patients were included in the study period from January 2015 to December 2016 and were divided into two groups (40 cases in each group) according to the random number method. All the patients enrolled received symptomatic and supportive treatment. The observation group was injected subcutaneously with recombinant human growth hormone, while the control group was treated with Shenyankangfu tablets. The recovery time of the clinical symptoms, change in serum protein, caloric intake and protein metabolism after intervention were compared between the two groups. Changes in serum cystatin C, <italic>IGF-1</italic> and <italic>IL-2</italic> before intervention, and at 1 week, 1 month and 3 months after intervention were detected, and the adverse reactions in the two groups were observed during the treatment. After intervention, the improvement time of proteinuria, hypoproteinemia, edema and hyperlipidemia in the observation group was significantly shorter than that in the control group (P&#x0003c;0.05). The expression of transferrin, pre-albumin, albumin and total protein in the observation group was significantly superior increased compared to those in the observation group prior to intervention and the control group after intervention (P&#x0003c;0.05). In addition the caloric intake, protein intake and urea nitrogen survival rate in the observation group were significantly superior to those in the observation group prior to intervention and the control group after intervention (P&#x0003c;0.05). At 1 week, 1 month and 3 months after intervention, the levels of serum cystatin C, <italic>IGF-1</italic> and <italic>IL-2</italic> in the observation group were markedly obviously lower than those in the control group during the same period (P&#x0003c;0.05). The total proportion of allergy, systemic pruritus, nausea and vomiting, abdominal distension and abdominal pain in the observation group was obviously lower than that in the control group (P&#x0003c;0.05). Compared with the traditional Chinese medicine Shenyankangfu tablets applied in the control group, the recombinant human growth hormone used for patients with chronic nephrotic syndrome can improve the clinical symptoms more quickly, regulate the protein metabolism and reduce the inflammatory response in the body, which also has fewer adverse reactions and higher safety.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>recombinant human growth hormone</kwd><kwd>nephrotic syndrome</kwd><kwd>protein malnutrition</kwd><kwd>insulin-like growth factor-1</kwd><kwd>interleukin-2</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nephrotic syndrome is the most clinically common kidney-related disease at present, posing a serious threat to physical health (<xref rid="b1-etm-0-0-5953" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In its pathogenesis, immune dysfunction is the main pathogenic and initiative factors (<xref rid="b2-etm-0-0-5953" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). At the same time, patients are often accompanied with malnutrition due to the loss of a large number of plasma proteins (<xref rid="b3-etm-0-0-5953" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>In the treatment of this disease, symptomatic and supportive treatment is dominant and nutritional support is strengthened for patients, as well as infection prevention, reduction of body aseptic inflammation and anti-immunosuppression (<xref rid="b4-etm-0-0-5953" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Recombinant human growth hormone is mainly secreted by the pituitary gland, which belongs to the common water-soluble protein in the body with the effects of promoting growth, development and metabolism of the body (<xref rid="b5-etm-0-0-5953" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In addition, it can strengthen the body's immune regulation function, and its therapeutic value in chronic nephrotic syndrome has been confirmed by the basic research (<xref rid="b6-etm-0-0-5953" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>In this study, the effects of recombinant human growth hormone on nutritional status and inflammatory factors, in patients with chronic nephrotic syndrome were investigated. The results showed that, chronic nephrotic syndrome can improve the clinical symptoms more rapidly, regulate the protein metabolism and reduce the inflammatory response in the body, which also has fewer adverse reactions and higher safety.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title/><sec><title>General materials</title><p>Eighty patients with chronic nephrotic syndrome were admitted to our hospital, and were included in the study, from January 2015 to December 2016. All the patients were informed before enrollment and signed the informed consent. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Zhumadian Central Hospital (Henan, China). Patients were aged 18&#x02013;60 years and received education in junior high school and above. Those who were treated with glucocorticoid and/or immunosuppressor within 30 days before enrollment, complicated with mental illness, inflammation or cardiopulmonary insufficiency, hepatic dysfunction, systemic infection, immune system diseases due to other causes, malignant tumors, unclear pathogenesis or drug allergy or who refused to be enrolled were excluded. According to the random number method, the patients were divided into two groups (40 cases in each group). The observation group comprised 21 males and 19 females, aged 18&#x02013;60 years, with an average of 35.3&#x000b1;2.1 years, and onset time of nephrotic syndrome was 1 week to 5 months with an average of 1.5&#x000b1;0.2 months. The control group comprised 23 males and 17 females, aged 18&#x02013;60 years, with an average of 35.4&#x000b1;2.1 years, and the onset time of nephrotic syndrome was 1 week to 5 months with an average of 1.5&#x000b1;0.3 months. There were no statistically significant differences in the sex, age and onset time of nephrotic syndrome between the two groups (P&#x0003e;0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The patients enrolled received symptomatic and supportive treatment, such as the application of diuretics, immunosuppressor, anti-inflammatory drugs and cytotoxic drugs. At the same time, patients complicated with infection were treated with antibacterial drugs for the prevention and treatment of infection, and anti-coagulation, regulation of plasma proteins, prevention and delay of renal failure and other treatments were also provided. On this basis, the observation group was injected subcutaneously with recombinant human growth hormone (Swiss Selangor Pharmaceutical Co., batch no. S2015010015) 3 times a week (4 units each time). Continuous treatment for 4 weeks was 1 course of treatment and the 3 courses of treatment constituted 1 treatment cycle. The control group was treated with Shenyankangfu tablets (Tianjin Tongrentang Group Co., Ltd., Tianjin, China; batch no. 201501132) at a dose of 5 tablets (0.48 g/tablets) each time, once in the morning, afternoon and evening.

With the progression of disease, they are accompanied with inflammatory hypoproteinemia and hyperlipidemia (<xref rid="b8-etm-0-0-5953" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Additionally, the body's nutritional metabolism is in a state of disorder, and long-term malnutrition seriously affects the prognosis of patients (<xref rid="b9-etm-0-0-5953" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Previous findings have shown that hypoproteinemia is treated by the infusion of exogenous human albumin for symptomatic support treatment; however, albumin is expensive (<xref rid="b10-etm-0-0-5953" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Additionally, there are certain infusion complications, leading to loss of albumin while the total time of maintaining plasma protein after infusion is short (<xref rid="b11-etm-0-0-5953" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Therefore, it cannot fundamentally correct the hypoproteinemia and malnutrition of the body. Traditional Chinese medicine has also been applied in recent studies (<xref rid="b12-etm-0-0-5953" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). However its treatment period was long, taking effect slowly over a short-term period and patient treatment compliance was poor (<xref rid="b13-etm-0-0-5953" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Long-term medication has a negative impact on renal function (<xref rid="b14-etm-0-0-5953" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Therefore, a clinically effective method with rapid effect is needed for nephrotic syndrome at present (<xref rid="b15-etm-0-0-5953" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), especially for hypoproteinemia and increased inflammation in the body (<xref rid="b16-etm-0-0-5953" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>In this study, based on conventional treatment, patients with nephrotic syndrome in the observation group were treated with recombinant human growth hormone, while those in the control group were treated with traditional Chinese medicine Shenyankangfu tablets. The comparison of recovery time of clinical symptoms between the two groups after intervention showed that the improvement time of proteinuria, hypoproteinemia, edema and hyperlipidemia in the observation group after intervention was significantly shorter than that in the control group, indicating that the application of recombinant human growth hormone can improve the clinical symptoms of patients more quickly. In addition, the study on protein metabolism and caloric intake in the body before and after intervention revealed that the transferrin, pre-albumin, albumin and total protein, and caloric intake, protein intake and urea nitrogen survival rate in the observation group after intervention were significantly superior to those in the observation group before intervention and the control group after intervention, suggesting that the application of recombinant human growth hormone in patients with chronic nephrotic syndrome can effectively improve the patient's protein metabolism and maintain the positive nitrogen balance compared with the traditional Chinese medicine Shenyankangfu tablets in the control group. At the same time, the study on changes in serum cystatin C, <italic>IGF-1</italic> and <italic>IL-2</italic> levels in the two groups during intervention showed that at 1 week, 1 month and 3 months after intervention, the levels of serum cystatin C, <italic>IGF-1</italic> and <italic>IL-2</italic> in the observation group were obviously lower than those in the control group during the same period, indicating that application of the recombinant human growth hormone in patients with chronic nephrotic syndrome has a positive significance effect in improving glomerular filtration and reabsorption and reducing the body's inflammatory response. Finally, it was found in the comparisons of adverse reactions in the two groups during the treatment that the total proportion of allergy, systemic pruritus, nausea and vomiting, abdominal distension and abdominal pain in the observation group was obviously lower than that in the control group, suggesting that the intramuscular injection of recombinant human growth hormone has fewer adverse reactions and higher safety.</p><p>Recombinant human growth hormone is a kind of protein synthesis-promoting hormone in the body, which can reduce protein catabolism, reduce urea nitrogen excretion and promote the fat metabolism in the body (<xref rid="b17-etm-0-0-5953" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), thereby improving the efficiency of protein synthesis. In addition, the recombinant human growth hormone has a certain effect of improving the immune function and reducing the incidence of infection (<xref rid="b18-etm-0-0-5953" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Through the indirect growth-promoting effect and direct anti-insulin function, it is used to improve the body's growth and development, increase the protein synthesis rate, enhance the albumin messenger RNA synthesis in liver (<xref rid="b19-etm-0-0-5953" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), improve the amino acid utilization of muscle tissues, and promote the body's anabolism (<xref rid="b20-etm-0-0-5953" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, compared with the traditional Chinese medicine Shenyankangfu tablets applied in the control group, the recombinant human growth hormone used for patients with chronic nephrotic syndrome can improve the clinical symptoms more quickly, regulate the protein metabolism and reduce the inflammatory response in the body, which also has less adverse reactions and higher safety.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><sec><title>Funding</title><p>No funding was received.</p></sec><sec><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>The datasets used and/or analyzed during the present study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>GD was involved in drafting the manuscript and data analysis.
