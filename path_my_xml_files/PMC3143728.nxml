                    college is typified by an increase in alcohol use and related harm for many
                    students. Therefore, this transition period is an ideal time for preventive
                    interventions to target alcohol use and related problems.</p><p><bold><italic>Purpose</italic></bold> The purpose of this report is to describe
                    the design and methods used in the Transitions Project, a randomized controlled
                    trial of two interventions designed to prevent and reduce heavy episodic
                    drinking and alcohol-related negative consequences among incoming college
                    students.</p><p><bold><italic>Methods</italic></bold> This study used a
                    2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 factorial design to investigate the effects of a
                    two-session brief motivational intervention delivered to students and a
                    handbook-based parent intervention. Interventions were administered to students
                    and parents. Follow-up assessment took place at 10- and 22-months
                    post-baseline.</p><p><bold><italic>Results</italic></bold> The Transitions Project successfully
                    recruited and retained participants across a major transition period (i.e.,
                    entering college), administered and compared two distinct but complementary
                    interventions, and collected and analyzed highly skewed data. The application of
                    a factorial design and two-part latent growth curve modeling allowed us to
                    examine main and interactive intervention effects in terms of both initiation
                    and growth in heavy drinking and alcohol-related problems.</p><p><bold><italic>Limitations</italic></bold> While we conducted successful tests of
                    our primary and secondary study hypotheses over a lengthy follow-up period, our
                    study design did not permit full interpretation of null findings. We suggest
                    that researchers carefully consider assessment timing, tests of assessment
                    reactivity, and ensure objective tests of intervention efficacy when conducting
                    clinical trials of motivational interventions.</p><p><bold><italic>Conclusions</italic></bold> The lessons we learned while conducting
                    this trial have the potential to assist other researchers designing and
                    conducting future preventive interventions targeting parents and college
                    students. The data analytic procedures presented can also help guide trials that
                    plan to analyze zero-inflated non-normal outcome data.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1740774510396387"><title>Background</title><p>The Transitions Project was a randomized controlled trial designed to examine the
                unique and combined effects of two preventive interventions to reduce heavy episodic
                drinking (HED) and related-harm among incoming college students. The purpose of this
                report is to describe the methodology of this trial and share the lessons learned in
                terms of recruiting and retaining a large sample across a major transition period
                (i.e., entering college), administering and comparing two complementary
                interventions, and collecting and analyzing zero-inflated non-normal data using a
                novel data-analytic technique. The reduction of HED among college students is a
                national priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774510396387">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1740774510396387">2</xref>]. Over 70% of
                college students report using alcohol, and approximately 40% report HED
                (typically defined as five drinks in a row for men and four for women) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1740774510396387">3</xref>]. While alcohol use is
                common among late adolescents, the passage from high school to college is typified
                by an increase in alcohol consumption and associated negative consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740774510396387">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1740774510396387">6</xref>]. Thus, the transition
                from high school to college represents a period of critical importance with respect
                to preventing and reducing heavy drinking and alcohol-related negative
                consequences.</p><p>Brief motivational interventions are one-on-one counseling sessions that utilize
                motivational interviewing and personalized feedback to facilitate change in
                health-related behaviors. They are the most empirically supported individual-level
                intervention for reducing alcohol use and problems among heavy drinking college
                students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740774510396387">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1740774510396387">13</xref>]. We expanded on past
                research by administering the brief motivational intervention to college students
                with heterogeneous drinking experiences and extending assessment periods beyond 1
                year.</p><p>Parent-based interventions are an emerging approach to prevent college student
                drinking. These interventions target parents and promote parenting strategies
                associated with lower levels of alcohol use and problems in adolescence; they build
                on research indicating that parents exert a continued influence throughout the
                college years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1740774510396387">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1740774510396387">17</xref>]. However, the potential beneficial role of parental influence on college
                student drinking has not been widely investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1740774510396387">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1740774510396387">22</xref>], despite a substantial body of research

                younger adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1740774510396387">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1740774510396387">26</xref>].</p><sec id="sec2-1740774510396387"><title>This study</title><p>The Transitions Project was designed to simultaneously examine a brief

                    growth of college student HED and alcohol-related consequences. A factorial
                    design was chosen to examine complementary influences on college student

                pre-matriculation, 10 months, 22 months). It was hypothesized that relative to an
                assessment only control arm, the study interventions would reduce the initiation and
                growth of HED and consequences among incoming college students, and the intervention
                effect would be multiplicative; (i.e., combined intervention effects greater than
                the sum of the individual effects). Secondary aims of this study included tests of
                intervention mediators such as changes in descriptive norms, for the brief

                    incoming students at a mid-sized northeastern public university in the United
                    States. All procedures were approved and monitored by the university
                    Institutional Review Board (IRB).</p><sec id="sec5-1740774510396387"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>The target population for this research trial was matriculating first year
                        students ages 17&#x02013;21 and their parents. Non-traditional students
                        (e.g., older, married, returning, and transfer students) were not eligible
                        to participate because of the emphasis on parent communication within the
                        home. Biological parents, stepparents, and legal guardians were eligible to
                        participate as long as they were living with the student during the
                        recruitment period.</p></sec><sec id="sec6-1740774510396387"><title>Recruitment and consent</title><p>Recruitment took place by telephone in the summer prior to college
                        matriculation. Prior to the first telephone contact, a detailed consent form
                        and introductory letter were mailed to potential participants. For students
                        who were under 18 years of age during the recruitment phase, an assent form
                        as well as a parental permission letter was sent in lieu of the standard
                        consent form. Upon telephone contact, interested parents and students (ages
                        18 and older) were asked to provide oral consent and complete the baseline
                        assessment over the telephone. Students who were 17 years old were required
                        to provide oral assent and parental consent over the telephone. In-person
                        consent was waived because recruitment took place before the students
                        arrived on campus. IRB approval for oral consent was obtained in accordance
                        with 45 CFR 46 &#x02018;Protection of Human Subjects,&#x02019; Section
                        46.117 c.2.</p><p>Given the power differential between parent and child, we chose to recruit
                        students prior to parents to minimize intentional or unintentional parental
                        pressure. All participants were informed that their participation was
                        voluntary, and students were paid for their baseline participation
                        regardless of parent recruitment. Confidentiality procedures did not
                        guarantee complete anonymity for study participation due to recruitment of
                        family members within the same household.</p><p>In an effort to recruit a gender-balanced parent sample, a mother or father
                        was randomly chosen as the initial recruitment target. If the pre-determined
                        parent was unwilling or unavailable, another parent was accepted for
                        recruitment (regardless of gender). We took this approach because fathers
                        have been under-represented in parent-based alcohol interventions with
                        college students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1740774510396387">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1740774510396387">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1740774510396387">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1740774510396387">30</xref>].

                        information designed to raise parental awareness of college student alcohol
                        use and provide strategies to help reduce student drinking and associated
                        consequences. These strategies included increasing parent&#x02013;teen

                        this letter would encourage all parents to read the materials and provide us
                        with feedback. The evaluation form served as our primary measure of
                        intervention fidelity and assessed readability, usefulness, and clarity of

                    frequently they engaged in HED; (2) whether and how often they experienced
                    alcohol-related negative consequences; and (3) hypothesized intervention
                    mediators. Because our study was designed to enroll students with a range of
                    alcohol-related experiences, our data contained a large proportion of zero
                    values (i.e., students who did not drink) in addition to data reflecting very
                    heavy drinking. To address this skew in our data distribution, we chose to
                    conduct our analysis using two-part latent growth curve-modeling. This technique
                    is well suited to address the heterogeneity arising from zero-inflated data by
                    simultaneously creating two correlated models from a single outcome variable;
                    one model for the binary (onset) portion and one model for continuous (rate of
                    change) portion of the variable&#x02019;s distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1740774510396387">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1740774510396387">36</xref>]. In Part 1 (the binary portion),
                    the outcome variable is modeled as a random-effects logistic growth model with
                    the log odds of use regressed on growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1740774510396387">37</xref>]. In Part 2 (the continuous
                    portion), the non-zero continuous frequency of the outcome is modeled using the
                    latent growth model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1740774510396387">38</xref>]. For this study, the binary part of the model estimated growth
                    in onset of HED or consequences (coded as 0 and 1). The continuous part of the
                    model estimated change in the frequency of HED or consequences for drinkers who
                    initially reported one or more instances of these behaviors.</p><p>An important advantage of the two-part model approach over the censored normal
                    model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1740774510396387">39</xref>] for

                    estimate the unique effects of covariates on each of the two parts even when
                    they are correlated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1740774510396387">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1740774510396387">38</xref>].
                    Two-part latent growth models, therefore, enable the separate evaluation of
                    intervention, mediating, and covarying factors on onset and growth of outcome
                    variables. Thus, we were able to determine whether our interventions affected
                    mediators and whether the mediators affected change in onset and growth of
                    outcome variables. We estimated the effects of the brief motivational
                    intervention, the parent-based intervention, and their interaction on all
                    10-month mediators regardless of an overall intervention effect to determine
                    whether the intervention significantly changed the hypothesized mediator(s) in
                    the desired direction and whether the mediator subsequently was related to the
                    outcome measure in the predicted direction. This analysis is especially
                    important for discovering unexpected relationships that may mask an overall

                limitations of this trial. In attempting to evaluate potential explanations for null
                and modest intervention effects, several design issues initially considered in the
                planning of this trial, re-emerged. Chief among these include questions were: (1)
                did assessment reactivity take place among parents and/or students? (2) did our
                assessment schedule miss critical short-term intervention effects?; and (3) were our
                interventions delivered with fidelity? We also have considered how these questions
                could have been answered with alternative experimental designs and study
                procedures.</p><p>The potential for assessment reactivity to attenuate or mask intervention effects is
                a serious and common problem in clinical research and is especially problematic when
                the size of intervention effects is modest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1740774510396387">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1740774510396387">43</xref>]. We believe our assessment protocol,
                which included an in-depth assessment of process-related variables at baseline, may
                have potentially masked parent-based intervention effects by motivating
                control-group parents to engage in behavior that may have reduced alcohol use among
                students. Previous research has sought to avoid this issue through the use of a
                post-test only comparison design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1740774510396387">30</xref>]. We opted for a pre-test post-test
                design in order to better model change over time. However, to disentangle
                intervention and assessment effects, an alternative study design is necessary, such
                as the Solomon Four Group Design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1740774510396387">44</xref>] which crosses two intervention arms
                with baseline assessment (Yes/No). However, in most large clinical trials this
                approach is prohibitively expensive and impractical. Newer, more efficient, methods
                for evaluating assessment reactivity are available which involve including
                &#x02018;planned missingness&#x02019; in the assessment design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1740774510396387">45</xref>].</p><p>Another aspect of our study design that deserves consideration is assessment timing.
                In the social sciences assessment, timing is often dictated by convenience or
                tradition rather than empirically based expectations regarding intervention effect
                periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1740774510396387">46</xref>]. We reviewed
                relevant research and found that intervention efficacy was well documented through a
                6-month follow-up period for brief motivational interventions, with several
                exceptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1740774510396387">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1740774510396387">48</xref>]. For this reason, we
                decided to focus on longer term outcome assessments to determine whether these
                interventions could produce lasting change. The use of lengthy assessments coupled
                with generous and increasing participation incentives enabled strong tests of the
                primary and secondary aims but used a large proportion of study resources, thus
                limiting our ability to afford a short-term assessment. Upon completion of this
                trial, we believe our null findings reflect a failure to capture critical periods of
                short-term intervention effects that decayed over time. Therefore, we recommend
                using three follow-up time points in combination with a baseline assessment to
                detect long-term and short-term, potentially transient, intervention effects and to
                model non-linear (e.g., quadratic, piecewise) effects.</p><p>Our lack of objective intervention fidelity measures is an additional limitation of
                this trial. Subjective measures of intervention fidelity employed by this study
                indicated the interventions were delivered as intended, but a lack of objective
                measures limits the strength of our inferences. Consistent with prior research
                    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1740774510396387">30</xref>], our parent
                handbook evaluation asked parents whether they read and understood the intervention
                materials. Parents may have provided socially desirable responses; the non-anonymous
                nature of the assessment may have exacerbated this effect. Similarly, participants
                in the brief motivational intervention were asked about clinician qualities and
                intervention components. Although their responses were collected anonymously after
                sessions, the possibility of subjective biases cannot be ruled out. In fact, our
                measures of intervention fidelity were relatively high and invariant across all
                categories for both interventions suggesting the possibility of social desirability
                and ceiling effects.</p><p>Ideally, future studies should examine the quality of intervention delivery using
                objective means, such as delivering the handbook online and tracking parent access.
                In terms of the brief motivational intervention, future trials should audio or
                video-record sessions and have them coded by at least two independent reviewers.
                Detailed, more objective procedures for assessing brief motivational intervention
                fidelity are available and increasingly expected in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1740774510396387">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1740774510396387">50</xref>]. Nonetheless, our supervision approach
                and the brief motivational intervention training we employed have been used in
                previous randomized controlled trials that obtained very good estimates of

                factorial design capable of testing unique and combined effects of two potentially
                complementary interventions and the implementation of novel data-analytic techniques
                uniquely suited to our data. Limitations included our inability to explicate the
                extent to which assessment reactivity or the length of our follow-up interval may
                help explain the lack of support for some study hypotheses.</p><p>In terms of study successes, a large sample of students and parents were recruited
                prior to college matriculation. Consistent with other research works, the use of
                monetary ballooning incentives and a highly trained survey center was likely
                integral to recruitment and long-term retention success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1740774510396387">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1740774510396387">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1740774510396387">54</xref>]. Intervention administration and
                participation were also high. Abstainers and drinkers were willing to attend
                in-person interventions and parents were willing to read mailed intervention
                materials and return evaluation forms. These participation and retention rates
                should encourage future researchers who attempt to use similar techniques and study
                similar populations. By including abstainers in our study, we were able to examine
                intervention effects among an at-risk but understudied group. The data complexity,
                the abstainers introduced (e.g., a high-zero count) was handled using latent growth
                curve modeling as an alternative to traditional data transformation. As published
                examples of two-part latent growth curve modeling are limited, interested readers
                are directed to our outcomes paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1740774510396387">42</xref>] and other published studies using this
                technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1740774510396387">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1740774510396387">38</xref>].</p><p>In summary, the choice of experimental and quasi-experimental designs in randomized
                controlled trials is a complex, multi-faceted endeavor with inevitable tradeoffs. We
                hope that consideration of the lessons we have learned and presented will benefit
                those who undertake similar research in the future.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="sec20-1740774510396387"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Transitions Study Research team for their assistance, particularly, Rosa
