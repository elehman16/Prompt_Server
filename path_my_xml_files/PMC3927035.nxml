Muscle weakening in elderly
persons, and the accompanying difficulties they have with daily activities reflect the
progress of aging. Balance control ability is hampered by such muscle weakening or such
functional restrictions and the risk of falls increases<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Daily activities may be
restricted due to the fear of falls resulting in functional loss, which may further increase
the risk of falls. As a result, activities gradually decrease, leading to a deterioration in
the quality of life and mental well-being of elderly persons<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. If elderly persons have a regular exercise regime, their gait,
balance, and muscle strength will improve and their ability to perform exercise will
increase, leading to the enhancement of their functional abilities. Therefore, balance
training can improve elderly persons&#x02019; stability and reduce the risk of falls<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Hippotherapy has a long history as a treatment and rehabilitation method and has recently
come to the fore as a therapeutic technique for the improvement of balance control. During
hippotherapy, the patient not only controls balance through active movements, but also
promotes balance control is promoted as a response to the horse&#x02019;s movements. The patient is
mediated by the horse to control abnormal muscle tones and movement patterns, improve trunk
balance control and gait, and enhance balance and sensory integration<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is hypothesized that hippotherapy can enhance the
balance and therefore the functions of elderly people and prevent falls. However, studies of
hippotherapy for elderly persons are lacking. Therefore, this study examined the effects of
hippotherapy on elderly persons&#x02019; static balance and gait.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted with 30 elderly persons residing in the community in Gyeonggi-do

The selection criteria for the subjects were as follows: at least 65&#x02005;years
old, no falls within the last year, and no disease that might have affected the
hippotherapy. Those who had visual impairment, hearing damage, nervous system or vestibular
organ problems, or were unable to understand the nature of the experiment were excluded. All
the subjects understood the purpose of this study and provided their written informed
consent prior to their participation in the study in accordance with the ethical standards
of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The subjects were divided into a hippotherapy group of 15 subjects and a treadmill group of
15 subjects, and training was carried out by both groups in 20-minute sessions, three times
per week for 12 weeks. During the training eight subjects decided to pull out of the
experiment. In every session of hippotherapy, the horse walked around a 30&#x02005;m diameter circle
20 times to the right and 20 times to the left in the 20 minutes. In each session, the
treadmill training began at a minimum speed 0.1 of&#x02005;km/hour, and subjects progressed to their
individual maximum speeds, which they maintained for 20 minutes. To measure subjects&#x02019; static
balance ability before and after the intervention, each subject was instructed to stand on a
BPM (software 5.3, SMS Healthcare Inc., UK) while looking straight ahead with his or her
eyes open for 30 seconds, and the sway path length was measured. To measure the subjects&#x02019;
dynamic balance ability, their step lengths and step times were measured using an AP1105
(GaitRite CIR, USA). All measurement results are expressed as the mean&#x000b1; standard
deviation.</p><p>SPSS for Windows (version 18.0) was used to analyze the data. The paired t-test was used to
examine pre- and post-intervention differences, and the independent t-test was used to
examine differences between the groups. The statistical significance level was chosen as &#x003b1; =
0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>After the intervention, step lengths increased significantly (p &#x0003c; 0.05), and step time

among elderly persons. Elderly persons have poorer balance ability than younger adults and
thus have a higher risk of falls<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. They
also have shorter step lengths and slower step speeds<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. These slow steps cause instability and falls and thus step length
decreases to compensate for the slow steps<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. During gait, temporary instability occurs when the body is
supported by one foot and balance recovery occurs on the stepping foot to restore the COG
(center of gravity) to within the range of the BOS (base of support). Step length increases
demonstrate that balance control ability has improved, and balance can be recovered from
larger angles when instability increases as the COG moves during gait. Step-speed increases
can be regarded as a sign of an increased response to control balance<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, increases in step length and step speed increase
the ability to cope with the risk of falls when balance has been lost. Step length increased
significantly and step time decreased significantly after eight weeks of intervention in
both the hippotherapy group and the treadmill group. Since decreases in step time mean
increases in step speed, these results indicate that the risk of falls decreased in both
groups.</p><p>Liston et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> found that when postural
sway tests were conducted, the elderly persons tested showed lower risks of falls than those
who did not undergo the tests and those who showed shorter sway path lengths showed lower
risks of falls. Fujita et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> measured
postural sway path length in relation to age, and reported that elderly persons showed
longer sway path lengths than young adults. The sway path lengths were proportional to age,
and age and effective postural control were inversely proportionate to each other. Tucker et
al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> said that those who experienced
many falls showed larger ranges of postural sway and slower, more inefficient balance
responses than those who had no experience of falls; thus they had higher risks of falls.
Thus, a large range of sway indicates ineffective postural control and a high risk of falls.
In this study sway path lengths decreased significantly after eight weeks of intervention in
both groups. Therefore, we conclude that both groups gained improvements in static balance,
with the hippotherapy group showing larger effects. We believe that this difference is
because hippotherapy is composed of more dynamic upward-downward, leftward-rightward, and
forward-backward movements of the horse than treadmill exercises, which results in greater
promotion of dynamic postural responses.</p><p>The limitations of this study include the fact that the number of subjects was small, thus
the results cannot be extrapolated to all elderly persons. In addition, the length of time
over which the balance and gait abilities of the elderly persons can be maintained after
improvement through hippotherapy needs to be evaluated in follow-up tests.</p><p>The need for ways to prevent elderly persons&#x02019; falls and to improve their balance ability is
growing as society is aging. Hippotherapy may be an effective method for improving elderly
persons&#x02019; balance abilities and preventing falls.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Duncan</surname><given-names>PW</given-names></name><name><surname>Studenski</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Chandler</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Functional reach: predictive validity in a sample of
