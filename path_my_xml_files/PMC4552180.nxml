On arrival, a peripheral venous catheter was inserted into the left antecubital fossa. After 30&#x02009;minutes of resting supine baseline endothelial function was assessed by brachial artery FMD as described below. Following successful acquisition of baseline FMD measurements, a marker was placed over the skin where the linear transducer ultrasound probe was located to ensure repeat FMD measurements were taken at the same segment of the brachial artery. Agitated saline injection was then performed during echocardiography using the Vivid-7 ultrasound platform (General Electric Healthcare, UK) with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position. A four-chamber view was optimised to focus on the left and right atrium. Agitated saline, created by agitating a mixture of 0.5&#x02009;ml of air and 8&#x02009;ml of saline, was injected intravenously by a second operator (HF). Inter-atrial shunting of microbubbles was confirmed when more than five bubbles were demonstrated in the left atrium within seven cardiac cycles following complete opacification of the right heart. If shunting was not demonstrated agitated saline injection was repeated during a valsalva manoeuvre for 10&#x02009;seconds before injection of agitated saline. Upon complete opacification of the right atrium the patient was asked to release the valsalva manoeuvre. Microbubble shunting was confirmed as described above. Up to a maximum of five valsalva manoeuvres with agitated saline injection were repeated and the procedure was stopped as soon as shunting was demonstrated. For PFO+ patients, an average of three valsalva manoeuvres with agitated saline injections was required to demonstrate inter-atrial microbubble shunting. The subject then returned to the supine position with the same right brachial artery segment imaged for FMD at 20, 40 and 60&#x02009;minutes after demonstration of microbubble shunting.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-2048004015601564"><title>Cross-over study in PFO&#x02013; and PFO+ patients</title><p>All patients: PFO&#x02212; (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;10) and PFO+ (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;14, including those in the time course study) participated in a cross-over study to control for possible confounding effects of repeated measures of FMD and to determine whether response to agitated saline injection was specific to PFO+ patients. FMD responses were assessed on two visits performed in random order separated by seven days. On visit 1 (no intervention), FMD was measured before and after no intervention or a valsalva manoeuvre (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;5, PFO+ patients) without injection of agitated saline. On visit 2 (agitated saline), FMD was measured before and after injection of agitated saline and demonstration of microbubble formation in PFO+ patients as described in the time course study. PFO&#x02212; status was confirmed when inter-atrial microbubbles shunting was not demonstrated following at least five agitated saline injections with valsalva manoeuvre.

After visualisation of the artery, the transducer was secured in place by a stereotactic probe holder and a baseline scan is performed. Reactive hyperaemia was then induced by inflation of a pneumatic tourniquet placed around the forearm (distal to the arterial segment being scanned) to a pressure of 250&#x02009;mmHg for five minutes, followed by release. The images were recorded continuously for one minute at baseline, five minutes during cuff inflation and five minutes post cuff deflation. Images were digitised for subsequent analysis. The diameter of the brachial artery was determined using semi-automated edge detection software (Brachial Analyser, Medical Imaging Applications, LCC, Iowa, USA). FMD was expressed as the percentage increase in brachial artery diameter from baseline to maximal dilation, which occurs in all patients at 30 to 90&#x02009;seconds after release of the cuff.</p></sec><sec id="sec6-2048004015601564"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Subject characteristics are summarised as means&#x02009;&#x000b1; &#x02009;SD and results as means&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SEM.

This effect is mediated by a relatively large number of bubbles rapidly accessing the arterial system and did not occur in the absence of an atrial level communication. Microbubbles had to be present for the impairment of endothelial function to occur and were not reproduced in control studies or subjects with a PFO in whom no agitated saline was used.</p><p>Systemic venous microbubbles occurring following diving and during medical procedures such as bypass surgery and haemodialysis are usually removed from the body by passage through the pulmonary circulation and expiration. The presence of an inter-atrial communication may allow this mechanism to be bypassed permitting the microbubbles to exert effects directly upon the arterial circulation. Animal studies have suggested that systemic arterial microbubbles may directly trigger acute endothelial dysfunction leading to a pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic state. However, this process is less well defined in human <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> studies.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2048004015601564" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-2048004015601564" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Coronary artery bypass surgery and haemodialysis have been associated with peripheral and central endothelial dysfunction.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2048004015601564" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="bibr14-2048004015601564" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr15-2048004015601564" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> This is believed to be a risk factor for vascular disease and the mechanism of the phenomenon has not been fully characterised. In the context of scuba diving, it has been shown that a reduction or impairment of endothelial function occurred following a single dive, which was prevented by pre-treatment with antioxidants such as Vitamin C.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2048004015601564" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="bibr17-2048004015601564" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr18-2048004015601564" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr19-2048004015601564" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> More recently, Vince et&#x000a0;al.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2048004015601564" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> detected a significant rise of VCAM-1 associated endothelial microparticles following a single dive in humans suggesting endothelial activation and/or apoptosis.</p><p>The current study aimed to explore the effects of injected microbubbles in order to study the time course of any outcome in a controlled environment. This model more closely equates to medical interventions than decompression illness where the supersaturation of all the tissues may be relevant to the pathophysiology of the condition. Within this protocol, the studies were performed under normobaric, normoxic condition, and this might explain the smaller degree and relatively short-lived alteration in endothelial function when compared to previous studies carried out under hyperbaric conditions with tissue supersaturation of microbubbles.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-2048004015601564" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> However, the current study cannot infer that a similar rapid recovery would occur in the setting of nitrogen-saturated peripheral tissues as found following diving. Since FMD is thought to be mediated through release of endothelium nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) derived nitric oxide (NO),<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2048004015601564" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> microbubbles may have a direct or indirect effect on NO bioavailability. The current study cannot determine whether the reduced bioavailability of NO is through reduced production, increased inactivation, a diminished response to available NO or a combination of these. In animal models, however, microbubbles have been shown to mediate a direct mechanical damage on the microvasculature and also induce acute endothelial dysfunction through the effects of increased oxidative stress on the vascular endothelium leading to activation of leucocyte, complement and clotting cascade systems.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2048004015601564" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><p>There are a number of limitations to our study, which are particularly relevant when considering it as a model of decompression illness, although less so in the setting of medical interventions. FMD is a marker of conduit artery rather than microvascular endothelial function and it is likely that the latter is the predominate site of abnormalities in some conditions, particularly such as decompression illness. Although impairment of FMD usually occurs in parallel with microvascular endothelial dysfunction, this cannot necessarily be inferred from the present study. The present studies were performed without prior hyperbaric conditions and therefore cannot mimic the inert gas supersaturation at the tissue level that occurs with diving and further studies are required to investigate the interaction between of microbubbles in human vascular endothelium in this setting. Due to the nature of the individuals undergoing clinical investigation for inter-atrial shunts, some subjects in these studies had established vascular risk factors. It is unlikely that these altered the results as similar effects were seen in all subjects and the cross-over nature of the protocol ensured individuals acted as their own control, however, this cannot be excluded.</p><p>In conclusion, this study shows that the passage of microbubbles into the arterial system through a right to left shunt at the atrial level leads to an acute deterioration in conduit artery endothelial function. As PFO is common in the general population, the results of our present study may have significant implications for understanding vascular function following diving and medical procedures involving exposure to microbubbles such as during cardiopulmonary bypass and haemodialysis. Further studies are needed to examine the mechanism of these pathological effects of microbubbles on the microcirculation and possible interventions that may protect against microbubble-induced endothelial dysfunction.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="sec19-2048004015601564"><title>Declaration of conflicting interests</title><p>The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></sec><sec id="sec20-2048004015601564"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by a British Heart Foundation Clinical Research Training Fellowship [FS/11/11/28634] to Dr Fok.
