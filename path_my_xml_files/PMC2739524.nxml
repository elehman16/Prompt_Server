Although there is a trend towards the concept of "Damage Control Orthopedics" (DCO) in the management of multiple trauma patients with long bone fractures as reflected by a significant increase in primary external fixation of femur fractures, current literature is insufficient. Thus, in the era of "evidence-based medicine", there is the need for a more specific, clarifying trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The trial is designed as a randomized controlled open-label multicenter study. Multiple trauma patients with femur shaft fractures and a calculated probability of death between 20 and 60% will be randomized to either temporary fracture fixation with fixateur externe and defined secondary definitive treatment (DCO) or primary reamed nailing (early total care). The primary objective is to reduce the extent of organ failure as measured by the maximum sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SOFA) score.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The Damage Control Study is the first to evaluate the risk adapted damage control orthopedic surgery concept of femur shaft fractures in multiple trauma patients in a randomized controlled design. The trial investigates the differences in clinical outcome of two currently accepted different ways of treating multiple trauma patients with femoral shaft fractures. This study will help to answer the question whether the "early total care" or the &#x0201e;damage control&#x0201d; concept is associated with better outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN10321620</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Trauma is a major medical and economical issue of health care systems today and the leading cause of death between the age of 1 and 45 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The World Health Organization assumes that death caused by accidents, violence and war will even increase until 2020. The implications for the society are serious, as most of the trauma victims are young and at the beginning of their careers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Fractures of the long bones and femur fractures in particular are common in multiple trauma patients, but the optimal management of femur fractures in these patients is not yet resolved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In principle, there are five methods for the treatment of these fractures: cast, extension, external fracture fixation with fixateur externe, and internal fixation with either intramedullary nail or plate osteosynthesis.</p><p>Of the five possibilities of treating femoral fractures, cast or extension therapy was considered standard therapy for long bone fractures in multiply injured patients in the 1960s, but this strategy gradually became obsolete. Observational studies showed that mortality rates were reduced by initial fracture stabilization, independent of the procedure performed (fixateur externe, nail or plate). This led to a new standard therapeutic concept for long bone fracture treatment in multiple trauma patients from the mid 1980s on, termed "early total care" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>But, the question remained whether primary internal (nail/plate) or external fixation (fixateur externe) is advantageous for this patient population, especially in high risk patients with additional chest or head injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. While nailing (in contrast to plate osteosynthesis) is considered the gold standard for treatment of isolated femur shaft fractures because of its undeniable advantage of weight-bearing structure, it is compromised by the significant distress caused by operation time, blood loss, and insertion of the nail, which may act as a "second hit". Studies comparing reamed and unreamed intramedullary nails show the superiority of the reamed nail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, advocates of temporary external fixation in multiple trauma patients assert its simplicity with regard to initial treatment, as well as hypothetic advantages regarding patient security with less blood loss and possible reduction in systemic response as well as mortality in specific subgroups of trauma patients, e.g. with additional chest or head injuries. However, hypothetic disadvantages of temporary external fixation must also be considered: planned additional surgery for the secondary definitive procedure with prolonged mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit (ICU) stay, planned additional burden for the patient at secondary surgery, increased infection rates by conversion of external to internal fixation, a certain number of patients in which a conversion will not be possible resulting in impaired functional results, moreover the planned conversion within the first days after trauma may also act as a "second hit" to the patient. The optimal time for conversion from external fixation to a definitive procedure is not clear in patients treated with temporary external fixation and secondary intramedullary nailing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>With respect to the question of "early total care" or temporary fracture fixation by fixateur externe in <italic>all </italic>multiple trauma patients regardless of their anatomic or physiologic injury severity the literature presents a diversity of studies supporting different views. Both a recently published evidence based guideline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] as well as a current systematic literature review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] could neither clarify the optimal time point nor procedure of femoral fracture fixation in multiple trauma patients. In addition, an analysis of the German Trauma Registry including more than 8000 multiple trauma patients showed that management differs widely and depends on both the individual hospital strategy as well as on patient/trauma characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>In this respect increasing literature evidence suggests that neither "early total care" nor temporary external fixation with secondary definitive internal osteosynthesis should be considered as standard therapy in <italic>all </italic>patients. Instead, decision making should be dependent on the patient's individual risk by its anatomic, physiologic and immunologic injury severity (risk adapted damage control concept): patients with a low mortality risk can be treated by primary definitive fracture fixation while patients at a higher mortality risk should be treated by damage control in the sense of temporary fracture fixation with a fixateur externe and later secondary definitive treatment when the patients' physiologic and immunological situation has been stabilized on the ICU.</p><p>Criteria, which have been recommended by various authors in order to define patients, in whom early definitive osteosynthesis might be disadvantageous are named in table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].

The validated system for internet randomization will be provided by the Coordinating Center for Clinical Studies Cologne (KKSK).

In addition the TRISS score will be used to describe injury severity. A fourth more recent score will also be used to describe the severity of trauma. This score, the revised injury severity classification (RISC) score, includes nine variables and has been shown to have very good prognostic capacity. However, as the RISC requires more variables (some of which may not be available in the emergency room quickly), this score will only be used for explorative adjustment of analyses.</p><p>In addition to these variables, standard demographic parameters (gender, body mass index, etc.), further physiologic variables (heart rate, temperature, etc.), routine laboratory results on admission (hemoglobin, leukocytes, creatinine, etc.), comorbidities (liver cirrhosis, immunosuppression, renal insufficiency, acute myocardial infarction, etc.) and medical management before randomisation (volume loading in the field and in the emergency room, need for thoracic drainage, radiographs done on admission, etc.) will be recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Prior and Concomitant Therapy</title><p>All concomitant surgical and non-surgical therapy is allowed and key aspects (ventilation, surgery etc.) will be recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><sec><title>Primary efficacy endpoint</title><p>Primary endpoint is the reduction of organ failure as measured by the maximum SOFA score within 28 days after trauma.</p><p>The SOFA score has been developed for the sequential evaluation and description of organ failure and has been shown to be a suitable indicator of prognosis in trauma patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. For the present trial, the 5 item SOFA score (exluding CNS) will be used. The central nervous system (CNS) will be excluded due to the known problems in receiving valid data from patients who were intubated and ventilated. Thus the maximum SOFA score will be 20 points (4 points for each organ).</p><p>The SOFA score will be assessed daily for the first 28 days after trauma (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Documentation will start on ICU and will be continued until the patient is returned to a normal ward, where the SOFA score will be set to zero. If the patient is discharged home within the first 28 days, SOFA score is set to zero by definition. If the patient is transferred to another hospital, the last observation will be continued until day 28. Patients who died during the first 28 days after trauma will be assigned the maximum possible SOFA score (20 points) for each day after death.</p><p>From the daily assessment of SOFA score, the worst value within the first 28 days will be used as primary endpoint. This corresponds to the intuitive mechanism of reducing the "second hit" which is induced by the operative trauma.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary endpoints</title><p>&#x02022; Hospital mortality</p><p>&#x02022; Cumulative organ failure = sum of SOFA score points for the first 28 days</p><p>&#x02022; Incidence of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)</p><p>&#x02022; Incidence of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis during ICU stay</p><p>&#x02022; Quantity and duration of surgical interventions, anaesthetics, and costs of surgery (material, time)</p><p>&#x02022; Length of ICU stay</p><p>&#x02022; Length of hospital stay</p><p>&#x02022; Number of ventilator-free days</p><p>&#x02022; Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System (TISS) 28 during ICU stay</p><p>&#x02022; Rate of phlegmona of the medullary cavity</p><p>&#x02022; Rate in which conversion to internal fixation was not possible (DCO group only)</p><p>&#x02022; Rate of pseudarthrosis</p><p>&#x02022; Functional outcome at discharge, 6 and 12 months after trauma</p><p>&#x02022; Quality of life at 6 and 12 months after trauma (determined by POLO chart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>])</p><p>&#x02022; Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at discharge, 6 and 12 months after trauma</p><p>&#x02022; Return to work</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Adverse events</title><p>All adverse events (AE) during hospital stay will be documented for both study groups.

Serious adverse events will be reported to the Principle Coordinating Investigator as soon as possible, at the latest within 24 hours.</p><p>Possible complications of the risk-adaptive treatment (&#x0201e;damage control orthopedics&#x0201d;, DCO):</p><p>Since there are at least two interventions in this treatment arm, there is a hypothetical higher risk of infection in these patients, longer ventilation time, and a certain rate of patients in whom no change from fixateur externe to intramedullary nail is possible and thus, resulting in a higher rate of pseudarthrosis, worse functional result, delayed weight bearing and lower quality of life.</p><p>Complications of the primary definitive treatment are primarily the hypothetically higher mortality, increase in duration and rate of SIRS, sepsis and/or multi organ failure (MOF).</p><p>Expected Adverse Events</p><p>Complications of surgery include:</p><p>&#x02022; Infection</p><p>&#x02022; Delayed healing</p><p>&#x02022; Bleeding</p><p>&#x02022; Nerve injury</p><p>&#x02022; Tendon and muscle injury</p><p>&#x02022; Thrombosis/embolism</p><p>&#x02022; Pseudarthrosis</p><p>&#x02022; Compartment syndrome</p></sec><sec><title>Proposed sample size/Power calculations</title><p>The primary hypothesis is that the damage control principle is able to reduce the extent of organ failure. Organ failure is measured daily by the SOFA score (five organs, excluding CNS, 0-4 points per organ). The maximum SOFA score during ICU stay is used as primary outcome measure. It is assumed that the maximum SOFA score could be reduced by 1-2 points. This corresponds to a reduction from "organ failure" to "organ dysfunction", or from "organ dysfunction" to "normal organ function" for one organ. Data from Ferreira et al. indicate that a 2 point increase in SOFA score correlates with an average 10% increase in mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. According to the database of the Deutsche Interdisziplin&#x000e4;re Vereinigung Intensivmedizin (DIVI; quality assessment in intensive care; 45.000 admissions 2000-2004) maximum SOFA score is about 3.2 &#x000b1; 3.2 in a general ICU population, and 3.3 &#x000b1; 3.1 in emergency admissions with trauma. Thus the estimated effect (1.5 points reduction) corresponds to a standardized effect size of 0.5. Assuming usual error rates (a = 0.05; b = 0.20), 64 patients per group would be required. However, due to the non-normal nature of the distribution and the use of non-parametric statistics, the number of patients to be randomized has to be increased by 10%. Thus, the total sample size is set to 140 patients (70 per group). Compliance and rate of loss to follow-up do not affect primary outcome measures.</p></sec><sec><title>Feasibility of recruitment</title><p>According to the Trauma Registry of the DGU (1993 - 2004, n = 20.815), 12% of multiple trauma cases had a fracture of the femoral shaft. The limitation to patients with ISS &#x02265; 16 does not change this rate. A level 1 trauma center treats 50-100 severe trauma patients each year (as observed in the German Trauma Registry). Thus, 15 participating centers will be able to screen at least 1000 patients per year. The number of appropriate patients with femur shaft fractures is 6 - 12 per year per center. Regarding the fact that not every case could be included due to organisational difficulties, only about half of these cases will be included and randomized.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The main outcome variable is the maximum SOFA score during ICU stay. In order to have comparable periods, the time period for SOFA score assessment is limited to the first 28 days after trauma. Documentation of daily SOFA scores is continued in intermediate care or other high dependency units.</p><p>The maximum SOFA score will be compared using non-parametric statistics (U-test) due to the substantial skewness of the distribution. Since severity of trauma is assumed to be a major determinant of outcome (including rate of organ failure) the comparability regarding Injury Severity Score (ISS) is tested before analysis. In case of substantial imbalance (p &#x0003c; 0.15; U-test) a stratified analysis of outcome will be performed (two groups; ISS &#x02264;/&#x0003e; 30 points).</p><p>Analysis will be done according to intention to treat; regarding to the per protocol (PP) analysis we expect the PP-population to be 5% less.</p><p>There will be one interim analysis of data collection when about half of the expected sample size has been included (70 cases). The p-value for the interim analysis will be set at 0.005 so that the final analysis will be done at a significance level of 0.048, according to Fleming and O'Brien [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>During interim and final analysis, a detailed safety analysis will be performed by comparing predicted and observed survival within each group and reviewing individual cases of non-survivors.</p><p>In addition, all secondary endpoints mentioned in the protocol will be considered for explorative analysis, because these factors are repeatedly named in the discussion about the advantages of damage control orthopedics. The aim of presenting all these data is not a confirmative statistical testing, but rather to serve as a basis for comparative analyses in future meta-analyses regarding damage control orthopedics versus early total care strategies.</p><p>The hospital perspective on costs includes the initial and all secondary operations or readmissions until one year after randomization. As most costs during hospital stay are caused by surgery itself and ICU care, data collection and statistical analysis will focus on these two aspects. The results will be reported as a cost-effectiveness analysis using life-years lost as the measure of treatment benefit. These analyses will employ decision-analytic models for the optimum management of multiply injured patients with femoral shaft fracture.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial organization</title><p>Prof. Dr. med.

Clear evidence for the superiority of one of the strategies does not exist. Nowadays, patients with multiple trauma are treated either with primary external fixation or primary internal nail fixation in the sense of early total care or risk adapted damage control. Which of these two principles will be performed often depends on the general hospital strategy. To give a clear cut picture: which treatment will be applicated depends on the hospital the patient enters by chance, the surgeon on duty by chance, as well as patient characteristics.</p><p>Participating centers must be trauma level I centers with great experience in multiple trauma care. Both strategies must be established in the hospital, the operating surgeon must be experienced in both strategies as well. Only patients are enrolled in whom both strategies can be performed and only if the surgeon is capable to perform both strategies in this particular patient. The surgeon is allowed to switch the treatment if there are technical or medical reasons for this.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics Committee (EC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB)</title><p>The final study protocol, including the final version of the written informed consent form, was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Cologne, who is responsible for the Clinical Principal Investigator before commencement of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical Conduct of the Study</title><p>The study is conducted according to ICH-GCP (International Conference on Harmonisation for Good Clinical Practice in clinical research), as set out in the European Union Clinical Trials Directive (2001) and associated UK Regulations (2004), which adhere to the principles of the Helsinki Declaration.</p><p>Particular aspects are the study protocol, patient information sheet, informed consent form, submission to EC, administrative documents, data registration, registration of adverse events, preparation for inspection and internal audit by authorized personal or the DSMB, and storage of study documents.</p><p>Before inclusion (i. e. before randomization or any other study specific procedure is undertaken), patients will be informed about the trial. However, it is expected that at time of admission, the majority of patients suitable to participate in this trial will not be able to give consent due to the severity of their injuries and/or the nature of prehospital therapy (i.e. intubation). If this situation occurs, informed consent could only be obtained from the patient's legally authorized representative. In the event that the patient's legally authorized representative is not available, the patient can be enrolled under waiver of informed consent. This way of enrollment requires a "Physician Authorization Form", where an independent physician and an impartial witness confirm by signature that all above-mentioned regulations were adhered to. The waiver of informed consent also requires that there is no clue either from the patient's side or from the family members objecting against trial enrollment. The Physician Authorization Form will also be signed by the investigator.</p><p>This process of enrollment using the waiver of informed consent is in accordance with German law and international standards of research. Due to the urgency of surgical treatment, it is not possible to obtain informed consent from a legal representative appointed by jurisdiction (i.e. Vormundschaftsgericht). It also is impossible to inform the general public about the trial through public notifications.</p><p>The patient will be informed about the trial as soon as possible and will be asked to sign the applicable informed consent form to continue participation in the trial. This consent (or its withdrawal thereof) supersede the authority of any previous authorization for trial enrollment.</p><p>Patient information will be updated if new relevant information gets available changing the risk-benefit assessment.

But, evidence from the current literature is insufficient. As discussed above, results are contradictory, a generalized management strategy is missing. Thus, in the era of "evidence-based medicine", there is the need for a more specific, clarifying randomized controlled trial. Therefore this new trial was initiated.</p><p>To our knowledge, this trial is the first to evaluate the risk adapted damage control orthopedic surgery of femur shaft fracutres in multiple trauma patients in a randomized controlled design. In 2003, Pape et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] presented their results of a randomized controlled trial. They investigated the impact of intramedullary instrumentation versus damage control for femoral fractures on immunoinflammatory parameters and complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. But, in contrast to this study, where a risk adaption is performed, they excluded multiple trauma patients with severe brain and thoracic injuries (AIS &#x0003e; 3) and patients in unstable or critical condition, too. In summary, the included patients were injured less severely. Furthermore, Pape et al. did not define criteria that must be fulfilled for performing the secondary definitive procedure. Therefore these two trials are not comparable in the authors' opinion.</p><p>Since there is still no clear evidence for the superiority of one of the strategies participation in the trial is not associated with an increased risk by itself. If one of the strategies proves superiority the benefit (reducing the organ failure) is evident. The main endpoint is a surrogate endpoint for mortality, i. e. the trial may lead to a definite treatment strategy in patients with multiple trauma lowering the overall mortality. If non-inferiority of the primary internal fixation can be proven, it can be assumed that hospital stay, number of operations etc. are lower in this group, thus lowering the expenses.</p><p>Although mortality would have been the most appreciated endpoint, a trial with mortality as the main endpoint would need approximately 1300 patients per arm. In addition to the fact that such a trial is almost undoable for practical reasons the concentration on mortality does not cover all aspects of the planned intervention since the damage control approach primarily tries to limit the sequelae of the "second hit" by surgical intervention. This is reflected by the measurement of organ failure by appointing maximum values for patients who died. The SOFA score has been developed for the sequential evaluation and description of organ failure and has been shown to be a suitable indicator of prognosis in trauma patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>A significant effect may only be shown in a group of medium probability of death (20-60%), especially concerning maximum SOFA-score, as the type of procedure chosen in patient groups of very high or very low mortality will most likely have only a minimal effect on this endpoint.</p><p>Because the most important factors that determine prognosis in multiple trauma patients are considered, a comparison of this heterogenic patient collective is possible.</p><p>In the current literature, another facet of the optimal surgical treatment in multiple trauma patients is discussed: Biochemical/immunologic factors. It has been shown that the traumatic tissue damage stimulates a maximal activation of the immune system, which leads to its depletion and debilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. As a consequence of a failing immune system a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or sepsis can occur. Both are potentially life threatening complications, in the course of which all organ systems can be affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>Some of the best analyzed pro-inflammatory cytokines are tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], and the interleukines (IL)-6 and IL-8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Circulating IL-6 is quickly detectable after trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] and has been shown to correlate with trauma load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>But so far, the transfer of results into clinical context and the verification for potential decision making (therapy) with respect to risk reduction during secondary surgical procedures after trauma failed.</p><p>In extension to the clinical part of the present research a further investigation is planned to monitor both study groups for potential differences in immunofunction/-dysfunction as reflected by temporal patterns of selected circulating mediators and markers for immuno-competence. This approach may result in optimum individualized concepts for fracture repair depending on the patient's individual immuno-competence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>Nevertheless, the prerequisites for performing this study give rise to hope for answering the question whether the "early total care" or the &#x0201e;damage control&#x0201d; concept is associated with better outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AE: adverse event; AIS: abbreviated injury scale; ARDS: adult respiratory distress syndrome; BE: base excess; CNS: central nervous system; CRF: case report form; CT: computer tomography; DIVI: Deutsche Interdisziplin&#x000e4;re Vereinigung Intensivmedizin; DSMB: data safety monitoring board; DCO: damage control orthopedics; ETC: early total care; GCP: good clinical practice; GCS: Glasgow coma scale; GOS: Glasgow outcome scale; ICU: intensive care unit; ISS: injury severity score; KKSK: coordinating center for clinical studies Cologne; MODS: multi organ dysfunction syndrome; MOF: multi organ failure; OF: organ failure; PI: primary investigator (principle coordinating investigator); RISC: revised injury severity classification; SAE: serious adverse event; SIRS: systemic inflammatory response syndrome; SOFA: sepsis-related organ failure assessment; TISS: therapeutic intervention scoring system; TRISS: Trauma Injury Severity Score.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>DR conceived and designed the trial, drafted the manuscript and secured trial funding.
