The only treatment option currently available to address multiple postmenopausal symptoms in women with an intact uterus is estrogen/progestin-containing hormone therapy (HT). Concerns surrounding side effects and published data regarding the association of HT with the increased risk for breast cancer have induced a decrease in the number of women seeking, initiating, and continuing this type of therapy. A combination containing bazedoxifene and conjugated estrogens (BZA/CE) maintains the established benefits of estrogen therapy for treatment of postmenopausal vasomotor symptoms, vulvovaginal atrophy, and osteoporosis, while certain estrogenic effects, such as stimulation of the uterus and breast, are antagonized without the side effects associated with HT. BZA/CE has been evaluated in a series of multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and active-controlled Phase III trials known as the Selective estrogens, Menopause, And Response to Therapy (SMART) trials. BZA/CE demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in vasomotor symptoms, vulvovaginal atrophy, and a protective effect on the skeleton. These clinical benefits were associated with an acceptable safety profile and an improved tolerability compared with HT. BZA/CE showed a favorable safety profile on the breast, endometrium, and ovaries. The incidence of venous thromboembolism was low and the risk does not appear to be any greater than for CE alone or BZA alone or greater than HT. The incidence of coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular accidents were similar to placebo. The overall incidence of cancer (including breast cancer) was low and similar to placebo. The SMART trials demonstrate that BZA/CE is an alternative option for treating non-hysterectomized, symptomatic, postmenopausal women.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>tissue selective estrogen complex</kwd><kwd>bazedoxifene</kwd><kwd>conjugated estrogens</kwd><kwd>menopause</kwd><kwd>osteoporosis</kwd><kwd>vasomotor symptoms</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Loss of ovarian estrogen production in women during menopause results in a state of estrogen deficiency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ijwh-5-465">1</xref> which has been associated with multiple problems, including vasomotor symptoms, symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy, and difficulties with sleep, mood, memory, and sexual activity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ijwh-5-465">2</xref> During menopause, these symptoms commonly overlap, presenting as a continuum, and may have a negative impact on a woman&#x02019;s quality of life.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ijwh-5-465">3</xref> Menopausal symptoms have also been negatively associated with the ability to work.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ijwh-5-465">4</xref> Estrogen deficiency has further been associated with loss of bone mass, often leading to osteoporosis, which is associated with an increased occurrence of skeletal fractures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ijwh-5-465">2</xref> Women who sustain osteoporotic fractures also face a negative impact on their quality of life, often affecting their ability to function and putting them at an increased risk of morbidity and mortality.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ijwh-5-465">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ijwh-5-465">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ijwh-5-465">6</xref></p><p>A variety of therapeutic options are available for the individual symptoms associated with menopause.

BZA/CE maintains the established benefits of estrogen therapy for menopausal symptoms of vasomotor symptoms, vulvovaginal atrophy, and prevention of osteoporosis, while preventing the stimulatory estrogenic effects on the uterus and estrogenic/progestogenic effects on breast tissue.</p><p>The rationale for development of BZA/CE was that BZA, acting as an estrogen receptor antagonist in uterine tissue, would inhibit the proliferative effects of estrogen on the endometrium in a manner mechanistically distinct from progestins, and therefore reduce the incidence of irregular uterine bleeding.</p><p>BZA acts as an estrogen receptor antagonist in breast tissue, so BZA/CE is posited not to induce breast pain or changes in breast density. BZA/CE does not cause morphologic changes in the mammary gland, and it is hypothesized that this is the pharmacologic explanation for the lack of changes in breast pain and density. In vitro and vivo models demonstrate that BZA also inhibits the proliferative stimulatory action of estrogens on breast cancer cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ijwh-5-465">16</xref></p><p>The objective of this review is to present key efficacy and safety findings from the Selective estrogens, Menopause, And Response to Therapy (SMART) trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ijwh-5-465">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ijwh-5-465">20</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Clinical studies with BZA/CE</title><p>BZA/CE has been evaluated in a series of multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and active-controlled Phase III investigations known as the SMART trials (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijwh-5-465">Table 1</xref>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ijwh-5-465">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ijwh-5-465">20</xref></p><p>The SMART-1 trial (n = 3,397) was conducted at 94 sites in the United States, Europe, and Brazil and enrolled generally healthy, postmenopausal women aged 40&#x02013;75 years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ijwh-5-465">17</xref> Eligible subjects had to have an intact uterus, a body mass index (BMI) &#x02264;32.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and normal endometrial biopsy results at screening.

BZA/CE also showed significant improvements in tolerability compared with HT, as measured by lower rates of uterine bleeding and breast pain. BZA/CE treatment had an effect on breast density similar to placebo. These clinical benefits were associated with an acceptable safety profile. No apparent increased risk for serious adverse events, such as venous thromboembolism, cardiovascular events, endometrial cancer, or breast cancer, was observed with either dose strength of BZA/CE. BZA/CE is an alternative option for treating non-hysterectomized, symptomatic postmenopausal women.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>SM is an employee of Pfizer Inc.
