Difficulty preserving the original anatomy[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and unexpected fractures of instruments are among the problems faced.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Against this, several strategies have been developed to improve instrument flexibility and resistance, including various cross-sectional designs, improved manufacturing processes, and innovations in the mechanics of instrumentation.</p><p>Malentacca and Lalli concluded that NiTi rotary instruments were significantly safer under an alternating rotary motion than when used with continuous rotary motion.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Subsequent studies have confirmed this observation, showing a lower incidence of fracture and a higher lifespan of the instruments under this type of movement.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Considering these benefits, Yared[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] proposed an instrumentation technique based on the use of a single file. The concept of using only one instrument for preparing the entire canal is promising because the learning curve is greatly reduced as a result of technical simplification and reduction of the arsenal needed. In keeping with this concept, the Reciproc (VDW, Munich, Germany) and WaveOne (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) systems appeared on the market, both using a single file specifically designed for use with reciprocating movement.</p><p>However, when faced with canals with complex anatomies, it is reasonable to think of preparations using multifile systems, progressively increasing the diameter of the instruments to reach the working length with more gradual enlargement, without forcing the file apically.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The use of only one instrument to complete the preparation could lead to increased root canal transportation[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and the accumulation of much stress, with the consequent risk of fracture.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>The ProTaper Next (PTN; Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) multifile system, manufactured using M-Wire NiTi alloy, has among its features, an off-center rectangular cross-section, and asymmetrical rotary motion. It has been reported that these instruments are more resistant to cyclic fatigue than is their predecessor, the ProTaper Universal (PTU) system.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Furthermore, lower apical transportation has also been observed in curved canals prepared using PTN versus WaveOne and PTU.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] To date, no published study has assessed the PTN system with reciprocating motion. The aim of this study was to evaluate transportation and the centering ability in curved root canals of the PTN multifile system used with alternating rotation compared with conventional continuous rotation using CBCT imaging.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>In total, 50 separate mesio&#x02013;buccal or mesio&#x02013;lingual canals of mandibular molars with fully formed apices stored in saline were selected for this study. Furthermore, only canals with an angle of curvature in the mesial&#x02013;distal plane between 30&#x000b0; and 60&#x000b0; were included in this study. The evaluation of angle and radius of curvature was performed according to the methodology of Pruett et al.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>The cavities were accessed with Endo-Access and Endo-Z burs (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland), and the working length was established under &#x000d7;10 magnification using a clinical operating microscope (M525 F40; Leica, Heerbrugg, Switzerland) by inserting a size 10 K file into the root canal until it was visible through the apex and subtracting 1 mm from this measure.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Specimens were divided into two experimental groups (<italic>n</italic> = 25 each), taking care to distribute the angle and radius of curvature equally. Then, the rotational movement applied in the PTN instruments was randomly assigned to each group: Group A, alternating rotation, and Group B, continuous rotation.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Root canal instrumentation</title><p>Canals were instrumented using I-Endo Dual digital electric motor (Satelec-Acteon, M&#x000e9;rignac, France) and a W &#x00026; H WD-75M 16:1 reduction contra-angle hand piece (W &#x00026; H, B&#x000fc;rmoos, Austria). Before using PTN, as recommended by the manufacturer, a glide path was created using ProGlider (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland).[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>The following sequence of instrumentation was established with PTN instruments: X1, X2, and X3. Group A was instrumented with an alternating rotation motion of 150&#x000b0; clockwise (CW) followed by 30&#x000b0; counterclockwise (CCW) at a speed of 300 rpm.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Group B was instrumented with continuous rotation motion at a speed of 300 rpm, according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p><p>Instrumentation was completed using a gentle in- and out-motion. Instruments were withdrawn from the canal, and dentinal debris was cleaned with gauze soaked in saline when resistance was felt in their progression.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Canal irrigation was performed in both groups with 2 mL of 5.25% NaOCl after the use of each file. Each instrument was used to prepare three canals and was then discarded.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Cone-beam computed tomography analysis</title><p>CBCT scans were performed before and after instrumentation with the aim of analyzing changes in cross sections of the canals at 3, 5, and 7 mm from the apex to calculate transportation and centering ability. Before the initial scan, coronal portions of the teeth were embedded in a radiolucent resin holder (Major-Repair; Major, Moncalieri, Italy), leaving the roots-oriented upward and maintaining coronal access. This permanent and rigid support allowed each sample to be placed in the same position before and after instrumentation.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>Samples were immersed in water[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and positioned on the CBCT scanner (CS 9300; Carestream, New York, United States). Images were acquired with the following specifications: 90 kV, 6.3 mA, and an isotropic resolution of 90 &#x003bc;m. The field of view was 5 cm &#x000d7; 5 cm.</p><p>To obtain the cross-sectional images of the canal, CS 3D imaging software (Carestream, New York, United States) was used. Before the initial scan was performed on each sample, three grooves were made in the root surface perpendicular to the root canal at 3, 5, and 7 mm from the apex using a fine diamond disk (0.3 mm) (Komet, Lemgo, Germany) mounted on a handpiece and under the control of a clinical operating microscope (M525 F40; Leica, Heerbrugg, Switzerland). These grooves facilitated the reproducibility of the root canal cross-sectional images obtained in the pre- and post-instrumentation scans. Images were exported in TIF format for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Canal transportation and centering ratio evaluation</title><p>Measurements were made using Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Adobe Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA).[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Periradicular area and the lumen of the canal were colored to determine their limit [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. The following formula (absolute value) was used to calculate the canal transportation: (M1&#x02013; M2) &#x02013; (D1&#x02013; D2), where M1 represents the shortest distance from the mesial margin of the root to the mesial margin of the uninstrumented canal, M2 is the shortest distance from the mesial margin of the root to the mesial margin of the instrumented canal, D1 is the shortest distance from the distal margin of the root to the distal margin of the uninstrumented canal, and D2 is the shortest distance from the distal margin of the root to the distal margin of the instrumented canal.

In this regard, the previous studies have examined the possibilities of using alternating rotation, which has been suggested to reduce fracture risk[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and extend the lifespan of the instruments[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] due to decreased torsion stress[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and lower cyclic fatigue.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>When analyzing the performance of different instruments and techniques in the preparation of root canals, several parameters are of special interest, particularly the shaping ability. The present study aimed at evaluating canal transportation and centering ability in the preparation of curved root canals using the PTN multifile system in combination with alternating rotation. The control group used the same system of instruments under continuous rotation, following the manufacturer's instructions. This was intended to assess whether one or the other type of instrumentation could provide better results in the preservation of the original canal anatomy.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>The application of alternating motion could be beneficial in the shaping of root canals by reducing the screwing effect.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] This effect is often associated with instruments working in continuous rotary motion, and it may result in overinstrumentation beyond the apical constriction, which is sometimes a cause of canal transportation.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Another reason to consider the alternating motion as a more conservative procedure is its similarity to Roane&#x000b4;s balanced forces technique.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] However, it is unclear whether alternating motion with rotary Ni-Ti instruments shows the same benefits as the balanced force technique with stainless steel hand files.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>Analysis of the results [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>] of our study on canal transportation and centering ratio revealed no significant difference between alternating rotary motion and continuous rotary motion at any of the three cross sections studied 3, 5, or 7 mm. One possible reason for this could be that the reduction of the screwing effect achieved by the alternating movement was not evident when combined with the PTN instruments, which reduce this effect themselves due to their off-center rectangular cross section and asymmetric rotary motion.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>(a) Graphic representation of root canal transportation. (b) Graphic representation of centering ability mean values</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCD-20-255-g004"/></fig><p>The results obtained are consistent with those of You et al.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] in a similar study carried out with micro-CT (&#x003bc;CT), in which the shaping ability was compared using PTU instruments under both types of rotation. They observed no difference in any of the parameters studied, including canal transportation.</p><p>In contrast, Franco et al.,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] in a study conducted in plastic blocks, found increased apical transportation with instrumentation performed with continuous rotation compared with alternating rotation. The explanation for these conflicting results could be found in the differences in methodology, such as the study models employed or the reciprocation range (60&#x000b0; CW, 40&#x000b0; CCW) with which the instruments were used.</p><p>In our study, we selected a range of 150&#x000b0; CW and 30&#x000b0; CCW, similar to that presented by WaveOne instruments, completing 1 cutting cycle (360&#x000b0;) in 3 CCW&#x02013;CW strokes. This range promotes progression of the instruments in the canal while providing very light apical pressure, sufficient for near-automatic advance.</p><p>Saber et al.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] investigated the influence of different reciprocation ranges on instruments' resistance and their shaping ability. They concluded that a decrease in the reciprocating range resulted in increased resistance to cyclic fatigue, reduced canal transportation, and increased centering ability. However, the results for the latter two parameters, canal transportation and centering ratio, showed no significant difference between groups at 1 mm from the apex. In addition, there was a linear inverse relationship between the reciprocating range and the time needed with the instrument to reach the working length, so smaller and more symmetrical ranges made progression along the canal more laborious and extended the preparation time.</p><p>In the present study, CBCT was used as a tool to evaluate the shaping ability of the tested techniques. This system has a high-resolution scanner that allows noninvasive and reproducible analysis of the changes in the root canal system after instrumentation.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] However, the images obtained with CBCT may have limitations when the area of interest is smaller than the voxel size used for scanning, so changes in root canal anatomy may not be detected with sufficient accuracy. To improve sensitivity and allow a more accurate analysis, images were assessed in our study using the Adobe Photoshop software.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Despite this, the limitations of the method should be considered, and new technologies should be implemented. In this regard, &#x003bc;CT systems, which can provide a resolution of up to 20 &#x003bc;m, have become a powerful tool in the field of endodontics research.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</p><p>The values obtained in our study for canal transportation and centering ratio with both types of rotation were similar to those in previous studies, such as that by Elnaghy and Elsaka[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] which evaluated shaping performed using a combination of ProGlider and PTN instruments with CBCT imaging. Zhao et al.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] used micro-CT to evaluate shaping performance, also showing transportation values with PTN consistent with our study, despite differences in the methodology. According to the observations of Wu et al.,[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] apical transportation of more than 300 &#x003bc;m could negatively affect the quality of the apical seal. Our results showed that none of the samples instrumented exceeded this limit at any of the levels studied.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>PTN instruments promote minimal transportation and remained relatively centered within the root canal, with no significant difference between alternating rotation and continuous rotation.</p><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Peters</surname><given-names>OA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Current challenges and concepts in the preparation of root canal systems: A review</article-title><source>J Endod</source><year>2004</year><volume>30</volume><fpage>559</fpage><lpage>67</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15273636</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Parashos</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Messer</surname><given-names>HH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Rotary NiTi instrument fracture and its consequences</article-title><source>J Endod</source><year>2006</year><volume>32</volume><fpage>1031</fpage><lpage>43</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17055902</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Taschieri</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Necchi</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Rosano</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Del Fabbro</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Weinstein</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Machtou</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Advantages and limits of nickel-titanium instruments for root canal preparation.
