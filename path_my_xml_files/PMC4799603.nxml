Hemorrhoidectomy is generally associated with pain of long duration. Treatment of perioperative acute pain is an important goal for anesthetists to satisfy their patients. The caudal epidural block is considered a simple, safe, and popular anesthetic technique to control such pain. Some members of local anesthetics have been used but still their duration of action need to be prolonged to meet patients&#x02019; requirements. Bupivacaine is the currently available local anesthetic with long duration of action.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Its maximum analgesic effect is up to 6-12 h.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Various methods have been devised to extend the duration of regional analgesia with local anesthetics. Placement of catheter invites a high risk of infection.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Many drugs including epinephrine,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] opioids,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] clonidine,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] ketamine,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] midazolam,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] neostigmine,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] have been tried as adjuvants with caudal bupivacaine to improve the quality of analgesia and extend its duration. Each of these adjuvants has its merits and demerits. For instance, caudal midazolam has been associated with prolonged sedation.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Behavioral changes have been noted with the use of caudal ketamine.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Caudal clonidine has been associated with postoperative hypotension.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Caudal morphine and pethidine along with bupivacaine caused nausea, vomiting, pruritus, itching, flushing, urine retention, and respiratory depression.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of two different doses of tramadol in perioperative caudal analgesia and to identify which dose had maximum duration of caudal analgesia with minimal adverse effects in adult patients undergoing hemorrhoidectomy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="patients|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>After approval of our local Ethical Committee and obtaining written informed consents from adult patients aged between 20 and 50 years old of both sexes of American Society of Anesthesiologists I and II, this study was conducted in a double-blind, randomized fashion. The patients were scheduled for an elective hemorrhoidectomy. Our exclusion criteria were patients having infection at the site of injection, bleeding disorders, preexisting neurological or spinal disease, abnormalities of the sacrum, and finally patients receiving medications likely to have interaction with opioids or cause sedation. All the patients were examined the day before the operation. All patients were premedicated with 1 mg midazolam intravenous (I.V.) 1 h before the operation. There was no intraoperative use of opioids or any other analgesic. All patients were continuously monitored with three lead electrocardiogram (ECG), noninvasive arterial blood pressure, pulse oximetry, and capnography. An I.V. cannula 18 or 20 gauge was inserted. Induction was started using 2-3 mg/kg propofol while the patient is in the left lateral position. Anesthesia was maintained at this position by an independent anesthetist using isoflurane 1.5-2 volume % via a face mask. Then, caudal space was identified, cleaned with antiseptic solution and draped. A 22 gauge needle was inserted into the epidural space. After negative aspiration for blood or cerebrospinal fluid, and confirmation of the caudal epidural space by modified swoosh test, either of the study preparations was injected into the caudal epidural space. They were randomly divided into three equal groups, 30 patients each. Group B included patients who were injected 20 ml of 0.25% plain bupivacaine in caudal epidural space. Group T<sub>1</sub> included patients who were injected 1 mg/kg tramadol in 20 ml normal saline. Group T<sub>2</sub> included patients who were injected 2 mg/kg tramadol in 20 ml normal saline. By the end of injection of the suggested preparation for each patient, the patient is turned immediately to supine position and a laryngeal mask is inserted. The patient is breathing spontaneously. The patients were monitored for perfusion index (PI) using Masimo Radical-7 SET (Masimo Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA). The pulse oximeter probe monitoring PI was placed on the big toe of either leg and was wrapped in a towel to minimize heat loss and to avoid light interference from operating room. A 100% rise of PI value from baseline is considered the onset of the success of caudal block. Positioning of the patient is done (lithotomy position), and surgery starts. By that time, the isoflurane concentration was reduced to 1-1.5 volume %. The effectiveness of the block was evaluated by respiratory rate (RR), hemodynamic stability, and decreased the requirement for inhalational anesthetic. Block was considered adequate when there was no increase of RR, heart rate (HR), and systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 15% after surgical incision compared to preoperative values. At the end of surgery, isoflurane was discontinued, and the laryngeal mask was removed. The patient was transferred to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) after full recovery. The duration of the operation was recorded. In the recovery room, all patients were observed for 2 h with continuous monitoring of ECG and SaO<sub>2</sub>. HR and blood pressure were recorded before induction of anesthesia (1), after anesthesia has been accomplished (2), after skin incision (3), at the end of the surgery (4), and after recovery before transfer to PACU (5). The postoperative pain was assessed using visual analog scale (VAS) hourly (0 = no pain (the patient is sleeping and lying comfortably), 10 = worst pain felt, 6 = moderate pain (the patient is asking for analgesia but still pain was bearable). If the VAS was 6, rescue dose of analgesic was given. The duration of analgesia was defined as the time interval between placement of the caudal block to the first demand for rescue analgesia. Sedation was assessed according to sedation score where 0 = alert, 1 = sleepy and arousable by verbal command, 2 = sleepy and arousable by tactile stimulation, and 3 = sleepy and arousable by painful stimulation. The degree of motor block was evaluated using the Bromage scale. Bradycardia, 20% decrease in HR compared to preoperative values, was to be treated with atropine 0.6 mg I.V. Hypotension, defined as a 20% decrease in mean arterial pressure compared to preoperative values, was to be treated with ephedrine 5 mg I.V. Follow-up of incidence of complications in the form of respiratory depression, nausea and vomiting, urine retention, pruritus or constipation has been done.</p><p>Hormonal stress response was assessed through recording preoperative (before the start of surgery) plasma cortisol (mg/dl) and epinephrine (Pico/ml) levels and recording postoperative (2 h postoperative) plasma cortisol and epinephrine levels. Epinephrine was measured using a noncompetitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Cat Combi ELISA) kit for the measurement of epinephrine. Serum cortisol was measured by a fluorescence polarization immunoassay technology by the Abbott Axysm system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Analysis of data</title><p>Using PASS 13 for sample size calculation, it was calculated that a sample size of 25 patients per group will achieve 80% power to detect difference in the meantime of analgesia between the three groups using an <italic>F</italic>-test with a 0.05 significance level.

This means that caudal tramadol 2 mg/kg showed the longest duration of postoperative analgesia. Group T<sub>2</sub> showed the least hormonal stress response indicating the best quality of analgesia. There was no significant difference in the quality of analgesia between Group B and Group T<sub>1</sub>.</p><p>Activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis and rise of cortisol and epinephrine plasma levels associated with surgical trauma are very important perioperative stress responses. In our study, cortisol and epinephrine showed insignificant rise 2 h postoperatively compared with the preoperative values of the three groups. However, still their values are significantly higher in Group B and Group T<sub>1</sub> than Group T<sub>2</sub>.
