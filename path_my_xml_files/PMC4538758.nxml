In this open-label pilot trial, our objectives were to assess the safety, efficacy, and molecular change associated with treatment of patients with diffuse cutaneous (dc)SSc with the TKI nilotinib (Tasigna&#x02122;).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Ten adult patients with early dcSSc were treated with nilotinib. Primary endpoints were safety and change in modified Rodnan Skin Score (MRSS) after 6 months. Lesional skin biopsies at baseline, 6 and 12 months of treatment were assessed by histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and DNA microarray.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Patients had early and active dcSSc with median disease duration of 0.7 years (range 0.5, 1.7) and increasing MRSS in the month prior to baseline (mean +2.9, p=0.02). Seven out of ten patients completed 6 and 12 months of treatment. Seventy-one adverse events (AEs) including 2 serious AEs were observed, and 92 % of AEs were grade 1-2. Two patients discontinued the medication due to mild QTc prolongation. MRSS improved by a mean of 4.2 points (16 %) at 6 months and by 6.3 points (23 %) at 12 months in the 7 completers, p=0.02 and 0.01, respectively. Patients with a decrease in MRSS &#x0003e;20 % from baseline at 12 months (classified as improvers) had significantly higher expression of transforming growth factor beta receptor (<italic>TGFBR</italic>) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (<italic>PDGFRB</italic>) signaling genes at baseline than non-improvers, and the expression of these genes significantly decreased in improvers post-treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Nilotinib was well tolerated by the majority of patients in this study, with tolerability limited primarily by mild QTc-prolongation. Significant MRSS improvement was observed in these early, active patients, but is not conclusive of treatment effect given the open-label study-design and small number of patients in this pilot study. Improvers had higher levels of expression of genes associated with <italic>TGFBR</italic> and <italic>PDGFRB</italic> signaling at baseline, and a significant decrease in the expression of these genes occurred only in patients with higher MRSS improvement. The findings of this pilot study warrant more conclusive evaluation.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinicaltrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01166139">NCT01166139</ext-link>, July 1, 2010.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13075-015-0721-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma) is a multisystem disorder characterized by vasculopathy, autoimmunity, inflammation, and fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc) have increased morbidity and mortality when compared to patients with other rheumatic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Although several medications are used to treat the skin disease associated with dcSSc, there are no universally effective therapies, and the treatment of scleroderma skin disease remains an area of unmet need [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Transforming growth factor beta (<italic>TGFB</italic>) and the platelet-derived growth factor (<italic>PDGF</italic>) are cytokines implicated in the pathological fibrosis of dcSSc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Nilotinib (Tasigna&#x02122;; Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with antagonistic activity against Abelson tyrosine kinase (<italic>c-Abl</italic>), the <italic>PDGF</italic> receptor (<italic>PDGFR</italic>), and other tyrosine kinases. It is approved in the USA for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It is a therapy of interest for dcSSc because of its ability to interfere with both <italic>TGFB</italic> and <italic>PDGF</italic> signaling. Nilotinib has been shown to decrease fibrosis in vitro and in bleomycin models of SSc similarly to imatinib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, these models have shortcomings in their ability to predict clinical impact in SSc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Several groups have studied imatinib for the treatment of dcSSc with variable experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Unfortunately, none of the studies have been definitive due to the open-label study design, inclusion of patients with limited cutaneous SSc (lcSSc) and morphea, or inadequate power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Adverse events (AE), in particular fluid retention, were prominent in these studies, but may be less frequent when imatinib is used at a low dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Although fluid retention has been observed in other populations, it has been particularly problematic in dcSSc, even leading to the early termination of one trial. Subcutaneous edema may also elevate the modified Rodnan skin score (MRSS), as edema can be difficult to distinguish from dermal thickening.</p><p>Nilotinib is a second generation TKI that blocks <italic>c-abl</italic> and <italic>PDGFR</italic> (more potently <italic>c-abl</italic> than imatinib and less potently <italic>PDGFR</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In populations with CML, edema has been seen in only 10 % of patients, and this represents an advantage of nilotinib over imatinib as a candidate therapy for SSc. We report here the results of our pilot trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study subjects</title><p>Patients were recruited from November 2010 until December 2011. Patients fulfilled the 1980 American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for SSc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and had the diffuse subtype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Patients were over 18 years old, had a disease duration &#x0003c;3 years since the first SSc-related symptom other than Raynaud&#x02019;s phenomenon, and had a baseline MRSS &#x02265;16. Patients were excluded if they had a baseline corrected QT (QTc) interval on electrocardiogram (EKG) &#x0003e;450 msec. Additional exclusion criteria included treatment with immunosuppressive therapies within 3 months before baseline (including prednisone equivalent &#x0003e;10 mg), pregnancy, serious medical conditions, diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) &#x0003c;30 % predicted, or ejection fraction (EF) &#x0003c;50 %.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>This was an investigator-initiated, single-center, open-label pilot study. The primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of nilotinib in patients with dcSSc as assessed by the number of AE and serious adverse events (SAE). The primary efficacy endpoint was change in MRSS after 6 months of treatment. Secondary efficacy endpoints included change in MRSS at 12 months, forced vital capacity (FVC) and DLCO on pulmonary function testing (PFT) as well as change in the short form 36 (SF-36) mental (MC) and physical components (PC) and scleroderma health assessment questionnaire disability index (SHAQ-DI). Skin biopsies were assessed using histopathologic and immunohistochemical analysis, and gene expression profiling with DNA microarray to assess change with treatment and explore the biologic basis of the clinical changes observed.</p><p>The protocol was approved by the institutional review board at the Hospital for Special Surgery. Patients provided written informed consent before enrollment. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) regularly reviewed safety data. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01166139).</p><p>Patients were assessed at visits occurring every month for AE ascertainment, interval history, physical examination, clinical laboratory measurements, and 12-lead EKG, and called our center about issues between visits. AE were listed according to the common terminology of the National Cancer Institute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. AE were graded as follows: 1 - mild, not requiring intervention; 2 - moderate, requiring minimal local or noninvasive intervention; 3 - severe, 4 - life-threatening; 5 - death. AE were attributed as unrelated, unlikely related, possibly related, probably related, or definitely related to the study medication in the opinion of the investigators and as adjudicated by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The MRSS was measured at screening, baseline, and every 3 months by the same physician (RS or JG). PFT with measurement of FVC and DLCO was performed at baseline and after 6 and 12 months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Dosing</title><p>Patients started nilotinib 200 mg by mouth daily for 1 week, which was up-titrated to 200 mg twice daily for 3 weeks and then to 400 mg twice daily. A 12-lead EKG with measurement of QTc was checked 1 week after any dosing change. This titration scheme is not required but was chosen by the investigators to carefully observe any dose-related side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Dermatopathology</title><p>Two 3-mm punch biopsies of lesional, extensor-surface, forearm skin were performed at baseline, and after 6 and 12 months of treatment. The post-treatment biopsies were taken 1 cm adjacent to the previous biopsy. At each time point one specimen was formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded, and the other was stored in RNAlater (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Sections for histopathology were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E), anti-&#x003b1;-smooth muscle actin (&#x003b1;SMA), and Masson trichrome (TC), CD-34, pro-Collagen (proCol), phosphorylated cAbl (p-cAbl), and phosphorylated PDGFR (p-PDGFR) using standard techniques. A dermatopathologist (CM), blinded to treatment status, compared each case. Slides were scored semiquantitatively using a scale (0, 1, 2, 3) based on collagen density and degree of infiltrate on H&#x00026;E, and the intensity of immunohistochemical stains. Skin thickness was measured by a micrometer from the epidermis to the subcutis. Eccrine coils and hair follicles were counted per section.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Gene expression by DNA microarray</title><p>Tissue samples stored in RNAlater were homogenized and RNA was purified as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. RNA integrity was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and all samples had RNA integrity numbers (RIN). Total RNA (25 ng) was amplified and labeled with Agilent Low Input Quick Amp Labeling Kit. cRNA was hybridized to Agilent SurePrint G3 Human Gene Expression 8x60K Microarrays (G4851A). Agilent Feature Extraction Image Analysis Software (Version 10.7.3) was used to extract data from raw microarray image files. Microarray data were log2-lowess normalized and filtered for probes with intensity &#x02265;1.5-fold over local background in Cy3 or Cy5 channels. Expression values were multiplied by &#x02212;1 to convert them to log2(Cy3/Cy5) ratios. Probes with &#x0003e;20 % missing data were excluded resulting in 31,762 probes that passed the filtering criteria. Paired samples (baseline and post-treatment biopsies at 12 months) were available for six patients and were used for analyses. We categorized patients as improvers based on a decrease in MRSS of &#x0003e;20 % at 12 months compared to baseline, and 4/6 patients with paired 12-month biopsy specimens met this criterion. The expression data from the study are deposited to NCBI GEO [GEO:GSE65405].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Microarray data pre-processing</title><p>Microarray data were pre-processed and analyzed using GenePattern modules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] with default parameters unless stated otherwise. Expression data in Stanford preclustering (PCL) file format were converted to Gene Cluster Text (GCT) file format via PclToGct module. Missing expression values were imputed via ImputeMissingValuesKNN module. In total, 31,762 probes were collapsed to 18,398 unique gene symbols via CollapseDataset module using annotation file for the Agilent 8x60K microarray platform. Class label (CLS) files were created via ClsFileCreator module to define phenotypic classes for microarray samples. Expression data were median-centered gene-wise in Cluster 3.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Differential expression analysis</title><p>For both baseline (improvers vs non-improvers) and improver (baseline vs post treatment) comparisons, the ComparativeMarkerSelection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] module from GenePattern was used to identify differentially expressed genes. The &#x02018;number of permutations&#x02019; parameter was set to 0 and the &#x02018;log transformed data&#x02019; parameter was set to &#x02018;yes&#x02019;. For improver comparison, the &#x02018;test statistic&#x02019; parameter was set to &#x02018;Paired <italic>T</italic>-Test&#x02019;. Expression data for significant genes (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c;0.05, not corrected for multiple hypothesis testing) were extracted via the ExtractComparativeMarkerResults module and converted to PCL file format using the GctToPcl module. Expression data were then hierarchically clustered gene-wise and array-wise in Cluster 3.0 using the uncentered correlation similarity metric and average linkage clustering method, and were visualized in TreeView [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Pathway enrichment analysis</title><p>For baseline and improver comparisons, pathways with significant changes in expression were identified by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] using corresponding GenePattern modules. All GSEA analyses were corrected for multiple hypothesis testing. GSEA and ssGSEA were run against the Canonical Pathways database comprising gene sets from several pathway databases. For GSEA, the &#x02018;permutation type&#x02019; parameter was set to &#x02018;gene set&#x02019;. ssGSEA enrichment scores were normalized by dividing by the maximum ssGSEA enrichment score for this expression dataset. Normalized ssGSEA enrichment scores for significant pathways (false discovery rate (FDR) &#x0003c;5 %) were extracted, clustered and visualized as described above for the expression data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Intrinsic subset assignment</title><p>Intrinsic probes (n = 995) from Milano et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] were collapsed to 793 unique genes. Separately the entire nilotinib dataset comprising expression data for 24 samples (including all baseline, 6-month and 12-month biopsies) was combined with 4 healthy control samples analyzed on the same DNA microarray platform to provide the proper data distribution across groups. From these samples 27,276 probes passed quality filters and were collapsed to 16,580 unique genes. Overlap with the 793 unique genes from Milano et al. resulted in 651/793 genes (82.1 %) in common between the two datasets. These 651 genes were used to organize the gene expression data from nilotinib and healthy control samples by unsupervised hierarchical clustering.</p><p>Intrinsic subset assignment was performed using the 651 intrinsic genes to calculate Spearman non-parametric statistics (correlation coefficients and <italic>p</italic> values) between each sample from the study and three centroids corresponding to fibroproliferative, inflammatory and normal-like samples from Milano et al. Limited was excluded because no limited SSc samples were included in this study. Centroids were created by averaging expression values for each gene across all samples assigned to a given intrinsic subset in Milano et al. The intrinsic subset assignment for each nilotinib sample was to the subset centroid with the highest Spearman correlation coefficient and the lowest <italic>p</italic> value.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Descriptive analysis of AE and SAE was performed for assessment of clinical data.

Another patient with known prior history of coronary artery disease (CAD) was hospitalized for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery after 3 months of treatment.

She had atypical chest pain, which she described as heartburn and which had been attributed to her gastroesophageal reflux disease predating the trial.

Several studies have attempted to address the safety and effectiveness of imatinib in this population, but design limitations make it impossible to make definitive conclusions. The collective imatinib experience has been mixed. A modest improvement in skin thickening was seen in some open-label studies, but side effects, especially fluid retention, were prevalent and prevented some patients from continuing the medication. This paper is the first published report on the use of nilotinib for the treatment of dcSSc.</p><p>In this pilot study of nilotinib, a different but related TKI with fewer fluid-related side effects, our goals were to assess safety in a population with dcSSc, generate pilot data on the MRSS to help us adequately power future studies, and to use histopathology and gene expression profiling to further understand our clinical observations.</p><p>Nilotinib was well-tolerated by the majority of patients in this study. Although the number of AE that were at least possibly related to nilotinib was high, many of the AE represented asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities that resolved without intervention. The side effects observed were similar to what has been seen in patients with CML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, nilotinib is known to have important cardiovascular side effects, which were observed and are particularly relevant to SSc patients. Monitoring the QTc with periodic EKG is required. Conduction abnormalities including QTc prolongation can be seen in dcSSc patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] or as a side effect of other medications they may use. In our study QTc prolongation was seen in five SSc patients at screening, which limited their eligibility. Persistent mild QTc prolongation without arrhythmia was the cause of two patients discontinuing treatment. Acceleration of peripheral arterial vascular disease has been reported with nilotinib in CML patients both with and without other risk factors for CAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In this small study we observed exacerbation of preexisting CAD in one patient with other risk factors. Careful consideration of the use of this medicine in patients with CAD or multiple risk factors would be needed in patients with SSc, as it would in CML.</p><p>We observed that the MRSS improved in a statistically significant manner with 6 and 12 months of treatment in this group of patients with very early and active SSc. The range of the minimally clinically important difference in MRSS has been estimated to be 3.2&#x02212;5.3 points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Therefore, the patients in this study were observed to change in a clinically meaningful manner. At the time of study entry the median disease duration was 0.7 years, 70 % of patients had a worsening MRSS, 50 % had the RNA Polymerase3 antibody and 40 % had tendon friction rubs. The combination of these clinical attributes put these patients at high risk of exacerbation of disease during the study period. However, the MRSS improvement is inconclusive given the uncontrolled study design and the observation that the MRSS tends to improve both with time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and in the context of clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Nonetheless, this clinical finding of improved MRSS in group of patients with such early and active dcSSc is worthy of further and more definitive study.</p><p>The FVC and DLCO were not significantly changed, but our trial was not designed to evaluate pulmonary endpoints, and most patients in this study did not have ILD. Recently another TKI, nintedanib, which has some overlapping spectrum of TK inhibition, has been shown to slow the decline of FVC in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a related fibrotic condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The additional outcome measures, including the SF-36 and SHAQ, at the 6- and 12-month time points also remained stable, and this has been shown to occur typically in SSc clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>In this study we used gene expression profiling and the concept of SSc intrinsic subsets to characterize biological response and distinguish between nilotinib improvers and non-improvers. In terms of the intrinsic subset assignment, three of four improvers were classified as non-fibroproliferative (with two out of four classified as inflammatory), whereas non-improvers were classified as fibroproliferative at baseline. Improvers tended to lose their intrinsic subset signature and become normal-like post treatment, while non-improvers remained fibroproliferative (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Genes from specific pathways targeted by nilotinib (e.g., <italic>TGFBR</italic> and <italic>PDGFRB</italic> signaling) showed significantly higher expression in improvers at baseline and were significantly downregulated in those improvers by treatment, whereas their expression in non-improvers was stable or displayed directionality opposite to improvers, with low expression at baseline. Interestingly, a recent analysis of imatinib and nilotinib effects in SSc mouse models suggested that high activation status and expression pattern of TKI targets was predictive of the potential response to therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It is not clear based on this single-group and uncontrolled clinical trial whether our results represent the natural history of the disease or a treatment effect, although an apparent change in the post-treatment intrinsic subset assignment to the one with less severe disease in improvers might reflect beneficial effects of the therapy. As the use of gene expression in the context of clinical trials continues, the significance of these findings will be more conclusive.</p><p>In this study, we found that <italic>TGFBR</italic> signaling was significantly increased in improvers at baseline and that this signature spanned the inflammatory and fibroproliferative subsets. In our original study of <italic>TGFB</italic> signaling in SSc skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] we observed its enrichment primarily in the fibroproliferative subset. However, a recent meta-analysis of three independent gene expression datasets from SSc skin, which dramatically increases the number of samples analyzed, shows that <italic>TGFBR</italic> signaling appears to span the inflammatory and fibroproliferative subsets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p>The results here are consistent with those data, as our improvers, who are primarily defined by high expression of <italic>TGFBR</italic> signaling at the initiation of treatment, appear to span across the fibroproliferative and inflammatory intrinsic gene expression subsets. This indicates that a biomarker of <italic>TGFBR</italic> signaling will be a useful stratification method in addition to biomarkers of the intrinsic gene expression subsets.</p><p>The histopathology of the forearm skin biopsy did not show a significant morphological improvement even in cases where a clinical improvement was seen, and phospho-staining of known targets of nilotinib in the skin was not differentially activated before and after treatment. It is possible that these dermatopathological investigations are less sensitive than microarray in picking up this degree of change, and this would be a topic for future investigation.</p><p>There were several limitations to this study, including its open-label design and small sample size. Because of these factors conclusions about efficacy cannot be definitively drawn. As noted, the MRSS tends to improve due to regression to the mean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and in the context of clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The lack of a control group additionally makes the changes in gene expression observed in the microarray studies inconclusive with respect to whether they represent a change due to treatment or a change based on the natural history of the disease. In terms of the differential gene expression analyses, we had to use uncorrected <italic>p</italic> values in the unpaired and paired <italic>t</italic> tests as the small sample size precluded the adjustment for multiple comparisons. We controlled for this by focusing on pathways found to be deregulated using GSEA, which were corrected for multiple hypothesis testing. This was a pilot study designed to provide preliminary data that could drive more conclusive hypothesis testing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This was an open-label, single-group pilot trial, which included histopathologic and microarray analyses of skin to further delineate biological response. In this pilot clinical trial a significant improvement in the MRSS was observed in patients who would have been expected to have progression of disease. Seventy percent of patients were able to tolerate the medication for 12 months, and side effects were predictable. Improvers were most clearly defined by having high expression of genes associated with <italic>TGFBR/PDGFRB</italic> signaling at the time of treatment initiation, while those that did not improve did not have evidence of activation. <italic>TGFBR</italic> and <italic>PDGFRB</italic> signaling pathways significantly decreased in improvers post treatment and this was not observed in non-improvers. Further evaluation of nilotinib or related TKIs in a randomized and controlled setting is warranted.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec26"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13075_2015_721_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
