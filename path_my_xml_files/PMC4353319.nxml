The randomized, open-label study assessed two doses of H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 influenza vaccine (1&#x000b7;9&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g or 3&#x000b7;75&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g hemagglutinin antigen) formulated with AS03<sub>A</sub> or AS03<sub>B</sub> (11&#x000b7;89&#x000a0;mg or 5&#x000b7;93&#x000a0;mg tocopherol, respectively).

Children are particularly vulnerable to morbidity and mortality associated with novel influenza A viruses because they lack previous exposure to influenza viruses and vaccines and, therefore, lack heterosubtypic immunity. In addition to the susceptibility to infection represented by immune naivety, viral transmission may be more extensive in children than adults because younger people shed viruses at high titers for long periods and have extensive social contact networks.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Pandemic vaccines should provide antigen-sparing, cross-reactive immunogenicity allowing the use of prime-boost strategies and should be suitable for use in children because this group is important in viral transmission.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Various prototype H5N1 influenza vaccines are licensed, which have been developed using antigens against prevalent avian influenza strains identified by global surveillance.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> One such vaccine is <italic>Prepandrix</italic>&#x02122; (GlaxoSmithKline [GSK] Vaccines), containing A/Indonesia/05/2005 formulated with an oil-in-water Adjuvant System (AS03), which has been shown to provide strong, durable, cross-clade immune responses in adults.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In addition, we previously reported the results of a Phase II, randomized, open-label study in children aged 3&#x02013;9&#x000a0;years and showed that two doses of H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1194/2004) vaccine containing 1&#x000b7;9&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g or 3&#x000b7;75&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of hemagglutinin antigen (HA) adjuvanted with two different dosages of AS03, elicited strong antibody responses against the vaccine and drifted strains.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>In this study, we present the follow-up results of the Phase II, randomized, open study of AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 vaccine in children aged 3&#x02013;9&#x000a0;years.

Exploratory analyses were performed to assess cell-mediated immunity (CMI) at 6&#x000a0;months post-vaccination in children aged 3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;years in the 1&#x000b7;9&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g HA/AS03<sub>B</sub> group.</p><p>In this follow-up report, we present the safety data up to 24&#x000a0;months post-vaccination in each vaccine group and the TIV control group, including AEs, serious AEs (SAEs), and AEs of special interest/ potential immune-mediated diseases (AESI/pIMDs). We also report HI antibody responses and CMI against the vaccine strain up to 24&#x000a0;months post-vaccination in the 1&#x000b7;9&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g HA/AS03<sub>B</sub> (3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;years) and 3&#x000b7;75&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g HA/AS03<sub>A</sub> (3&#x02013;5, 6&#x02013;9&#x000a0;years) groups, as observations from these two groups were expected to represent the lowest and highest responses to H5N1 vaccination. HI antibody responses against vaccine homologous (A/Vietnam/1194/2004) and heterologous (A/Indonesia/5/2005) strains were assessed. The safety analysis and HI antibody responses were described as secondary outcomes in the protocol, and CMI as exploratory.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety assessments</title><p>Blood samples were taken on days 0, 21, and 42 and at months 6, 12, and 24 for assessment of biochemistry safety parameters. Unsolicited AEs, SAEs, and AESI/pIMDs were assessed prospectively throughout the 24-month follow-up period and were graded for severity. Investigators provided assessment of the causal relationship between the study vaccines and AEs. All SAEs were to be reported within 24&#x000a0;hours. AEs were classified according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunogenicity assessments</title><p>Blood samples were taken on days 0, 21, and 42 and at months 6, 12, and 24 for assessment of HI and CMI. All serological testing was performed in a central GSK Vaccines laboratory or a validated external laboratory using standardized, validated procedures. HI assays were performed using an established HI method, using horse rather than avian erythrocytes.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> All sera were tested in duplicate.</p><p>For intracellular cytokine staining, the method described by Maecker <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. was adapted,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> in which T cells were restimulated ex vivo by incubation with antigen in the presence of costimulatory antibodies to CD28 and CD49d<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and Brefeldin A to inhibit cytokine secretion and allow intracellular accumulation. The cells were then stained by fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies to phenotypic (CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup>) surface markers, intracellular cytokines, and activation marker before enumeration by flow cytometry. In addition to influenza H5N1 split antigen, H5 peptide pools (with overlaps to ensure all T-cell epitopes are represented) were used as ex vivo stimuli to specifically measure the response to H5 antigen. Antibodies used for cell stimulation were unconjugated and azide-free anti-CD28 and anti-CD49d. Conjugated antibodies used for staining were anti-IFN-&#x003b3;-FITC, anti-IL-2-allophycocyanin, anti-TNF-&#x003b1;-PE Cy7, anti-CD40L-PE, anti-CD4-PerCP, and anti-CD8-allophycocyanin Cy7 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).</p><p>Purified peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMCs) were thawed, washed twice in culture medium [RPMI 1640 (Cambrex, Charles City, NJ, USA)] supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS (PAA Laboratories GMbH, Pasching, Austria), 10000&#x000a0;IU/ml penicillin, 10000&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g streptomycin sulfate, 200&#x000a0;m<sc>m</sc> L-glutamine, 100X MEM nonessential amino acids, 100&#x000a0;m<sc>m</sc> sodium pyruvate, 50&#x000a0;m<sc>m</sc> 2-mercapto-ethanol (all from Life Technologies, Gent, Belgium), examined for viability and counted (<italic>Trucount</italic>, BD Biosciences), washed again and resuspended to 2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml in culture medium. The PBMCs (10<sup>6</sup> cells per well) were incubated in 96-well microtiter plates with costimulatory anti-human CD28 and CD49d antibodies (1/250 dilution each) and stimulated for 20&#x000a0;h at 37&#x000b0;C with either H5N1 split antigen from the A/Vietnam/1194/2004 NIBRG-14 vaccine strain (final concentration 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml HA) or one of the peptide pools (final concentration 1&#x000b7;25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml of each peptide). Brefeldin A (BD Biosciences) at a final concentration of 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml was added for the last 18&#x000a0;h of culture. An unstimulated control (no antigen) and positive control (staphylococcus enterotoxin B, 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) were included in each assay. Following incubation, the cells were washed (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% FCS) and stained with anti-CD4-PerCP and anti-CD8-APC Cy7. The cells were then washed again, fixed and permeabilized with the Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences) according to instructions, and stained with anti-IFN&#x003b3;-FITC, anti-IL-2-APC, anti-TNF-&#x003b1;-PE Cy7, and anti-CD40L-PE. Following washing (Perm/Wash buffer, BD Biosciences), the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry.</p><p>Cells were analyzed on a FACSCanto flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using 6 color panels.

In addition to prospectively recording AEs, in line with the regulatory recommendations, we monitored neurological and autoimmune events and assessed our safety data to identify AESI/pIMDs based on MedDRA Preferred Terms.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Over the 24&#x000a0;month follow-up, we identified 5 events that fulfilled the criteria for AESIs/pIMDs, of which a case of autoimmune hepatitis and a case of uveitis were considered by the investigators to be vaccine-related, and which occurred during the first 6&#x000a0;months, as previously discussed.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>To date, this is the first study of AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine in children to assess safety up to 24&#x000a0;months after vaccination, and our results suggest that the long-term safety profile of the vaccine is clinically acceptable. Notably, the child with autoimmune hepatitis had increased concentrations of serum transaminases at baseline, and the child with uveitis also experienced tonsillitis, gingivostomatitis, and fever one day after the second dose of vaccine and seven days before the development of uveitis, raising the possibility of a viral infection as the cause of the subject's symptoms. Although there are no other long-term studies of AS03-H5N1 vaccines in children, mass vaccination during the 2009 swine-origin pandemic outbreak provided important safety data regarding AS03-adjuvanted A/H1N1pdm09 vaccine. Recent reports have suggested a link between an A/H1N1pdm09 vaccine (a strain distinct from the one we used)<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> or natural infection<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> with subsequent onset of narcolepsy. Further research will help to elucidate the chain of events that resulted in narcolepsy and the potential roles of genetic and environmental factors in triggering this disease. No cases of narcolepsy were detected in this H5N1 study, which was likely too small to detect rare events such as narcolepsy.</p><p>Our immunogenicity analysis showed that there was a low level of persistence of the HI antibody responses up to 24&#x000a0;months following the first vaccination. In addition to the original study, the results of this long-term follow-up suggest that AS03-H5N1 vaccine provides antigen-sparing, durable, cross-reactive immune responses in children, which will allow the use of prime-boost strategies.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>In addition to the humoral immune response, CD4+ T cells play an important role in immunity to influenza and are reported to have protective roles that are independent of neutralizing antibody responses.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Various mechanisms underlying cell-mediated immunity to influenza have been reported, including the induction of antigen-specific T and B cells associated with long-term immune memory, characterized by influenza-specific human CD4+ T cell memory responses that are strongly biased toward T<sub>H</sub>1 cells, producing TNF&#x003b1;, IFN&#x003b3;, and IL-2 on activation. The induction of immune memory via mechanisms that are independent of neutralizing antibody responses may be an important facet of vaccine protection against pandemic influenza because memory CD4+ T cells have been implicated in heterotypic immunity in animal models and in human challenge studies with H3N2 and H1N1 viruses.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>A previous study has shown that formulation of H5N1 vaccine with AS03 enhances B-cell memory and CD4+ T cells compared with non-adjuvanted vaccine in adults,<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and although the exact function of CD4+ T cells induced by AS03-H5N1 vaccine is not known, pre-clinical models suggest that &#x003b1;-tocopherol modulates the innate immune response and enhances adaptive immunity.<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> To assess the induction of T-cell responses in children, we evaluated intracellular cytokines against H5N1 vaccines and a H5 pool of peptides. In the initial report from this study, in children aged 3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;years receiving the 1&#x000b7;9&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g HA/AS03<sub>B</sub> formulation or TIV, the CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell response to the H5N1 antigen was substantially induced upon vaccination with the AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 influenza vaccine, but not TIV, thus suggesting that AS03 enhances cell-mediated immunity.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The CD4+ T-cell response was characterized by the production of IL-2 and IFN-&#x003b3;, but not IL-13.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In this follow-up study, the frequencies of specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells peaked at Day 42 and remained markedly above pre-vaccination levels by Month 24, induced by the vaccine antigen and the peptide pool. The frequencies of vaccine-induced antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were identified as producing IL-2 upon short-term <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation with the H5N1 split antigen, and a substantial portion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> and IL-13<sup>&#x02212;</sup>. However, CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses were not present, or not detectable, in the periphery at the analyzed time-points. Although further studies are needed to assess the mechanisms of cell-mediated immunity with influenza vaccines, our results suggest that AS03-H5N1 vaccine may induce CD4+ T-cell responses that may be associated with long-term, heterosubtypic immune memory in children.</p><p>In conclusion, up to 24&#x000a0;months following the first vaccination in children aged 3&#x02013;9&#x000a0;years, AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 prepandemic vaccine demonstrated a clinically acceptable safety profile. There was a progressive reduction of humoral immunity at 12 and 24&#x000a0;months following the first&#x000a0;vaccination, and strong, long-term, cross-reactive cell-mediated immune responses.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all the participating study volunteers and their families, center coordinator (for the Institut Pedi&#x000e0;tric Mar&#x000e8;s Riera: Gema Riera), study doctors and trial nurses (for the Institut Pedi&#x000e0;tric Mar&#x000e8;s Riera: N&#x000fa;ria Tarr&#x000e9;s), and laboratory technicians at the study site as well as the sponsor's project staff for their support and contributions throughout the study.
