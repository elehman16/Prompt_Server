There is considerable evidence implicating facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria as the primary cause of periodontal disease.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] The control of the prevalence and severity of periodontal disease implies a managed reduction of either the total microbial plaque mass or at least those microbes considered to be pathogenic. This is performed routinely in the dentist's office by mechanical scaling and root planing (SRP). However, variation in the ability of the therapist to gain access to deep and tortuous pockets often results in substantial variation in the effectiveness of SRP. This has led to the adjunctive use of antibacterial agents, usually in the form of irrigants or systemic antibiotics. In the treatment of periodontal diseases, irrigation is used as a lavage to flush away the bacteria that are in contact with the periodontal tissues. Oral irrigation has been promoted and used as a dental hygiene aid for over 80 years. Recent evidence has suggested that oral irrigation is effective in altering, both quantitatively and qualitatively, the unattached subgingival plaque associated with chronic adult periodontitis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>Chlorhexidine (CHX), a bisbiguanide compound, has been shown to possess a broad spectrum of topical antimicrobial activity. It is this property, in addition to the safety, effectiveness, substantivity, lack of serious side effects and lack of toxicity that has allowed it to be used extensively in dentistry, usually as a mouthrinse. The combined use of irrigators and CHX appears to be more effective than when used as a mouthrinse at altering the subgingival microflora[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] The tetracyclines are a group of bacteriostatic antimicrobials effective against a wide range of organisms and successfully tested in both animal models and clinical studies. Preliminary data indicate that tetracycline HCl may be retained in the subgingival environment and is slowly released to the gingival crevicular fluid in clinically meaningful concentrations following an irrigation procedure. It is not known, however, whether this was an effect of substantivity of tetracycline HCl to the periodontally exposed root or to other subgingival tissues.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] The aim of this present study was to compare and evaluate the clinical and antimicrobial effects of a single episode of subgingival irrigation with 150 ml each of 0.2% CHX digluconate, tetracycline HCl at 10 mg/ml and 50 mg/ml concentrations and normal saline, in the absence of SRP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty patients diagnosed with chronic periodontitis were selected.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>

Conventional closed debridement of subgingival plaque from root surfaces can be effective, but is time consuming and technically demanding. It has been shown that the chance of failing to remove all of the subgingival plaque increases in pocket depths greater than 4 mm. As subgingival plaque accumulates and matures, periodontal breakdown can occur.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Therefore, professional maintenance therapy may not always achieve complete or adequate debridement. This has led to the adjunctive use of antibacterial agents, usually in the form of irrigants or systemic antibiotics, to overcome the limited efficacy of the conventional treatment. The primary purpose of irrigation is to nonspecifically reduce the bacteria and their by-products that lead to the initiation or progression of periodontal diseases.</p><p>Local delivery of antibiotics and antimicrobials has been explored for the control of subgingival plaque. The potential benefits of an antimicrobial agent as an adjunct in periodontal therapy may be to disrupt, more intensely, the microflora or to alter, selectively, its regrowth so that mechanical therapy has a more prolonged effect.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] The present study was designed to evaluate the clinical and antimicrobial effects of a single episode of subgingival irrigation of tetracycline or CHX in deep periodontal pockets.</p><p>In this study, the mean plaque index and gingival index scores for group C were more significantly reduced as compared to the other groups. Similar results were observed in a study done by Christersson <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] to evaluate the binding to and release of tetracycline-HCl from human root dentin surfaces, <italic>in vivo</italic>. A significant improvement in the clinical parameters was seen during a three-month follow-up period. Silverstein <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] found that tetracycline irrigation showed statistically significant improvement in clinical parameters when compared with control. The favorable results obtained in the above-mentioned studies may be due to the high concentration of tetracycline-HCl used (100 mg/ ml) and repeated administration (every other day for a two-week period).</p><p>The main advantage of irrigation of periodontal pockets with tetracycline-HCl over systemic administration appears to be the localized concentration of the drug at the sites of disease activity, with minimal effects on the microflora present in other areas. The amount of drug delivered often creates sulcular medication concentrations exceeding the equivalent of 1 mg/ ml. This level is considered bactericidal for the majority of bacteria that exhibit resistance to systemically delivered concentrations. Thus, the control of disease activity in deep periodontal pockets brought about by local delivery of the drug may be attributable to the improvement in the clinical parameters.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>The reduction in the mean probing pocket depth for group C from day 0 to day 7 was significantly higher as compared to reduction in other groups and only group C showed a statistically significant change in the mean clinical attachment level in the same time period. These results are similar to those observed by Stabolhz <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] in a randomized, split-mouth clinical study, evaluating the results of a single episode of irrigation with CHX or tetracycline HCl. They suggested that subgingival irrigation with high concentrations of tetracycline solutions may have a role in the management of adult periodontitis. However, Trombelli <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] showed that no adjunctive effect on the healing response was obtained by augmenting mechanical debridement with tetracycline. It is assumed that different levels of disease activity or disease severity were present at the time of treatment and could account for the lack of agreement between these studies.</p><p>The significant improvement in the clinical attachment levels of the sites irrigated with tetracycline HCl may be attributed to its&#x02019; effects on periodontal regeneration. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have shown enhanced soft tissue attachment to root surfaces treated with tetracycline. Dentin root surface demineralization by low pH tetracycline increases adsorption of fibronectin, an extracellular matrix glycoprotein. The adsorbed or bound fibronectin enhances fibroblast attachment and growth, while suppressing epithelial cell attachment and growth.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>The reductions in the spirochetes and motile rods&#x02019; counts and increases in the mean cocci counts were significantly higher in group C compared to the other groups on days 28, 56, and 84. The changes in the subgingival bacterial counts in the present study concur with the results of the study done by Silverstein <italic>et al</italic>. Statistically significant improvements from baseline and from the control were found primarily for the tetracycline group. In this group, the cocci cell percentages were significantly elevated from both baseline and control values at two, four, and eight weeks associated with a statistically significant decrease in the percentage of spirochetes and motile rods.</p><p>Tetracycline acts by inhibiting protein synthesis in the bacterial cell. <italic>in vitro</italic> studies performed to assess antibiotic susceptibility showed that most potentially periodontopathic bacteria, including <italic>P. intermedia</italic>, <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>, <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> and <italic>C. rectus</italic>, are all susceptible to this antibiotic. The lipophilic properties of the tetracyclines explain their high penetration capacity into bacterial cells. Also, the crevicular fluid level of tetracycline was estimated to be two to four times the blood level at a given dose, far exceeding the minimum inhibitory concentrations of most periodontopathic bacteria.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>An important prerequisite for an antimicrobial drug as a plaque-inhibiting agent is substantivity, that is, the ability of the agent to adsorb to and subsequently desorb from surfaces such as those of teeth and oral soft tissues maintaining antimicrobial activity. Tetracycline is known to be a potent chelator and its&#x02019; incorporation into enamel and dentin is caused by a yet unknown physiochemical process. Preliminary data indicate that tetracycline HCI may be retained in the subgingival environment to slowly release to the gingival crevicular fluid in clinically meaningful concentrations following an irrigation procedure. Stabholz <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] demonstrated long-lasting substantivity of tetracycline HCl to root dentin of extracted teeth, as compared to CHX digluconate. Roots immersed in tetracycline HCl at concentrations of 50 mg/ml and 10 mg/ ml released antimicrobial activity for a significantly longer period (14 and 4 days, respectively). Interestingly, within each treatment, there were no differences between the exposure intervals (1, 3, or 5 min). The high substantivity of tetracycline HCl obtained in their study may be related to the high concentration (50 mg/ml) and quantity (150 ml for each site) used, which are similar to the present study. This demonstrates that the amount of antimicrobial activity retained is proportional to the concentration of tetracycline HCl used for irrigation.</p><p>Other studies have demonstrated multiple beneficial properties of tetracycline unrelated to its antimicrobial properties. Tetracycline HCI has been shown to etch and/or remove the root surface smear layer and cause surface demineralization, to delay pellicle and plaque formation, and to exhibit anti-collagenase activity as well as to inhibit, <italic>in vitro</italic>, parathyroid hormone-induced bone resorption and human neutrophil functions. It is apparent, therefore, that the effects of tetracycline may be multifactorial through modulation of both the subgingival microflora and mechanisms of tissue destruction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>From this study it can be concluded that subgingival irrigation with tetracycline HCl at a concentration of 50 mg/ml has shown significant improvement in the clinical and microbial parameters compared to control.
