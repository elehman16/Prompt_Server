Major risk factors under this umbrella are mainly lifestyle related conditions such as physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, and disturbed sleep pattern[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] which are preventable. Hence, more attention has to be given to prevent these lifestyle related diseases. In classics, there are references of 100 years life span of the people who are accustomed with proper diet and regimen.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Nowadays, due to disturbed lifestyle, i.e., faulty dietary habits and wrong behavioral pattern, life expectancy of male/female has been decreased to 67/70 years.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Lifestyle means a way in which a person lives, which includes entire activities and conducts by a person during the whole day, night and its methods, timing, place, etc. Hence, <italic>Vihara</italic> and <italic>Ahara Vidhi</italic> can be included under the heading of lifestyle in Ayurveda. <italic>Vihara</italic> consists of conducts explained under the heading of <italic>Dinacharya</italic> (daily regimen), <italic>Ritucharya</italic> (seasonal regimen) and <italic>Sadvritta</italic> (behavioral regimen) and <italic>Ahara Vidhi</italic> (dietetic rules) consists of the conducts given under the heading of <italic>Ahara Vidhi Vidhana</italic> (codes of dietetics), <italic>Bhojanottara Vidhi Vidhana</italic> (conducts after meal) etc., which are described in detail in Ayurveda. Any alteration in these conducts leads to the manifestation of diseases.</p><p>Wrong dietary habits such as <italic>Adhyashana</italic> (eating after meal), <italic>Vishamashana</italic> (diet on irregular time and quantity), and wrong behavioral pattern such as <italic>Vegadharana</italic> (suppression of urges) leads to vitiation of <italic>Doshas</italic> independently or together causing <italic>Agnimandya</italic> (indigestion). In <italic>Ayurveda</italic>, it is believed that <italic>Agnimandya</italic> is the root cause for all the diseases[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] such as <italic>Prameha</italic> and <italic>Sthaulya</italic>. In modern science also, it has been proved that there exists gut-brain-endocrine axis which involves ghrelin-leptin hormones, insulin and orexins. Disturbance in this axis leads to diseases such as obesity and diabetes mellitus which are among the top ten lifestyle disorders. The causes for these diseases are improper diet pattern, disturbed sleep pattern etc.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>The present study is aimed at establishment of relationship between disturbances in lifestyle and <italic>Agnimandya</italic> and role of lifestyle modification in correcting the state of <italic>Agnimandya</italic> by correcting impaired <italic>Ahara Parinamakara Bhavas</italic> (factors responsible for digestion) and circadian rhythm.
