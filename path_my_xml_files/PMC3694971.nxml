The social world is an important source of satisfaction and support for most of us. However, social contact can also be a source of suffering and problems. Individuals with a diagnosis of mental disorder often have difficulties to adapt to the social world and to trust others <xref rid="pone.0066747-vanOs1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Although representations of social mistrust are common also in the general population, they generally take on more severe forms in the context of mental disorders <xref rid="pone.0066747-Freeman1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Two important factors which fuel paranoia are low self-esteem <xref rid="pone.0066747-Thewissen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, expectation of mistreatment and affective dysregulation <xref rid="pone.0066747-Freeman2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066747-Bentall1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, illustrating the transdiagnostic nature of paranoia. Paranoia consequently is not only commonly observed in individuals with psychosis but also in individuals with affective disorders such as depression, <xref rid="pone.0066747-Bentall1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066747-White1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The presence of paranoid symptoms impacts negatively on outcome even when expressed at subclinical level <xref rid="pone.0066747-Wigman1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, and increases the risk for developing a full-blown psychotic disorder <xref rid="pone.0066747-vanRossum1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Paranoia affects representations of the social environment, resulting in unease in social situations and reduced social approach. The resulting social avoidance will further fuel mistrust, giving rise to a downward spiral <xref rid="pone.0066747-Green1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Recent research proposes that mindfulness-based approaches, for instance Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), are effective in treating different forms of psychopathology. Most studies were conducted in patients with depression or anxiety disorder <xref rid="pone.0066747-Hofmann1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066747-Fjorback1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, but a few small randomized controlled trials have reported positive effects of ACT and MBCT for patients recovering from acute psychosis <xref rid="pone.0066747-Bach1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066747-Pankey1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066747-Chadwick1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066747-Chadwick2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066747-Langer1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066747-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066747-Bach2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. There is little work on possible psychological processes that might be transformed by of mindfulness-based therapies <xref rid="pone.0066747-Bach3" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066747-Ludwig1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, particularly in terms of examining alterations in the subtle dynamic interplay of altered representations and social interaction in real life, for example when people interact with others, or when they feel suspicious. Real-time and real-world assessment approaches such as the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) have been optimized for the investigation of dynamic patterns of interaction between experience and behaviour <xref rid="pone.0066747-MyinGermeys1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>Mindfulness-based approaches, unlike cognitive therapy, are not aimed at changing the contents of mental experience, but rather target the relationship the individual has with thoughts and feelings <xref rid="pone.0066747-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Participants practice to become more aware of moment-to-moment sensations and to recognize negative feelings/thoughts, without being <italic>wrapped up</italic> in them or considering them to be a reflection of reality. This practice may bring about the ability to deal with feelings of insecurity and paranoia.</p><p>In a sample of participants with affective dysregulation and increased risk to experience feelings of mistrust, ESM was used to measure feelings of paranoia and appraisal of social interactions during six days before and six days after either MBCT or waiting list control group (hereafter: Control). This study used data pertaining to a published RCT on the effects of MBCT on depressive symptoms <xref rid="pone.0066747-Geschwind1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, to test further hypotheses, developed after completion of the RCT, regarding the effects of MBCT on paranoia. The primary aim of the study was to examine the effects of MBCT on feelings of paranoia and on the appraisal of social situations, measured as they occur in daily life. A secondary aim was to investigate whether MBCT may interrupt the downward spiral between feeling paranoid and feeling less accepted in social situations, using time-lagged analyses.</p><p>The hypothesis was that, following MBCT, individuals would feel (i) less paranoid and (ii) more at ease during social interaction. Furthermore, following MBCT, we expected (iii) a reduction of the association between paranoia and unease during social interactions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participant Characteristics</title><p>In the MindMaastricht study (trial number NTR1084, Netherlands Trial Register Trial registration: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=1084">http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=1084</ext-link>) <xref rid="pone.0066747-Geschwind1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, adults with residual depressive symptomatology (&#x0003e;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;7 on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; HDRS <xref rid="pone.0066747-Hamilton1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>) after at least one episode of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and thus at risk of also displaying elevated paranoid ideation <xref rid="pone.0066747-Wigman1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, were recruited from outpatient mental health care facilities in Maastricht and through posters in public spaces.

Eligible participants were invited for a detailed explanation of the experience sampling procedure, and then took part in the baseline assessment. The baseline assessment consisted of six days of experience sampling in the participant's natural environment (see below).

In addition to the weekly group sessions, participants received CDs with guided exercises and were assigned daily homework exercises (30 to 60 minutes daily).

Compared to retrospective questionnaires and interviews, ESM offers several advantages: (a) enhanced ecological validity, (b) minimized retrospective bias, because participants' experiences are assessed as they occur, and (c) enhanced reliability, because participants' experiences are assessed repeatedly <xref rid="pone.0066747-Csikszentmihalyi1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In the current study, participants received a digital wristwatch and a set of ESM self-assessment forms collated in a booklet for each day. The wristwatch was programmed to emit a signal (&#x0201c;beep&#x0201d;) at an unpredictable moment in each of ten 90-minute time blocks between 7:30 am and 10:30 pm, on six consecutive days, resulting in a maximum of 60 beeps per study period. After each beep, participants were asked to fill out ESM self-assessment forms, collecting reports of current emotions, cognition and context. All self-assessments were rated on 7-point Likert scales (ranging from <italic>not at all</italic> to <italic>very</italic>). Trained research assistants explained the ESM procedure to the participants during an initial briefing session, and a practice form was completed to confirm that participants understood the 7-point Likert scale. Participants were instructed to complete their reports immediately after the beep, thus minimizing memory distortion, and to record the time at which they completed the form. All reports not filled in within 15 min after the actual beep were excluded from the analysis, since previous work has shown that reports completed after this interval are less reliable and consequently less valid. For the same reason, participants with less than 20 valid reports at baseline were excluded from the analysis <xref rid="pone.0066747-Delespaul1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.

All results remained significant and similar when controlling for momentary paranoia at t.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first daily life study to show that MBCT changes the way in which individuals with affective dysregulation deal with feelings of insecurity and paranoia in the social world. Our results indicate that MBCT decreases feelings of paranoia in the flow of daily life, while paranoia grew worse in the control group. Moreover, MBCT significantly increased feeling accepted in social situations while controls reported reduced social acceptance from baseline to follow-up. A bi-directional link between feeling paranoid and feeling accepted was apparent, which was attenuated as a result of MBCT, suggesting that MBCT interrupts the vicious circle of feeling paranoid and not feeling accepted (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066747-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066747-g002">Figure 2</xref>). This interruption seems to particularly take place between paranoia and social acceptance the next moment, but not between feeling accepted on paranoid feeling the next moment.</p><p>Improvements in social interaction (because of their central importance for human beings) may be one of the indirect mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of mindfulness-based interventions in depression. Feeling paranoid and not accepted during social interaction may become detrimental for wellbeing, leading to increased isolation <xref rid="pone.0066747-Green1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Earlier work shows that dispositional and state mindfulness predict self-regulatory behaviour and positive emotional states <xref rid="pone.0066747-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Thereby, MBCT may prevent individuals from becoming socially isolated and developing additional symptoms, for example social anhedonia. Moreover, the interpretation of events is at the heart of affective dysregulation, according to influential cognitive theories <xref rid="pone.0066747-Harvey1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. MBCT may weaken the impact of paranoia on affective dysregulation by promoting a different relationship to intrusive thoughts (aware yet detached; <xref rid="pone.0066747-Greeson1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>) as well as self-compassion <xref rid="pone.0066747-Neff1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. By affecting paranoia and its impact on a network of are causally linked symptoms <xref rid="pone.0066747-Cramer1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, MBCT may be able to prevent a cascade of symptoms that would normally result in a worse prognosis and increased risk for need for care in individuals with affective dysregulation. Therefore, MBCT may be particularly suited for individuals suffering from (sub-clinical) paranoia. In early intervention, circular processes that otherwise would take place and induce shifts upward the psychosis continuum may be prevented. ESM is ideally suited to examine these interactions at the most fundamental &#x0201c;micro-level&#x0201d; expression of psychopathology <xref rid="pone.0066747-vanOs2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> and to examine directionality of momentary processes and the smallest building blocks that may eventually form part of a mental illness. More research is necessary to investigate whether MBCT also improves feeling accepted during social interaction when feelings of paranoia are more pronounced (e.g., as in individuals in an acute psychotic episode or at ultra-high risk to develop a psychotic disorder).</p><p>Only a handful of small RCTs using mindfulness-based therapies in participants with psychotic symptoms exist and it is difficult to compare the current study with earlier work because of differences in sample characteristics (sub-clinical feelings of suspiciousness vs. psychotic patients) and employed methodology (experience sampling vs. retrospective questionnaires). Two small randomized trials showed that ACT significantly reduces distress related to hallucinations <xref rid="pone.0066747-Gaudiano1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066747-Gaudiano2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> as well as re-hospitalization for in-patients with psychosis <xref rid="pone.0066747-Bach2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, with effects extending to up to 1 year post-discharge <xref rid="pone.0066747-Bach4" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Three other studies in individuals with a psychotic disorder examined the effect of MBCT <xref rid="pone.0066747-Chadwick1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066747-Chadwick2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066747-Langer1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> compared to waiting list control conditions and found improvements in clinical functioning and mindfulness. Recently, improvements in psychological symptoms, command hallucinations, negative symptoms, depression and crisis contacts were reported after mindfulness-based therapies in psychosis <xref rid="pone.0066747-White1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066747-vanderValk1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066747-Shawyer1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Our findings extend these findings to real-life paranoia in the context of major mood disorder, and provide a framework for an understanding of the (psychological) mechanisms underlying these positive clinical changes.</p><p>Some strengths and limitations of the current RCT should be mentioned. An important observation is that conclusions are limited to subclinical paranoia. One limitation concerns the absence of an active control group. Moreover, we had no measure of MBCT fidelity with respect to both adherence and competence. For some of the ESM variables used in the current study, single item measures were used. ESM requires selectivity in choosing one's items, because participants have to answer them so frequently (in this study, up to 120 times). While construct validity may suffer due to these restrictions, ecological validity and reliability of the estimation are strongly boosted <xref rid="pone.0066747-Delespaul2" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. These particular single-item measures items have been used in several ESM studies in our research group (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0066747-Simons1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>) and have demonstrated predictive and ecological validity. The momentary paranoia scores of the current sample with residual mood complaints were elevated compared to the general population, but were below the momentary paranoia scores of (paranoid) psychotic patients.Strengths include the large sample size and sufficient power for the analysis of group by time interaction effects. Examining (subclinical) paranoid ideas in a sample with affective dysregulation has the advantage that patterns underlying psychosis remain relative plastic, so that changes in psychological processes related to paranoia may be investigated more easily. The most important asset of the current study is the use of repeated assessment of paranoia and social acceptance in daily life, enabling fine-grained examination of changes in psychological processes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0066747.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
