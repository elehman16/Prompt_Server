In addition, the magnification using bNBI with dual focus (bNBI-DF) allows the prediction of the polyp&#x02019;s histology. This multicenter randomised controlled trial was conceived to compare the ADR of high definition white light endoscopy (HD-WLE) vs bNBI during withdrawal of screening colonoscopies. No difference was found in ADR between HD-WLE and bNBI. The prediction of diminutive distal polyps with bNBI-DF was satisfactory according to the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy&#x02019;s threshold.</p><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Its incidence in Asia-Pacific region has been rising at an alarming rate[<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Screening colonoscopy and polypectomy have been shown to reduce the mortality related to colorectal cancer[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Despite its effectiveness, the potential to miss polyps can range between 15% to 30% with screening colonoscopy[<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Current guidelines recommend removal of all visible polyps (except benign diminutive distal polyps) and subjection to histological assessment, irrespective of their endoscopic morphological features. This could make colonoscopy a less cost effective screening strategy[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Novel image enhanced endoscopic technologies have the potential to overcome some of the limitations of standard while light endoscopy (WLE) by increasing the detection rate of polyps/neoplasms and providing real-time histological diagnosis.</p><p>Narrow band imaging (NBI) is one of the most widely available and convenient to use technologies developed. Narrowed bandwidth light is used to visualize superficial vasculature and mucosal pit patterns in real-time[<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The light penetrates the mucosa and submucosa and is absorbed by hemoglobin in surface microvessels, which appear as linear darker structures[<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This enables the endoscopist to differentiate thicker and more irregular vascular landmarks. Multiple classification systems based on surface pit-pattern and vascular pattern have been developed and validated to differentiate hyperplastic polyps from adenomatous polyps[<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This real-time differentiation has been proposed as a part of &#x0201c;resect and discard&#x0201d; strategy in which diminutive polyps (measuring &#x0003c; 5 mm) are resected without histological assessment and hyperplastic polyps in rectosigmoid region are left <italic>in situ</italic>[<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This approach could confer substantial cost savings by avoiding unwarranted histological evaluation[<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and may avoid complications related to polypectomy[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Few published studies showed no significant difference in adenoma detection rates (ADRs) between NBI and WLE[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Only one meta-analysis demonstrated an increased accuracy of NBI over WLE in characterising colonic polyps with hierarchical summary receiver-operating characteristic curves exceeding 0.90[<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Dimmer images compared to WLE[<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], type of endoscopes and monitors used (high <italic>vs</italic> low resolution), inconsistent color enhancement settings and endoscopists&#x02019; experience have been proposed as potential reasons for the unimpressive performance of NBI.</p><p>Recently, a newer generation NBI system has been introduced. The system appears to provide brighter NBI (bNBI) images (by 2 fold) in a high-definition (HD) mode and has the option of further magnifying a particular target with the dual focus (DF) magnification function, up to 65 times. These provide an in-depth view of desired areas of the mucosa with clear and crisp images, which potentially may improve polyp detection as well as characterisation.</p><p>In this study we hypothesized that, when compared to high definition white light endoscopy (HD-WLE), the newer generation colonoscopes with the brighter NBI capability and the bNBI with dual focus (bNBI-DF) magnification mode could improve ADR and accurately predict polyp histology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>We performed a prospective multicenter randomised controlled trial across four centers in the Asia Pacific region (The Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong; The King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thailand; Changi General Hospital, Singapore and The Lyell McEwin Hospital, Australia) from October 2010 to April 2012. Institutional medical and ethics committees of each participating hospital approved the study protocol. The study was registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 01422577).</p></sec><sec><title>Study population</title><p>We recruited subjects who were referred for outpatient screening colonoscopy across four centers during the study period. All patients were 40 years and older with no significant medical comorbidities and met the criteria for average risk for the colorectal cancer with no previous colonoscopies in the last five years. Patients were excluded if they were on anti-platelets or anticoagulants, had any colorectal surgical resection, inflammatory bowel disease, familial colorectal cancer syndromes (familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer), were unable to provide written informed consent or had poor bowel preparation.</p><p>All participating subjects were informed about the study and written informed consent was obtained before initiation of the procedure. Participants were allowed to have clear fluids on the day before the procedure and were given four liters of polyethyleneglycol as bowel preparation followed by a 6-h fast (previous day preparation). Appropriate doses of conscious sedation (Fentanyl and Midazolam &#x000b1; Propofol) were given prior to and during the procedure.</p><p>Eleven endoscopists participated in the study. Each of the endoscopists had extensive experience with the use of NBI in colonoscopy having performed more than 2000 procedures each using the earlier generation colonoscopes with NBI. The CF-HQ 190 or 290 series colonoscopes with the DF mode for magnification (Olympus, Tokyo Co. Ltd) were used for all patients. The colonoscope was connected to a CLV video processor with images transmitted to HD monitors (1280 &#x000d7; 1024 pixels). All participating endoscopists were consultants who had experience with an earlier generation of NBI scopes.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation</title><p>Subjects were randomised to receive the examination during withdrawal either in the HD-WLE or in the bNBI mode, followed by bNBI-DF to characterise each polyp that was identified in both arms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The colonoscope was inserted using HD-WLE until caecum was reached, in all subjects. Randomisation took place once the caecum or appendiceal orifice was identified and adequacy of bowel preparation was established as per the modified Aronchick scale[<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Subjects with suboptimal bowel preparation were excluded. Patients were randomised according to a computer-generated randomisation scheme in blocks of twenty. Allocation to HD-WLE or bNBI mode of withdrawal was kept in a concealed envelope and revealed by a research assistant to the endoscopist just before withdrawal was initiated. A dedicated nurse assistant monitored both insertion (time to reach caecum from insertion) and withdrawal (time of scope removal from initiation of withdrawal) times with a stopwatch. During insertion, the stopwatch was paused during patient position change or while exerting abdominal pressure to facilitate colonoscope advancement. Similarly, the stopwatch was paused during withdrawal when biopsies or polypectomies were performed. The withdrawal time was set to a minimum of 6 min in both bNBI and HD-WLE arms and endoscopists were deliberately reminded of the time during the withdrawal phase.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study flow chart. bNBI: Bright narrow band imaging.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="WJGE-9-273-g001"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>Colonoscope withdrawal commenced from the caecum with the patient in the left lateral position and was carried out according to randomisation. Location of each polyp was identified using anatomical landmarks and categorised into either the right or left side of the colon. The size of each polyp was assessed using diameter of the opened biopsy forceps (7.5 mm) or the diameter of the snare used. Identified polyps were characterised by using bNBI-DF mode in both arms.</p><p>Characterisation of polyps was made by bNBI-DF using Sano&#x02019;s classification, which has been found to be valid tool for predicting polyp histology[<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The classification was based on vascular pattern on the surface of the polyp. Characterisation of polyps was made with high confidence if the polyp demonstrated endoscopic features, which were strongly suggestive of its pathology according to Sano&#x02019;s classification. Polyps were characterised with low confidence if exposure was limited secondary to non-removable debris, inadequate focus or if the polyp demonstrated features of more than one Sano&#x02019;s class.</p><p>The preferred mode of polypectomy was left to the endoscopists&#x02019; discretion. Once the polypectomy was performed, mucosal viewing was switched back to respective mode as per randomisation. Each identified polyp was resected and retrieved into an individual container for pathologic examination. Pathologists with experience in gastrointestinal tract, who were blinded for the endoscopic mode of the examination, evaluated all resected polyps.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome of the study was to compare the ADR, defined as percentage of patients with one or more adenomatous polyp detected, between the two arms (HD-WLE <italic>vs</italic> bNBI). The secondary outcome was to assess if bNBI-DF could meet the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE)&#x02019;s Preservation and Incorporation of Valuable Endoscopic Innovation (PIVI) threshold in predicting histopathology of colon polyps[<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We only assessed the second criteria from the PIVI guideline [where the technology, when used with high confidence, should provide &#x0003e; 90% negative predictive value (NPV) for adenomatous histology in diminutive rectosigmoid polyps] as we believed that this strategy would be more practical and generalizable.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>We previously conducted a colonoscopy screening study amongst average risk Hong Kong Chinese subjects older than 50 years of age and found an ADR of 30%[<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The prevalence of colon adenomas in asymptomatic subjects in Asia is unknown and is likely to vary across different ethnic groups. The sample size evaluation was based on assumption that improved optics and bNBI is superior to the HD-WLE mode in detection of colon polyps. We thus hypothesized that bNBI would be able to detect more adenomas than HD-WLE. A sample size of 500 per group was required to detect a relative risk of 1.28 (<italic>i.e</italic>., a difference of 38.4% <italic>vs</italic> 30%) with a power of 80% and a type 1 two-sided error of 0.05.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Continuous variables were compared using the <italic>t</italic>-test if normally distributed. Categorical variables were compared using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test when appropriate. The Mann-Whitney&#x02019;s <italic>U</italic> test was used for skewed variables. To compare the detection of all adenomas and hyperplastic polyps (per-polyp analysis), the Poisson regression model or negative binomial regression model was used. The accuracy of bNBI-DF in examining early colorectal lesions was evaluated using Sano&#x02019;s classification compared to the final histopathology and measures of sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV), and NPV; and their correspondent 95%CIs were performed. These diagnostic tests were calculated by means of the generalized estimating equations to account for the clustering of polyps within patients.</p><p>In addition, we performed statistical analysis to examine the effect of the withdrawal time, entered as a covariate, on the ADR on a per-patient level. Specifically, a multiple logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratio (OR) and its 95%CI with all variables (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) excluding time taken to reach cecum, entered as covariates. The presence or absence of one or more adenomas was considered a response variable. Mode of withdrawal (HD-WLE or bNBI) was forced to remain into all regression models. Two-tailed <italic>P</italic> value lower than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Multiple outcomes were tested without adjusting for the type <bold>I</bold> error rate. Statistical tests were performed with the use of SPSS software (version 19.0, SPSS, Chicago, IL, United States).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Characteristics of patients and colonoscopy performance in both groups <italic>n</italic> (%)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="center"><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Parameters</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>bNBI (<italic>n</italic> = 495)</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>WLE (<italic>n</italic> = 511)</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold><italic>P</italic> value</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody align="center"><tr><td colspan="4" align="left" rowspan="1">Patients</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Men</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">210 (42.43)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">237 (46.38)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.207</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age, mean &#x000b1; SD</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">58.31 &#x000b1; 6.17</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">58.36 &#x000b1; 6.13</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.904</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BMI, mean &#x000b1; SD</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.75 &#x000b1; 3.29</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.74 &#x000b1; 2.99</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.942</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Current smoker</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">24 (4.9)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">29 (5.7)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.536</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Current drinker</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">38 (7.7)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">44 (8.7)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.815</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Current use of NSAID</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (1.2)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">9 (1.8)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.705</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Current use of aspirin</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">13 (2.6)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">22 (4.3)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.345</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Current use of warfarin</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (0.4)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.232</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4" align="left" rowspan="1">Comorbidities</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hypertension</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">123 (24.8)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">131 (25.6)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.774</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Diabetes</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">56 (11.3)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">32 (6.3)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.005</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ischemic heart disease</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 (2.0)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 (2.0)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.943</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Chronic obstructive airway disease</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (0.4)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.15</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Previous stroke</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (0.2)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (0.4)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.582</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cirrhosis</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (0.2)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (0.2)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.982</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gastro-esophageal reflux</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 (2)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (1.6)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.587</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Dyslipidemia</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">31 (6.3)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">29 (5.7)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.694</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">History of cancer</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">19 (3.8)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">12 (2.3)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.172</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4" align="left" rowspan="1">Examination time (min), mean &#x000b1; SD</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Time to cecum</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.66 &#x000b1; 4.56</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.06 &#x000b1; 4.94</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.183</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Time for withdrawal</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.23 &#x000b1; 6.36</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.84 &#x000b1; 5.03</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c; 0.0001</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>bNBI: Bright narrow band imaging; WLE: White light endoscopy.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 1006 patients were enrolled during the 17-mo study period (October 2010 to April 2012), of which 44.4% were men and the mean age was 58 years.

In addition, bNBI-DF was used to characterise polyps using the Sano&#x02019;s classification. We did not find a statistically significant improvement in ADR with bNBI when compared to HD-WLE. Polyp characterisation was effective with bNBI-DF in differentiating adenomas from hyperplastic polyps in diminutive distal polyps, meeting the second PIVI standard.</p><p>The study design was similar to that of Rex and Helbig, who evaluated an earlier version of NBI[<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Their study represented a single operator experience, in contrast to this study, which involved several academic centers. In a recent tandem study, Leung et al[<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] compared bNBI to HD-WLE in colonoscopy. Subjects were submitted to bNBI first and followed by HD-WLE or <italic>vice versa</italic>. The use of bNBI was associated with a higher ADR with a higher number of polyps detected per subject. However, for the HD-WLE group, the older generation 260 series colonoscopes were used. Illumination with 260 series colonoscopes is considerably less sharp when compared to the 190/290 series colonoscopes. Hence, one cannot be certain if the superiority of bNBI in finding adenomas was not a result of a &#x0201c;brighter processor&#x0201d;. In another study by Wallace et al[<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], average risk subjects presenting for screening were randomised to receive the examination by a standard colonoscope (H180) or a dual focus colonoscope (HQ-190). ADR were similar between both groups (52% <italic>vs</italic> 50%). The NPV for diminutive rectosigmoid polyps were 96 and 97% respectively, which was not too dissimilar to our study.</p><p>Multiple randomised studies and a meta-analysis compared ADRs of NBI with conventional colonoscopy. The results have thus far been mixed with very few studies[<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] demonstrating improved ADRs with NBI. Despite having endoscopists with considerable experience in using NBI and a large sample size, we were unable to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in ADR. Actually, this study suggests that NBI could actually decrease the ADR if used exclusively for overview of the whole colon during withdrawal. The similar ADRs achieved in this study may be attributed to the fact that improved resolution could be achieved using the same high definition processor for both bNBI and HD-WLE. These findings are not too dissimilar to studies conducted in the past with older generation systems[<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>-<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies conducted using bNBI to differentiate adenomatous from non-adenomatous lesions demonstrated accuracies ranging from 77% to 93%[<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>-<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Sessile serrated adenomas/polyps (SSA/Ps), which endoscopically may resemble hyperplastic polyps but have malignant potential, were detected in 1.8% of all polyps. Previous studies have shown the prevalence of SSAs ranging from 1% to 7%[<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], but a more recent study shows that the reported prevalence of SSA/Ps is raising with the years and it can get up to 15.8%[<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This difference may be due in part to the different prevalence rate in the studied population, which included predominantly a younger Asian cohort. These polyps unfortunately do not fit into any of the available classifications at the time the study was performed.</p><p>This study adds strength to the usefulness of bNBI in characterising colonic lesions in real-time. This &#x0201c;endopathology&#x0201d; concept supports the &#x0201c;resect and discard&#x0201d; approach that carries many practical advantages. In a simulation model by Hassan et al[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], this strategy resulted in a substantial economic benefit without any impact on efficacy. Kessler et al[<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] demonstrated that endoscopic diagnosis of polyp histology during colonoscopy and forgoing pathologic examination would result in substantial up-front cost savings whilst the downstream consequences of the resulting incorrect surveillance intervals appear to be negligible. bNBI-DF used in this study not only successfully met the second PIVI threshold established by the ASGE but also demonstrated the highest accuracy so far in differentiating adenomas from hyperplastic polyps[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. More than 85% of polyps were characterised with high confidence and the overall sensitivity and specificity demonstrated was significantly higher than in other studies[<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>This study has some limitations. First, the mean withdrawal time was prolonged in both arms, but particularly in the bNBI&#x02019;s arm (11.23 min <italic>vs</italic> 9.84 min). In a multiple regression model, examination of the colon in the HD-WLE mode was associated with a better ADR. Similar to this study, longer withdrawal times with bNBI were also noted in a meta-analysis by Jin et al[<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] as well as by Rex et al[<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This could be potentially explained by the lack of confidence in assessing the mucosa in an overview mode with bNBI, although endoscopists were experienced with previous versions of the modality. The ADRs in both arms of the study were higher than the target ADR set by the United States Multi-Society Task Force (men &#x0003e; 25% and women &#x0003e; 15%)[<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Longer withdrawal times and high-definition imaging are the possible reasons for the overall higher adenoma detection rates.</p><p>In conclusion, ADR was not different between bNBI and HD-WLE. Male sex, larger withdrawal time and older age where positively correlated with ADR. When adjusted for withdrawal time, HD-WLE had higher ADR. With bNBI-DF, 85% of the polyps could be characterised with high confidence, of which more than 95% of them were predicted accurately. The most worthwhile strategy to reduce the risks associated with unwarranted polypectomies and save costs incurred with pathological assessment of polyps could be a &#x0201c;combination strategy&#x0201d; where withdrawal is performed using HD-WLE and polyp characterisation with bNBI-DF.</p></sec><sec><title>COMMENTS</title><sec><title>Background</title><p>Colorectal polyps are the precursors of colorectal cancer and their removal through colonoscopy is effective in preventing colorectal cancer.
