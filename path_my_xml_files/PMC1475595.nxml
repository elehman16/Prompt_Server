Early detection and prompt treatment is a key component of the global strategy for malaria control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Across Africa, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum </italic>resistance to common affordable antimalarial drugs, chloroquine and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine has reached very high levels, and noticably hampered malaria control efforts in the region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In Nigeria, chloroquine and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine have been the first and second line anti-malaria drugs respectively but evidence from local research spanning a period of two decades show that the therapeutic efficacy of these two drugs have deteriorated due to high levels <italic>of P. falciparum </italic>resistance in all parts of the country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The World Health Organization recommends that combination treatment rather than monotherapy should be used in areas where multi-drug resistance to <italic>P. falciparum </italic>is a problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Combination drugs act at different sites or have different mechanisms of action, achieve better cure rates and are more likely to delay development of parasite resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Artemisinin-based combination treatments (ACTs) are preferred because artemisinin compounds have rapid parasite and fever clearance effects and also reduce gametocyte rate with the potential to reduce transmission. Artemisinin derivatives have short half life but the component combination drug, with a longer duration of action, makes up for this by providing sustained activity to eliminate remaining parasites[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The artemisinin-based combination treatment regimens are more expensive than each drug used singly, but their advantages over monotherapy far outweigh the cost. Artemisinin-based combination treatments are recommended for use as first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria, even in resource-poor areas where multi-drug resistant <italic>P. falciparum </italic>infection is a problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. ACTs have been used for a long time as first-line treatment in some South-East Asian countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The options under consideration in Nigeria for ACTs are amodiaquine with artesunate, or artemether-lumefantrine. Artemether-lumefantrine has reportedly high cure rates in observational studies, but controlled trials comparing it against other artemisinin containing regimens are few [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. It has an advantage that the component drugs are coformulated in the same tablet but it is expensive, even at discounted rates, and requires patients to take six doses. Amodiaquine plus artesunate is less expensive, but not co-formulated, and therefore more likely to be misused as monotherapy. It is believed that cure rates of this combination regimen may be lower than with artemether-lumefantrine because of parasite resistance to amodiaquine.</p><p>The Nigerian government supported randomized controlled trials in the six geopolitical zones of the country to assess the clinical efficacy and parasitological response of <italic>P. falciparum </italic>to combinations of artemether/lumefantrine and artesunate plus amodiaquine in treating uncomplicated childhood malaria. This paper describes one of these trials, conducted in the far-south geo-political zone within the Niger Delta region of the country. <italic>P. falciparum </italic>resistance to chloroquine was first documented in this region in 1987 and the current rate of resistance to chloroquine and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) exceeds 80% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study area and population</title><p>This study was conducted in Ikot Ansa a rural community within the Calabar Municipal Local Council area of Cross River State, Nigeria. The area has a projected population of 222,100, with 44,420 being under five years of age. This area lies within the tropical rainforest belt of southeastern Nigeria. The annual rainfall is 2,000&#x02013;3,000 mm, within the rainy season lasting from April to October. There are two predominant ethnic groups, <italic>Efiks </italic>and <italic>Ejagham</italic>. The people's main occupations are subsistence farming, fishing and logging. Malaria is holoendemic in the study area with high and perennial transmission, especially in the rainy season (from April to November). The study was conducted in the months of September, October and November, 2004.</p></sec><sec><title>Patient enrolment</title><p>Children were enrolled if they had uncomplicated malaria, and fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: residence in study area, age 6&#x02013;59 months, axillary temperature &#x02264;37.5&#x000b0;C and parasite density of 1,000&#x02013;200,000 asexual parasites/&#x003bc;l of blood, and informed consent by parents/guardian. Children with packed cell volume (PCV) &#x0003c;15%, severe malnutrition, other signs of severe malaria or illness including any "danger sign" (viz. inability to drink or breastfeed, vomiting everything, recent history of convulsion, lethargy or unconsciousness, inability to sit or stand up, were excluded from the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Ethical approval was given by the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital Ethical Committee. A written informed consent was obtained from each parent/legal guardian of eligible participants prior to enrolment.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>Participants were randomized by simple random sampling technique (drawing lots) in blocks of ten (10) to receive either artemether-lumefantrine (AL) or artesunate+amodiaquine. Allocation sequence was concealed in opaque, sealed and serially numbered envelopes. Study treatment was started on the day of randomization (day zero) and completed on day two, while follow-up continued for 14 days. Clinical examination plus body weight and height were recorded on day zero. Follow-up visits were scheduled on days 1, 2, 3, 7 and 14. On each visit, clinical examination including axillary temperature and thick blood film specimen obtained to screen for presence of malaria parasites and density was assessed by light microscopy. Packed cell volume (PCV) was estimated on day zero and repeated on day 14.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>Artesunate and amodiaquine were given orally at 4 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg body weight respectively, once daily on days 0, 1 and 2 with amodiaquine reduced to 5 mg/kg on day 2. Artemether/lumefantrine was given as 20/120 mg tablets. Participants weighing 5&#x02013;14 kg received one tablet (20/120 mg), two tablets (40/240 mg) for body weight 1524 kg and three tablets for those weighing 25 &#x02013; 35 kg. Each participant had a total of six doses of AL, with each dose at 12-hourly intervals for 3 days. Treatment was directly supervised by the research nurse and patients observed for 30 minutes. Drugs were re-administered to those who vomited within this period. Tepid sponging, exposure and administration of paracetamol at 15 mg/kg body weight were used to reduce high fever. Participants that did not return on schedule for follow-up were visited at home on the same day.</p></sec><sec><title>Laboratory investigation</title><p>Thick and thin blood smears were prepared and stained in 3% Giemsa solution for 30 minutes. The smears were read to 100 fields with quantification of <italic>P. falciparum </italic>asexual parasitaemia on the thick smear. Parasites were enumerated using thick film as described by Shute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The parasite density (per &#x003bc;l of blood) was calculated, assuming a normal leucocyte level of 8,000/&#x003bc;l. The thin film was used to speciate the parasites. Packed Cell Volume (PCV) was measured on days 0 and 14 with sample collected in a heparinized capillary tube and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 10,000 G.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis</title><p>Data generated were recorded in a log book, and individual patients case record files.

This study has shown rapid parasite and fever clearance in children treated with 6-dose regimen of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and 3-day course of artesunate plus amodiaquine (AAMQ). This is characteristic of artemisinin combination therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. It was also demonstrated that these ACT regimens were tolerable among under-five children in this locality. The ACTs were not compared with existing first-line and second-line drugs for uncomplicated malaria (chloroquine or sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine,) because of very high treatment failures (in excess of 80%) recently reported for both drugs in the study area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Administering such ineffective treatments to ill, under-five children could significantly increase the risk of poor treatment outcome.</p><p>The cure rates obtained for a 6-dose regimen of AL and a 3-day course of AAMQ were high (&#x0003e; 80%) but fell short of therapeutic efficacy levels reported in other areas. Day-14 cure rates for AAMQ were 91%, 93%, and 98% in Kenya, Senegal and Gabon, with lower day-28 cure rates of 68%, 82% and 85%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Another report of 14-day in-vivo study of AAMQ in Mozambique showed a parasitological cure rate of 94.3% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The 14-day cure rate obtained for a 6-dose regimen of AL in the present study is comparable with those reported for 4-dose regimen in other trials, but lower than cure rates obtained in other 6-dose trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. A 42-day cure rate of 93.6% has been documented in a recent randomized controlled trial of 6-dose regimen of AL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>This study has demonstrated comparable therapeutic efficacy and tolerability for a 6 dose regimen of artemether-lumefantrine and a 3-day course of artesunate plus amodiaquine. This apparent lack of difference in effects may be because the study samples were small and lacked statistical power to detect significant difference at 95% confidence level.</p><p>The short follow-up period of 14 days is another methodological limitation of this study. Recent observations have shown that treatment failures affecting artemisininbased combination treatment regimens tend to occur after 21 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The minimum follow-up period currently recommended this type of studies is 28 days. This trial started before the evidence that 14-day follow-up period is inadequate for in-vivo efficacy studies of ACTs became overwhelming.</p><p>The Nigerian government has reviewed the malaria treatment policy, replacing chloroquine and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine with artemisinin-based combination treatment (ACT) as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria. This change in policy has been informed by evidence from local studies like the one reported here [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Larger effectiveness studies with higher statistical power than the present study will be needed to ascertain the effects of these drug combinations in this area. Prospective sentinel monitoring of the use and effectiveness of the new ACTs at strategic geographical locations in the country would provide reliable evidence for health planning and future policy reviews.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>Martin Meremikwu, Emmanuel Ezedinachi and Donald Ordu developed the protocol and supervised the trial.
