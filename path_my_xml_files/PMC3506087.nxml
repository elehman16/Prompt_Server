The aim of the present study was to determine the safety and the efficacy of noradrenalin in comparison with midodrine-octreotide in patients with HRS.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>This study was registered to the Iranian Registry of Clinical trials (IRCT). This study was a single-center, randomized, clinical trial that performed in Alzahra hospital, Isfahan, Iran. Since March 2011 to January 2012, twenty-three patients were enrolled in the study. Eligible patients were allocated in 2 groups. In the first group, patients received infusion of NA with the dose of 0.1&#x02013;0.7 &#x003bc;g/kg/min, and in the other groups, patients received octreotide 100-200 &#x003bc;g subcutaneously 3 times daily and midodrine 5-15 mg orally 3 times daily. In both study groups, patient received albumin infusion in addition to noradrenalin or midodrine-octreotide.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Complete response of HRS was observed in 8 of the 11 patients (73%) treated with noradrenalin and in 9 of the 12 patients (75%) treated with midodrine-octreotide (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). HRS recurred after treatment withdrawal in 2 of 11 in NA and 3 of 12 in MO group. That shows no significant difference between 2 groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>We deduce that NA has the same efficacy and safety with MO and can induce a complete response in high percentage of the patients. Moreover, we observed no significant differences in the recurrence rate and outcomes after 3 months among the patients in both study groups; this result could support the use of NA in HRS management. The IRCT ID is: IRCT201107217085N1.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Clinical trial</kwd><kwd>hepatorenal syndrome</kwd><kwd>midodrine</kwd><kwd>noradrenalin</kwd><kwd>octreotide</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is known as development of acute renal failure in a patient who usually has advanced liver disease.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] HRS has 2 clinical patterns: Type 1 HRS is an acute form of HRS, characterized by rapidly progressive renal failure with a median survival of 4 weeks; Type 2 HRS has slower course of renal failure, with a median survival of about 6 months.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>The criteria for HRS are based on the following mechanisms: Renal failure in HRS is functional and caused by marked intra-renal arteriolar vasoconstriction and extra-renal vasodilatation, and plasma volume expansion does not improve renal failure,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Liver transplantation is still the treatment of choice in patients with HRS.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] However, achievement to this ideal management even in the advanced care settings has major obstacles. Accordingly, several attempts have been made recently for obtaining some effective, rapid strategies for improving renal function and extending the patients&#x02019; survival before transplantation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Arterial vasodilatation, mainly in the splanchnic circulation, has an important role in the hemodynamic changes and in renal function in cirrhosis, so using vasoconstrictor drugs has made a big stride in this path as they have brought about promising outcomes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Their effectiveness in increasing mean arterial pressure (MAP) and improvement in renal function has been significant, which may also be enhanced by administration of plasma expanders, especially human albumin.</p><p>As it is mentioned above, vasoconstrictors are effective drugs in management of HRS. There are previous data that suggest that midodrine plus octreotide are highly effective and safe in HRS management.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Moreover, there is only one pilot study, which evaluated the efficacy of noradrenalin (NA) in management of HRS.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Considering that NA is a cheap and widely available drug,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] designing a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NA in comparison with midodrine-octreotide (MO) seemed to be necessary.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to determine the safety and efficacy of NA in comparison with MO in patients with HRS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Patients and settings</title><p>This single-center, randomized, clinical trial was performed in Alzahra hospital, Isfahan, Iran.

Intravenous albumin (20 g/100 mL) was initiated to maintain central venous pressure (CVP) between 10 and 15 cm H2O. The measurement of arterial blood pressure was performed manually every 4 hours while CVP and urine output were checked every 8 hours.</p><p>In all patients&#x02019; serum and urine sodium, blood coagulation states were checked. Blood and urine samples were provided prior to the initiation of treatment and daily during the study. We also checked plasma rennin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone by radioactive immune assay (RIA) at the initiation and at the end of treatment.</p><p>In the first group, patients received a continuous infusion of NA at an initial dose of 0.1 &#x003bc;g/kg/min, aimed to attain an increase in MAP of at least 10 mm Hg. In case of lack of increase in baseline MAP of at least 10 mmHg, noradrenalin was increased every 4 hours in steps of 0.05 &#x003bc;g/kg/min up to the maximum dose of 0.7 &#x003bc;g/kg/min.</p><p>NA was administered either until HRS reversal or for a maximum of 15 days.

Midodrine was administered orally at an initial dose of 5 mg 3 times daily, and in case of lack of increase in baseline MAP of at least 15 mmHg, midodrine was increased every 24 hours in steps of 5 mg 3 times daily up to the maximum dose of 15 mg 3 times daily, if needed. In addition, an amount of 20 to 60 g/d of albumin was infused in all patients to maintain CVP in the range of 10 to 15 mmHg.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Assessments and outcomes</title><p>HRS was diagnosed according to the International Ascites Club (Club criteria): Cirrhotic patients with serum creatinine &#x0003e;1.5 mg/dL without improvement following diuretic withdrawal and plasma volume expansion with intravenous albumin and in the absence of (a) shock, (b) renal or gastrointestinal fluid loss, (c) recent management with nephrotoxic drug, (d) recent ongoing bacterial infection, (e) proteinuria &#x02265;500 mg/dL, and (f) ultra sonographic evidences of parenchymal renal disease or urinary tract obstruction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>Patients considered as complete response (reversal of HRS) to the therapy when the decrease of 30% or greater of serum creatinine level compared with the baseline value to a final value of 1.5 mg/dL (133 &#x003bc;mol/L) or lower during treatment were observed.</p><p>HRS recurrence diagnosed by increase in serum creatinine level of 50% or more with respect to the lowest value after therapy in patients with complete response with a final value above 1.5 mg/dL (133 lmol/L) during the follow-up period.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Sample size and randomization</title><p>Sample size was calculated to be 11 in each group, using statistical formula with considering that &#x003b1; =0.05 and &#x003b2; =0.2 (power =80%).

As it is explained in [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>], NA led to HRS reversal in 8 of 11 (72.72%) patients; on other hand, MO led to complete response in 9 of 12 (75%). There was no significant difference in complete response and the outcome after 3 months, which shows the same efficacy of these two methods. This finding is in line with previous studies in this field.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] One of them that performed by Alessandria <italic>et al</italic>. compared NA and Terlipresin in 22 patients with HRS. They revealed that NA is as effective and safe as Terlipresin. They also conclude that since NA is a cheap and widely-available drug, it can be used in HRS management.</p><p>HRS recurred after treatment withdrawal in 2 of 11 in NA and 3 of 12 in MO group. That shows no significant difference between 2 groups. This low percentage of recurrence in patients who treated with NA is in agreement with previous studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>As it is shown in [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>], the parameters including MAP, CVP, GFR, urine volume, urine sodium, Aldostrone, creatinine, and PRA showed significant change before and after the study in both study groups.</p><p>We also observed significant change in BUN and creatinine in NA group, and on other hand, albumin in MO group. These changes didn&#x02019;t observe in the other group. Glomerular filtration rate and sodium excretion remained below normal values despite the response to therapy. The reasons why renal function fails to normalize in these patients is unknown. The same results were obtained in previous researches in this field.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>Although NA can worsen the liver function due to decrease in liver blood flow, our results didn&#x02019;t show significant changes in ALT, MELD, or CHILD score. In contrast with our study, previous data showed that treatment with telmipresin can significantly reduce MELD score in patients with HRS.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>Our study also had some limitations; we suggest further multicenter and multinational, blinded, controlled trials to confirm the results of the present study.</p><p>In conclusion, we deduce that NA has the same efficacy and safety with MO and can induce a complete response in high percentage of the patients. We also observed the same recurrence rate and outcomes after 3 months among the patients in both study groups; this result could support the use of NA in HRS management.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> This study was supported by a grant from Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (Grant No: 390210)</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gluud</surname><given-names>LL</given-names></name><name><surname>Christensen</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Christensen</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Krag</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Systematic review of randomized trials on vasoconstrictor drugs for hepatorenal syndrome</article-title><source>Hepatology</source><year>2010</year><volume>51</volume><fpage>576</fpage><lpage>84</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19885875</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fagundes</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Gines</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Hepatorenal syndrome: A severe, but treatable, cause of kidney failure in cirrhosis</article-title><source>Am J Kidney Dis</source><year>2012</year><volume>59</volume><fpage>874</fpage><lpage>85</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22480795</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gines</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Guevara</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Arroyo</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Rodes</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Hepatorenal syndrome</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>2003</year><volume>362</volume><fpage>1819</fpage><lpage>27</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14654322</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Arroyo</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Gines</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Gerbes</surname><given-names>AL</given-names></name><name><surname>Dudley</surname><given-names>FJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Gentilini</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Laffi</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Definition and diagnostic criteria of refractory ascites and hepatorenal syndrome in cirrhosis.
