Although Phoresor<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>&#x00399;&#x00399; PM850; IOMED<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Inc. is not designed for tDCS, it has been widely used for tDCS studies. This device can control current intensity, duration, and ramp up time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>First, we placed three electrodes over C3 (corresponding to the left M1), C4 (corresponding to the right M1) of the international 10-20 EEG system, and the right supra-orbital region. For Uni-tDCS (2 mA for 20 minutes) and sham stimulation (2 mA for 1 minute), we used an anode electrode over C3 and a cathode over the right supraorbital region, and for Bi-tDCS (2 mA for 20 minutes) we used an anode over C3 and a cathode over C4.</p><p>The current was slowly increased to 2 mA from the onset of stimulation in a ramp-up like fashion over 30 sec. For real stimulation, the switch was toggled up and down for an additional 30 sec to match the sham procedure, and the current was then maintained at 2 mA for the remainder of the 20 min, whereas during sham stimulation sessions the current was slowly tapered down to zero over 30 sec. This procedure has been demonstrated to prevent subjects differentiating between real and sham stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. We selected C3 and C4 of the international 10-20 EEG system for stimulation because it has been reported that the primary motor cortex (M1) mediates implicit motor sequence learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and because a neuroimaging study showed that C3 and C4 correspond to the left and right M1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, in the present study, stimulation may have extended beyond M1 due to the large electrode size used.</p><p>The tDCS procedures were administered by a separate investigator who did not participate in outcome measurements or data analysis. Therefore, the subjects and the investigator who determined outcome measures were unaware of the intervention type.</p></sec><sec><title>Serial reaction time task</title><p>We used a serial reaction time task (SRTT) as an outcome measure. The SRTT is a simple task that provides a measure of implicit motor skill learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Subjects performed a total of 20 blocks of key presses with their right hands, and each block was composed of 10 repetitions of a 12-digit length sequence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Subjects were seated in front of a computer screen and asked to press the key corresponding to the location of asterisks with 4 fingers (2<sup>nd </sup>- 5<sup>th</sup>) of the right hand as quickly and as accurately as possible. The task was designed using Superlab pro v.4.0 software (Cedrus Corporation, San Pedro, CA).</p><p>After familiarization using a random block (R' in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), subjects were presented with random (R in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) or predetermined repeating sequence blocks (S in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) separated by resting 30 sec periods. Next blocks were presented when all keys presses were correct.</p><p>For the R' and R blocks, an asterisk appeared randomly in one of four locations on a computer screen, whereas an asterisk appeared in a predetermined repeating sequence in an S block. We used three predetermined repeating sequence S blocks (3-4-2-1-2-4-1-3-4-2-1-3/2-4-1-3-2-1-2-1-3-4-3-4/1-2-1-4-2-3-2-4-3-1-4-3), one for each of the three stimulation types (Uni-tDCS, Bi-tDCS, or sham stimulation) in a randomly selected manner. These R'-R-S blocks were presented at baseline (Pre), immediately (Post 1), and 24 hours after stimulation (Post 2). During stimulation, subjects practiced using the same predetermined repeating sequence S blocks (block 4-8 and 10-14) interrupted by one R block. The ratios of reaction times for the predetermined repeating sequence and the random sequence (shaded S block/R block in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) were used as an outcome measure of motor sequence performance improvements by practice.</p><p>Prior to each session, subjects described their levels of attention, perceived general fatigue, hand fatigue, and task difficulty using a numeric rating scale (range 0 ~ 10; 0 = lowest, 10 = highest).</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>The mean response time per each trial was calculated to quantify motor sequence performance improvements (motor sequence learning) achieved by repeated practice.

We found that combined bilateral stimulation did not improve implicit motor learning more than unilateral stimulation, but that Bi-tDCS and Uni-tDCS did improve implicit motor learning more than sham stimulation.</p><p>Initially we hypothesized that decreasing inter-hemispheric trans-callosal inhibition from non-dominant to dominant M1 by right hemisphere cathodal tDCS in combination with increasing the excitability of dominant M1 by left hemisphere anodal tDCS would improve implicit motor learning more than increasing the excitability of dominant M1 by left hemisphere anodal tDCS alone. However, our findings did not support this hypothesis, although it should be noted that Bi-tDCS showed a tendency to more improve implicit motor learning than Uni-tDCS, as is shown by the raw data presented in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>.</p><p>Recently, Vines et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] found that Bi-tDCS improved motor performance of the non-dominant hand more than Uni-tDCS in healthy subjects, whereas in the present study only a weak trend was found. We believe that this discrepancy may have been caused by the different task paradigm used or the use of the non-dominant hand, because in this previous study a 5 digit sequence and non-dominant left hands were used. It is possible that dominant hands might have already reached a ceiling prior to stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], or that interhemispheric inhibition from non-dominant to dominant hemisphere might be trivial as compared with inhibition from dominant to non-dominant hemisphere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. It is also probable that healthy young subjects are more likely to display the ceiling effect than older subjects or stroke patients in implicit motor learning process. It is also possible that our study was underpowered due to small number of subjects recruited.</p><p>Although the clinical applications of tDCS have expanded, the effects of electrode montages have not been well established. One unique aspect of tDCS application is the use of an electrodes pair. The belief that tDCS increases excitability just at the stimulating site under the anode and decreases excitability under the cathode is changing. Now it is generally believed that tDCS has both a regional effect on the cortex underlying electrodes and a remote effect on brain regions between electrodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Moreover, recently Moliadze et al. addressed the role of the "return" electrode position on tDCS induced excitability changes under an the "active" electrode using a computer model, and showed that the position and size of the ''return" electrode affects the electric field distribution across the entire cortex, and the electric field distribution in cortex directly under the "active"electrode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>According to this view, the anodal effects on C3 during Uni-tDCS and Bi-tDCS differed in the present study, because the return cathode was positioned over the contralateral supraorbital region for Uni-tDCS and over C4 for Bi-tDCS. We used this Bi-tDCS electrode montage hoping to simultaneously up-regulate excitability of the motor cortex over C3 (anodal stimulation), and to down-regulate excitability of the motor cortex over C4 (cathodal stimulation). Recently Lindenberg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] also used the same Bi-tDCS electrode montage used in the present study.</p><p>Extracephalic electrode montages offer another approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. According to this method one electrode is placed over the cortex and the other over an extracephalic region, such as, a shoulder or mastoid process. It would be interesting to compare Uni-tDCS and Bi-tDCS using this extracephalic electrode montage in the future. However, in the present study, we could not exclude the possibility that during Uni-tDCS, the reference cathode on the right supraorbital region, which corresponds to the right prefrontal cortex, might have had some beneficial effect on implicit motor sequence learning, which would have diluted the additive effect of Bi-tDCS over Uni-tDCS. Additional experimental studies are required to investigate the effects of various electrode montages on the effects of tDCS.</p><p>Another possibility is that the electrode size over M1 was large enough to cover the pre-motor cortex, which also would have had a diluting effect on Bi-tDCS versus Uni-tDCS. In a neuroimaging study, it was found that finger sequence performance recruits the pre-motor and supplementary motor cortex as well as the primary motor cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], although we only intended to stimulate M1 as performed in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], in which it was shown that finger sequence performance task results can be influenced by modulating M1 activity.</p><p>In the present study, the reaction times of predetermined repeating sequence in the SRTT decreased regardless of stimulation type, whereas the reaction times of random sequences did not, which implies that implicit motor learning had occurred during training. However decreases in reaction times immediately after sham stimulation tended to diminish at 24 hours, but were maintained after Uni-tDCS and Bi-tDCS, which suggest that tDCS might consolidate implicit motor learning more than Sham stimulation, which is in accordance with a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Our results also reveal that tDCS mainly affected motor performance speed rather than accuracy.</p><p>Subject attention levels could also have contributed to SRTT results, though these were similar across sessions as determined by our numerical rating scale, and thus, we believe that subject attention level differences were adequately taken into account.</p><p>TDCS is easily administered, comfortable for patients, relatively inexpensive and can be administered in combination with rehabilitative training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and for these reasons was recently introduced as an adjuvant strategy for hand motor rehabilitation after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Our results might be relevant to stroke hand motor rehabilitation, although its relevance is limited by potential differences in the implicit motor learning process between healthy subjects and stroke patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, no significant difference was observed between Uni-tDCS and Bi-tDCS in terms of inducing implicit motor sequence learning, although both Uni-tDCS and Bi-tDCS led to greater consolidation of the learned motor sequences than sham stimulation.
