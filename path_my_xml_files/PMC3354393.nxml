Psychologists also believe that self-esteem is a portion of mental health, and they consider the enjoyment of self-esteem as a basic and central cause of the social&#x02013;emotional adjustment of the people.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>Self-esteem involves all the daily activities of humans, so it is one of the most important aspects of one's personality and a determinant of the actualization and behavioral characteristics of human beings, and most of the experts know it as an important and fundamental factor in social and emotional adjustment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] This characteristic is a general feature in all human beings and is not limited or transient, but is fixed and permanent.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] People with a low level of self-esteem should be diagnosed, to improve their self-esteem, with appropriate educational programs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>Students are constantly exposed to stressors and experience numerous problem due to the nature of their life during immigration to other places far from home.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] The studies indicate that students are affected by various psychiatric disorders.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>The PRECEDE model is a model for health education and promotion planning, which is used for changing behavior. Its focus is on behavior change at individual or group levels. Green and Kreuter believe that the PRECEDE model has been considered successful in the application of clinical and field trials. This model provides a framework in which the factors affecting behavior, such as: The predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing factors in the educational and assessment phases are determined. The PRECEDE model can be used as a guideline to analyze health problems or health behaviors, and also to determine knowledge, attitudes, and those beliefs that are effective in changes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>Several studies, particularly in the last 15 years, suggest that self-esteem is considered as a major psychological factor influencing health and quality of life. It has also been determined that a sense of empowerment and value trace is created for every person with increasing his / her self-esteem, and positive changes flourish in them to gain success, such as: academic achievement, more efforts for success, having a high self-esteem, and a great desire to preserve and promote health.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] A research on self-esteem and mental health in Canada showed that the most important mental need in 87.4% of the adolescents was self-esteem.

The studied population was the first year students (the freshman students) of medical sciences from two universities in the north east of Iran.</p><p>Sampling was done initially, based on a pilot study, among universities of medical sciences in the north east of Iran. Two universities were selected that showed a high prevalence of psychological problems among their students and they also had similar academic conditions and situations. Next, one of the two universities was randomly assigned as the case group and the other was identified as the control group. Considering P<sub>1</sub> = 0.27, P<sub>2</sub> = 0.05, Z<sub>&#x003b1;</sub> = 1.96, Z<sub>&#x003b2;</sub> = 1.64, and with confidence interval values of 95%, the sample size was determined to be more than 134 students. The students were randomly selected based on a stratified random sampling method. Following this, they were randomly assigned to two groups of case and control. So, the intervention effect was free from any relationship effects between the groups. Both the groups were matched for age, sex, discipline, and educational degree. The inclusion criteria were, studying in medical science subjects, passing at least one university educational term, and voluntary participation in the study. Exclusion criteria were, having a psychiatric disorder and not volunteering for participation in the study. The following tools were used for data collection.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing factors questionnaire (PRECEDE model constructs)</title><p>In order to prepare this section of instruments, after a literature review on information resources, a questionnaire was designed.

After the announcement of their viewpoints and after resolving the problems and reforming the faults, they were submitted to 50 medical students, for reviewing and verifying from the sentences, matching points of view, with implementation, purposes, and aims of the scale producer, and resolving any objection or challenge regarding the understanding of the same concept from each question, by the students. After reviewing and correction of the cases, the reliability of the questionnaire was estimated for 188 students, using the internal consistency and test &#x02013; retest. The Cronbach's alpha coefficients for internal consistency of the scales were 0.74, 0.78, and 0.78, respectively, and after three weeks of test&#x02013;retest, the reliability coefficients were 0.80, 0.77, and 0.77, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Rosenberg self-esteem scale</title><p>This known and standard tool, which was developed by Rosenberg (1989), includes 10 questions, and each question is scored based on a four-choice options scale, from &#x02018;quite agree&#x02019; to &#x02018;disagree&#x02019;, with divers scoring for question numbers 9, 6, 5, and 2.

The 28-item questionnaire was made in order to increase the variance rate, and was based on factor analysis, copied from the main form. It has four scales, with seven questions in each scale, including physical symptoms, anxiety, depression, and disorder in social function. The GHQ's non-traditional method of scoring is the same as the Likert method in which scoring of each test is with four degrees, &#x02018;0, 1, 2, and 3,&#x02019; and thus the total score of each individual varies from 0 to 84. In this study the cut off point was considered to be 22 for the student population and for both sexes, so, persons with scores less than 22 were considered to have optimal mental health.

In short, the research findings introduced self-esteem, examination times, knowledge, and attitude as the significant and affecting variables on the mental health of students.</p><p>There was also a significant difference between the predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing factors, self-esteem, and ultimately the students&#x02019; mental health, in the case group and the control group, after the intervention. A significant correlation was observed between mental health and self-esteem, mental health and knowledge, self-esteem and knowledge, self-esteem and attitude, and mental health and attitude in the case group after intervention, while such a correlation was not seen in the control group.</p><p>In the study, the mental health status showed no significant difference between single and married students, but in Fakhraei's study,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] the psychological disorder status was reported to be significant in single students. Fakhraei[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>], Ziaei and his colleagues[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>], and Faraji[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] did not show any relationship between marital states and psychological disorders. Ildarabadi, <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] reported that the depression in married students was higher than in single students. It is also important to note that the length of the education period in the university, especially in medical sciences, varies in different subjects and this can cause variations in the prevalence rate of mental disorders in the students of those fields.</p><p>The results before intervention indicated the influence and close relationship of knowledge, attitude, and self-esteem with mental health. Meanwhile, the regression analysis test introduced the self-esteem, knowledge, and attitude variables as significant variables affecting the students&#x02019; mental health. The results were considered to be the base and foundation of the design and implementation of the intervention programs based on the model, hence, they were highlighted in the focus group discussions (FGD) among students, and its effectiveness was identified in the intervention program process after implementation on the case group, rather than on the control group. It also showed significant differences in the correlation between self-esteem and mental health, correlation of mental health with knowledge and attitude, and correlation of self-esteem with knowledge and attitude; so self-esteem and the mental health status of the samples were better with increase in knowledge and a positive attitude level. The promotion of students&#x02019; mental health was observed as their self-esteem increased and that coordinated with the results of this research and many other texts, such as, those by Mann and colleagues,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Mohair,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] and Moshki <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] Particularly, the significance of these factors, after performing the program, indicated a confirmation of compliance with the study findings and reports of Pope,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] Botvin,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] and Talebpour, <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] The influence of knowledge and attitude status from the predisposing factors has been emphasized on mental health and self-esteem, and also a significant correlation between the variables of knowledge, attitude, economic, religious, and environmental factors has been confirmed in the related literature, with self-esteem and their mental health.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] Meanwhile, the role of self-esteem as a variable of an impressive predictor correlated with mental health has been explained in the studies of Mann and his colleagues, quoted by Tudor[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>], Furnham and Cheng[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] Zimmermann[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>].</p><p>Even Krueter and Green have noted and expressed the influencing role of self-esteem based on the model and have mentioned it specifically and implicationally in the training-ecological stage of the model.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Its efficacy can show the power of the model, which can facilitate the exact determining of the study aims, through community participation and empowerment. It cannot be achieved, except through the process of community assessment, using evidence based on community-based participatory approaches, capacity building, and correcting the contributing factors during a review, and regular and continuous evaluation in the form of this model.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] It is possible that the significant increasing factor of self-esteem and especially mental health, is the use of the educational-participatory program based on the PRECEDE model in the case group rather than in the control group. Using this model as a framework of an intervention, to reduce mental health problems, confirms the study findings in relation to the predisposing factors (knowledge and attitudes), enabling factors (educational resources and skills), and reinforcing factors (social support), with the results of other related researches, including the use of the PRECEDE model in anxiety reduction of the Tehran fire fighters,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] the impact of education on depression in bypass heart surgery patients, and in accordance with the PRECEDE model in Isfahan,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] the development and evaluation of community mental health with public awareness based on the PRECEDE&#x02013;PROCEED model in Australia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>Phoenix and Winnie[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] utilized the predisposing, reinforcing, and enabling factors in the educational diagnosis of the PRECEDE model, to examine their effects on the mental well-being and quality of life among adults in Hong Kong. Structural equation modeling showed that the sense of coherence (predisposing factor), social support (reinforcing factor), and daily hassles (enabling factor) were significantly related to mental health promoting behaviors, which were associated with the mental well-being. We also found a significant relationship between mental health and the mentioned factors of the PRECEDE model in this study.</p><p>Wright and colleagues[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] showed that mental health campaigns were differently higher in the target region. It meant that the object of the enabling factor which was to make mental health information more available was accessed. The predisposing and reinforcing factors showed a significant change. They also stated that suicide beliefs associated with depression and psychosis increased or stabilized in the target region, while it declined in the comparison region.</p><p>Skarsater, <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] indicated that if mental health was well-designed as an intervention it could empower individuals to take responsibility for adopting mental health promoting behaviors. They emphasized on social supports as a factor to promote mental health. They also recommended the PRECEDE model as a useful framework for understanding factors involved with mental health promoting behaviors, among a large number of their samples.</p><p>Considering the effect of the predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing factors of the educational&#x02013;ecological model on self-esteem and the students&#x02019; mental health at first glance, and as the ultimate goal, the cumulative effect of related variables with each of the factors, and during implementation of the educational-participatory programs is matched and has conformity with the PRECEDE model. This model provides some steps for policy development, implementation, and evaluation of an educational program process, because a health education program is a process that is presented in regular consecutive stages.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>It is clear that the samples of this study cannot be a representative of the country's student population because of the wide extent and the different distribution of cultural, social, and ethnic characteristics. On the other hand the study samples are limited to the study subjects in two universities of medical sciences, and certainly more studies are needed among students in other subjects across the country, Iran, as also in the state universities, non-profit, and even non-governmental universities. However, may different factors such as individual ethnicity, customs and habits of the students that are effective on students&#x02019; self-esteem and their mental health and similar researches should be conducted and expanded in different parts of the country to observe how they work and impact.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This study is a part of an extensive and innovative project, using internationally recognized standards of a health promotion program model to promote self-esteem and mental health in the Iran students&#x02019; community. The study also offers confidence to researchers in this manner to use approved skills and training methods with student empowerment and participation based on the PRECEDE model, which finally leads to health promotion in a part of the community. In fact, this pattern can provide a clear concept of designing an effective program through community awareness about mental health, so that it can have the ability to comply with all areas, problems, and mental disorders.</p><p>In the same manner, and with the help of health education, we should step on the path to promote personal and social confidence and empower people to participate in health promotion. To promote mental health, health education approaches should be strengthened based on this study context and methods. In fact, this strategy shows that even educated people of the society should strive to rely on their own resources. To achieve such self-confidence, people should be informed adequately about having the accurate attitude and sufficient skill to participate in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of health interventions. The goal will be effectively achieved only through appropriate educational activities intending to empower people to protect their health, family, and community in which they live.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We thank all those who assisted us in the implementation of the research, and those who cooperated in performing the task are also appreciated.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Gonabad University of Medical Sciences</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><article-title>WHO.
