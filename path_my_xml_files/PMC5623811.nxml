Even though, &#x0003c;10% of the brain is active at any given time, it utilizes almost all the oxygen delivered. In order to perform complex tasks or more than one task (multitasking), the oxygen supply is shifted from one brain region to another, via blood perfusion modulation. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether a hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) environment, with increased oxygen supply to the brain, will enhance the performance of complex and/or multiple activities.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A prospective, double-blind randomized control, crossover trial including 22 healthy volunteers. Participants were asked to perform a cognitive task, a motor task and a simultaneous cognitive-motor task (multitasking). Participants were randomized to perform the tasks in two environments: (a) normobaric air (1 ATA 21% oxygen) (b) HBO (2 ATA 100% oxygen). Two weeks later participants were crossed to the alternative environment. Blinding of the normobaric environment was achieved in the same chamber with masks on while hyperbaric sensation was simulated by increasing pressure in the first minute and gradually decreasing to normobaric environment prior to tasks performance.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Compared to the performance at normobaric conditions, both cognitive and motor single tasks scores were significantly enhanced by HBO environment (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 for both). Multitasking performance was also significantly enhanced in HBO environment (<italic>p</italic> = 0.006 for the cognitive part and <italic>p</italic> = 0.02 for the motor part).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The improvement in performance of both single and multi-tasking while in an HBO environment supports the hypothesis which according to, oxygen is indeed a rate limiting factor for brain activity. Hyperbaric oxygenation can serve as an environment for brain performance. Further studies are needed to evaluate the optimal oxygen levels for maximal brain performance.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>HBOT</kwd><kwd>hyperbaric oxygenation</kwd><kwd>dual tasking</kwd><kwd>oxygen limitation</kwd><kwd>enhancing brain activity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group><title>Clinicaltrials.gov id:</title><kwd>NCT03126669</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group><title>Unique Protocol ID:</title><kwd>213/13</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="41"/><page-count count="6"/><word-count count="4690"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The brain is the body's largest consumer of oxygen, utilizing roughly 20% of the total oxygen and consuming 25&#x02013;30% of the total glucose (Lennie, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Even though &#x0003c;10% of the brain's maximal capacity is active at every given time, the brain utilizes almost all delivered oxygen (Sokoloff et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">1955</xref>). In order to perform different tasks or more than one task at a time (multitasking), the oxygen supply is shifted from one region of the brain to another via blood perfusion modulation (Lennie, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). These perfusion changes can be easily visualized by functional magnetic resonance tomography (fMRI) technology (Tombu et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Multiple studies have demonstrated that our ability to perform complex activities decreases under oxygen depleted environments (Shukitt-Hale et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Lieberman et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Malle et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). However, the possible effect on brain performance by a single hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) environmental exposure has not been studied in humans.</p><p>Brain performance is highly sensitive to any decrease in oxygen supply. A reduction of the plasma oxygen pressure to 65 mmHg will impair the brain's ability to perform complex tasks, at 55 mmHg short-term memory will be impaired, while at &#x0003c;35 mmHg consciousness will be lost (Zauner, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). The effects of a hypobaric environment (decreased oxygen level) in individual motoric and cognitive performances were studied at high altitudes. At high altitudes or other oxygen depleted environments, cognitive and motor performances are impaired while performing relatively simple tasks (Shukitt-Hale et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; West, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Mortazavi et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Lieberman et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Malle et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). On the other hand, elevation of oxygen levels, even at normobaric conditions, was found to facilitate cognition by decreasing the response time in the elderly (Choi et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In a randomized control trial where memory consolidation (as a measure for cognition) was evaluated, increased oxygen supply at normobaric conditions (sea level) to healthy young participants, word memorization was more efficient compared to control group (Moss and Scholey, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>).</p><p>While multitasking at a normal environment (normal air at sea level), oxygen is required in multiple brain regions simultaneously. The relative deficiency of oxygen may explain the decrease in processing speed, accuracy and other neuro-cognitive performances (Spelke et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">1976</xref>; Han and Marois, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). It is assumed that conscious attention to two different actions performed at the same time is possible only if the tasks are coordinated into a single, higher-order activity (Spelke et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">1976</xref>) or that at least one of the activities is being done &#x0201c;automatically&#x0201d; without conscious awareness (Spelke et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">1976</xref>; Han and Marois, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Donohue et al. have found that the ability to perform more than one task is limited even in individuals who are very experienced in one of the given tasks (Donohue et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p><bold>The aim</bold> of the present study was to evaluate whether an HBO environment, with increased oxygen supply to the brain, will enable better performance of complex and/or multiple activities in healthy individuals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>A prospective, double blind randomized control, crossover trial was performed at the Sagol Center for Hyperbaric Medicine and Research, Assaf-Harofeh Medical Center, Israel. This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of Assaf-Harofeh medical center institutional review board with written informed consent from all subjects. All subjects gave written informed consent in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by the Center's institutional review board.</p><sec><title>Participants</title><p>The study included 22 healthy volunteers, aged 20 years or older with a minimum of 12 years of formal education.

After a 2-week wash-out period, participants were crossed to the alternative environment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study protocol diagram.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fnint-11-00025-g0001"/></fig><p>During each session, participants were seated in the chamber with masks on. In the intervention session, the pressure in the chamber was increased to 2 ATA, and the participants breathed 100% oxygen for 45 min. In the control session, in order to manipulate the participants, the chamber pressure was increased for less than a minute so they felt some pressure in the ears, and a flow of 21% oxygen was used for the masks. The tests/tasks were initiated 30 min after the masks were on within the chamber.</p><p>Cognitive performance was evaluated by a symbol-digit test (example in Appendix <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">1</xref>), and the motor performance was evaluated by the units of beans that were transferred from a plate to a cup (One of the tasks in the motor assessment scale test-MASS, Appendix <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">2</xref>). The dual tasking was a combination of the cognitive and the motor tests which were done simultaneously.</p></sec><sec><title>Cognitive/attention symbol-digit modality test (SDMT)</title><p>The symbol digit modalities test (SDMT, Appendix <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">1</xref>) is a test used to assess divided attention, visual scanning, tracking, and motor speed (Strauss et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). In this test, participants are presented with series of symbols, each indicates a different number. While they are repeatedly presented with those different symbols they are asked to write the adequate number next to each symbol (the Appendix includes an example of the task recoding). The test was found to be reliable in four different forms in healthy and cognitive impaired conditions (McCaffrey, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>; Hinton Bayre and Geffen, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Dickinson et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Paramenter, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Three different forms of the SDMT were used in each evaluation session. The first was a try-out for the test, ensuring that the task was understood. The second tested the ability to perform an individual task. The third form was used in combination of the motor task for examining dual task performance. Standard administration procedures were followed as indicated in the test manual (Smith, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">1973</xref>). The score of the test is the number of correct substitutions during a 90-s interval.</p></sec><sec><title>Motor task: transferring of beans</title><p>Motor performance was evaluated by the motor assessment scale test (MAS, Appendix <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">2</xref>)&#x02014;transferring individual beans between two tea cups an arm's length away. The MAS test was found to be reliable for assessing advance hand-motor functioning in post stroke patients (Carr, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>; Pool and Whiteny, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>). One of the advantages of this task is that during its performance the participant is not required to have full vision focus on the hands, allowing the participant to do other tasks. In addition, the test can be easily performed under the conditions inside a hyperbaric chamber. The MAS score is based on the number of beans that were successfully transferred in the given time (90 s).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was done using SPSS software (version 22.0).

The ability to perform cognitive and/or motor tasks as a single or a combined task (multitask) was evaluated at a normal air/oxygen environment and at HBO, a hyperbaric oxygen enriched environment. Increasing oxygenation using a HBO environment significantly enhanced both cognitive and motor performance. Significant improvements were found for both single tasks as well as simultaneous multiple tasks.</p><p>Many studies have confirmed that environments low in oxygen levels have a negative effect on performing single and multiple tasks (Shukitt-Hale et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Lieberman et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). A study performed by Yu et al. evaluated the effect of repeated exposure to HBO treatment for healthy individuals (Yu et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Their study demonstrates that repeated daily HBO sessions, 5 days per week, 80 min with 100% at 2 ATA, can enhance memory performance. The improved memory correlated with enhanced functional connectivity in the left hippocampus, right inferior frontal and lingual gyri as demonstrated by fMRI analysis (Yu et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In the current study, the immediate effect of a single HBO environment exposure was evaluated in healthy volunteers. Since it is a single exposure, the immediate effect on neuro-cognitive performance cannot be related to the neuroplasticity effects of HBO but rather to a limiting factor preventing the brain to function at a higher capacity. This finding means that oxygen is indeed a limiting factor for brain performance at standard conditions in healthy human beings.</p><p>The minimal effective dosages of pressure and oxygen concentration are still unknown, and future studies are needed to test this issue by evaluating the optimal, case-specific dose response curves (Efrati and Ben-Jacob, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). There is a huge variability in HBO dosages (1.3&#x02013;2.4 ATA) used in previous studies aimed to induce neuroplasticity in post stroke and TBI patients (Boussi-Gross et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Efrati and Ben-Jacob, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Tal et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Hadanny and Efrati, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Oxygen is not a drug and because it is mainly metabolized in the mitochondria, its pharmacodynamics varies greatly from patient to patient. Thus, no simple dose-response curve has been defined so far. Emphasizing the latter, there are many case reports illustrating the significant effect of relatively low increases in air pressure (Golding et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">1960</xref>; Austin, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). For example, the Dead Sea (altitude 402 m below sea level, 1.05 ATM) can serve as a good model for a relatively &#x0201c;low&#x0201d; hyperbaric environment. The beneficial effect of this slight increase in air partial pressure is well-known and was studied and evaluated in different populations (Kramer et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Falk et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Goldbart et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). With respect to the current study, the aim was to confirm that oxygen is indeed a rate limiting factor for enhancing the activity and not to investigate the minimal effective dosage oxygen. For that purpose, we chose to use 100% oxygen at 2 ATA as the challenge dose. Now that we have demonstrated that indeed oxygen is a limiting factor, further studies are needed to evaluate the dose-response curve related to enhancing brain/cognitive performance.</p><p>In today's modern life, there is an increased need for multitasking, which is unfortunately limited (Carrier et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The inability to perform well while multitasking could have severe and even life threatening consequences, as was found in emergency room care physicians (Chisholm et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) and in military drone pilots (Shanker and Richtel, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Considering that an oxygen enriched environment could enhance performance, improve multitasking and decision making, the use of this environment could have a significant impact for those who needs it. However, before being used for large scale populations, the minimal and maximal effective dosage should be evaluated.</p><p>In addition to immediately enhancing brain/cognitive functions, there is growing convincing evidence that HBO therapy can revitalize chronically damage brain tissue in patients suffering from chronic neuro-cognitive impairment due to TBI, stroke or anoxic brain damage even years after the acute insult (Boussi-Gross et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Efrati et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Efrati and Ben-Jacob, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Hadanny et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Tal et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Hadanny and Efrati, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). As detailed above, brain metabolism reaches its upper limit of oxygen consumption even at normal healthy conditions, which makes it dependent on cerebral blood flow (CBF) for its oxygen supply. After brain insults, when the CBF is compromised, there is a further decrease in oxygen delivery to the injured brain tissue and oxygen becomes a limiting factor for brain recovery (Hadanny and Efrati, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Consequently, achieving higher tissue oxygen delivery by using higher paO<sub>2</sub> is crucial for maintaining the sufficient oxygenation needed for the damaged brain tissue (Hadanny and Efrati, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Clinical studies published in recent years present convincing evidences that HBO therapy (HBOT) can assist in brain repair (Boussi-Gross et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Efrati and Ben-Jacob, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In addition to delivering sufficient oxygen to the brain for tissue repair, HBOT might initiate cellular and vascular repair mechanisms and improve cerebral vascular flow (Efrati and Ben-Jacob, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). At the cellular level, HBOT can improve mitochondrial function (in both neurons and glial cells), improve blood-brain barrier and inflammatory reactions, reduce apoptosis, alleviate oxidative stress, increase levels of neutrophils and nitric oxide, and upregulate axon guidance agents (Efrati and Ben-Jacob, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Moreover, the effects of HBOT on neurons can be mediated indirectly by glial cells, including astrocytes (Efrati and Ben-Jacob, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). HBOT may also promote neurogenesis of the endogenous neural stem cells (Efrati and Ben-Jacob, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). At the vascular level, HBOT was found to have a role in initiating and/or facilitating angiogenesis and cell proliferation needed for axonal regeneration (Efrati and Ben-Jacob, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>Another potential effect of HBOT may be its possible contribution to perception. Perception provides meaning for sensation. Mendez-Balbuena et al, has shown that by providing audio tactile stimulation, the sensory experience (perception) of vision, could be expended (Mendez-Balbuena et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). It might be possible that enhanced brain activity by HBOT may also increase sensory perception. However, it was not directly evaluated in the current study and it could be an interesting goal for additional studies.</p><p>The current study has several challenges and potential limitations. One important limitation relates to the test re-test learning effect due to the crossover design. Every participant has performed the tests twice under both conditions in separate sessions. To overcome this limitation, participants were randomly divided into two groups in a way that part of the participants started under the HBO environment and the other part started with the sham environment (normobaric with room air). Accordingly, the two groups are almost matched for their learning effect. The other challenge is related to generating the control intervention that would mimic hyperbaric environment where participants can sense the increased pressure in their ears. To overcome this challenge, the chamber pressure was increased and then gradually decreased during the control session so that the participants felt some pressure in their ears, and a flow of 21% oxygen was used for the masks. The tests/tasking were initiated 30 min after the masks were on within the chamber and the pressure at that time was already reduced back to sea level during the placebo session.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The improvement in performance of both single and multitasking while in a HBO environment supports the hypothesis that oxygen is indeed a rate limiting factor for brain activity. Hyperbaric oxygenation can serve as an environment for enhancing brain performance. Such a brain enhancing environment can be of significant importance when many skills are becoming more and more dependent on enhanced cognitive functions and multitasking. Further studies are needed to evaluate the optimal oxygen-performance relation for maximal brain performance.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Author contributions</title><p>All authors listed have made a substantial, direct and intellectual contribution to the work, and approved it for publication.</p><sec><title>Conflict of interest statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s7"><title>Supplementary material</title><p>The Supplementary Material for this article can be found online at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnint.2017.00025/full#supplementary-material">http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnint.2017.00025/full#supplementary-material</ext-link></p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><media xlink:href="DataSheet1.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Austin</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>1998</year>). <article-title>Gammow bag for acute mountain sickness</article-title>. <source>Lancet</source>
