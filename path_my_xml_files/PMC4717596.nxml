It is controversial whether chemotherapy with or without primary tumor resection (PTR) is effective for the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer with unresectable metastasis. Primary tumor resection could prevent tumor-related complications such as intestinal obstruction, perforation, bleeding, or fistula. Moreover, it may be associated with an increase in overall survival. However, surgery delays the use of systemic chemotherapy and affects the systemic spread of malignancy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>Patients with colon and upper rectal cancer patients with asymptomatic, synchronous, unresectable metastasis will be included after screening. They will be randomized and assigned to receive chemotherapy with or without PTR. The primary endpoint measure is 2-year overall survival rate and the secondary endpoint measures are primary tumor-related complications, quality of life, surgery-related morbidity and mortality, interventions with curative intent, chemotherapy-related toxicity, and total cost until death or study closing day. The authors hypothesize that the group receiving PTR following chemotherapy would show a 10&#x000a0;% improvement in 2-year overall survival, compared with the group receiving chemotherapy alone. The accrual period is 3&#x000a0;years and the follow-up period is 2&#x000a0;years. Based on the inequality design, a two-sided log-rank test with &#x003b1;-error of 0.05 and a power of 80&#x000a0;% was conducted. Allowing for a drop-out rate of 10&#x000a0;%, 480 patients (240 per group) will need to be recruited. Patients will be followed up at every 3&#x000a0;months for 3&#x000a0;years and then every 6&#x000a0;months for 2&#x000a0;years after the last patient has been randomized.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This randomized controlled trial aims to investigate whether PTR with chemotherapy shows better overall survival than chemotherapy alone for patients with asymptomatic, synchronous unresectable metastasis.

About 940,000 cases of colorectal cancer develop annually, and about 500,000 patients die annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Approximately 20&#x000a0;% of all patients with colorectal cancer are diagnosed as having Stage IV cancer; 80&#x000a0;% of these present with unresectable metastatic lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>The treatment of choice for colorectal cancer is radical surgery, and additional chemotherapy or radiotherapy is available to prevent residual microcarcinoma, distant metastasis, and recurrence. However, in this incurable situation, the treatment of choice is unclear. According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], chemotherapy for colorectal cancer with unresectable metastasis is recommended following palliative resection of primary tumor only if the patient shows tumor-related symptoms. When the patient has no tumor-related symptoms, the first treatment option is chemotherapy. Thereafter, surgery for the primary tumor and metastatic lesions is recommended if the metastatic lesions become resectable.</p><p>Primary tumor resection (PTR) requires time for the patient to recover, which subsequently delays systemic chemotherapy and affects the systemic spread of malignancy. Several studies showed no significant difference in overall survival rate between groups receiving PTR and groups not receiving PTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Moreover, since the introduction of new chemotherapeutic agents and regimens, several phase III trials have revealed prolonged median overall survivals of 17&#x02013;23 months for colorectal cancer patients with distant metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Thus, some physicians prefer chemotherapy to PTR because of these drawbacks of PTR and because of the low tumor-related complication rates obtained with recently developed chemotherapeutic agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Conversely, many studies reported that PTR is necessary in patients with unresectable distant metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Primary tumor resection could prevent tumor-related complications, such as intestinal obstruction, perforation, bleeding, or fistula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. These complications are associated with poor oncologic outcomes as well as perioperative morbidity and mortality. Moreover, recent papers have reported significantly better overall survival rates for patients undergoing PTR than patients who do not have this treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. We found similar results from data obtained at our institution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Moreover, National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for this issue are based on lower-level evidence (category 2A).</p><p>However, previous studies support each opposing conclusion, and these studies are all retrospective. Therefore, we cannot know whether PTR should be performed or not for the patients with unresectable distant metastasis. A prospective, randomized controlled trial is required for this reason. Thus, we have designed a clinical trial. The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the role of PTR in colorectal cancer patients with asymptomatic, synchronous, unresectable metastasis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives and endpoints</title><p>The authors will compare overall survival rates as the primary endpoint measure between a group undergoing PTR followed by chemotherapy and a group undergoing only chemotherapy. Primary tumor-related complication rates, PTR-related complication rates, conversion rates to the resectable state, total cost, and quality of life will be evaluated as secondary endpoint measures. These evaluations will allow us to know whether or not PTR has benefits compared with the upfront chemotherapy strategy in Stage IV colorectal cancer patients with asymptomatic, synchronous, unresectable metastasis.</p><p>The primary endpoint measure is a comparison of 2-year overall survival rates between both groups. Secondary endpoint measures are comparisons of quality of life, total cost, and conversion to resectable status between both groups. Moreover, primary tumor-related complication will be evaluated in the group receiving upfront chemotherapy only and PTR-related morbidity and mortality will be evaluated in the group receiving PTR followed by chemotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Definition and evaluation methods of parameters</title><p>Major primary tumor-related complications are intestinal obstruction, lower gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation of tumor, and fistula. Intestinal obstruction is defined from such symptoms as abdominal discomfort, pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension or tenderness, rebound tenderness on physical examination caused by primary tumor, with evidence of obstruction shown in an abdominal X-radiograph or computed tomograph. Lower gastrointestinal bleeding is defined as a bleeding from the primary tumor, resulting in a reduction in hemoglobin concentration, and requiring transfusion or intervention. Tumor perforation includes both tumor perforation and other site perforation owing to high pressure caused by primary tumor obstruction. Fistula is defined as fistula formation between the primary tumor and an adjacent organ, as observed on physical examination or in imaging studies.</p><p>We consider the total cost to be all the colorectal cancer-related cost. It is related not only with the treatment itself, including surgery and chemotherapy, as well as care during admission and in the outpatient department, but also readmission due to adverse events or complications. In Korea, data on the cost of caring for Korean patients can be obtained from the Ministry of Health and Welfare, with approval.</p><p>To compare the quality of life between the two groups, the Korean version of EQ-5D<sup>TM</sup> (EuroQol Group) and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 will be used. All the enrolled patients will complete the questionnaires before chemotherapy or PTR, and thereafter every 6&#x000a0;months.</p><p>Morbidity and mortality related to PTR are graded according to the Clavien&#x02013;Dindo classification within 30&#x000a0;days after PTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and chemotherapy-related toxicity is evaluated by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>When the state of a tumor converts to resectable during the trial, the treatment plan can be changed into curative intent. Curative or radical resection is defined as complete resection (R0) of both the primary tumor and metastatic lesions, including radiofrequency ablation for liver metastases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design and period</title><p>This is a randomized, prospective, multicenter trial comparing chemotherapy following PTR with chemotherapy alone in colorectal cancer patients with asymptomatic, synchronous, unresectable metastases.

The trial is expected to last 5&#x000a0;years. All eligible patients will be enrolled after approval has been obtained from the institutional review board at each participating institution and enrollment will continue to February 2017. Ethical approval has been received for the trial from the following institutions: Severance Hospital and Gangnam Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Kyungpook National University Hospital, Soon Chun Hyang University Hospital, Ajou University Hospital, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Chonnam National University Hospital, Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital, National Cancer Center, Yeungnam University Hospital.

They are divided into two chemotherapy groups: chemotherapy with or without target agents. The chemotherapy regimens are outlined in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. The use of target agent (cetuximab, panitumumab, bevacizumab) is decided by the physician. This is one of the stratification factors.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Chemotherapy regimens.

If patients who received second-line therapy need third-line therapy, they can be prescribed capecitabine or other chemotherapeutic agents or supportive care.</p><p>All chemotherapeutic agents will be used according to the guidelines of the national health insurance service of Korea. According to the results of K-ras mutation tests, an appropriate target agent will be used. If the patient wants to receive target agent, the first line of chemotherapy is FOLFIRI with cetuximab or bevacizumab for patients without the K-ras mutation and FOLFIRI with bevacizumab for patients with the K-ras mutation. The second-line therapy is xeloda with oxaliplatin (XELOX) or FOLFOX with or without bevacizumab. The third-line therapy is regorafenib, capecitabine, or supportive care.</p><p>Patients allocated to Arm 2 (chemotherapy after PTR) will receive PTR within 14&#x000a0;days after randomization. Then they will receive chemotherapy within 8&#x000a0;weeks after PTR. The chemotherapy regimen is the same as that of Arm 1.</p><p>Primary tumor resection is intended to obtain a complete resection of the primary tumor (R0) with negative resection margins and adequate lymphadenectomy. The type of operation will be determined by the location of the tumor, and may be right hemicolectomy, transverse colectomy, left hemicolectomy, or anterior resection. The surgeon can decide the method of operation, whether open or laparoscopic surgery. For the primary site, a complete resection (R0) or microscopic remnant resection (R1) should be confirmed by pathologists after PTR. Patients with visible incomplete resection (R2) are excluded from this study. Operative and pathologic reports are documented in a case report form. All adverse events occurring within 30&#x000a0;days after PTR are recorded, using the Clavien&#x02013;Dindo classification of surgical complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Sample size calculation and randomization</title><p>The literature was searched to find a significant difference in 2-year overall survival rates between Arms 1 and 2. Ruo <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] reported a 25&#x000a0;% probability of 2-year overall survival in resected patients compared with 6&#x000a0;% in patients never resected (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). Ferrand <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] reported similar results, of 24&#x000a0;% versus 10&#x000a0;% (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001). Galizia <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] reported a difference of 21 percentage points (38&#x000a0;% versus 17&#x000a0;%). All the studies documented prolonged survival in the PTR group, as compared with the chemotherapy only group. Thus, we hypothesized that Arm 2 would show an improvement of 10 percentage points (approximately 47 % improvement) in 2-year overall survival rate than Arm 1 (31&#x000a0;% versus 21&#x000a0;%). Considering the size of each center, about 10,000 colorectal patients visit the trial centers yearly. We assumed that 20&#x000a0;% of them would have Stage IV cancer, and 80&#x000a0;% of these would have an unresectable metastasis. Finally, 10&#x000a0;% of patients would not present with any symptom; therefore, approximately 160 patients would be enrolled per year. The accrual period amounts to 3&#x000a0;years and the follow-up period amounts to 2&#x000a0;years. Based on the inequality design, a two-sided log-rank test was conducted, giving an &#x003b1;-error of 0.05 and a power of 80&#x000a0;%, using PASS version 12 (NCSS statistical software, Kaysville, UT, USA). The drop-out rate is expected to be 10&#x000a0;%; therefore, 480 patients (240 per group) must be enrolled.</p><p>Of the 480 subjects, 300 will be assigned to Arm 1 or Arm 2 by permuted block randomization within strata with block size 2 or 4. Randomization will be performed in a 1:1 ratio, and stratified according to age (&#x0003c;70 versus &#x02265;70), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0 versus 1 and 2), American Society of Anesthesiologists score (1 and 2 versus 3), and target agent (use versus no use). Because there will not be so many enrolled patients in each center, owing to the rarity of this kind of cancer, we will analyze data first without considering the site effect, and then we will analyze data considering the site effect as a random effect. The remaining 180 subjects will be enrolled using the Pocock and Simon minimization algorithm, to balance the study groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Although the first 300 patients will be randomized under the stratified randomization, the enrollment speed will vary. This may result in an imbalance between the two groups, so we will use the minimization method for later patients to balance the randomization more precisely.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Enrollment criteria and detailed definitions</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Aged 20&#x000a0;years old or older</p></list-item><list-item><p>Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the colon or upper rectum</p></list-item><list-item><p>Resectable primary colon or upper rectal cancer and unresectable metastatic lesions</p></list-item><list-item><p>No primary tumor-related symptoms</p></list-item><list-item><p>Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0&#x02013;2</p></list-item><list-item><p>Appropriate organ functions (hepatic transaminases &#x02013; less than five times the normal range; total bilirubin &#x02013; less than twice the normal range; serum creatinine &#x02013; less than 1.5 times the normal range; platelets &#x02013; more than 100,000/&#x003bc;l; neutrophil &#x02013; more than 1,500/&#x003bc;l)</p></list-item><list-item><p>American Society of Anesthesiologists score of &#x02264; 3</p></list-item><list-item><p>Able to give informed consent.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The patient received adjuvant chemotherapy within the past 6&#x000a0;months</p></list-item><list-item><p>The patient received chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer</p></list-item><list-item><p>The patient was planning to have curative surgery for the metastatic lesions</p></list-item><list-item><p>The primary cancer is unresectable</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients with mid and low rectal cancer (&#x02264;10&#x000a0;cm)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients with primary tumor-related complications, such as intestinal obstruction, intractable bleeding, and perforation; these need to be treated</p></list-item><list-item><p>American Society of Anesthesiologists score of &#x02265; 4</p></list-item><list-item><p>The patient has chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis; an asymptomatic carrier of hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus may participate</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients with an active infection, which requires antibiotic therapy, during the randomization period</p></list-item><list-item><p>Pregnant or breastfeeding women</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients who are enrolled in another clinical trial during the time of enrollment (within the 28-day randomization period)</p></list-item><list-item><p> Patients who have had another different malignant tumor in the previous 5&#x000a0;years; patients with treated non-melanoma skin cancer or cervical cancer may be enrolled.</p></list-item></list></p><p>&#x02018;Asymptomatic&#x02019; is defined as lack of primary-tumor-related symptoms, including obstruction, lower gastrointestinal bleeding, and perforation.

Moreover, in terms of complications, Poultsides <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] reported that 11&#x000a0;% of 233 patients with synchronous Stage IV colorectal cancer developed primary tumor-related complications and only 7&#x000a0;% required emergent surgery. In their study, seven patients underwent intraluminal stenting successfully. Eventually, Poultsides <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] concluded that their data supported the use of chemotherapy without routine prophylactic resection, as the appropriate standard practice for patients with neither obstructing nor hemorrhaging primary colorectal tumors in the setting of metastatic disease. Meanwhile, in our data, primary tumor-related complication rates of 252 patients in our institution were 35&#x000a0;%, and 8&#x000a0;% required emergent surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Moreover, Van Hooft <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] closed their multicenter randomized clinical trial comparing endoscopic stenting versus surgery for Stage IV left-sided colorectal cancer because of high numbers of complications (i.e., 6 perforations of 11 patients who underwent stent insertion). They reported that the safety of non-operative intervention instead of PTR was questionable.</p><p>Postoperative mortality rates following palliative resection were reported to be 8.3&#x02013;9.8&#x000a0;% by publications before 2000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, these rates have decreased to 0&#x02013;5&#x000a0;% since 2000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This decrease would be because of development of operative technique, anesthesiology, and postoperative management. According to data from our institution, the 30-day mortality rate after PTR was 1.9&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. These results favor PTR.</p><p>However, all these retrospective studies cannot be used to establish treatment guideline because of their inherent bias. Thus, this trial is proposed and aims to provide critical data, to support the establishment of a standard treatment protocol for patients with asymptomatic Stage IV colorectal cancer with unresectable metastasis. In this clinical trial, quality of life is secondary endpoint measure. If this clinical trial finds any differences of quality of life between two treatment groups, this will be invaluable knowledge for the patients even if oncologic outcomes are similar between treatment methods. Another secondary endpoint measurement is comparison of hospital cost between the two treatment methods. This comparison will provide important knowledge not only for patients but also for government health policy makers, who want to establish a cost-effective medical system.</p><p>The trial started with the first enrolled patient in October 2013. The authors expect that this trial will find an optimal treatment strategy for asymptomatic colorectal cancer patients with unresectable metastasis with level 1 evidence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Trial status</title><p>This study is currently in the recruitment phase.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>FOLFIRI</term><def><p>5-fluorouracil with irinotecan</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FOLFOX</term><def><p>5-fluorouracil with oxaliplatin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PTR</term><def><p>primary tumor resection</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAS</term><def><p>statistical analysis aystem</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SPSS</term><def><p>statistical package for the social sciences</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>XELOX</term><def><p>xeloda with oxaliplatin</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing of interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>SHB, JBA, and CSY designed and conducted the study, and revised the manuscript.
