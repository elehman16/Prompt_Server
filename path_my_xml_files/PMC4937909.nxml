However, existing evidence shows a mixed effect of PRHCP. This study is to explore the potential effectiveness of PRHCP that contributes to the convincing evidence of health policy and reform.</p><p>This study was undertaken in Qian Jiang City, applying a matched-pair cluster-randomized trial. Twenty primary care institutions were treated as clusters and were matched into 10 pairs. Clusters in each pair were randomly assigned into a control or an intervention group. Physicians&#x02019; prescribing information was publicly reported to patients and physicians monthly in the intervention group from October 2013. A total of 748,632 outpatient prescriptions were included for difference-in-difference (DID) regression model and subgroups (SGs) analysis.</p><p>Overall, PRHCP intervention led to a slight reduction in the use of combined antibiotics (odds ratio [OR] = 0.870, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.001) and slowed the average expenditure increase of patients (coefficient = &#x02212;0.051, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.001). SG analysis showed the effect of PRHCP varied among patients with different characteristics. PRHCP decreased the probability of prescriptions requiring antibiotics, combined antibiotics, and injections of patients aged 18 to 64 years old (OR&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;1), and all results were statistically significant. By contrast, the results of elderly and minor patients with health insurance showed that PRHCP increased their probability of prescriptions requiring antibiotics and injections. PRHCP slowed the increase of average expenditure of most SGs.</p><p>PRHCP intervention can influence the prescribing pattern of physicians. Patient factors such as age and health insurance influence the effect of PRHCP intervention, which imply that PRHCP should be designed for different patients. Patient education, aiming at radically changing attitudes toward antibiotics and injections, should be taken to promote the effectiveness of public reporting in China.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>a matched-pair randomized trial</kwd><kwd>antibiotics</kwd><kwd>difference-in-difference</kwd><kwd>injections</kwd><kwd>public reporting</kwd><kwd>rational use of medicine</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>OPEN-ACCESS</meta-name><meta-value>TRUE</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>The rational use of medicine is an important aspect of quality of care,<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> and irrational use of antibiotics and injections have become an outstanding problem all over the world, especially in low- and middle-income countries.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> It has been reported that over 50% patients were prescribed with antibiotics or injections in China,<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> which are double compared with the appropriate rate.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> Irrational use of antibiotics results in drug adverse reactions and antimicrobial resistance, threatening the global population.

This popular instrument for improving care quality has been proposed as a mechanism<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> for providing transparency and increasing the motivation of health care providers.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup></p><p>However, existing evidence on the efficacy of PRHCP is mixed. Several studies report that PRHCP stimulates quality improvement activity,<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> but some studies disagree.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> Thus, the effect of PRHCP intervention is not clear.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup></p><p>Many factors determine whether PRHCP will work as expected, and patient factor is an important aspect.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> Patient characteristics, such as age and insurance status, may assist or hinder efforts to improve quality.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> Another important issue is the design and implementation quality of the PRHCP intervention. A systematic review on PRHCP, which includes 45 articles from 1987 to 2008, showed that design and implementation, if they are sufficiently improved, may increase the effect of PRHCP intervention.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> Therefore, PRHCP must be designed and implemented appropriately, and it is also important to identify appropriate patients for intervention to make PRHCP effective.</p><p>The strength of the research designs may also contribute to the explanation of the mixed findings. Little evidence uses controlled experimental designs to evaluate the effect of PRHCP,<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> and most studies use performance data before and after the release to evaluate the effect of PRHCP.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> In addition, the regression analysis of the difference-in-difference (DID) model is a powerful method to estimate the net effect of policy intervention.<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> This method allows analysts to control the confounding influences of independent variables and makes causal claims about the effects of the intervention.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup></p><p>China has conducted several public reporting movements to improve the quality of care,<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> but scant evidence is available regarding the effect of PRHCP intervention.<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> The 1st objective of the study is to explore the potential effectiveness of PRHCP intervention. The 2nd objective is to identify the appropriate patients who would benefit from PRHCP intervention, which contributes to convincing evidence for health policy and reform. Meanwhile, the design and implementation details of PRHCP intervention are also reported, which may contribute to the small but increasing practice and experience of PRHCP intervention.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Settings</title><p>Hubei Province is located in south central China and has a population of 60 million and a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of 2225 billion (Yuan in 2012), which ranks this area in the middle range of all provinces.

PRHCP reduced average expenditure of most SGs except for SG4.</p><p>Overall, PRHCP increased antibiotic and injection use in all elderly and minor patients with health insurance (SG1, 3, 9, 11), while this effect was inversed in patients aged 18 to 64 years old.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>4</label><title>Discussions</title><sec><label>4.1</label><title>Patient factors influenced the effect of PRHCP intervention</title><p>This study, using a randomized matched-pair trial design in real-world, demonstrated that PRHCP intervention can influence the prescribing pattern of physicians. However, the effect of PRHCP intervention varied according to patients characteristics. When information of antibiotics and injection prescribing was available, elderly and minor patients with health insurance preferred to use more antibiotics and injections.</p><p>One important explanation for this phenomenon was that patients&#x02019; deep-rooted misconception toward antibiotics and injections. The persistent high prevalence of antibiotic and injections overuse has lasted for many decades<sup>[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</sup> and reflected both inertia in physician practice and continued demand from patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> Previous studies showed that Chinese health literacy is low<sup>[<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]</sup> and antibiotics and injections are considered as stronger, faster, and high-quality medicine for treatment.<sup>[<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</sup> Furthermore, the misunderstanding of patients and prevalence of overuse antibiotics and injection imposed pressure on physicians to prescribe more, not fewer, antibiotics and injections.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> Without sufficient education, patients would choose high antibiotic or injection prescribing rate physicians as their priority selection.</p><p>By contrast, it was interesting that PRHCP reduced antibiotic and injection usage in patients aged 18 to 65 years old. Since there was no decrease in minor patient who were always taken to primary care institutions by their parents, adults patients seemed prefer antibiotics and injections only for their children. There is a conjectural reason for these results. After dissemination of the potential risk of overuse of antibiotics and injections for many years,<sup>[<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</sup> the conception of young adults slightly changed. Nevertheless, these medicines were still considered as integral of high-quality care inveterately and were required to children by their patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup></p><p>Moreover, physicians&#x02019; clinical practice varied according to the age of patients,<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> which would contribute to this result. Similar result has been showed from a multicenter observational study about neonatal intensive care unit in 2011. Although there is no clinical indicator for supplemental parenteral nutrition, most clinicians still prescribed the treatment because of the anxiety from themselves and pressure from children's parents.<sup>[<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</sup> This situation still plays an important role under current clinical practice.</p><p>Besides, health insurance also played a vital role in the increasing use of antibiotics and injection. Studies carried out in the late 1990s in China had provided evidence that medical insurance encouraged prescription of more items and antibiotics<sup>[<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]</sup> and a review synthesizing research showed that patients become less willing to seek care when plans increase copayments in the USA.<sup>[<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]</sup></p><p>Meanwhile, Chinese governments are intended to achieve universal health insurance coverage, and 3 types of health insurance, aiming at different population, have been established. The official data showed that over 95% people had enrolled in health insurance by the end of 2014.<sup>[<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]</sup> Considering the prevalence of health insurance coverage and patients attitude toward antibiotics or injections,<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</sup> PRHCP seemed to be harmful and might contribute to the irrational use of antibiotics and injections. Patient education, aiming at radically changing attitudes, should be taken to reverse the potential harmful trend.</p><p>PRHCP intervention reduced the average expenditure of patients in all SGs, though some of the results were not statistically significant (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref>). Unlike the indicator of quality of prescriptions, the expense indicator was sensible to all patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> Since PRHCP showed entirely different effect for different patients, treating patients as a whole for public reporting may not be wise. PRHCP intervention must be designed for different patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>4.2</label><title>Indicators of PRHCP may influence the effect of intervention</title><p>The objective of PRHCP intervention in this study was to address the irrational use of antibiotics and injection. Thus, physicians&#x02019; prescribing performance and physicians prescribing behaviors were selected as reported information and outcome measurement, respectively. These 2 parts were directly related to ensure effective PRHCP intervention. However, studies about the New York State Cardiac Surgery Reporting System (NYSCSRS)<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]</sup> showed that the effect of PRHCP varied when using different outcome indicators for evaluation. NYSCSRS, publicly reporting adjusted mortality rates, reduced patients&#x02019; death in all New York hospitals,<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> but failed to promote market share redistribution,<sup>[<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]</sup> which means that NYSCSRS promoted care quality improvement, but not medical-behavior improvement. The studies on NYSCSRS demonstrated the importance of selecting outcome indicators of PRHCP. For policy makers and health administrators, the goal of PRHCP and reported information should be directly relevant.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>4.3</label><title>Design and implementation issues may affect the effect of PRHCP</title><p>Design and implementation issues could increase the effect of PRCHP on effectiveness. The PRHCP intervention that was designed and implemented by our team, a 3rd party, is different from other studies.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]</sup> Associations or colleges are more professional compared with the government. Thus, patients and physicians preferred to accept the information released by a 3rd party that was fair and credible and the buy-ins of patients and physicians in PRHCP intervention is essential for its success.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]</sup></p><p>In addition, it was rare to find a study using a randomized control trial design to explore PRHCP effect within a complex real-world environment and most existing research applied before&#x02013;after or retrospective design.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]</sup> Evidence from randomized control trials was considered as the most robust and reliable<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> and the different design methods may influence the results.</p><p>Knowledge on medication use was included to easily understand the released information, and a publicity strategy was considered for the wide dissemination of information during implementation. These efforts may contribute to the final effect of PRHCP intervention.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup></p><p>Overall, many design and implementation details of PRHCP intervention was reported in this study, which may contribute to a future study design. To make PRHCP work as expected, impact, reliance, and acceptability of reporting information must be considered when choosing which information should be reported. These 3 aspects decide whether the information would be used or not. Dissemination is also an important part for PRHCP since most patients would not come to see the information specially when they come to healthcare institutions to see a physician. Furthermore, further research should be conducted on the effect of report design and implementation.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup></p></sec></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Limitation</title><p>First, this study sites were primary care institutions. Therefore, the conclusions drawn from this research must be carefully generalized to other types of healthcare institutions. Second, this study explored the potential effectiveness of PRHCP intervention, but we did not attempt to empirically examine the causal pathways through which PRHCP influences the quality of care. The mechanism of PRHCP intervention is needed for further studies. Third, it may need some time for PRHCP intervention fully working as expected and early evaluation would overestimate the actual effect of PRHCP. Forth, though tried to control the confounding from investigators, we did not included characteristics of investigators in DID model, which could had potential bias for the results.</p></sec><sec><label>6</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study demonstrated that PRHCP intervention can influence the prescribing pattern of physicians, but the effect varies among patients with different characteristics. Elderly and minor patients with health insurance preferred to receive more antibiotics and injection after this information released, while this effect was inversed in 18 to 64 year old patients. Age and health insurance are 2 important factors that determine whether PRHCP will work as expected. Moreover, the design, implementation, and indicators of PRHCP may also influence the impact of the intervention. The results suggest that PRHCP intervention must be designed for different patients, and publicly reported information should be chosen based on the goals and also be directly relevant to the goals. Patient education, aiming at radically changing attitudes toward antibiotics and injections, should be taken to promote the effectiveness of public reporting in China. Further research is needed on the effect of report design and implementation.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank the managers of the participating institutions.
