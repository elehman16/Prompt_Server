<bold>Background:</bold> Chronic fatigue syndrome is a complicated and poorly understood illness. People with the condition experience tiredness that carries on for a long period of time and does not get better with rest. Other symptoms include sleeping problems, muscle and joint pains, concentration difficulties, and headaches. The causes of chronic fatigue syndrome are not known. There is evidence for the effectiveness of certain behavioral interventions, such as exercise therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy, in improving certain symptoms. However, some doctors are concerned that a food supplement called Acclydine, derived from a plant called <italic>Solanum dulcamara,</italic> is being used and promoted as a treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome when there is little evidence about the efficacy or safety of this supplement.</p><p>The researchers here carried out a randomized trial in The Netherlands, recruiting adult patients who met the internationally accepted criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome. The participants were allocated by chance to receive either 14 weeks of treatment with Acclydine together with amino acid supplements or, alternatively, placebo versions of the Acclydine and amino acid tablets. The researchers then measured participants' responses with respect to two primary outcome measures. One of these was how tired participants felt, which was measured using a subscale on a questionnaire called the Checklist Individual Strength scale (CIS-fatigue). The other primary outcome measure was &#x0201c;functional impairment,&#x0201d; which examines how well someone carries out their daily life, using the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP-8) scale. The secondary outcome measures included physical activity levels, day-to-day fatigue levels, and the levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) in blood, a hormone that's thought by some researchers to be related to the severity of chronic fatigue.</p><p>
<bold>What the trial shows:</bold> In the trial, 57 people were randomized to receive either Acclydine plus amino acid supplements, or placebo tablets. When comparing scores on the primary outcome measures at the end of the trial, the researchers did not see significant differences between the treatment and placebo groups. Similarly, the results for secondary outcome measures in this trial did not show any significant differences between the treatment and placebo groups.</p><p>
<bold>Strengths and limitations:</bold> Strengths of this study include the fact that it is one of the few properly designed studies of a product for which claims have been made of effectiveness in chronic fatigue syndrome. The study was designed as a double-blind trial, in which participants and investigators (those collecting the outcome data) did not know whether an individual received Acclydine or placebo. This procedure should help to minimize bias in assessing outcomes. A key limitation of this study is the relatively small number of participants. However, the investigators considered it unlikely that a larger trial would detect a clinically meaningful effect of Acclydine on these outcome measures for patients with chronic fatigue syndrome.</p><p>
<bold>Contribution to the evidence:</bold> Systematic reviews of interventions for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome have found evidence for the efficacy of exercise therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. This trial shows no evidence of efficacy of Acclydine plus amino acid supplements for the treatment of chronic fatigue.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>The GKH, Bleijenberg G, van der Meer JWM (2007) The effect of acclydine in chronic fatigue syndrome: A randomized controlled trial.

Various accompanying symptoms may be present, such as headache, joint and muscle pain, sore throat, and impaired memory and concentration. Of the many therapeutic interventions that have been undertaken, so far only cognitive behavioral therapy and graded exercise therapy have met with success [<xref rid="pctr-0020019-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Neuroendocrinological investigations have tried to elucidate the pathophysiology of CFS [<xref rid="pctr-0020019-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. As CFS patients and adult patients with a growth hormone (GH) deficiency report similar symptoms such as fatigue, myalgia, a diminished sense of well-being, and reduced physical capacity [<xref rid="pctr-0020019-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020019-b005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and treatment of GH-deficient adults with GH has measurable effects on physical function and perception of fatigue [<xref rid="pctr-0020019-b006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], GH status is a focus of this research.. Changes in the GH/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) 1 axis have been reported in CFS and fatigue-related disorders such as fibromyalgia [<xref rid="pctr-0020019-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. IGF1 studies in CFS patients have yielded conflicting results: low [<xref rid="pctr-0020019-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020019-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], normal [<xref rid="pctr-0020019-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020019-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and increased [<xref rid="pctr-0020019-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] basal IGF1 levels have been found. Sample size, selection of controls, appropriateness of matching, and selection of CFS patients with psychiatric co-morbidity could explain the conflicting results.</p><p>Despite the conflicting publications concerning IGF1 status in CFS patients, in recent years there have been reports in patient organization newsletters that a new food supplement called Acclydine could be an effective treatment for CFS. The active ingredient of Acclydine is an alkaloid from <italic>Solanum dulcamara.</italic> It has been claimed that Acclydine is effective because it increases IGF1 concentrations in CFS patients by stimulating GH releasing hormone and, consequently, GH secretion. GH is converted to IGF1 in the liver. IGF1 activates tyrosine kinase and integrin receptors and stimulates intracellular lipid and glycogen synthesis.</p><p>Levels of IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs), particularly IGFBP3, modulate the biological activity of IGF1, and the ratio of IGFBP3 to IGF1 reflects IGF1 biological activity [<xref rid="pctr-0020019-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. There are unpublished observations suggesting that Acclydine could increase the IGF1 plasma concentrations in healthy humans and in CFS patients. An 8-wk controlled trial with Acclydine in combination with amino acid supplementation in 90 CFS patients has been reported to have a positive effect [<xref rid="pctr-0020019-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>However, there are, to our knowledge, no published peer-reviewed studies investigating the effect of Acclydine. Double-blind randomized controlled trials are needed, for several reasons. First, this food supplement is available on the Internet without prescription and is thus easily accessible. Second, although the effects of Acclydine treatment have not been evaluated thoroughly, there are ongoing studies in other vulnerable patient categories, such as in cancer patients with chronic fatigue after treatment, but these studies are not listed in the international controlled trial registry Current Controlled Trials (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com">http://www.controlled-trials.com</ext-link>).</p><p>For the reasons given above, we assessed the IGFBP3/IGF1 status in patients fulfilling the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for CFS [<xref rid="pctr-0020019-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and in healthy gender- and age-matched neighborhood controls, to evaluate whether there are intrinsic differences in IGFBP3/IGF1 status between the two groups. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of Acclydine on IGF1 concentration, IGFBP3/IGF1 ratio, and CFS-related symptoms in a well-defined CFS population using validated outcome measures and a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled design.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><p>The study was approved by the medical ethical committee of the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to enrollment.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Patients were recruited through the outpatient clinic of the Department of General Internal Medicine of the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre and through an advertisement in the newsletter of the Dutch CFS patient organization ME-Stichting (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.me-cvs-stichting.nl">http://www.me-cvs-stichting.nl</ext-link>). Patients were eligible for participation if they fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: they had to be between 18 and 65 y of age, and they had to fulfill the CDC consensus criteria for CFS [<xref rid="pctr-0020019-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-1) was performed to exclude patients with current psychiatric co-morbidity and to ensure a homogeneous group of patients.</p><p>Pregnant or lactating women were excluded, as were patients with lactose intolerance and patients taking psychotropic drugs or experimental medications.</p><p>An additional criterion to be met was an IGFBP3/IGF1 ratio greater than 2.5. We asked patients who could potentially participate in the trial, if possible, to bring a healthy neighborhood control individual of similar age, gender, body weight, and body height, to compare IGF status. Except for contraceptives, the control individuals were not allowed to take medication.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Interventions</title><p>Acclydine and an identical placebo were delivered by the manufacturer Optipharma. Each Acclydine capsule contained 250 mg of the alkaloid.

The effect of Acclydine was assessed by pre- and post-trial testing. Post-trial testing was performed at the end of the 14-wk treatment period. During the post-trial assessments, the patients were still taking the trial supplements. All participants, investigators, and laboratory technicians were blinded to the treatment condition. IGF1 and IGFBP3 measurements were also done in a blinded fashion.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Randomization</title><p>Before the start of the clinical trial, the pharmacy of the hospital prepared 57 treatment packages. Randomization and allocation to the treatment or placebo group was based on a patient's study number. After acceptance of a patient by the junior researcher (G. K. H.

The pharmacy held the randomization list that correlated the study number with the treatment group. To maintain balance over time, the concealed randomization was done in blocks of ten. Treatments were generated randomly within the blocks using a computer program (Excel, Microsoft, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.microsoft.com">http://www.microsoft.com</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Primary Outcome Measures</title><sec id="s2e1"><title>Fatigue severity.</title><p>The Checklist Individual Strength is a reliable and validated self-report questionnaire.

In this study we also addressed the issue of a deficiency of bioactive IGF1. To control for unwanted stress effects and other confounders, the blood samples were taken simultaneously from the patients and their matched neighborhood controls.

These results do not support the hypothesis that changes in IGF1 and IGFBP3 metabolism are involved in the pathophysiology of CFS.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Generalizability</title><p>In this study we enrolled a representative sample of adult referred and non-referred CFS patients who fulfilled the international CDC consensus criteria for CFS [<xref rid="pctr-0020019-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In contrast to previous intervention studies with cognitive behavioral therapy [<xref rid="pctr-0020019-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] or with a polynutrient supplement [<xref rid="pctr-0020019-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] conducted by our research group, we excluded patients with psychiatric co-morbidity to exclude hormonal influences caused by current psychiatric co-morbidity. The mean fatigue severity and functional impairment scores in this study represent high fatigue severity levels and high functional impairment in the CFS patients. Compared to the previously mentioned intervention studies, the patients in this clinical trial reported slightly lower fatigue and functional impairment scores. Selection of CFS patients without current psychiatric co-morbidity could explain this difference.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Overall Evidence</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first published report of a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effect of the food supplement Acclydine in CFS patients. The effect was assessed by pre- and post-trial testing with validated instruments designed to assess different dimensions of CFS as well as treatment effects. Treatment with Acclydine was not more effective than placebo in changing self-reported outcome measures, hormonal blood levels, or physical activity.</p><p>The lack of significant differences on any of the dimensions of fatigue or the hormonal assessments strengthens our overall findings.</p><p>Previous unpublished studies by others on file at the manufacturer claimed that treatment with Acclydine would be more effective in CFS patients with a higher IGFBP3/IGF1 ratio. Based on this claim, we did a subset analysis for patients with a ratio greater than 4.5:19 CFS patients in the Acclydine group and 20 in the placebo group had a ratio greater than 4.5. No significant differences in change scores were seen between the subgroups in any of the outcome measures.</p><p>A second claim was that Acclydine treatment works by increasing biologically active IGF1. However, assessment of IGF1 concentration and IGFBP3/IGF1 values in the Acclydine group at baseline, 4 wk, and 8 wk during treatment, at the end of treatment, and at follow-up (1 mo after the treatment period) did not show a significant change.</p><p>The power of our study was sufficient to detect changes in time in both groups. Thus, the negative findings found in this randomized controlled trial cannot be explained by a power problem. Considering the reported treatment effect on the primary outcome measures, we believe it is very unlikely that a larger trial would detect a clinically meaningful effect.</p><p>It is of interest to note that we detected a minor placebo effect in this study. This is in accordance with observations from earlier randomized controlled clinical trials in CFS [<xref rid="pctr-0020019-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020019-b025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, the minimal decline in fatigue severity and functional impairment during pre- and post-trial testing in both treatment groups could also be partly explained by the phenomenon regression to the mean or a Hawthorne effect.</p><p>We did not monitor patient compliance on a daily basis. During the trial, patients had an appointment by telephone or at the outpatient clinic every 2 wk. During these appointments, we assessed whether the capsules were taken as directed, and the treatment protocol for the next 2 wk was discussed with the patient. Although adherence could not be verified fully, there is no reason to believe that lack of adherence can explain the negative findings.</p><p>In conclusion, this randomized controlled trial did not demonstrate an effect of Acclydine on biologically active IGF1, nor did it demonstrate any benefit in CFS-related outcome measures. Thus, the findings of this clinical trial do not support the use of Acclydine in the treatment for CFS.</p><p>We feel that the negative results of this trial are important for two reasons: Acclydine is expensive, so patients might be spending a lot of money on an ineffective treatment, and it is also available without prescription on the Internet, making it available to patients potentially without a doctor's oversight.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020019-sd001"><label>CONSORT Checklist</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0020019.sd001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p>(58 KB DOC)</p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020019-sd002"><label>Trial Protocol</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0020019.sd002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p>(262 KB DOC)</p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020019-sd003"><label>Alternative Language Abstract S1</label><caption><title>Translation of Abstract into German by Andres How Ming Neuhaus</title><p>(12 KB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pctr.0020019.sd003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020019-sd004"><label>Alternative Language Abstract S2</label><caption><title>Translation of Abstract into Chinese by Yong Xue</title><p>(162 KB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pctr.0020019.sd004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Hormonal measurements were performed by Centrum voor Medische Analyse, Herentals, Belgium.
