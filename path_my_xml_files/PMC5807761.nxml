Lifestyle modifications, such as increased levels of physical activity, are recommended as the first line of anti-hypertensive treatment. A recent systematic review showed that isometric handgrip (IHG) training was superior to traditional endurance and strength training in lowering resting systolic blood pressure (SBP). The average length of previous IHG training studies is approximately 7.5&#x000a0;weeks with the longest being 10&#x000a0;weeks. Therefore, presently it is unknown if it is possible to further lower blood pressure levels beyond the 10-week mark. Recently, we developed a novel method for monitoring handgrip intensity using a standard Nintendo Wii Board (Wii). The primary aim of this study is to explore the effects of a 20-week IHG home training facilitated by a Wii in hypertensive older adults (50&#x02009;+&#x02009;years of age) on lowering SBP compared to usual care. Secondary aims are to explore if/when a leveling-off effect on SBP will occur during the 20-week intervention period in the training group and to explore adherence and potential harms related to the IHG home training.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">Based on previous evidence, we calculated that 50 hypertensive (SBP between 140 and 179&#x000a0;mmHg), older adults (50&#x02009;+&#x02009;years of age) are needed to achieve a power of 80% or more. Participants will be randomly assigned to either an intervention &#x0003e;group (IHG home training&#x02009;+&#x02009;hypertension guidelines on lifestyle changes) or to a control group (hypertension guidelines on lifestyle changes). Participants in the intervention group will perform IHG home training (30% of maximum grip strength for a total of 8&#x000a0;min per day per hand) three times a week for 20&#x000a0;weeks.

HT increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases (e.g., coronary artery disease, stroke, and heart failure) and overall mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Both European and US treatment guidelines for primary and secondary prevention of HT recommend non-pharmacological lifestyle modifications, such as increased levels of physical activity, as the first line of anti-hypertensive therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In addition, there is class I, level B evidence that 150&#x000a0;min of weekly physical activity offers an alternative that may be used to complement anti-hypertensive medication, although optimal exercise training regime remains unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A systematic review from 2013 highlighted the potential of isometric handgrip (IHG) training regimens in reducing systolic blood pressure (SBP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The meta-analysis from the review showed that IHG training was superior to endurance training and dynamic resistance training in reducing SBP (by&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;10.9, &#x02212;&#x02009;3.5, and&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;1.8&#x000a0;mmHg, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Another systematic review published in 2014 on IHG training, including isometric leg extension training, reported a more modest mean difference of&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;6.77&#x000a0;mmHg in SBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Lately in 2016, yet another systematic review was published on isometric training (both handgrip and leg extension) and showed an overall reduction in SBP of&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;5.2&#x000a0;mmHg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This review, however, was heterogenetic in nature with several outlying studies, which may have undermined the effect of isometric training on blood pressure levels. In addition, some of the studies included in the most recent review were performed on normotensive populations and may have contributed to a reduced effect compared to the systematic review from 2013. Overall, most isometric exercise training studies have followed somewhat the same exercise protocol with an intensity of 30% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) in intervals of 2&#x000a0;min per hand/foot (a total of 8&#x000a0;min per hand/foot per day). In addition, the training has been three times per week for an average of 7.5&#x000a0;weeks in duration with the longest reported study being 10&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Most of the studies have been conducted at a hospital, university, or healthcare clinic burdening the participant by having to travel to the study site for assessment and training. Finally, many of the previous studies on IHG training have been relatively small in size (average 28 participants) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Recently, we have shown that handgrip [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and lower extremity strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] can be measured precisely using a standard Nintendo Wii Board (Wii) with an on-screen visual feedback of the force exerted over time (force/velocity curve). As a continuation of this work, we have further developed a novel method that monitors handgrip muscle control and is suitable for IHG home training. Given the development and low-cost nature of the Wii, we are now able to perform home-based IHG training. For the above reasons we intend to conduct a IHG training study, which will be twice as long (20&#x000a0;weeks) as the longest previous study (10&#x000a0;weeks) to explore the effects on specific measures of blood pressure and other relevant outcomes. Our primary aim is to explore the effects of 20&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; IHG home training facilitated by a Wii in hypertensive older adults (50&#x02009;+&#x02009;years of age) in lowering SBP. Secondary aims are to explore if/when a leveling-off effect on SBP will occur during the 20-week intervention period in the training group and to explore adherence and potential harms related to the IHG home training. The study will compare IHG home training with a control group in a randomized, assessor-blinded design. Thus, we hypothesize (1) that 20&#x000a0;weeks of IHG home training will significantly reduce SBP in hypertensive older men and women compared to usual care, (2) that a leveling-off effect on SBP will occur during the 20&#x000a0;weeks of IHG training, and (3) that a minimum of 50% of participants will complete at least 50% of their training sessions (30 sessions).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p id="Par12">The design of the study will be a randomized controlled, outcome-assessor-blinded superiority trial with participants randomly assigned to either an intervention group (IHG home training&#x02009;+&#x02009;hypertension guidelines on lifestyle changes) or to a control group (hypertension guidelines on lifestyle changes).

The IHG training consists of isometric contractions applied with the hands on a Wii. The Wii will be connected to a standard PC to monitor the level of the applied force using the FysioMeter software (Br&#x000f8;nderslev, Denmark). The IHG training will be structured with four sets of 2-min contractions for each hand, 3&#x000a0;days per week for 20&#x000a0;weeks. The training volumes will this way sum up to a total of 480&#x000a0;min for each hand in the study period. The level of IHG training will be set to 30% MVC in line with previous IHG training trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

At the follow-up measures, participants will be specifically asked not to mention nor comment on which group they have been assigned to in order to maintain allocation concealment to the outcome assessor. With respect to physiological measures, these will be assessed approximately at the same time of day as the baseline measures to avoid variability due to circadian rhythms or medication intake cycle. In addition, participants will be instructed via telephone by the study coordinator to refrain from vigorous exercise and alcohol for 24&#x000a0;h prior to all measurements. Moreover, they will be instructed to fast and refrain from caffeine for 4&#x000a0;h prior to all measurements. Further, they will be instructed to refrain from smoking and intake of anti-hypertensive medicine up to 30&#x000a0;min prior to all measurements. In addition, the assessor will ask if the participants complied with these instructions.

Likewise, if they die or emigrate they will be removed from the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par35">The aim of this randomized control trial is to explore whether 20&#x000a0;weeks of IHG home training on older adults (50&#x02009;+&#x02009;years of age) with hypertension can reduce SBP compared to usual care. In order to increase the clinical value of this study, our inclusion and exclusions criteria are selected to target patients where lifestyle changes are recommended by national guidelines as first line therapy before initiation of medical treatment.</p><p id="Par36">This study adds further knowledge to the current academic literature in several aspects. Firstly, the duration of the intervention in this study will be 20&#x000a0;weeks compared to the average durations of 7.5&#x000a0;weeks seen in previous studies with the longest reported study of 10&#x000a0;weeks. Secondly, with a longer study duration and measurements every 5&#x000a0;weeks, this study should be able to reveal when, and if, a possible leveling-off effect on measures of blood pressure occurs. Thirdly, the present study will extend the size of previous IHG training studies as former studies have included smaller sample sizes (on average approximately 28 participants) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Fourthly, this is the first study to explore the effects on resting blood pressure using a standard Wii for IHG training. Finally, in the present study participants will perform home-based IHG training. Previous studies report IHG training taking place in either a hospital or university setting burdening participants with traveling time and changes in environment and potentially affecting their adherence to the training program. If the home-based IHG training is potent in lowering resting blood pressure this type of setup with home training could be attractive to many patient populations.</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par37">Recruitment of participant will be initiate approximately 1&#x000a0;month from now.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec18"><p>
