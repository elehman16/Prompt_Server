Teeth with white spots, signs of demineralization, fractures, abrasions and carious lesions were excluded. After selection, the teeth were cleaned and stored in 0.5% chloramine solution at 5&#x02103; for 48 hours.

After acrylic resin polymerization, the blocks were coupled to a metallographic cutter (SYJ - 150 Digital Diamond Low Speed Saw 4, MTI Crystal, Richmond, CA, USA), and the occlusal surfaces of the teeth were sectioned in the transverse direction to their long axis with the aid of a double-faced diamond disc No. 11-4243 (Buehler, Lake Bluff, IL, USA) under constant water cooling. Afterwards, the occlusal surfaces were flattened on a manual polisher (Struers, Ballerup, Denmark) using a 600-grit abrasive paper (Norton, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, SP, Brazil) to obtain a flat dentin surface.</p></sec><sec><title>Teeth restoration</title><p>The teeth were randomly separated into 5 groups (<italic>n</italic> = 6) according to the composites/adhesive systems used for restoration as described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>.</p><p>For the Pre-etching/Silorane group, pre-etching of the dentin surface was performed with 37% phosphoric acid (Dental Gel, Dentsply, Petr&#x000f3;polis, RJ, Brazil). The acid was applied on the entire dentin surface for 15 seconds. Next, the surface was thoroughly washed with water, and then dried with absorbent paper to remove the excess of water. The specific self-etching primer (Filtek Silorane, 3M ESPE, Sumar&#x000e9;, SP, Brazil) was then applied and rubbed over the dentin surface for 15 seconds. A light jet of air was applied in order to spread the primer and form a uniform film over the dentin surface. Next, the primer was light activated with a LED type appliance (FlashLite 1401, Discus Dental, Culver City, CA, USA, light intensity, 1,100 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> and wavelength in the band between 460 and 480 nm) for 10 seconds.

The self-etching primer was applied and spread over the entire dentin surface for 20 seconds.

Based on the results obtained, it could be stated that the tested null hypothesis was rejected since pre-etching promoted higher bond strength values for silorane specific adhesive system. According to the manufacturer (3M ESPE), this specific self-etching adhesive system is able to promote bonding between dental tissues of hydrophilic nature, and the silorane-based composite with hydrophobic property. This adhesive system is composed of a methacrylate-based self-etching primer, which has hydrophilic monomers, in addition to water and ethanol that promote ionization, and form the base for substrate/composite bonding.<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Also, according to the manufacturer, the specific adhesive is methacrylate-based, and contains hydrophobic monomers, whose function is to complement bonding between primer and the hydrophobic monomer of the composite. Thus, the bond strength between substrate and silorane-based composite is assured by the chemical reaction of the methacrylate-based and silorane molecules contained in the specific adhesive system.<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Several studies have reported that there is no significant difference in the bond strength values between composite and dentin promoted by self-etching and conventional adhesive systems.<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> However, Sheets et al. demonstrated that pre-etching of the dentin surface with phosphoric acid increases the bond strength significantly in comparison with self-etching systems.<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> For Van Landuyt et al., the fact that self-etching adhesive systems simplify the clinical procedure does not mean that these systems improve the performance of restorations made with composites.<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> According to these same authors, self-etching adhesive systems, particularly the one-step type, tend to present lower bond strength than the conventional three-step systems, and they are not always simpler to apply.<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Moreover, interface analysis by TEM demonstrated a great variation among the one-step adhesives, depending on their composition and acidity.<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> In this case, at least two different types of hybrid layers could be observed ultramorphologically: a) completely demineralized hybrid layer in which all hydroxyapatite was removed; and b) a partially demineralized hybrid layer with hydroxyapatite crystals.<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Also, light-microscopic evaluation of adhesive solution homogeneity demonstrated that one-step self-etching adhesives were prone to form droplets, which makes their application difficult, and their technique more sensitive.<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Nevertheless, two-step self-etching systems, such as the one used in this study, present advantages in comparison with conventional three-step systems because the critical phases during acid etching and its removal are avoided. Hence, their application becomes not only faster but easier as well.<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>Moreover, acid etching does not always play a fundamental role in bond strength increase.<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The infiltration of resin monomers at the interface of the hybrid layer and dentin surface may be reduced due to the reduction in the gradient of diffusion of resin monomers in association with the blocking effect of the copolymer of polyalkenoic acid present in three-step adhesive system, such as the one used in this study.<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> These findings are in agreement with the results of the present study, since pre-etching did not increase the bond strength for methacrylate-based composite submitted to two-step self-etching adhesive system application. Furthermore, the Three-step/Methacrylate group, which was hybridized with conventional three-step system, presented lower mean bond strength values than the Pre-etching/Methacrylate and Methacrylate groups. According to Van Landuyt et al., these values may be explained by the technique sensitivity which requires more steps, increasing the probability of errors by the operator.<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Short application procedures, such as the self-etching adhesive systems, is interesting for the professional since the number of application steps could determine the technique sensitivity. The more steps, the higher the risk of application failures.<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>However, the same could not be said regarding the specific adhesive system used for silorane-based composite since the best results were obtained by means of pre-etching. The lower values of bond strength obtained with the specific adhesive system combined with the silorane-based composite could be explained by the poor chemical interaction between the components of the adhesive and the composite.<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The silorane specific adhesive system is presented in two bottles, with two different application steps.<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> However, it is considered a one-step adhesive system, with an acid adhesive.<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Such fact may explain the results, since the specific adhesive system do not strongly bond to the silorane-based composite due to its hydrophilic nature, and hydrophobic of the composite.<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Moreover, the specific adhesive system of silorane-based composite requires separate light activation steps for the primer and the adhesive, different from the majority of two-step self-etching systems, in which the application of primer and adhesive is finalized by only one light irradiation.<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The hydrophilic primer of the specific adhesive system is composed of phosphated methacrylate, acid copolymers, methacrylate-based monomers of Bisphenol A-Glycidyl dimethacrylate (Bis-GMA) and Hydroxyethyl-methacrylate (HEMA), a system of solvents that contain water and ethanol to humidify and penetrate into the dentin surface, a photoinitiator system based on Camphorquinone and silane treated silica particles (3M ESPE). Due to the relatively high HEMA content, the previous application of primer would be very vulnerable to the absorption of water if the hydrophobic layer of the silorane adhesive were not applied.<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Therefore, according to Mine et al., in addition to providing a bond compatible with the resin matrix of silorane, the application of individual rounds of light activation on the components of the adhesive system is beneficial, which provides greater stability of the composite-tooth substrate bond and long term durability of the hybrid layer.<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>Mine et al. characterized the ultra-structure of the hybrid layer formed between the enamel/dentin and the adhesive system of a silorane-based composite.<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> An interesting fact observed was the infiltration of silver nitrate along the adhesive interface of the silorane system, between the primer and adhesive, and within the primer itself, indicating the presence of porosities in the hybrid layer. Silver nitrate is frequently used for the observation of spaces at the bond interface, which may be responsible for the nanoleakage of fluids, compromising the integrity of the hybrid layer.<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The phenomena observed by Mine et al. are probably related to the hydrophilicity of the HEMA and water containing primer, which is more difficult to remove with jets of air, resulting in greater failures at the primer/adhesive interface than at the adhesive/dentin interface.<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> This water present in the primer of the adhesive system reacts with the phosphorylated methacrylate present in the adhesive systems, generating the hydrogen ions necessary for demineralizing the dentin.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> However, in areas where polymerization of the adhesive system does not occur completely, water molecules may persist within the collagen network or adhesive layer, degrading bonding over the course of time.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>The adhesive system of the silorane-based composite is considered a 'mild' self-etching system when compared with other self-etching systems due to its pH which is around 2.7. Nevertheless, it produces intense intertubular demineralization.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> According to Duarte et al., the silorane-based composite specific adhesive system promotes intense intertubular decalcification exposing the collagen fibrils.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> However, the dentinal tubules still remain blocked by smear plugs. Therefore, few resin tags are observed due to the presence of remaining smear plug within the dentin tubules, which makes adhesive infiltration difficult.</p><p>When applied on smear layer-free dentin, the adhesive system forms a hybrid layer with larger resin tags due to the greater penetration of the primer into the dentinal tubules. This is different from when it is applied on thick smear layers, which interrupt the resin tags formation, and affect the efficacy of the adhesive bond, decreasing the bond strength values, as observed in the present study.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> However, according to Lohbauer et al., the length of resin tags does not influence the bond strength of self-etching adhesive systems since the resin monomers present in the adhesive penetrate into the exposed collagen fibrils network, forming an interlock, which micromechanically guarantees satisfactory bond strength.<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>Pre-etching with phosphoric acid prior to silorane-based composite specific adhesive system application demonstrated a significant increase in the bond strength values in comparison with the group in which the adhesive system was applied in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. However, the same cannot be said for methacrylate-based composite. The different characteristics of silorane and conventional dimethacrylate-based composites could explain such conflicting results, since the two composites used self-etching adhesive systems. The silorane specific adhesive system involves the application of an initial hydrophilic solution - the primer - to form the base for bonding with the dental tissues; and a second solution - the adhesive agent - which has a hydrophobic nature in order to complement bonding to the primer and unite with the hydrophobic monomer of the composite.<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> However, according to Fernandes et al., such components have some degree of incompatibility.<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The efficiency of dentin etching depends more on the chemical composition of the adhesive than the effect of the phosphoric acid itself.<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Thereby, the results of the present study suggest a greater chemical interaction between the components of methacrylate-based composite and its adhesive system, irrespective of the pre-etching.<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>One of the main characteristics of the silorane-based composite is its low polymerization shrinkage.<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> However, the application of its specific adhesive system in strict accordance with the manufacturer's instructions restricts its use due to its lower bond strength values.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Although low-shrinkage silorane-based composite represents an evolution in restorative dentistry, its specific self-etching adhesive system does not present a similar performance to the conventional ones.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Within the limitations of this <italic>in vitro</italic> study, it was concluded that pre-etching increased bond strength of silorane-based composite specific adhesive system to dentin. Despite the fact that association between specific self-etching adhesive system of silorane composite and pre-etching promoted higher bond strength, further studies are still necessary before the clinical application of this bond strategy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>The authors of this study would like to thank CNPq for the financial support (Process No. 2011.1.1199.58.0).
