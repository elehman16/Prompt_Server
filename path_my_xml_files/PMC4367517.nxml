<bold>Background </bold>Heart failure is one of the most prevalent chronic conditions in adults, leading to prolonged morbidity, repeated hospitalizations, and placing tremendous economic burden on the healthcare system. Heart failure patients discharged from rural hospitals, or primarily critical access hospitals, have higher 30-day readmission and mortality rates compared to patients discharged from urban hospitals. Self-management improves heart failure patients&#x02019; health outcomes and reduces re-hospitalizations, but adherence to self-management guidelines is low. We propose a home based post-acute care service managed by advanced practice nurses to enhance patient activation and lead to the improvement of self-management adherence in heart failure patients discharged from rural hospitals.</p><p>
<bold>Objective </bold>This article describes the study design and research methods used to implement and evaluate the intervention.</p><p>
<bold>Method</bold> Our intervention is a 12-week patient activation (Patient AcTivated Care at Home [PATCH]) to improve self-management adherence. Patients were randomized into two parallel groups (12-week PATCH intervention + usual care vs. usual care only) to evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention. Outcomes were measured at baseline, 3 and 6 months.</p><p>
<bold>Discussion</bold>
</p><p>This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a rural theory based, advance practice nurse led, activation enhancing intervention on the self-management adherence in heart failure patients residing in rural areas. Our expectation is to facilitate adherence to self-management behaviors in heart failure patients following discharge from rural hospitals and decrease complications and hospital readmissions, leading to the reduction of economic burden.&#x000a0;</p><p>

<sup><xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and reducing re-hospitalizations
<sup><xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Non-adherence to self-management guidelines accounted for 50% of hospital readmissions in heart failure patients
<sup><xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.</p><p>Compared to urban residents, patients in rural communities face greater challenges in managing their heart failure
<sup><xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Difficulties include lack of local cardiac services and heart failure specialists
<sup><xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, lack of heart failure specific self-management guidance from providers
<sup><xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, less hospital discharge education at critical access hospitals, lack of follow-up by providers
<sup><xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, poor communication between the patient and providers, difficulty in traveling long distances for follow-up appointments and associated problems (time, fatigue, and cost)
<sup><xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, and feeling isolated and unsupported
<sup><xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Despite these identified needs, effective programs to support heart failure patients in managing this complex, chronic condition in rural communities have not been reported
<sup><xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. In addition, there is lack of reimbursement for programs that promote heart failure patients engaging in self-management behaviors over time. Innovative programs, such as the proposed PATCH program, are needed to assist heart failure patients&#x02019; self-management adherence.</p><p>The effective interventions to improve adherence to heart failure self-management behaviors are primarily disease management programs
<sup><xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> which require intensive resources and are mainly delivered in urban areas with comprehensive medical care centers. The limitations of existing interventions to promote self-management adherence in rural heart failure patients include: lack of theoretical guidance for the development of a rural-based intervention
<sup><xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, unclear mechanism of intervention

<sup><xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>.</p><p>Our study will fill the gap of knowledge and evidence existing in the current literature about self-management interventions by: 1) identifying and appraising new intervention mechanisms to improve self-management behaviors; 2) testing the feasibility and efficacy of a rural theory-based intervention designed to assist rural heart failure patients in managing their chronic condition; and 3) evaluating the use of biomarkers (i.e., brain natriuretic peptide [BNP] and sodium concentration collected from a spot urine sample) to assess the adherence of self-management behaviors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conceptual framework</title><p>Self-management adherence is defined as the ability to follow and engage in self-management behaviors recommended in heart failure treatment guidelines (e.g., monitor daily weight, follow a restricted sodium diet, take medication as prescribed, exercise regularly, and keep follow-up appointments)
<sup><xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. We have proposed the patient activation intervention PATCH (Patient AcTivated Care at Home Model) for this study based on components of Lorig&#x02019;s chronic disease self-management model
<sup><xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, Hibbard&#x02019;s patient activation theory
<sup><xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>, Bandura&#x02019;s conceptualization of self-efficacy
<sup><xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>, and Long and Weinert&#x02019;s rural nursing theory
<sup><xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). According to Long and Weinert&#x02019;s rural nursing theory, rural patients are more likely to accept help and care during times of crisis
<sup><xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Therefore, the intervention is triggered by the patient&#x02019;s hospitalization and initiated during their hospital stay when they feel most vulnerable and receptive to the idea of making behavioral change to avoid readmission. Rural patients&#x02019; belief about self-reliance (responsibility for one&#x02019;s own care) supports the use of Hibbard&#x02019;s patient activation theory
<sup><xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1. </label><caption><title>

<sup><xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Our central hypothesis, based upon our preliminary data, is that patients with higher activation levels, as assessed by the Hibbard patient activation measure, will have significantly better self-management adherence. Given the significant challenges of managing heart failure patients in rural settings, it is essential to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and size of the effects of PATCH on adherence to self-management behaviors and readmissions.</p><p>We test our intervention with the following aims:</p><p>
<bold>Aim 1. To evaluate the immediate and extended effects of the patient activation intervention on self-management adherence</bold>, we measure adherence using clinical biomarkers and self-report of self&#x02013;management behaviors. Our working hypothesis (H
<sub>1</sub>) is that subjects in the intervention group have better self-management adherence than the usual care group over time (3 and 6 months).</p><p>
<bold>Aim 2. To evaluate the immediate and extended effects of the patient activation intervention on the specific health outcome</bold>, we measure hospital readmission rates. Our working hypothesis (H
<sub>2</sub>) is that subjects in the intervention group have lower readmission rate than the usual care group over time (30 days, 3 and 6 months).</p><p>
<bold>Aim 3. To evaluate the mechanism of the patient activation intervention.</bold> Our working hypothesis (H
<sub>3</sub>) is that the scores on self-management knowledge, self-efficacy for self-management, patient activation, and self-management strategies in the intervention group are higher than the usual care group at the end of the intervention (3 months) when the maximum difference for each variable is expected.</p><p>
<bold>Aim 4. To evaluate the feasibility of the PATCH intervention</bold> for a future larger clinical trial, which includes evaluation of enrollment (recruitment efficiency, attrition, problems and solutions), intervention fidelity (delivery, receipt, enactment), data collection, subject acceptability of the intervention, and estimation of effect sizes for sample size determination.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><sec><title>Study settings</title><p>Study participants were recruited and enrolled between October 2013 and December 2014 from two rural critical access hospitals.

For Aim 1, a repeated-measures ANOVA with an average between-group difference of Cohen&#x02019;s f=.25 (a medium effect) and a within-subject correlation of &#x02264;.6 would require 41 patients per group to have power=.80. With this sample size, a z-test of independent proportions would have power=.79 if the group proportions meeting guidelines differed by approximately .25, a value reached or exceeded by medication, diet, and weighing adherence in most of the intervention trials reviewed
<sup><xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. The sample of 82 also would be large enough to estimate proportions &#x000b1; .07&#x02013;.13 with 90% confidence (the precision depends on the value of the proportion and whether it was calculated within-group or for the entire sample).

The intervention was comprised of two phases in which the in-hospital discharge education session was followed by 12 weeks of post-discharge education sessions delivered by telephone. The telephone delivery mode was a reliable method to reach patients living in rural counties where internet service was often unreliable and costly. In addition, telephone contact was preferred by many elderly patients because of the complexity of navigating and manipulating other communication platforms
<sup><xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>.</p><p>During
<bold><underline>Phase I</underline> (in-hospital discharge education session)</bold>, the intervention was delivered in the hospital to capture a &#x0201c;teachable moment&#x0201d; when patients had recently experienced deteriorated health and recognized the need to better manage their heart failure. The intervention was focused on assessing the patient&#x02019;s intent and readiness to assume a self-management role or encouraging the patient to assume this role (patient activation level 1) and building knowledge, skills and confidence specific to areas of knowledge deficit identified by the patient (patient activation level 2). The teaching materials included: 1) an educational workbook developed by Dr. Darren DeWalt at the Cecil G. Sheps Health Services Research Center for heart failure patients (

<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ahrq.gov/qual/goinghomeguide.pdf">http://www.ahrq.gov/qual/goinghomeguide.pdf</ext-link>) and 3) the personal stories about living with heart failure posted on the American Heart Association webpage (

The overall goal was to establish the initial patient-provider relationship and encourage patients to take an active role in self-management. At discharge, each participant from the intervention group received an intervention toolkit containing the heart failure self-management workbooks, an electronic talking pillbox and a digital scale.</p><p>During
<bold><underline>Phase II</underline></bold> (
<bold>post-discharge phone education sessions</bold>), a total of 11 phone contacts were made with the patient (twice a week for the first 2 weeks, once a week for weeks 3&#x02013;6, and every other week for weeks 7&#x02013;12). Each session focused on 1&#x02013;2 topics and confirmed the patient&#x02019;s understanding of the knowledge and skills delivered during their hospital stay. The goals for the
<bold>Phase II</bold> intervention were to establish a therapeutic patient-provider relationship and to monitor and reinforce self-management behaviors. Each session started with an informal assessment of the patient&#x02019;s activation level and the intervention strategies were modified based on the results. The length of the intervention and number of sessions were similar to Wolever&#x02019;s study that showed effects of a telephone delivered patient activation intervention on the improvement of self-management behaviors in type 2 diabetic patients

Descriptive statistics are reported at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. Chi &#x02013;square tests were used to evaluate the difference between proportions. We used t-tests to compare the averages of continuous variable between groups.</p><p>For the continuous outcomes (days of self-weighing and taking prescribed medication, physical activity outcomes, and level of BNP and urine Na/Cr), linear mixed model methods are used to compare the groups across the 6-month period, adjusting for baseline levels on the respective outcome. We used ANOVA analysis for repeated measures. Kaplan-Meier method is used for survival analysis to estimate the difference of hospital readmission occurrence between groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will examine the effectiveness of a rural theory based, advance practice nurse led, activation enhancing intervention on the self-management adherence in heart failure patients residing in rural areas. The findings of this study could fill the gap of knowledge in self-management research in rural heart failure populations.</p><p>The long-term goals of this research are to: 1) test this patient activation intervention in other rural patient populations with multiple chronic conditions; 2) develop a rural based patient activation conceptual framework to guide the design and implementation of interventions to promote life-long self-management adherence in rural and underserved communities; and 3) develop a point of care tool kit for heart failure patients to provide timely feedback about their performance in managing their chronic conditions.</p><p>Our expectation is to facilitate adherence to self-management behaviors in heart failure patients following discharge from rural hospitals and decrease complications and hospital readmissions, leading to the reduction of economic burden.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Institutes Nursing Research of the National Institutes of Health under award number 1R15NR 13769-01A1.

<italic>et al. </italic>does an excellent job aiming to propose an intervention and evaluation of it for self-management among heart failure patients discharged from rural hospitals. With the prevalence of heart failure, self-management of patients plays a critical role in their improvement of quality of life, relief of exacerbation of symptoms and readmission to hospitals. Patients discharged from rural hospitals especially need education and guidance to improve adherence. The authors tried to solve this needs and described in detail the innovative intervention of a 12-week patient activation (Patient AcTivated Care at Home [PATCH]). And this paper is well-organized in clarifying the rational and design of the study to evaluate feasibility and efficacy of PATCH. Moreover, the authors showed us a vision of implementation of this intervention.&#x000a0;</p><p>The genesis of this study based on solid nursing and patients&#x02019; activation theories. And a prospective, two-group, randomized experimental design with three data collection points (baseline, 3 months and 6 months) were chosen to assess the feasibility and efficacy of the intervention. Sample size was carefully estimated. Also, different measures on biomarkers, outcomes and self-management were designed. In order to prevent the possible cognitive or psychotic confounding factors, simple screening tests were required to conduct prior to enrollment. The article was well constructed, the study was well designed, and interpretation was prudent.</p><p>However, there are some comments and suggestions for authors to consider. First, is it practical for a rural heart failure patient to complete so many questions on measurements of self-management knowledge, self-efficacy, patients&#x02019; activity and strategies at one visit? Suggest simplified measurable scales. Second, for measurements of adherence of self-management, only data at 3 months were collected. Will it help to analyze extended effects of the intervention by record data at 6 months?</p><p>Finally, this work is a good reminder for all the cardiologists to pay more attention to the management and education of heart failure patients. The novel intervention of PATCH might acts as an example to help more and more heart failure patients.</p><p>I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined above.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="report7376" article-type="peer-review"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5256/f1000research.6416.r7376</article-id><title-group><article-title>Referee response for version 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Salameh</surname><given-names>Pascale</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="r7376a1">1</xref><role>Referee</role></contrib><aff id="r7376a1"><label>1</label>Faculty of Public Health, Section II, Lebanese University, Beirut, Lebanon</aff></contrib-group><author-notes><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>

However, some points should be met:</p><p>
<bold>Study design: </bold>References are needed for interventions. More details are particularly needed for the major PATCH intervention.</p><p>
<bold>Figure 2: </bold>Why not add the number of patients for each step, since the study is already over?</p><p>
<bold>Statistical analysis: </bold>Why adjust over baseline value of the measure in question only? Adjustment over other baseline variables may also be needed in case randomization did not succeed to equilibrate them.

<bold>One more point:</bold> In several locations in the manuscript, the authors say it is an exploratory work. Why? What is lacking?</p><p>I have read this submission.
