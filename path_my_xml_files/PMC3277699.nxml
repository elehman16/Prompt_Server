The American College of Obstetrician and Gynecologists has recently stated that the causes of recurrent fetal losses are similar in women who have suffered two losses or more when compared with women who have had three losses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Approximately 1% of all women trying to conceive have RMs; when RM is defined as two previous miscarriages, the proportion rises to 5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. They may or may not follow a successful birth. About half of RMs are unexplained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Medical investigations usually begin after a third loss, but some centers investigate after two losses on the basis that the risk of failure in the next pregnancy increases substantially [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) Special Interest Group for Early Pregnancy (SIGEP) protocol for the investigation and medical management of RM, based on the data of recently published large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analysis, recommended that basic investigations of a couple presenting with RMs should include obstetric and family history, age, BMI, and exposure to toxins, full blood count, antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies), parental karyotype, pelvic ultrasound and/or hysterosalpingogram [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The most compelling association between pregnancy loss and autoimmune phenomena has been with the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies&#x02014;Lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies and at least one clinical manifestation, the most common being venous or arterial thrombosis and recurrent fetal loss. The syndrome occurs in isolation, or in association with connective tissue diseases, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It may coexist with several, predominantly autoimmune diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Pregnancy loss associated with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) has traditionally been ascribed to thrombosis of the utero-placental vasculature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]; however, thrombosis is neither a universal nor a specific finding in aPL pregnancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Management of APS focuses on anticoagulation; however, despite the solid evidence suggesting that this is the best treatment option available, a lot of debates persist regarding the intensity and duration of anticoagulation needed in various subsets of APS. Thus there are currently no uniformly agreement upon management algorithm for APS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Although several treatments have been advocated, heparin and aspirin treatments are emerging as the treatment of choice for APA syndrome associated with recurrent pregnancy loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Dawes et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] demonstrated that low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) may be more effective than unfractionated heparin, because it is more effectively absorbed after subcutaneous administration and has a longer half life in the circulation. This represents an important role for LMWH in the treatment of APS in pregnancy, because it causes less bleeding in both vaginal and abdominal deliveries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Many types of LMWH have been used alone or in combination with aspirin low dose with different results in different settings for prevention of miscarriages associated with APS, but the current study is regarded as the first one using the new second generation LMWH (Bemiparin) alone as a trial for prevention of RM due to APS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary outcome measure was to compare the live birth rate in women presented with RM due to APS treated with LMWH versus aspirin low dose, secondary outcomes included obstetrical complications, fetal and maternal adverse events in both treatment groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>A clinical comparative study was performed to investigate whether treatment with LMWH versus ALD results in increased live birth rate in women with history of RPL and APS, in Maternity Teaching Hospital, Erbil city, Kurdistan region, North of Iraq from 15th of September 2007 to the 1st of August 2010.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Women considered participants in this trial fulfilled the following criteria: aged 18&#x02013;42&#x000a0;years at the time of interview; a history of &#x02265;2 unexplained consecutive pregnancy losses before 20&#x000a0;weeks gestation; persistent presence of anticardiolipin antibodies and or Lupus anticoagulant in two occasions 8&#x000a0;weeks apart.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>The included Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, known peptic ulcer disease, sensitivity to Aspirin or Heparin depending on patients&#x02019; history report, previous venous thromboembolic disease requiring ongoing anticoagulant therapy and failure to consent to participate.</p><p>Cases with SLE were excluded from the study because pregnant mothers with SLE should remain under medical care until delivery, they have an extra increased risk for pregnancy complications, usually they are on multiple medications depending on the system involved by the disease (patients require warfarn or cyclophosphamide therapy should not get pregnant), they may be on Non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, Anti-malarial drugs, glucocorticoids, or immunosuppressive drugs like methotrexate. SLE may flare up during pregnancy and has its own complications regarding the fetus and newborn babies.</p><p>Other causes for RM were regarded as exclusion criteria. Hormonal assay was carried out to exclude polycystic ovarian syndrome and thyroid dysfunction, hysterosalpingogram/Ultrasound was done to exclude anatomical causes for RM, cervical cultures for mycoplasma and urea plasma to exclude bacterial vaginosis infection. To exclude frank diabetes as a risk factor for RM, glucose tolerance test was done for suspicious cases, karyotype analysis for both parents was done for both parents depending on a local laboratory in the city which was available recently in our city, and other cases we depend on the results done abroad by the patients themselves.</p><p>Only one case with type 1 diabetes mellitus was not excluded from the study being a case with strictly controlled blood sugar with a high level of anticardiolipin antibody titer in two occasions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Laboratory evaluation</title><p>To confirm the diagnosis of APS in the participant, positive serology was defined as at least one of the following tests to be positive in two occasions:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Anticardiolipin antibodies in medium to high titer levels were identified using a standardized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) IgG &#x0003e;15 IgG phospholipids units (GPL) or IgM &#x0003e;25 IgM phospholipids units (MPL).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Lupus anticoagulant measured by prolonged phospholipid-dependent coagulation (aPTT, Kaolin clotting time, dilute Russell viper venom test, dilute PT), the prolonged coagulation time was failed to be corrected by a mix with platelet poor plasma and the prolongation of coagulation time was also corrected with excess phospholipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>Anti-&#x003b2;2 glycoprotein 1 IgG and/or IgM isotype in serum or plasma is also regarded as one of the criteria for diagnosis of APS, it was not done in the current trial because the method was not available in our city and to diagnose APS at least one of the clinical criteria and only one of the laboratory criteria should be met.</p></list-item></list></p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size consists of 146 ladies presented to the maternity teaching hospital, with RM, clinical and laboratory evaluation done for all the cases; all known causes for RM were excluded except for APS and they were asked to attained the hospital as soon as they miss a period of their menstrual cycle.

The study time was about 3&#x000a0;years and most of patients got pregnant within this period of time except five cases who were referred to a special infertility unit in the maternity teaching hospital. Sixty-one cases were randomly assigned to receive Low Dose Aspirin (LDA) before pregnancy was diagnosed at suspected month and continued throughout pregnancy till 36&#x000a0;weeks gestation, the other group of 80 cases were assigned to receive LMWH (Bemiparin) with the diagnosis of pregnancy.

One woman in the Bemiparin group developed severe preeclampsia. This woman had type 1 diabetes mellitus and was on insulin. She was 24&#x000a0;years old with a history of diabetes for 10&#x000a0;years; her blood sugar was strictly controlled in all her previous pregnancies, which ended in miscarriages in the first trimester. Blood test for anticardiolipin antibody was high on more than two occasions, for that reason she was included in our trial being a case of APS rather than an uncontrolled diabetes causing RM.</p><p>Five cases out of 80 in the Bemiparin group presented with slight ecchymosis at the injection site.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this trial we found that the use of the new second generation LMWH (Bemiparin) in patients with history of RM due to APS improves the live birth rate in comparison to LDA alone. The live birth rate was 86.25% in the LMWH group versus 72.13% in the LDA alone group.</p><p>The present standard of care for women with aPL and RPL is treatment with heparin and low dose aspirin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. There have been a number of randomized control trials for patients with RPL due to aPL evaluating either unfractionated heparin (UFH) or LMWH over the past 15&#x000a0;years. Each trial determined its inclusion criteria; however, regardless of differences in aPL status among the various trials, the live birth rates were similar ranging from 71.1 to 84%. The only significant differences among trial outcomes were in the LDA-only treatment arms: the live birth rates in those varied from a low of 42.2% to a high of 80% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>To date, studies confirmed that treatment with LMWH plus LDA should be considered as the standard therapy for recurrent pregnancy loss due to aPL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. All these previous studies used previously wellknown LMWH like Enoxaprin. Also, there were many studies also using heparin alone or in combination with LDA with different success rates regarding live birth rate. Using a new LMWH in the current trial, we suspect the results to be similar to the reults of previous published trials using other LMWHs.</p><p>Bemiparin was the first LMWH to be marketed in our city since 2007; formerly UFH was available with unrecognized sources because of the political problems of Iraqi people.</p><p>Our trial is regarded as the first to be published on pregnant ladies receiving Bemiparin from the time of diagnosis of pregnancy and up to 36&#x000a0;weeks of gestation, and having a success rate of 86% in cases of APS associated with RPL.</p><p>There were no major adverse events associated with both treatment arms and this result was in agreement with an RCT done by Carl et al. to compare live birth rates in women with RPL and either autoantibodies or a coagulation abnormality, treated with heparin plus aspirin (LMWH/ASA) or ASA alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>The mean birth weight for newborns was higher in the Bemiparin group. Because there was no head-to-head study comparing LMWH (Bemiparin) versus LDA for prevention of RPL in the first trimester due to APS, the relative effect of Bemiparin versus LDA regarding birth weight is unknown.</p><p>Regarding the single case with type 1 diabetes and being positive to APS, type 1 diabetes is an indicator of immune dysregulation that develops as a result of an autoimmune process. It has been reported that patients with type 1 diabetes have a high level of aCL antibodies as a marker of autoimmune dysregulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Future research may concentrate on cases with good diabetes control but still present with RM to investigate for other types of autoantibodeis that may be responsible for the recurrent pregnancy losses.</p><p>There were some limitations in the current study that warrant consideration. The study was stratified by the presence of acquired autoantibody syndrome (APS); by checking for only aPL, inherited thrombophilia was not tested for in the sample size. We consider it appropriate to test for a boarder spectrum of autoantibodies in patient presenting with RPL.</p><p>The current study included women with a history of two or more consecutive first trimester miscarriages, depending on the definition used by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] rather than the definition of three or more miscarriages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], which is used traditionally to define RM. This may have theoretically diluted the result of the trial. Trials on RPL and the use of different treatment protocols abroad show that the selection of cases according to the history of previous miscarriages differ from two to three RPL with no significant difference concluded in the results depending on the previous number of miscarriages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Also there was no difference in the pregnancy outcome in women having a history of less than and more than three pregnancy losses in both treatment arms in the current trial.</p><p>Our study was an open label RCT; the patients were randomly assigned to each treatment group, but they were then made aware of the group to which they were assigned taking into consideration that the ethical concern of subjecting pregnant women to daily placebo injection for 36&#x000a0;weeks gestation is in favor of using an open label design.</p><p>The use of LDA is on the basis that it is a wellknown antiplatelet drug that has been used in many previous and update trials alone or in combination with heparin in cases of RPL due to APS; its use was either as a treatment arm or as a control group to compare the efficacy of the new heparin.</p><p>Although the live birth rate of the current study was high, further research is needed using larger sample sizes, comparing the drug with a true control group and a combination of the drug with LDA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The use of the new second generation LMWH (Bemiparin) in comparison to LDA during pregnancy for prevention of RM in women with APS is a safe, reliable method with a high live birth rate and no maternal and fetal complications.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>There is no conflict of interest in relation to the current article.</p><p><bold>Open Access</bold> This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License which permits any noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bricker</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Farquharson</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Types of pregnancy loss in recurrent miscarriage: implications for research and clinical practice</article-title><source>Hum Reprod</source><year>2000</year><volume>17</volume><fpage>1345</fpage><lpage>1350</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1093/humrep/17.5.1345</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11980763</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Carson A, Branch W (2001) Management of recurrent early pregnancy loss, Compendium selected publications.
