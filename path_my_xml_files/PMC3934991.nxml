Preclinical studies, predominantly in breast cancer, have suggested that stathmin may additionally be a predictive marker for response to paclitaxel. We first evaluated the response to paclitaxel in endometrial cancer cell lines before and after stathmin knock-down. Subsequently we investigated the clinical response to paclitaxel containing chemotherapy in metastatic endometrial cancer in relation to stathmin protein level in tumors. Stathmin level was also determined in metastatic lesions, analyzing changes in biomarker status on disease progression. Knock-down of stathmin improved sensitivity to paclitaxel in endometrial carcinoma cell lines with both naturally higher and lower sensitivity to paclitaxel. In clinical samples, high stathmin level was demonstrated to be associated with poor response to paclitaxel containing chemotherapy and to reduced disease specific survival only in patients treated with such combination. Stathmin level increased significantly from primary to metastatic lesions. This study suggests, supported by both preclinical and clinical data, that stathmin could be a predictive biomarker for response to paclitaxel treatment in endometrial cancer. Re-assessment of stathmin level in metastatic lesions prior to treatment start may be relevant. Also, validation in a randomized clinical trial will be important.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Helse Vest, Research Council of Norway (803100, 805797) and The Norwegian Cancer Society (Harald Andersens legat) supported this study.

Stathmin is expressed in all tissues. It is a critical regulator of microtubule dynamics through its microtubule destabilizing properties, including both prevention of polymerization and active promotion of microtubule depolymerization <xref rid="pone.0090141-Belletti1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0090141-Rubin1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Phosphorylation of stathmin on four serine residues in the beginning of the mitotic phase attenuates its destabilizing activities, allowing cells to form a mitotic spindle; dephosphorylation then takes place prior to exit of mitosis <xref rid="pone.0090141-Belletti1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090141-Rubin1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Stathmin is also involved in intracellular transport, cell motility, polarity, maintenance of cell shape and regulation of apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0090141-Belletti1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>A biomarker is defined as a 'characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biologic processes, pathogenic processes or pharmacologic responses to a specified therapeutic intervention <xref rid="pone.0090141-BiomarkersDefinitionsWorking1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Biomarkers can be divided in various types, such as prognostic; linked to the prognosis of a patient independent of treatment, and predictive biomarkers; that identify patient subpopulations most likely to (not) respond to a treatment <xref rid="pone.0090141-BiomarkersDefinitionsWorking1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Thus, reliable predictive biomarkers are of paramount importance for improved and individualized treatment.</p><p>Stathmin is upregulated in many solid cancers, including endometrial cancer <xref rid="pone.0090141-Belletti1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090141-Baquero1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0090141-Trovik1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, and its upregulation has been associated with clinicopathological variables of aggressive disease such as increased risk of lymph node metastasis <xref rid="pone.0090141-Kang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090141-Trovik2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and poor survival <xref rid="pone.0090141-Baquero1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090141-Kang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090141-Kouzu1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090141-Salvesen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090141-Su1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090141-Saal1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, confirming stathmins role as a prognostic biomarker.</p><p>Presently, few predictive markers are known in human cancers and even less are clinically applied.

This impact of stathmin protein level on treatment response was limited to anti-microtubule agents.

In endometrial cancer to our knowledge no studies, preclinical nor clinical, have explored an association between stathmin level and response to paclitaxel containing chemotherapy. In this report, we demonstrate in endometrial carcinoma cell lines, that reduction of stathmin levels by stathmin knock-down results in improved response to paclitaxel.

The identification and development of predictive biomarkers are of paramount importance to increase treatment efficacy and reduce unnecessary side effects, not only in targeted therapies but also in chemotherapeutic regimes, as for both counts that only a subpopulation will respond well, especially in the metastatic setting, but with currently very limited tools available to predict these patients <xref rid="pone.0090141-Amant1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090141-Halle1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. None of the important clinicopathological factors, such as FIGO stage or histological subtype, are currently known to help distinguish potential responders from non-responders to paclitaxel containing chemotherapy in the metastatic setting. Studying large population based series with high-quality clinical annotation such as our series, combined with preclinical experiments are a useful and time-efficient tool to explore potential predictive biomarkers, which can subsequently be tested in clinical trials.</p><p>In line with previous <italic>in vitro</italic> results in breast cancer, we show in endometrial cancer cell lines that, independent of the original stathmin level, sensitivity to paclitaxel increased and thereby apoptosis expedited after successful stathmin knock-down. This was shown by direct microscopic counting and in Ishikawa cells also substantiated by immunoblotting focusing on PARP cleavage. PARP cleavage is an established indicator of apoptosis, distinguishing it from other mechanisms of cell death, such as necrosis. The increased apoptotic body formation noted by microscopy in the stathmin knock-down cell lines fits with increased apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0090141-Galluzzi1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090141-Taatjes1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.</p><p>In our prospectively collected, retrospectively analyzed patient series, we also demonstrated a striking difference in response to paclitaxel containing chemotherapy comparing patients with normal to those with high stathmin level, also when correcting for the most important clinicopathological prognostic variables. Even when exploring such a large clinical series with endometrial cancer patients as ours, collected over more than 10 years, with adequate follow-up and RECIST <xref rid="pone.0090141-Eisenhauer1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> compliant documentation of response, ultimately only a smaller number of patients had been treated with the treatment of interest, underlining the difficulty of collecting series with adequate patient numbers for specific marker studies; but at the same time the importance to exploit these large prospectively collected population based series for predictive biomarkers suggested in preclinical studies, and explore potential clinical validity prior to clinical trial stage. The statistically significant correlation between high stathmin level and poor paclitaxel response according to RECIST criteria in clinical samples and the fact that stathmin level has an independent prognostic value in patients receiving paclitaxel for metastatic disease, not present in patients who do not, in survival analyses, supports the likelihood that the level of stathmin level may act not only as a prognostic marker but also as a predictive marker for response to paclitaxel treatment in endometrial carcinomas.</p><p>Unlike previous studies looking at stathmin as a potential predictive marker, predominantly in <italic>in vitro</italic> breast cancer studies, in this study we were able to test and confirm the association in clinical samples from patients treated with the drug of interest; using data from a well-annotated prospectively collected patient series. Both the preclinical and clinical testing support that stathmin level influences sensitivity to paclitaxel. We have explored and excluded that this effect can be generalized to other chemotherapeutic agents such as carboplatin, also frequently used in endometrial cancer.</p><p>Reporting recommendations for tumor marker prognostic studies (REMARK) guidelines have been developed with the aim to improve the methodological quality and reporting transparency in such studies <xref rid="pone.0090141-McShane1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. The current study has been performed in accordance to these guidelines to improve the quality and general validity of its results.</p><p>Taxanes, originally isolated from the bark of the yew tree, belong to the family of anti-microtubule chemotherapeutic agents, with paclitaxel as their prototype. Simply put, taxanes bind to &#x003b2; -tubulin, causing microtubules to resist depolymerization, inhibiting cell cycle progression and promoting mitotic arrest and cell death <xref rid="pone.0090141-Xiao1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Carboplatin, in contrast, is one of the platinum based agents, interacting with DNA and interfering with DNA repair. As stathmin is a critical regulator of microtubule dynamics, taken into consideration the mode of action of the drugs, the positive effect of stathmin knock-down on paclitaxel response and the absence of it to carboplatin sensitivity, is also biologically plausible.</p><p>We show a higher proportion of high stathmin level in metastatic (37%) compared with primary lesions (18%). Discrepancy in stathmin status was noted in a quarter of paired samples, paralleling findings in e.g. breast cancer where discrepancies between primary and metastatic lesions are shown in 14&#x02013;55% and 0&#x02013;40% for hormone receptors and HER2 respectively <xref rid="pone.0090141-Arslan1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0090141-Simmons1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.
