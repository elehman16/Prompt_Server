mobilization technique on improvement of lower limb function in patient with poststroke
hemiparesis. [Subjects] Twenty- two stroke patients participated in this study. [Methods]
They were randomly selected based on selection criteria and divided into two groups. In
the subject group (n=10), sciatic nerve mobilization with conventional physical therapy
was applied to patients. In the control group (n=10), only conventional physical therapy
was applied to stroke patients. [Results] There were significant differences between the
two groups in pressure, sway, total pressure, angle of the knee joint, and functional
reaching test results in the intervention at two weeks and at four weeks. [Conclusion] The
present study showed that sciatic nerve mobilization with conventional physical therapy
was more effective for lower limb function than conventional physical therapy alone in
patient with poststroke hemiparesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Sciatic nerve mobilization</kwd><kwd>Foot pressure</kwd><kwd>Knee joint angle</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In the treatment of stroke patients, the action of the hamstring muscle is an essential
element in adjusting knee joint extension, which is related to gait; shortening of the
hamstring muscle decreases gait ability<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Mechanical problems resulting from neurological disorders in these areas may reduce the
range of motion of the knee joint. This affects the physiological movement of both the
pelvis and the spine<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, triggering asymmetric weight bearing and excessive pelvic
inclination during gait. These problems also increase posture disturbance and cause
hypertension in the lower limbs, which negatively affects both balance ability and gait
ability<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The sciatic nerve mobilization technique improves the nerve mobility of the hemiparetic
lower limb in a nervous system patient and is helpful in increasing ROM of the lower limbs
without resistance. Improvement in sciatic nerve mobility in stroke patients with functional
disorders in the upper extremities facilitates muscle tension and inhibits spasticity, which
are essential to the functional recovery of the lower limbs. Furthermore, sciatic nerve
mobility is important in rehabilitation and the prevention of injury to the nervous
system<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Several previous studies of nerve
mobilization techniques have been conducted. However, they concern mainly peripheral nerve
system disorders, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, and do not focus on reduction of low back
pain and improvement of flexibility. There has been almost no research on the nerve
mobilization technique, which has been presented as an effective treatment in improving the
function of the lower limbs in stroke patients<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the present study examined the
effects of the sciatic nerve mobilization technique on the lower limbs of stroke patients by
measuring the variables of sway, total pressure, and angle of the knee joint. The functional
reaching test and timed up go test were also used as measurement instruments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 20 patients who were diagnosed with a stroke at least 6

All of the protocols used in this study were approved by the University of
Daejeon. Before participation, the procedures, risks, and benefits were explained to all the
participants, who gave their informed consent. The participants&#x02019; rights were protected
according to the guidelines of the University of Daejeon.</p><p>All the subjects received two daily 30-minute sessions of conservative physical therapy for
the lower limb region five times a week for four weeks. The conservative physical therapy
was based on functional treatment, including sitting to standing, climbing and descending
stairs, and using an alternative anteroposterior step<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The experimental group received the sciatic nerve mobilization
technique for the lower limb after conservative physical therapy.</p><p>The sciatic nerve mobilization technique was conducted in three stages for relaxation of
the sacral nerve<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. First, in a supine
position, the subject placed the neck and trunk in a neutral position. Both sides of the
knee joint were then fixed so that they did not bend. The lower limb on one side was placed
in the maximum straight leg raise position. In this state, a slight vibration was applied,
held for 20 seconds, and repeated three times. In the second stage, ankle joint dorsiflexion
accompanied performance of the straight leg raise, and hip joint adduction and internal
rotation were applied. In the third stage, cervical flexion was sequentially applied so that
the sacral nerve became tense and reached the maximum level. The second and the third stages
were held for 20 seconds and were repeated six times. All procedures were performed
repeatedly for the contralateral lower limb. The application time for all stages was about
10 minutes<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The foot pressure test (Gaitview System AFA-50, Alpus, Seoul, Republic of Korea) was used
to measure the pressure distribution of the soles of the feet and disturbance in a standing
position. To measure plantar pressure, a foot scan board was installed on the ground and
connected to a computer before the static balance test was conducted. Under the oral
instruction to &#x0201c;maintain a straight position as best as possible,&#x0201d; the overall pressure
distribution and postural sway degree of both feet were measured for 10 seconds.</p><p>To measure the knee joint angle, the joint was photographed and then analyzed by a
two-dimensional imaging analyzer system (Dartfish ProSuite, Dfkorea, Seoul, Republic of
Korea). In order to increase the precision of the knee joint angle measurement, a blue
reflective mark was attached to the greater trochanter of the lower limb, lateral
epicondyle, and lateral malleolus of the joint on the paretic side. The subject lay on a
bed, and the hip joint and knee joint on the paretic side of the lower limb were flexed at
90&#x000b0;. During measurement, the examiner maintained the ankle joint on the paretic side in
plantar flexion and manually extended the knee joint to the maximum degree<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In order to test the dynamic balance ability of the subject, the functional reaching test
was conducted<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The subject spread both
feet at shoulder width and stood beside a wall, stretching the non-paretic hand towards the
front and flexing the shoulder joint at 90&#x000b0;. The patient maintained his/her balance at the
maximum level and lowered the trunk toward the front. The distance (cm) at the end of the
third metacarpal bone was measured.</p><p>SPSS 12.0 for Windows was used for the statistical analysis. A one-way repeated measures
analysis of variance was performed in order to compare the measurements from before
intervention, after intervention for 2 weeks, and after intervention for 4 weeks. When there
were significant differences, the Bonferroni method was used as a post hoc comparison test.
In order to compare significant differences between the two groups at each measurement time,
an independent t-test was conducted. The statistical significance level was set at &#x003b1;
=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were significant differences between the two groups in pressure, sway, total

positive effect on the functional improvement in the lower limbs of stroke patients. In the
experimental group, pressure, sway, and total pressure significantly increased after the
nerve mobilization technique compared with the control group. These results alleviated the
mechanical sensitivity that had been heightened by loss of nerve mobility. Furthermore, the
adaptability of the peripheral nerve increased, and compression, excessive friction, and
tension in the sacral nerve decreased. Cowell and Phillips (2002) reported that the nerve
mobilization technique reduced nerve conduction resulting from injuries to the nervous
system and improved the nervous system structure and flexibility of the muscles, alleviating
sensory and motor disorders<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Similarly,
the present study found that improvement in hamstring flexibility might contribute to
improving lower limb movement and balance ability. Factors that interrupt independent daily
life in stroke patients include decreased flexibility of the hamstring, which triggers step
reduction<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, hip joint
extension is predominantly used, resulting in an inappropriate response by the gluteus
maximus and the rectus abdominals, triggering instability in the trunk muscles and causing
loss of balance ability in the trunk<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The results of the measurements of the knee joint angles showed significant improvements in
the experimental group compared with the control group. The present results are similar to
those of a previous study that found that the sciatic nerve mobilization technique promoted
relaxation of the hamstring, increased range of motion of the knee joint, and contributed to
recovery of the normal length of the hamstring<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The sciatic nerve mobilization technique increases the flexibility
of the peripheral nerve and activates neurotransmission fibers related to motor function and
sensory disorders, thus improving the movement and motor ability of the lower limbs<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The results of the functional reach test showed that the experimental group had
significantly higher post-intervention values than the control group did, which suggests
that the sciatic nerve mobilization technique applied to the experimental group was helpful
in enhancing hamstring flexibility. Coutinho et al. (2006) explained the possibility that
muscle performance improved because of increases in the cross-sectional areas of muscle
fibers and in the number of consecutive sarcomeres after stretching the nerves and
muscles<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. This finding is similar to
the present results, which showed that hamstring flexibility significantly increased and
that the nerve mobilization technique improved sciatic nerve mobility and contributed to the
improved flexibility of the stroke patients.</p><p>The therapeutic mechanism of the nerve mobilization technique improves the axonal transport
system, promoting nerve conduction and reducing intraneural compression within the nerves,
thus improving circulation to the nerves<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study has limitations. It was conducted over a short period of four weeks, so the
long-term effects were not evaluated. There is also a limitation in quantifying the power
exerted during stretching in each subject. Therefore, future studies should overcome the
present limitations and research the long-term effects of the nerve mobilization
technique.</p><p>The results showed that application of the sciatic nerve mobilization technique to stroke
patients improved their lower limb function. Therefore, the sciatic nerve mobilization
technique may be considered a treatment method to reduce the mechanical sensitivity of
peripheral nerves and activate nervous system function, thus alleviating functional
disorders of the lower limbs.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Fox</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Effect on hamstring flexibility of hamstring stretching
