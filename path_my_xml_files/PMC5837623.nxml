Briefly, the efficacy and safety of sucroferric oxyhydroxide (1.0&#x02212;3.0 g/day, 2&#x02212;6 tablets/day) were compared with those of sevelamer carbonate (&#x02018;sevelamer&#x02019;; 2.4&#x02212;14.4 g/day, 3&#x02212;18 tablets/day) in adult haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis patients with hyperphosphataemia over 24 weeks of treatment. Eligible patients entered the 28-week extension study, continuing the same treatment and dose they were receiving at the end of the initial study. Patients with serum ferritin &#x0003e;2000 ng/mL were excluded, and oral iron therapies or supplements were not permitted during the study.</p><p>To observe the effects of long-term treatment administration on iron parameters, <italic>post hoc</italic> analyses included only those patients who completed at least 52 weeks of continuous treatment (completer set). To fully investigate changes in iron-related parameters throughout the study, patients were stratified by baseline serum ferritin quartiles (Q1, &#x02264;310 ng/mL; Q2, &#x0003e;310 to &#x02264;604 ng/mL; Q3, &#x0003e;604 to &#x02264;920 ng/mL; Q4, &#x0003e;920 ng/mL). In order to evaluate the potential impact of sucroferric oxyhydroxide and sevelamer on iron-related parameters independent of IV iron use, serum levels of ferritin, TSAT and haemoglobin were also summarized for the subgroup of patients in each treatment group who did not receive IV iron during the study (&#x02018;no IV iron&#x02019; subgroup). Iron parameters were summarized at baseline (&#x02018;Week 0&#x02019;) then every 4 weeks up until Week 52 (end of study). Any missing values at Weeks 24 or 52 were imputed using the last observation carried forward method.</p><p>Analysis of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) related to changes in iron parameters was performed on the safety set (patients who took one or more dose of study medication during the initial 24-week Phase 3 study and/or the 28-week extension study).</p><p>Analyses were conducted using SAS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Version 9.2 or later (SAS Institute, Inc.), and statistical tests were performed using two-sided tests at the 5% significance level.

Analysis of the safety set (<italic>n</italic> = 1055) showed that TEAEs related to an increase in iron parameters were reported by a similar proportion of patients in both treatment groups (sucroferric oxyhydroxide, 2.8%; sevelamer, 2.9%).

The other patient was diagnosed with iron overload, based on elevated TSAT (80%) and iron (48.1 &#x003bc;mol/L) levels, although ferritin concentrations remained rather low (31.2 ng/mL). The iron overload resolved without further sequelae 14 days later, and the patient was able to remain on the full dose of sucroferric oxyhydroxide for the remainder of the study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Initial increases in some iron-related parameters, particularly ferritin and TSAT, were observed in this <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis of patients who received 52 weeks of continuous sucroferric oxyhydroxide treatment. Serum ferritin reflects the amount of stored iron and is also recognized as an inflammatory disease marker [<xref rid="GFW242C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="GFW242C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Inflammation is common in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis [<xref rid="GFW242C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]; therefore, higher threshold levels for ferritin are defined for assessment of iron stores. In this current analysis, ferritin increased in both treatment groups at Weeks 24 and 52 among patients in the overall study population, the majority of whom (&#x0003e;70%) received concomitant IV iron at least once during the 52-week treatment period. In contrast, in patients who did not receive IV iron during the study, there was a decline in ferritin concentrations in both treatment groups up to Week 24. These observations indicate that increases in ferritin concentrations observed among patients in the overall population were largely driven by concomitant IV iron use.</p><p>Importantly, TSAT, which reflects circulating iron availability for haemoglobin production [<xref rid="GFW242C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], increased over 1 year of sucroferric oxyhydroxide treatment, irrespective of whether or not patients received IV iron during the study. Finally, although there was a statistically significant difference between the sucroferric oxyhydroxide and sevelamer groups for the change in haemoglobin concentrations from baseline to Week 24, the absolute changes in haemoglobin in both groups appeared small and unlikely to be clinically meaningful.</p><p>The differences between treatment groups in terms of changes in iron parameters are likely due to minimal iron absorption from sucroferric oxyhydroxide. This was particularly evident from the analysis of iron parameters in the &#x02018;no IV iron&#x02019; subgroup, which was performed to evaluate the impact of sucroferric oxyhydroxide and sevelamer treatment on iron-related parameters, independent of IV iron use. In this patient subgroup, there were small but significant increases from baseline in TSAT and haemoglobin among subjects treated with sucroferric oxyhydroxide, whereas no significant changes were observed in those treated with sevelamer. In addition, the use of concomitant anti-anaemic treatments, including ESAs, by the majority of the patients (72% of the completer population at baseline, and up to 88% during the study) should be considered as a factor modifying iron parameters. Across both treatment groups, the greatest changes in iron parameters occurred during the first 6 months of treatment, whereas the changes in iron parameters over the second 6 months were less pronounced and the differences between the treatment groups not statistically significant. In both treatment groups, patients with high baseline serum ferritin concentration had the least pronounced change in iron parameters, in line with knowledge that iron uptake is largely governed by iron body storage and inflammatory status [<xref rid="GFW242C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Furthermore, the proportion of patients with iron-related TEAEs was similar between treatment groups, and none of these TEAEs was severe, serious or caused withdrawal from the study. The risk of iron accumulation or overload with long-term sucroferric oxyhydroxide treatment appears to be minimal. While minimal iron absorption from sucroferric oxyhydroxide may be beneficial to dialysis patients, who are often iron deficient [<xref rid="GFW242C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="GFW242C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], this treatment does not replace the use of IV iron products that enable controlled delivery of iron to replenish and maintain iron stores.</p><p>A slightly higher proportion of patients in the sevelamer group received IV iron and ESA products during the 1-year study period, compared with those in the sucroferric oxyhydroxide group. Concomitant IV iron use in both treatment groups, as well as ESA use in the sucroferric oxyhydroxide group, was greatest during the first 6 months and declined over the next 6 months. The lack of prespecified, per-protocol data relating to dose and frequency of anti-anaemic product use makes it difficult to precisely evaluate the extent to which concomitant IV iron and ESA use were affected by sucroferric oxyhydroxide treatment. Use of IV iron in dialysis patients is influenced by several factors, including reimbursement pressures (e.g. bundling) that provide an incentive to reduce the use of more costly treatments (such as ESAs) in favour of less expensive treatments (such as IV iron) [<xref rid="GFW242C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Implementation of a new bundling reimbursement policy in the USA in 2011, when the Phase 3 study was being conducted [<xref rid="GFW242C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], may have led to a higher use of IV iron preparations in US haemodialysis patients [<xref rid="GFW242C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and may have impacted concomitant IV iron and ESA use during the study.</p><p>Sucroferric oxyhydroxide was developed as a phosphate binder with high potency and low iron release properties, resulting in minimal iron uptake in chronic kidney disease patients following administration of radiolabelled sucroferric oxyhydroxide [<xref rid="GFW242C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="GFW242C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Preclinical studies conducted in rats and dogs have also demonstrated that long-term (up to 2 years) administration of sucroferric oxyhydroxide in clinically relevant and higher doses was associated with only modest increases in tissue iron levels and no iron toxicity [<xref rid="GFW242C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Findings from the current <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis are consistent with data from the overall patient population investigated in the previous sucroferric oxyhydroxide Phase 3 and extension studies, in which changes in some iron parameters were observed [<xref rid="GFW242C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="GFW242C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Real-world observational studies of sucroferric oxyhydroxide have also reported similar findings with respect to changes in iron-related parameters. A large retrospective study of over 3000 US dialysis patients found that 3 months' treatment with sucroferric oxyhydroxide was associated with small but significant increases in serum ferritin, TSAT and haemoglobin among subjects who also received concomitant IV iron [<xref rid="GFW242C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Analysis of the sucroferric oxyhydroxide-treated patients who did not receive IV iron during the 3-month treatment period revealed significant reductions in serum ferritin concentrations and no changes in TSAT or haemoglobin levels [<xref rid="GFW242C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These observations are consistent with the changes in iron parameters observed in this current analysis.</p><p>Increases in iron-related parameters, including ferritin and TSAT, have been observed with another iron-based phosphate binder, ferric citrate, in short-term (8-week [<xref rid="GFW242C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and 12-week [<xref rid="GFW242C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]) and longer-term (52-week [<xref rid="GFW242C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="GFW242C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]) studies. In addition, ferric citrate was associated with a reduction in the need for concomitant IV iron and ESA compared with active control, supporting the potential of this phosphate binder to increase iron stores [<xref rid="GFW242C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="GFW242C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Despite IV iron therapy being stopped if patients' serum ferritin concentration exceeded 1000 ng/mL, &#x0223c;20% of patients who received ferric citrate had one or more episode of elevated serum ferritin (&#x0003e;1500 ng/mL), compared with &#x0223c;10% in the active control arm [<xref rid="GFW242C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="GFW242C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and a number of patients had serum ferritin concentrations &#x0003e;2000 ng/mL over 1 year of treatment [<xref rid="GFW242C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>It is not possible to make a direct comparison between ferric citrate and sucroferric oxyhydroxide in terms of their effects on iron parameters due to inherent differences between study designs. For example, in contrast to the ferric citrate studies [<xref rid="GFW242C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="GFW242C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], IV iron therapy was not prohibited in sucroferric oxyhydroxide studies if patients' serum ferritin concentration exceeded 1000 ng/mL [<xref rid="GFW242C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="GFW242C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Moreover, mean baseline ferritin was lower in patients receiving ferric citrate (&#x0003c;600 ng/mL) in the 52-week study [<xref rid="GFW242C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="GFW242C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], compared with those receiving sucroferric oxyhydroxide in the Phase 3 study and its extension study (&#x0003e;600 ng/mL) [<xref rid="GFW242C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="GFW242C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The differences between the phosphate binders may be explained, at least in part, by their individual physicochemical properties. The active moiety in sucroferric oxyhydroxide&#x02014;polynuclear iron(III)-oxyhydroxide&#x02014;is practically insoluble [<xref rid="GFW242C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and iron release is minimal under physiological pH conditions simulating administration on a full stomach [<xref rid="GFW242C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Citrate is known to chelate [<xref rid="GFW242C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], solubilize and promote absorption of trivalent metals from the diet [<xref rid="GFW242C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and, thus, has the potential to enhance iron uptake from a ferric-based phosphate binder and impact physiological mechanisms of controlled iron absorption [<xref rid="GFW242C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Nevertheless, preliminary data from a subgroup analysis of a ferric citrate 52-week Phase 3 study, in which patients were stratified by concomitant IV iron use versus no IV iron [<xref rid="GFW242C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], appear to show findings that contrast with those observed with sucroferric oxyhydroxide in the current <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis. In particular, changes in ferritin and TSAT in patients treated with ferric citrate appeared to be similar in those who received concomitant IV iron and those who did not [<xref rid="GFW242C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>This study had several limitations: no specific information was available on changes in doses or frequency of IV iron and ESA; almost 50% of patients enrolled in the initial Phase 3 study were recruited in the USA and, therefore, iron-related data may have been influenced by the implementation of the new bundling reimbursement policy in the USA in 2011 [<xref rid="GFW242C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="GFW242C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="GFW242C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, initial increases in some iron-related parameters were observed in dialysis patients treated with sucroferric oxyhydroxide. Changes in iron parameters were less pronounced among patients with high serum ferritin concentrations at baseline, and the risk for iron accumulation or overload appears to be minimal following 1 year of continuous sucroferric oxyhydroxide treatment. Thus, no additional monitoring of iron parameters, beyond routine evaluation, is required. A potential modest reduction in the use of anti-anaemic products following treatment with sucroferric oxyhydroxide, compared with sevelamer, warrants more in-depth analyses in post-marketing studies.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT</title><p>A.C.C. has received consultancy fees or lecture fees from Vifor Pharma, Fresenius Medical Care and Amgen.
