Group 2 was tested for maximum pressure of the warning piercer penetrating front cortex of the vertebral body (F<sub>2</sub>). Group 3 was tested for the maximum pressure of piercer penetrating vertebral body endplate (F<sub>3</sub>) and pedicle notch (F<sub>41</sub>, F<sub>42</sub>).

At the time of warning pedicle piercer, the pressure variation was converted to audiovisual signals to reflect the real-time changes. The piercer is composed of an awl instrument with a hollow handle that has a built in electronic printed circuit board [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>], a piercer installed pressure.&#x02026;sensor, a warning control devices and an alarm system [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>]. The output line of the piezoelectric device was connected with the alertor. Therefore, it could trigger the audiovisual signals and then alert the surgeon to adjust the drilling direction when pressure approaching to a critical level. The digital screen would display the pressure values [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>]. Compared with traditional pedicle screw piercer, it would decrease the incidence of pedicle and vertebral body wall perforation.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Clinical photograph showing (a) overview of warning piercer (b) schematic diagram of warning piercer (I) visual alarm (II) audible alarm (III) warning device (IV) pressure sensor (V) pressure generating direction (c) Built in structure of warning piercer (I) viewing screen (II) power switch (III) battery (IV) audible alarm (V) adjustment button (VI) pressure receptor</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJOrtho-48-545-g001"/></fig><p>The specimens were randomly allocated into four groups with equal 20 vertebrae in each group.

Hence, two normal adult thoracolumbar specimens with clear exposure of local anatomical marks were selected. The anterior bone cortex was chiseled up to 3.5 mm and the needle point of thoracic vertebrae was determined using Ebraheim method<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and the needle point of lumbar vertebrae was determined using Magerl method.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> After opening, the warning device via pedicle and vertebral body was applied. The maximum pressure of this process was recorded and marked as F<sub>1</sub> (<italic>n</italic> = 40). Group 2 was tested for the maximum pressure of the warning piercer penetrating front cortex of vertebral body. The operation steps were similar to those in Group 1. The maximum pressure of this process was recorded, and marked as F<sub>2</sub> (<italic>n</italic> = 40). Group 3 was tested for the maximum warning pressure of the screw piercer throughout the endplate and notch of pedicle. Thus, two thoracolumbar specimens consisting of 20 vertebral bodies and 40 pedicles dividing along the midcourt line of pedicle [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>] were chosen and used with warning piercer throughout the endplate center, and was marked as F<sub>3</sub> (<italic>n</italic> = 40).

Alarm threshold of warning piercer was set up between 9.6 and 12.3 kgf. The gold standard of experiment was to observe the relationship between nail channel and cortex of vertebrae under direct vision. The vertical distance from the end of channel to the outer cortex &#x0003c;3.5 mm was considered to arrive the cortex. Absence of alarm in preparation of nail way was recorded as negative, and the converse was recorded as positive. If warning piercer passing every pedicle and vertebral body, the emergency alarm was recorded as positive. Otherwise, it was recorded as negative. The thoracic needle distance was 4.0 cm, while the lumbar needle distance was 4.5 cm. The thoracolumbar vertebrae were then removed out of specimens and soft tissues were discarded. Kirschner wire was inserted into the pin tract to explore warning piercer throughout the cortex, and the vertebrae was split using hacksaw along with the direction of Kirschner wire. The distance of nail way and vertebral cortex was measured with a Vernier caliper. All screws were evaluated by postoperative computer tomography with parameters similar to those in intraoperation scan.</p><p>True positive was indicated by warning piercer alarm reaching cortex through nail way. True negative was suggested by absence of alarm and failure of reaching cortex. False positive signal was characterized by alarm though piercer untouched with cortex. False negative alarm was signified when vertebral cortex was topped by piercer without any alert.</p><p>Degrees of sensitivity and specificity were determined.

The value of the F<sub>1</sub> was significantly less than that of the maximum pressure of warning piercer penetrating vertebral cortex. The mean maximum pressure of warning piercer on the inside vertebrae was 8.970, S<sub>1</sub> = 0.5698, F<sub>1</sub> = 8.970 &#x000b1; 0.5698. The minimum pressure F<sub>3</sub> which stands for maximum pressure of warning piercer throughout the endplate was equal to 13.055 &#x000b1; 0.6718 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>]. The pressure was between 12.38 and 13.73 kgf [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Therefore, the alarm threshold value was calculated as 9.6-12.3 kgf. In total of 40 vertebrae and 80 pedicles, the frequency of applied piercer was 80, including 38 alarms and 42 no alarms. We found there were 80 nail ways during the operation. Of the 38 alarms, 36 vertebrae were not throughout cortex and 2 failed to reach cortex. Another 42 vertebrae without alarm were consisted of 39 vertebrae without touching the cortex, 1 throughout lateral cortex, and 2 throughout anterior cortex. The 80 pedicles included 38 positive (36 truly positive, 2 false positive) and 42 negative (39 true negative, 3 false-negative). The 36 truly positive nail ways included 18 lateral cortices of vertebrae, 6 reaching the medial cortex of pedicle, 9 reaching lateral cortex of pedicle and 4 reaching endplate.

The accurate preparation of nail channel and the protection of vessels neighboring vertebrae has become a hot point in the field of neurosurgery. Because of the specific anatomic structure of pedicles, pedicle screw nail way must be implanted via the pedicle shaft axis to prevent the complications such as leakage of cerebrospinal fluid, injury of root and artery, and even paraplegia. The advent of minimally invasive procedures for spinal fixation has led to the advances of placing pedicle screw holes and implants percutaneously. However, this method increases the risk of misplacement implant and neural structure's injury as well. Schizas <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> reported that 30% (18/60) of patients implanted with pedicle screws percutaneously manifested the perforation of pedicular wall, in which 2 of 60 (3.3%) cases required repeated surgery.</p><p>Multiple devices such as somatosensory evoked potentials, electromyographic recordings (EMG) and navigation system were tested by investigators to reduce the morbidity. Neurophysiological monitoring required the involvement of professional neurophysiologists during the process of screw placement. Recording of sensory or motor evoked potentials depended on the detection of impingement onto nervous tissue, which suggested a full cortical breach. Being a warning system, these methods were imperfect because it was too late to alert the surgeon after detecting impaired nerve function in the whole process. Some studies reported that the false negative result was as high as 23% determined by continuous EMG monitoring during the course of pedicle screw placement. Both compound muscle action potential and EMG recordings required subtotal neuromuscular blockade. With the rapid progress of computer technology, spinal navigation system became an interactive tool with a surgical pointer or tool used for reviewing images at computer workstation in the operating theatre. Computed tomography (CT) based image navigation systems were reported in conjunction with pedicles perforation up to 0-2.5%.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Clinical studies of computer assisted image guided implant placement revealed the deviation rates were between 1% and 9%.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> However, some studies disclosed there were no significant differences of perforation rate between image guided and two dimensional fluoroscopy guided systems.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>Sasso and Carrido reported that intraoperative navigation system did not prolong the surgical time compared with serial two dimensional fluoroscopy.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Nevertheless, other studies showed there were significantly differences of surgical time between image guided screw placement and conventional surgical procedure.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Assistant devices for improving accuracy of screw placement were also developed. For example, Bolger <italic>et al</italic>. designed a piercer to avoid penetrating the vertebral wall by differential impedance between soft tissue and bone structure in preparative nail way. Its alarm rate was 98%, but risk of vertebral hemorrhage was accompanied.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Similarly, Kantelhardt <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> used intraosseous ultrasound for nail way preparation. Its accurate rate reached 99%.</p><p>Traditional screw insertion technique was mainly depend on the hand felling of the surgeon to judge and adjust the direction through the alteration of resistance during drilling. However, the alarm piercer was able to convert the experienced hand felling into the objective indexes by gauging the difference of mechanical strength between changed bone density of vertebral cortex and cancellous bone. The changeable resistance can activate the alarm within first time to alert the surgeon adjusting the needle power and drilling direction before cortex was penetrated. The warning piercer was also occupied the exceptional advantages of shorter operation time, less radiation and reduced learning curve. This unique design of warning piercer took the piezoelectric converter as a main body to make an audiovisual signal system, which could provide early real time warning for surgeon to adjust the nail direction accordingly. Meantime, it ensured the pedicle screw was correctly placed in right position and hence reduced the injury to adjacent nerves and vessels.</p><p>Our study demonstrated that the transpedicular approach to the vertebral body exerted a pressure of 8.970 &#x000b1; 0.5698 kgf and the pressure of piercer penetrating endplate was 13.055 &#x000b1; 0.67188 kgf. There is no overlap between the minimum and maximum pressure values within the vertebrae and penetration through the cortical bone. The threshold guaranteed by the vertebrae within the cancellous bone, not penetrating the cortical bone was 9.6-12.3 kgf. Preoperative CT scanning or planning were not required. Since this tool does not require computer registration or vertebral tracking, it can be used in all aspects of spinal fixation including fractures and spondylolisthesis, regardless of the severity of fracture and dislocation. The warning piercer is an auxiliary device to improve the accurate rate of pedicle screw placement and reduce the dependence on fluoroscopy. This device can reduce radiation exposure to the surgeon while maintaining safe pedicle screw placement for the patient and does not require navigation or vertebral tracking. It can be widely used in all aspects of spinal fixation including fracture and degeneration, no matter what degree of pars fractured and dislocated. It provides a real time monitoring for operation with minimal impact on the standard surgical procedure.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold>
