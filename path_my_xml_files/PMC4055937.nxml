Vilanterol (VI) is a novel long-acting beta<sub>2</sub> agonist, under development in combination with fluticasone furoate, a new inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). Findings from a previous 4-week study suggested that VI has inherent 24-hour activity and is therefore suitable for once-daily dosing. The study described here was a double-blind, double-dummy, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, the aim of which was to assess the efficacy of once-daily VI compared with placebo in patients with persistent asthma. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in 24-hour weighted mean forced expiratory volume in 1&#x000a0;second after 12&#x000a0;weeks of treatment <italic>vs.</italic> placebo. An active control arm received salmeterol (SAL) twice daily. All patients were maintained on a stable background dose of ICS.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Patients (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;347) received VI, placebo or SAL (1:1:1). For the primary endpoint, substantial improvements in lung function were seen with VI (359&#x000a0;ml), SAL (283&#x000a0;ml) and placebo (289&#x000a0;ml). There were no statistically significant treatment differences between either the VI (70&#x000a0;ml, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.244) or SAL (-6&#x000a0;ml, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.926) groups and placebo. Both active treatments were well tolerated, with similarly low rates of treatment-related adverse events compared with placebo. No treatment-related serious adverse events occurred.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study failed to show a treatment difference between VI and placebo for the primary endpoint, in the presence of a placebo response of unforeseen magnitude. Because the placebo response was so large, it is not possible to draw meaningful conclusions from the data. The reason for this magnitude of effect is unclear but it may reflect increased compliance with the anti-inflammatory therapy regimen during the treatment period.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01181895">NCT01181895</ext-link> at ClinicalTrials.gov.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Asthma</kwd><kwd>Bronchodilators</kwd><kwd>Long-acting beta agonist</kwd><kwd>Lung function</kwd><kwd>Placebo response</kwd><kwd>Randomised trial</kwd><kwd>Salmeterol</kwd><kwd>Vilanterol</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease characterised by airway hyper-responsiveness which causes narrowing of airways and obstruction of air flow. This typically occurs following exposure to a stimulus such as an allergen or chemical and is associated with inflammation of the airway
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. This produces symptoms including dyspnoea (shortness of breath), wheezing and cough that generally resolve in response to treatment and/or removal of the triggering stimulus
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Exacerbations (&#x02018;asthma attacks&#x02019;) are worsenings of symptoms associated with acute airway inflammation, and are associated with significant morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Spirometry is a fundamental measure in the clinical management of asthma, characterising lung function and the presence of airway narrowing by assessing the degree to which airflow is limited
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Specifically, the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) measurement has been validated for its close correlation with airway obstruction and is thus predictive for the presence of asthma and asthma mortality
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Asthma treatment is aimed at improving lung function and symptoms, along with minimising the likelihood of exacerbations
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Short-acting beta<sub>2</sub> agonists, which provide rapid-onset relief of bronchoconstriction, are typically used on an as-needed basis and are the first line of treatment. For patients with persistent, uncontrolled asthma, maintenance therapy with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), which treat inflammation, and long-acting beta<sub>2</sub> agonists (LABAs), which improve lung function and alleviate symptoms, are recommended. Current asthma treatment guidelines
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] recommend the addition of a LABA to ICS for patients inadequately controlled by ICS monotherapy and advise against LABA monotherapy.</p><p>LABAs currently licensed for asthma, such as salmeterol (SAL) and formoterol, require twice-daily dosing. Vilanterol (VI) is chemically distinct from SAL
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and has been shown to exhibit faster onset and longer duration of action in human lung tissue
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Clinical studies have demonstrated 24-hour efficacy of VI in patients with persistent asthma when administered concurrently with ICS once daily
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. VI is currently under development as a once-daily treatment in combination with fluticasone furoate (FF), a novel ICS shown to be effective in a range of asthma severities
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>This study sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-daily VI 25 mcg over 12&#x000a0;weeks in patients with persistent asthma uncontrolled by ICS alone. This dose was identified from earlier-phase studies to have the greatest therapeutic ratio
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The main hypothesis for the study was that VI would exhibit superior efficacy relative to placebo on the primary endpoint of weighted mean (0&#x02013;24 hours) FEV<sub>1</sub> after 12&#x000a0;weeks. A SAL reference arm was also included for benchmarking.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 347 patients at 34 centres in 5 countries were randomised; 298 completed the study.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. LABAs currently licensed for the treatment of asthma include SAL and formoterol, and are available with fluticasone propionate and budesonide, respectively, in combination ICS/LABA formulations with duration of action approximately 12&#x000a0;hours
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. As such, the currently available therapies require twice-daily dosing. VI has previously been shown to display inherent 24-hour activity
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In combination with the novel once-daily ICS FF, VI will potentially offer patients with persistent uncontrolled asthma a once-daily maintenance option, simplifying treatment and potentially improving patient adherence
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Despite the availability of effective management therapies, many patients continue to have sub-optimal control
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], in part due to failure to adhere to treatment regimens
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, no relative improvement in lung function compared with placebo was seen with VI or with the active comparator, SAL. Although the raw changes from baseline for VI and SAL of 359&#x000a0;ml and 283&#x000a0;ml were similar to previous findings for the same dose of VI (25 mcg)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], the change observed with placebo (289&#x000a0;ml) was far higher than anticipated. The remarkable magnitude of the placebo response meant that, although substantial improvement from baseline in lung function was observed with both active treatments, it is not possible to draw meaningful conclusions about their effects on lung function or asthma symptoms from this study. Nevertheless, it is important that the findings of this study are published in order to address potential publication bias
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and facilitate the use of the data in meta-analyses.</p><p>The wisdom of including an active reference arm to gauge assay sensitivity is clearly apparent. Previous studies performed by the sponsor have shown a clinical effect in adults and adolescents for SAL compared with placebo on lung function, however, this study did not. This supports the proposition that the reason for the failure of VI to achieve a statistically significant improvement relative to placebo is related to the unexpected and sustained improvement in the placebo group, rather than ineffectiveness of the active treatment. A possible explanation for the placebo effect, that study batches had been mis-labelled or cross-contaminated, was investigated through the re-analysis of retention samples; no evidence of incorrect treatment assignment or contamination was found. Some variation was found in the mean changes from baseline in the primary endpoint across the five countries of the study. However, despite the observed differences for improvements in lung function by country, the lack of evidence for a treatment-by-region interaction for these improvements suggests that the failure to achieve significance for the primary endpoint cannot be explained by inter-country variability.</p><p>One other possible explanation for the lack of efficacy is that there could have been an increase in patient compliance with background ICS during the study period. In order to be eligible for the study, patients were required to have been using ICS for at least 12&#x000a0;weeks prior to screening, with a stable ICS dose for at least 4&#x000a0;weeks prior to screening and during the run-in period. Patients were excluded from randomisation if they were not compliant with their ICS on at least 4 of the last 7 consecutive days of run-in. To confirm compliance, patients in this study were asked daily via the e-diary if they had used their ICS. However, real-world compliance with ICS maintenance therapy among asthma patients is often poor
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. As such, it is conceivable that, despite the eligibility criteria requiring stable ICS use, a proportion of study participants may have only begun using their ICS regularly immediately prior to baseline. Comparatively, in a previous study of VI versus placebo in which compliance with ICS was required during the 4-week run-in period, a statistically significant improvement in lung function was seen
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Investigators were asked to counsel non-adherent patients on the importance of taking ICS at the prescribed dose at each clinic visit. This may have resulted in an improvement in adherence. The high degree of FEV<sub>1</sub> reversibility observed among the population adds further weight to the suggestion that ICS non-adherence may have affected the outcome of this study. In future studies, confirmation of adherence during the run-in period could be addressed by providing single-blind ICS with dose counters, in order to better compare the ICS response with the observed treatment effect following the addition of vilanterol.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Substantial improvements in lung function and asthma control were seen in all treatment groups, thus the unexpectedly strong placebo response confounded interpretation of the primary and secondary comparisons.

At screening, a best pre-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> of 40&#x02013;90% of predicted normal and demonstration of &#x02265;12% and &#x02265;200&#x000a0;ml reversibility of FEV<sub>1</sub> within 10&#x02013;40 minutes of rescue medication were required. To be eligible for randomisation, patients were required to be symptomatic on their current ICS treatment, defined as asthma symptom score &#x02265;1 and/or rescue use on &#x02265;4 of the last 7&#x000a0;days of the run-in, and compliant with baseline medication on &#x02265;4 of the last 7&#x000a0;days of the run-in period. Compliance was assessed by a daily question of ICS compliance in the eDiary; patients were also contacted by telephone approximately two weeks after Visit 1 to assess compliance. Patients were excluded if they had a history of life-threatening asthma, or asthma exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids or emergency-room attendance within 3&#x000a0;months or overnight hospitalisation within 6&#x000a0;months prior to Visit 1. All patients continued the same dose of ICS throughout the treatment and follow-up periods. Patients were required to replace their current short-acting beta<sub>2</sub> agonists with albuterol/salbutamol inhaler provided at Visit 1 for use as needed during the study. All systemic, oral, parenteral and depot corticosteroids were prohibited from within 12&#x000a0;weeks of Visit 1. All anti-leukotrienes, inhaled or oral LABA or ICS/LABA therapies, theophyllines, anticholinergics, ketotifen, nedocromil sodium and sodium cromoglycate were prohibited from Visit 1 for the duration of the study. Any other medications with the potential to affect the course of asthma or interact with sympathomimetic amines were prohibited throughout the study.</p><p>Patients were stratified according to their screening stable dose of ICS medication then randomised (1:1:1) to receive VI 25 mcg via ELLIPTA&#x02122; dry powder inhaler (representing an emitted dose from the dry powder inhaler of 22 mcg) once daily, SAL 50 mcg via Diskus&#x000ae;/Accuhaler&#x000ae; twice daily, or placebo over the duration of the study (ELLIPTA&#x02122; is a trademark of the GlaxoSmithKline group of companies). Patients and investigators were blinded to treatment assignment. All patients received double-blinded placebo dry powder inhaler and Diskus&#x000ae; inhalers for use as appropriate (once daily and twice daily, respectively). Inhalers containing active treatment and placebo were indistinguishable. The randomisation schedule was generated by RandAll (GlaxoSmithKline, UK) following stratification of the patients according to dose of ICS medication (low, medium or high). Patients were randomised to treatment using an automated, telephone-based Registration and Medication Ordering System (RAMOS). Treatment compliance was measured by reviewing the dose counter on the inhalers.</p><p>The intent-to-treat (ITT) population comprised all patients randomised to treatment who received at least one dose of study drug.

For the primary and powered secondary endpoints, treatment interaction-by-region was analysed. Time to &#x02265;12% and &#x02265;200&#x000a0;ml increase above baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> was analysed using a Cox proportional hazards model with treatment group as the explanatory variable and baseline FEV<sub>1</sub>, region, sex and age as covariates, with additional sensitivity analysis by log-rank test. Responses to global assessment of change questionnaire after 4 and 12&#x000a0;weeks of treatment were assessed using logistic (proportional odds) regression with covariates of region, sex, age and treatment group to produce odds ratios for estimated treatment differences.</p><p>In order to account for multiplicity across the key endpoints, a step-down testing hierarchy was applied. This stipulated that statistical significance (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) of the primary endpoint treatment comparison of once-daily VI 25 mcg to placebo was required in order for statistical significance of powered secondary endpoints to be inferred.
