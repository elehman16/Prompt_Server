The &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist NRL001 (1R,2S-methoxamine hydrochloride) improves anal sphincter tone. NRL001 efficacy was evaluated by changes in Wexner scores at week 4 vs. baseline in NRL001-treated patients compared with placebo. Impact of NRL001 on QoL and safety were also assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Four hundred sixty-six patients received NRL001 (5, 7.5 or 10&#x000a0;mg) or placebo as suppository, once daily over 8&#x000a0;weeks. Wexner score, Vaizey score and QoL were analysed at baseline, week 4 and week 8. FI episodes and adverse events were recorded in diaries.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At week 4, mean reductions in Wexner scores were &#x02212;3.0, &#x02212;2.6, &#x02212;2.6 and &#x02212;2.4 for NRL001 5, 7.5, 10&#x000a0;mg and placebo, respectively. All reduced further by week 8. As placebo responses also improved, there was no significant treatment effect at week 4 (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.6867) or week 8 (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.5005). FI episode frequency improved for all patients, but not significantly compared with placebo (week 4: <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.2619, week 8: <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.5278). All patients&#x02019; QoL improved, but not significantly for all parameters (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05) except depression/self-perception at week 4 (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0102) and week 8 (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0069), compared with placebo. Most adverse events were mild and judged probably or possibly related to NRL001.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>All groups demonstrated improvement in efficacy and QoL compared with baseline. NRL001 was well-tolerated without serious safety concerns. Despite the improvement in all groups, there was no statistically significant treatment effect, underlining the importance of relating results to a placebo arm.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Faecal incontinence</kwd><kwd>Quality of life</kwd><kwd>Episode frequency</kwd><kwd>Alpha-1 receptor agonist</kwd><kwd>NRL001</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Norgine</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Faecal incontinence (FI) is a distressing condition defined as the inability to voluntarily control the passage of faecal matter or gas through the anal canal and expel it at a socially acceptable time and location [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It significantly reduces psychological and emotional well-being and negatively affects quality of life (QoL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The feelings of embarrassment and depression may be one of the explanations why the majority of patients do not report FI to their physician [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and may be one of the main reasons why only approximately one third of symptomatic patients seek medical help [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Estimates of the prevalence of FI vary depending on the population studied. One survey of adults living in the US community showed that approximately 8.3&#x000a0;% reported FI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The incidence of FI has been shown to be significantly higher in women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], in patients with existing gastroenterological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and also significantly increases with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The most recent and largest North American study found that almost 20&#x000a0;% of healthy women had experienced FI during the preceding 12&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Mild FI may be improved with conservative therapies including lifestyle changes and biofeedback retraining. Pharmacological interventions remain poorly investigated, and a recent review of clinical trials suggests that many therapies do not significantly improve symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Surgery is increasingly performed in FI due to the failure of conservative and pharmacological therapies. However, many subjects are poor surgical candidates and long-term success rates are variable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The lack of a universally effective, surgical method has led to the development of numerous complex options including an artificial bowel sphincter, magnetic anal sphincter, stimulated graciloplasty and sacral nerve stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These procedures might lead to definite improvement, but the morbidity profiles emphasize the need for effective pharmacological treatments.</p><p>The internal anal sphincter (IAS) muscle exists in a natural state of tonic contraction. Naturally occurring degeneration due to ageing can result in a loss of smooth muscle tone, and in addition, reduced contractile function might lead to uncontrollable bowel movements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The IAS muscles receive excitatory innervations to mediate contraction or relaxation via the &#x003b1;- or &#x003b2;-adrenergic receptors, respectively. Therefore, the adrenergic sympathetic nervous system could be targeted therapeutically with a view to restoring smooth muscle tone and improving FI symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Topical application of the selective &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine increased anal sphincter tone as measured by mean anal resting pressure (MARP) in both healthy subjects and patients with FI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Symptomatic improvement, however, was disappointing in a separate phenylephrine study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. 1R,2S-Methoxamine hydrochloride (NRL001) is a highly selective &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist that is approximately four times more potent than phenylephrine at constricting porcine IAS tissue in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Local administration of NRL001 to healthy subjects and patients with FI has been shown to increase MARP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, the Libertas study&#x02014;a multi-centre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging clinical study&#x02014;was designed to primarily investigate the impact of NRL001 on FI symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Secondary aims were to assess patient QoL, safety profile and tolerability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethics</title><p>Independent Ethics Committees approved this study, which was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki, 2008.

During randomization, eligible patients were assigned a unique randomization number from the Interactive Web Response System (IWRS; Premier Research Group Ltd, UK) that was linked to two patient investigational medicinal product packs. The investigator maintained a list of patient names, assigned unique patient numbers and associated assigned unique randomization numbers. The password-protected randomization list was supplied by a statistician of Premier Research Group Ltd using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) for Windows (SAS Institute Inc., USA) to Pharmaceutical Development, Norgine Ltd, UK. NRL001 and placebo were packed and labelled according to pertinent regulations by the Sponsor. The randomization schedule was then made available to the Premier Research Group Ltd IWRS.</p><p>This was a double-blind study with all NRL001 and placebo suppositories provided in the same packaging and labelling. No person involved in conducting the study had access to the randomization code before the blinding was officially broken. However, in the case of an emergency that required the investigator to be unblinded, the investigator was allowed to obtain the randomization code via the IWRS.</p><p>The study period consisted of a 2-week run-in phase, an 8-week treatment period and a 1-week post-treatment follow-up. In total, the study comprised five visits to the study site. Patients were screened on day 14. On day 1 (randomization), patients received their first dose, provided the eligibility criteria were met. Patients attended visits at week 2, week 4 and week 8. A follow-up telephone call was made at week 9 to assess overall patient satisfaction and the duration of any adverse event.</p><p>Patients received 70 suppositories in total&#x02014;35 at week 1 and 35 at week 4&#x02014;and were provided with an electronic diary (e-Diary) to record details of suppository administration and frequency and type of incontinence episodes.</p><p>The primary endpoint of this study was to determine the efficacy of NRL001 as assessed by a change in the Wexner score at week 4 in patients receiving NRL001 compared with those receiving placebo. Key secondary endpoints included Vaizey scores and the number of FI episodes per week as additional efficacy parameters at week 4 and week 8, as well as patient QoL and satisfaction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Sample collection and analysis</title><p>The Wexner scoring system consisted of the score sum of five parameters (frequency of gas, liquid or solid incontinence, need to wear a pad and lifestyle alterations) scored on a scale of 0 (absent) to 4 (daily) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. A total score of 0 suggested full continence and score of 20 complete FI. The Vaizey scoring system was subsequently created by modifying to include two additional questions assessing the ability to defer defecation and use of antidiarrheal medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]; 0 suggested full continence and 24 complete FI.</p><p>QoL was measured using the FI quality of life (FIQoL) scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and the EQ-5D-5L Healthcare Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] at baseline, week 4 and week 8. The FIQoL scale ranged from 1 to 5, where 1 indicated lowest QoL and 5 the highest, and was produced by scoring statements based on lifestyle, coping/behaviour, depression/self-perception and embarrassment. The EQ-5D-5L Healthcare Questionnaire assessed five parameters: mobility, self-care, ability to perform usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. It also included a visual analogue scale (VAS) for patients to record their self-rated health state. The frequency of FI episodes was assessed using recordings made in the e-Diaries.</p><p>Pharmacokinetic relationships between NRL001 concentration and either efficacy or adverse effects were assessed at week 1 (pre-dose and 1, 2 and 4&#x000a0;h post-dose) and week 4.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Safety assessment</title><p>Adverse events were recorded from screening until the end of the study and were coded using MedDRA Version 14.0 or higher. All adverse events were graded as mild, moderate or severe according to intensity, and the relationship to NRL001 was classified as probable, possible or unrelated. The final phone call was used to assess the patients&#x02019; global perception of efficacy and the duration of adverse events.</p><p>Blood pressure, pulse rate, physical examination, urine analysis and 12-lead electrocardiogram measurements were recorded at each visit. Twenty-four-hour Holter monitoring was performed at screening and week 2. Patients also had blood samples taken at screening, week 2 and week 8 for laboratory safety tests of clinical chemistry and haematology.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The sample size was calculated using a responder rate. Active treatment was classed as a success if it showed a 20&#x000a0;% improvement over placebo in the primary endpoint. With 80&#x000a0;% power and a two-sided level of significance of 0.05 (5&#x000a0;%), a minimum of 98 patients were required in each treatment group to show a difference between rates of 25 and 45&#x000a0;%.</p><p>The primary endpoint was defined as the change relative to baseline in Wexner score at week 4.

Differences between placebo and each of the three active treatment groups are presented with a 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval (CI). Where significant variation was seen, pairwise differences between placebo and each of the three active treatment groups were tested by calculating CIs for the difference in least square means between placebo and active treatment using Dunnett&#x02019;s method within the ANCOVA. Differences in the number of FI episodes and the Vaizey, and FIQoL scores were tested using the same statistical methods as the primary endpoint.

However, a marked placebo response was observed during the entire 8-week treatment period such that no statistically significant treatment effect was observed when comparing active treatment with placebo. Secondary endpoints showed similar findings, with marked improvements in response to NRL001 accompanied by a notable placebo response of similar magnitude. However, NRL001 had a statistically significant effect on some QoL assessments at week 4 and week 8 compared with placebo: NRL001 significantly improved patients&#x02019; self-assessed mobility, activity and overall health at week 4 and activity at week 8. Although these were not paired with statistically significant improvements in Wexner scores, correlations were apparent. Decreases in Wexner and Vaizey scores, and frequency of FI episodes complemented QoL improvements; associations have proven to be significant in previous validation studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>The reduction in Wexner score after 8&#x000a0;weeks of treatment when compared with baseline was highly significant for all NRL001 treatment arms (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) as well as placebo. Pharmacokinetic data demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in plasma concentrations of NRL001. Visual inspections of the data indicated that there was no dose-proportional improvement in any of the endpoints, although this was not tested statistically. A dose-dependent increase in MARP was reported in a study in which NRL001 was administered to healthy volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Assessment of anorectal physiology may have provided useful information regarding the mechanistic insight of the drug. However, anorectal physiology assessments were likely to have significantly adversely affected enrolment feasibility and cost. Furthermore, evaluations of anorectal physiology, such as anorectal manometry assessments, are often also poorly correlated with patient outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. This has been hypothesized to be due to a stenosing effect following surgery, increasing the resistance to blood flow through the anus, masking physiological alterations detected in pressure measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Additionally, MARP was not assessed in this current study due to the difficulties standardizing methodologies in a large patient population and the suggestion that many therapies do not significantly improve symptoms of FI, despite their positive effect on MARP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This and the lack of dose-response in symptom improvement in the current study argue strongly that biological endpoints such as MARP are poor markers of patient outcomes. The FI episodes reported in this study encompassed all forms of incontinence. It was considered that analysis of faecal matter incontinence episodes (FMIE), which excludes flatus, might reveal a more robust treatment effect. Consequently, although not presented here, FMIE for each active treatment group at both week 4 and week 8 were analysed and compared with those of placebo-treated patients but no significant treatment effect was observed. As such, evaluation of Wexner scores as the primary endpoint for this study was considered appropriate.</p><p>The reported adverse events were similar to those in previous studies (paraesthesia, chills and piloerection) and were thought to be a direct result of increased &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Visual inspections of the data indicated that adverse events were less frequent in the placebo-treated group than any of the NRL001-treated groups. There also appeared to be no dose-relationship in the frequency of adverse events reported across the three active treatment groups, although not tested statistically. Safety assessments did not show any new or previously unknown risks of NRL001. Bradycardia&#x02014;an expected effect of &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]&#x02014;was not reported in any treatment group. A meta-analysis of previous studies involving topical application of NRL001 has shown that whilst patients generally experienced a dose-dependent decrease in heart rate, bradycardia was not clinically significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Therefore, the safety of NRL001 was deemed better than expected.</p><p>The inclusion criteria for this study included a screening Wexner score of 8&#x02013;20. Therefore, patient FI severities ranged from relatively mild to very severe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. It is possible that the severity of Wexner score at screening was an important factor; however, a descriptive post hoc analysis (Norgine data on file) was unable to show any difference in effect between patients with baseline Wexner score of 8&#x02013;11, 12&#x02013;15 or 16&#x02013;20. This inclusion criterion was designed to make the results of this study comparable with those of other recent studies that assess new therapeutic options for treatment of FI (not direct surgical repair) and use the Wexner score to define their patient population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Prior exposure of patients to biofeedback therapy, a conservative approach employed to treat FI based on the theories of operant conditioning, was not taken into consideration. Patients receiving conservative treatments display sustained FI symptom improvement for up to a year, but some studies hypothesize that beneficial effects relate more to the relationship with the therapist than the technical aspects of the therapy and many responders lose the effect over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. It is possible that any patients naive to biofeedback therapy included in this study may have benefited more from inclusion in the study rather than the pharmacological substance itself. Also, any patient in whom biofeedback therapy had previously improved symptoms, but which was lost over time, might be more likely to have improvement in their symptoms again. As such, this study may have benefited by including a run-in period with biofeedback therapy to exclude those patients who would have attained adequate FI symptom relief from conservative treatments. However, this is likely to have restricted the number of patients eligible for inclusion.</p><p>A number of important factors made the Libertas study unique: There have been few similarly designed studies in FI involving this number of patients; this study was the first testing NRL001 in a broad population of patients; and it employed innovative strategies, including the use of an outreach program, to recruit patients whilst taking into account the sensitivity of the condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and finally the comparison of subjects&#x02019; responses to NRL001 with placebo, rather than solely with screening measurements. Given the positive effects of NRL001 in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], the findings of the current study are highly relevant, confirming the importance of a placebo group.</p><p>Predictors of the placebo response have been a focus of many studies with potentially significant impact on clinical trials. The placebo response observed in this study was larger than expected and did not decline during the 8-week treatment period. The placebo suppositories used in this study comprised 0.03-g colloidal anhydrous silica and 1.97-g hard fat. NRL001 suppositories contained reduced amounts of fat to compensate for the addition of NRL001. The route of administration of a treatment is known to impact the extent to which a placebo response may be elicited. A review of placebo responses observed in clinical trials of migraine treatments concluded that interventions administered at the site of pain elicit a greater placebo response than those administered at a distance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. As such, the placebo response observed in this study is likely to have been more robust than a placebo response observed had the intervention for FI been administered orally. Furthermore, progressively invasive treatments are coupled with a more robust placebo response: One study of a migraine treatment reported pain relief of 39&#x000a0;% following administration of placebo as a suppository, whereas others have demonstrated pain relief of 39&#x02013;32&#x000a0;% following administration via nasal sprays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Placebo-controlled studies in patients with FI have also shown unexpected high response rates after saline injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] or sham electrical stimulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. As well as the route of administration, the small sample sizes of these studies may have contributed to the lack of clinical effect in these studies. This was one factor that the Libertas study aimed to mitigate, and by using a broad and ample study population, it was hoped that the sample size would be sufficient to demonstrate a significant clinical effect. These findings suggest that FI studies that report a positive treatment effect but do not make comparisons with placebo should perhaps be interpreted with caution.</p><p>Treatment-specific restrictions on conservative therapies such as dietary advice, behavioural changes or muscle-strengthening exercises were not imposed on patients during this study. Therefore, active treatment groups and the placebo-treated group should have received similar treatments throughout. Although conservative medical treatments were not analysed here, a Cochrane review of 21 individual studies found little evidence to support the therapeutic benefits of anal sphincter exercises or biofeedback therapy alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], and so the use of these by placebo-treated patients would have been unlikely to account for their robust response. Patients were also required to report any concomitant medications taken throughout the study in their e-Dairies. A total of 17 patients used drugs for the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders during the course of the study, although there was imbalance in relation to treatment group. Therefore, the use of concomitant medications or conservative medical treatments was not thought to differ between treatment groups and thus contribute to the response observed in the placebo-treated group.</p><p>A recent review suggested that the placebo response is also related to cognitive constructs, such as locus of control&#x02014;the extent to which individuals believe they can control events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. In particular, a placebo response is seen in those with an external locus of control, meaning participants have a strong belief that outcomes are determined by factors external to their control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Additional factors that appear to minimize the placebo response in gastroenterology studies are the use of a randomized, double-blind, controlled, parallel group study design, with dosing taking place no more than once daily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], all of which were implemented in this study.</p><p>In conclusion, patients in this study displayed an improvement in FI symptoms in all parameters tested throughout the duration of this 8-week study. This was also reflected in improvements of QoL and positive patient satisfaction. However, no statistically significant treatment effects of NRL001 were seen compared with placebo because of the comparable response observed in this group. This finding confirms the importance of robust study design in clinical trials to include appropriate control and comparator groups and should be considered when interpreting other studies in this therapeutic area. Libertas was intended to provide a framework for future studies allowing clear endpoints to be derived. It is hoped that, despite the lack of a treatment effect in the Libertas study, lessons learned from its design and conduct will ultimately benefit patients suffering with FI.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>What does this paper add to the literature?</bold></p><p>All patients&#x02019; FI symptoms improved, but the NRL001 effect was not significant when compared with placebo. Unexpected and sustained symptom improvements in the placebo group highlight the requirement for appropriate study design. Devices used to treat FI are often introduced without placebo-controlled studies. The use of suppositories is an acceptable and tolerable treatment option for FI patients.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the patients and investigators who participated in the Libertas study.
