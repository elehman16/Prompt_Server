The healthy term newborns were divided into 3 groups; A, formula-fed; B, breast-fed only; S, breast-fed with vitamin D supplementation. We measured serum concentrations of vitamin D (25OHD3), calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), alkaline phosphatase (AP), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and bone mineral density (BMD) at 6 and 12 months of age. Using questionnaires, average duration of sun-light exposure and dietary intake of vitamin D, Ca and P were obtained. At 6 and 12 months of age, 25OHD3 was significantly higher in group S than in group B (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). iPTH was significantly lower in group S than in group B at 6 months (<italic>P</italic>=0.001), but did not differ at 12 months. Regardless of vitamin D supplementation, BMD was lower in group B and S than in group A (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Total intake of vitamin D differed among 3 groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001, A&#x0003e;S&#x0003e;B), but total intake of Ca and P were higher in group A than in group B and S (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). In conclusion, breast-fed infants show lower vitamin D status and bone mineralization than formula-fed infants.

In children, severe vitamin D deficiency manifests as rickets, and vitamin D inadequacy can impair attainment of peak bone mass. In adults, inadequate vitamin D can result in secondary hyperparathyroidism, decreased bone mineral density, osteomalacia, and increased risk of fragility fractures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Moreover, inadequate vitamin D may be involved in the pathogenesis and/or progression of several disorders, including cancer, hypertension, osteoarthritis, diabetes, and other autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>Infants between 4 months and 2 yr of age are at a high risk for the relative vitamin D deficiency because of their rapid growth in skeletal system. The incidence of vitamin D deficiency during infancy had been decreased in the past with the improvement of nutritional condition such as vitamin D supplementation in infant formula. But, lately it has been increased again for various reasons such as breast-feeding from vitamin D deficient mother, lack of sun-light exposure (cosmetic or dermatologic reasons, sun-block, etc.), high latitude, dark skin, and low dietary intake of vitamin D, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In response to the resurgence of rickets especially in breast-fed infants, the American Academy of Pediatrics revised its policy on vitamin D supplementation to infants and children in 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>The incidence of vitamin D deficiency would be high as well in Korean infants for similar reasons, but there are few clinical studies performed to evaluate the nutritional status of vitamin D during infancy. Therefore, in this study, we evaluate the vitamin D status in Korean infants, and further determine the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation on the vitamin D nutritional status and bone mineralization in term breast-fed infants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects and study design</title><p>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Chungbuk National University. And the informed consents were obtained from mothers. The healthy term infants delivered at Chungbuk National University Hospital from July 2004 through June 2005 were enrolled in this study. Study infants were divided into 3 groups: A, formula-fed; B, breast-fed only without supplementation; S, breast-fed with vitamin D supplementation. During 1 yr follow-up period after enrollment, serum concentrations of vitamin D (25OHD3), calcium (Ca), inorganic phosphorus (P), alkaline phosphatase (AP), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), bone mineral density (BMD), and bone mineral content (BMC) were measured at birth, 6 and 12 months of age. Average duration of sunlight exposure (min/day) and total intake of vitamin D, Ca and P were obtained by maternal interview using questionnaires.</p></sec><sec><title>Vitamin D supplementation</title><p>In group S infants, 0.5 mL of Poly-Vitamin Drops&#x000ae; (Hi-Tech Pharmacal Co.

In general, vitamin D deficiency in infancy and childhood presents clinical manifestations such as rickets, and vitamin D insufficiency may result in an asymptomatic biochemical abnormality such as secondary hyperparathyroidism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). We defined vitamin D deficiency, insufficiency, and sufficiency as 25OHD3 less than 11 ng/mL, 11-30 ng/mL, and over 30 ng/mL, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). However, vitamin D deficient infants as defined in our study did not show clinical symptom of rickets. Only 6 infants whose 25OHD3 levels less than 15 ng/mL showed increased iPTH levels above 40 pg/mL, suggestive of secondary hyperparathyroidism due to vitamin D insufficiency.</p><p>In adults, BMD correlates with the serum vitamin D levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), whereas, in infants, it has been reported to have no correlation with the serum vitamin D levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Since lumbar-spine (L2-L4) bone mineral density does not have normal reference values for the infants less than 1 yr of age, we simply compared BMDs among 3 study groups.</p><p>The overall prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency in our study were 18% and 74% at birth, 4% and 43% at 6 months, and 0% and 15% at 12 months of age. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in our study is lower than the data reported by Challa et al. (56-91% at birth and 21-30% at 6 months), but similar to the data by Weiler et al. (36% at birth by using cord blood levels of vitamin D less than 11 ng/mL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p><p>Serum vitamin D level was determined by 2 major factors, i.e., the dietary intake and production in the skin when exposed to the sun (ultraviolet B irradiation, UVB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Healthy term infants are born with the storage of vitamin D enough for next couple of months, and the half-life of serum vitamin D is 12-20 days. Infant formula has been fortified with sufficient amount of vitamin D (&#x0003e;400 IU/L), whereas breast milk contain only 12-60 IU/L of vitamin D which is much less than the required maintenance amount (200 IU/day) as recommended by National Academy of Science (NAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). On top of that, dermal conversion is seasonally unreliable source of vitamin D and may not compensate for low nutritional intake, particularly in infants whose skin exposure to sunlight is limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Therefore, exclusively breast-fed infants are at high risk of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency. Actually, the breast-fed infants showed significantly lower vitamin D status and bone mineralization than the formula-fed infants, as revealed in this study.</p><p>Measures to prevent vitamin D deficiency include increased skin exposure to sunlight, increased fortification of food items with vitamin D, and vitamin D supplementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In our study, we supplemented breast-fed infants with 200 IU/day of vitamin D from 2 months of age as recommended by American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in 2003 in order to evaluate the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation. We compared their vitamin D status and BMD with those of 2 control groups, one with breast-fed without supplementation and the other with formula-fed at 6 and 12 months of age. Our results showed that vitamin D supplementation (200 IU/day) in breast-fed infants increased serum 25-OH vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, but did not increase bone mineral density. As a matter of fact, BMD and BMC were lower in breast-fed infants than in formula-fed infants, regardless of vitamin D supplementation. As vitamin D level increased at 6 months, iPTH in supplemented group was significantly lower than in breast-fed control. But at 12 months of age, unlike our expectation, iPTH in supplemented group became rather higher, yet of no significant difference, despite higher vitamin D level as compared with breast-fed control.</p><p>Season, residence, and sun-light exposure were compared in order to evaluate the factors on vitamin D status in this study, and there were no differences among 3 study groups. On the contrary, dietary intake of vitamin D, Ca, and P at 6 and 12 months were significantly different among 3 groups. According to our survey data, daily intake of these nutrients in all breast-fed infants, regardless of vitamin supplementation, were lower than those recommended for 5-11 month-old infants in the 7th Korean Recommended Dietary Allowances (10 &#x000b5;g/day of vitamin D, 300 mg/day of calcium, and 300 mg/ day of phosphorus).</p><p>Based on our results, it was supposed that 200 IU/day of vitamin D supplementation in breast-fed infants did increase serum 25-OH vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, but did not increase BMD, and did not fully correct iPTH at 12 months. Regarding these unexpected results in our study, we speculated firstly that 200 IU/day of vitamin D supplementation in AAP recommendation (2003) might not be enough to correct the vitamin D insufficiency in late infancy. Since some researchers have suggested 400-800 IU/day of vitamin D intake for the prevention of vitamin D deficiency, further studies are warranted to examine dose-responsive relationship of vitamin D supplementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p><p>Secondly, the amount of calcium intake should be considered. BMD depends mainly on the amount of total body calcium. Therefore, an increase in calcium intake alone can enhance bone mineralization and effectively suppress the secretion of iPTH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). It is plausible that the difference in BMD and iPTH between the breast-fed and the formula-fed group might result from a large amount of calcium intake in formula-fed infants, independent of vitamin D. In addition, 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D could mobilize calcium by increasing bone resorption of osteoclasts if the calcium intake is very low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The unexpected result of iPTH in supplemented group at 12 months might also be caused by a relative excess of vitamin D to low Ca, P intake in breast-fed infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Therefore, a clinical trial of co-supplementation of vitamin D with calcium would be considered to elucidate this possibility.</p><p>Lastly, the other nutrients such as iron (10 mg/mL) and fluoride (0.25 mg/mL) contained in our multivitamin preparation for vitamin D source should be elucidated, because those nutrients could influence vitamin D status and bone mineralization. Currently there is no commercially available preparation of vitamin D alone. A preparation of vitamin D alone needs to be developed and used in future study to exclude this problem.</p><p>In conclusion, vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency was relatively common in Korean infants. Especially, breast-fed infants showed lower vitamin D status and bone mineralization than formula-fed infants. Vitamin D supplementation (200 IU/day) in breast-fed infants increased serum 25-OH vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, but did not increase bone mineral density.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>This work was supported by the Korea Research Foundation Grant funded by the <funding-source>Korean Government (MOEHRD)</funding-source> (<award-id>R04-2004-000-10205-0</award-id>).</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Holick</surname><given-names>MF</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>High prevalence of vitamin D inadequacy and implications for health</article-title><source>Mayo Clin Proc</source><year>2006</year><volume>81</volume><fpage>353</fpage><lpage>373</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16529140</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Holick</surname><given-names>MF</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The vitamin D epidemic and its health consequences</article-title><source>J Nutr</source><year>2005</year><volume>135</volume><fpage>2739S</fpage><lpage>2748S</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16251641</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hollis</surname><given-names>BW</given-names></name><name><surname>Wagner</surname><given-names>CL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Nutritional vitamin D status during pregnancy: reasons for concern</article-title><source>CMAJ</source><year>2006</year><volume>174</volume><fpage>1287</fpage><lpage>1290</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16636329</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Grant</surname><given-names>WB</given-names></name><name><surname>Holick</surname><given-names>MF</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Benefits and requirements of vitamin D for optimal health: a review</article-title><source>Altern Med Rev</source><year>2005</year><volume>10</volume><fpage>94</fpage><lpage>111</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15989379</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lips</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Vitamin D physiology</article-title><source>Prog Biophys Mol Biol</source><year>2006</year><volume>92</volume><fpage>4</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16563471</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Muhe</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Lulseged</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Mason</surname><given-names>KE</given-names></name><name><surname>Simoes</surname><given-names>EA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Case-control study of the role of nutritional rickets in the risk of developing pneumonia in Ethiopian children</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>1997</year><volume>349</volume><fpage>1801</fpage><lpage>1804</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9269215</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B7"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Callaghan</surname><given-names>AL</given-names></name><name><surname>Moy</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Booth</surname><given-names>IW</given-names></name><name><surname>Debelle</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Shaw</surname><given-names>NJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Incidence of symptomatic vitamin D deficiency</article-title><source>Arch Dis Child</source><year>2006</year><volume>91</volume><fpage>606</fpage><lpage>607</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16595644</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B8"><label>8</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rajakumar</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>SB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Reemerging Nutritional Rickets.
