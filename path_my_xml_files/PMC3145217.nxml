Ninety overweight and obese participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups for 23 wk: <italic>1</italic>) WP; <italic>2</italic>) SP (each providing ~56 g/d of protein and 1670 kJ/d); or <italic>3</italic>) an isoenergetic amount of CHO. Supplements were consumed as a beverage twice daily. Participants were provided no dietary advice and continued to consume their free-choice diets. Participants&#x02019; body weight and composition data were obtained monthly. Dietary intake was determined by 24-h dietary recalls collected every 10 d. After 23 wk, body weight and composition did not differ between the groups consuming the SP and WP or between SP and CHO; however, body weight and fat mass of the group consuming the WP were lower by 1.8 kg (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.006) and 2.3 kg (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005), respectively, than the group consuming CHO. Lean body mass did not differ among any of the groups. Waist circumference was smaller in the participants consuming WP than in the other groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Fasting ghrelin was lower in participants consuming WP compared with SP or CHO. Through yet-unknown mechanisms, different sources of dietary protein may differentially facilitate weight loss and affect body composition. Dietary recommendations, especially those that emphasize the role of dietary protein in facilitating weight change, should also address the demonstrated clinical potential of supplemental WP.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dietary approaches for controlling unhealthy weight gain are becoming increasingly important and using dietary manipulations to control hunger is one potential means to control energy intake. Many investigations of dietary manipulations to modulate body weight, especially those with higher protein diets, include energy restriction during or subsequent to the dietary modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). Results from these interventions suggest that body weight loss is greater while consuming higher protein diets and satiety may be a key factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). However, because these participants were in an energy deficit, it is difficult to separate the effects of the catabolic state from those of the dietary macronutrients.</p><p>In short-term studies with subjective assessment of hunger and satiety, dietary protein has been shown to be more satiating than isoenergetic intake of fat and carbohydrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Although results from these short-term studies can provide insight into energy intake regulation, it is unclear what effect any short-term response in food intake will have on long-term energy intake and body weight regulation, especially in a noncatabolic state. Thus, longer term dietary interventions with body weight or composition as outcomes may answer these questions.</p><p>Not all longer term dietary interventions of restricted energy intake concomitant with increased protein intake have demonstrated that these diets improve body weight or composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). In most interventions, the source of dietary protein is typically not described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>) or is from mixed sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). Protein source may be important to consider in understanding the success or failure of these interventions. For example, in a study of overweight and obese men fed isoenergetic diets, animal protein (pork) increased energy expenditure compared with a vegetable (soy) protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Wistar rats (10 wk old) fed a high-protein diet with whey protein concentrate had a 4% reduction in weight gain and reduced visceral and subcutaneous fat deposition compared with rats fed a red meat-based protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). These results suggest that there might be differential effects among protein sources on energy intake or body weight regulation. However, the rat data are from young, growing animals whose physiological state might be much different from an adult human. Likewise, human studies investigating different sources of protein and body weight and composition have either been of very short duration or conducted with energy restriction, thus confounding the interpretation of the results.</p><p>The primary objective of the present study was to determine the effects of added supplemental protein to the habitual diet of free-living overweight and obese adults, without energy restriction, on body weight and composition. A secondary objective was to determine whether there are differential effects between protein sources on body weight and composition in a longer term intervention. Whey and soy are both readily available proteins and both have been implicated in regulating food intake. We hypothesized that supplementation of overweight and obese free-living individuals with whey protein (WP)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3"><sup>3</sup></xref> would decrease body weight and fat compared with individuals supplemented with isonitrogenous soy protein (SP) or isoenergetic carbohydrate (CHO) and that insulin, insulin-like growth factor (IGF), ghrelin, and thyroid hormones would be affected by protein source.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>A double-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted to determine the effects of supplemental WP and SP and an isoenergetic amount of CHO on body weight and composition in free-living overweight and obese but otherwise healthy individuals for 23 wk. In addition, plasma glucose, insulin, ghrelin, IGF, and serum thyroid hormones were determined to evaluate metabolic and hormonal changes. Because dietary intake and physical activity can alter body weight and composition, these factors were monitored at frequent intervals throughout the intervention.</p><sec><title>Participants.</title><p>Ninety participants were recruited and randomly assigned (stratified by sex, BMI, and age) to 1 of 3 groups: WP, SP, or an isoenergetic amount of CHO (maltodextrin). The sample size was selected to determine a 3% change in body weight (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) with 90% power among each treatment comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Participants were stratified to treatment based on gender and BMI.</p><p>Inclusion into the study was for nonsmokers having a BMI (in kg/m<sup>2</sup>) &#x0003e;28 and &#x0003c;38, fasting glucose &#x0003c;7 mmol/L, blood pressure &#x0003c;160/100 mm Hg, and total cholesterol &#x0003c;6.2 mmol/L. Exclusion criteria included: history or presence of kidney, gastrointestinal, liver, or thyroid disease, gout, certain cancers, or type 2 diabetes; recent weight loss; recently following a high-protein diet or using antiobesity medications or supplements; and consuming a WP or SP supplement. Medical history, routine blood chemistry indexes, complete blood count, urine analysis, and a physical examination were used to evaluate each participant&#x02019;s eligibility for inclusion in the study. The protocol and consent form were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Medstar Research Institute. Participants provided written informed consent and received $800 for successful participation.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention.</title><p>Each treatment supplement was specifically formulated and manufactured for this study (Innovative Food Processors) and was provided in 3 flavors in serving sizes of 52 g/packet (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). The source of WP was WP concentrate-80, the source of SP was an isoflavone-free SP isolate (Prolisse, Cargill), and the source of CHO was maltodextrin (Maltrin M180, Grain Processing). The WP concentrate-80 was from a cheese-derived source and was not hydrolyzed. An isoflavone-free SP isolate was selected to minimize the impact of nonprotein compounds and focus on the biological effects of the macronutrient component. Participants were instructed to consume 1 pack immediately prior to, during, or immediately after breakfast and dinner. The total amount of energy from the treatments was 1670 kJ/d. Participants were provided with information on the energy content of the products but with minimal instruction from a registered dietician on how to make dietary alterations to incorporate these products. Participants completed a questionnaire each day to record the time the treatment was consumed and general health questions. Participants were provided a daily vitamin and mineral supplement (Os-cal Ultra; GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare) to standardize supplemental calcium intake.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1"

At the end of the intervention, in the group consuming supplemental WP compared with those consuming supplemental CHO, there was a 1.8-kg difference in body mass and a 2.3-kg difference in fat mass, with the CHO-supplemented group being heavier than the protein-supplemented group. By contrast, in the group consuming supplemental SP compared with the group consuming supplemental CHO, there was no difference in body mass or composition. Similarly, the groups consuming the 2 protein sources did not differ. Based on the length of the treatment and the daily energy provided from the supplement, we would estimate that weight gain would exceed ~10 kg without any compensation for the additional energy of the supplement. Given the observed changes in weight, it appears that the energy compensation occurred for all treatments. The difference in body weight and composition at the end of the intervention likely is related to better compensation among the group consuming the whey treatment compared with the CHO treatment. These differences among treatments in body weight and composition may be a result of subtle effects of CHO and protein on satiety. Changes in energy intake in the range of only 170&#x02013;210 kJ/d could account for the observed modest change in body weight during this 23-wk intervention. These changes are so subtle that they may not be detectible with the 24-h recall methodology. Additionally, consuming WP resulted in a significantly smaller waist circumference compared with the group consuming supplemental CHO. This finding is important, because the amount of intra-abdominal adipose tissue is more significantly correlated with metabolic complications in obese individuals than is subcutaneous fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). During energy restriction, higher protein diets consumed ad libitum facilitate weight loss, and improved satiety is a presumed contributing mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). In this study in which energy restriction was not part of the intervention, changes in body weight and composition were small but nevertheless suggest that habitual consumption of supplemental protein may result in improved body composition and incremental, but ultimately significant, weight loss. These data suggest that supplemental dietary protein may reduce the risk of unhealthy weight gain observed in many populations (i.e. 500&#x02013;1000 g/y).</p><p>Although there were no differences among treatments with respect to total (background diet + treatment) energy intake, there was a decrease in the CHO intake of the background diet between the initial and final dietary recall in the participants consuming the WP treatment. Consumption of supplemental WP decreased concentrations of the orexigenic peptide ghrelin. Ghrelin may serve as a hunger signal; it strongly increases food intake in both animals and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). In 1 study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>), there was a decrease in the ghrelin concentration at 2 and 3 h following acute ingestion of 55 g of whey or casein compared with ingestion of 56 g of glucose or lactose. These results are similar to our findings from samples collected after a 12-h fast. In a second study, Bowen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>) found a decrease in ghrelin after ingestion of 50 g of soy, whey, or gluten protein compared with glucose. However, in contrast to our finding, they did not detect a difference among the protein sources. Study design differences could account for the observed differences in response; our observations are from samples collected after a 12-h fast and longer intervention, whereas Bowen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>) collected samples 2 or 3 h after ingestion of the foods, without prior exposure. Further, protein consumption may reduce body fat by stimulating the release of hormones affecting metabolic rate. Thyroid hormone concentrations (T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub>) can increase in participants consuming a high-protein diet compared with a high-carbohydrate diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). Protein source did affect free T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> uptake concentrations; however, consuming SP increased these concentrations more than did consuming WP. Further research is required to gain a better understanding of the long-term effects of differing protein sources on thyroid function.</p><p>Strengths and limitations of the study design warrant consideration. Based on the number of participants who completed the intervention, this study was well powered to detect a small change in body weight. To better ensure participant compliance with treatment (beyond measuring disappearance of packets), we qualitatively measured urinary excretion of an internal treatment marker at random time points during the study. Assessment of dietary intake and physical activity was performed on a regular and frequent schedule. To assess dietary intake throughout the study, we used a method that is designed to estimate current dietary intake and strives to minimize the problem of misreporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). However, this methodology is not sensitive enough to detect the subtle changes in energy intake that take place to result in the small yet significant differences in weight seen in this study (1.8 kg between WP and CHO groups). This study did not include a placebo control group (no intervention) to maintain a double-blind standard. Protein and carbohydrate were selected for the intervention, because they both provide similar metabolizable energy intake for a given mass. In this intervention, participants were instructed to consume their product immediately before, after, or during their meal. Much previous research has used macronutrient interventions as a preload to a meal. Preloading participants might have resulted in greater treatment differences.</p><p>This intervention study reported on the effects of long-term consumption of supplemental WP, SP, and CHO in a free-living overweight and obese population without imposed energy restriction. However, most studies examining the effects of increased dietary protein have used mixed sources of proteins (dairy, vegetable, meat, and soy) in conjunction with weight loss; therefore, future research should target whether specific dietary proteins may elicit beneficial effects on body composition during energy restriction. Future research should also target the dose of specific proteins necessary for beneficial effects on weight and body composition and the interaction of dose and time needed to observe any effects.</p><p>In conclusion, this study suggests that after 6 mo of supplementation, there was a difference in body weight and fat mass between overweight and obese adults who consumed supplemental WP compared with those who consumed isoenergetic supplemental CHO. The difference in body weight was associated with a decrease in fat without an effect on lean mass. Supplemental SP compared with CHO did not alter body weight or composition, nor were there differences in body weight or composition between soy and WP sources. Although there were differences in food intake between males and females, the effects of the intervention were consistent between males and females. Short-term weight loss requires energy restriction and higher protein diets may assist in this acute weight reduction; however, protein supplementation, particularly WP, in overweight and obese individuals may assist in long-term maintenance of body weight without energy restriction.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>D.J.B., B.A.C., and W.V.R. designed research; D.J.B., K.S.S., D.R.P., and W.V.R. conducted research; D.J.B. analyzed data; D.J.B. and K.S.S. wrote the paper; and D.J.B. had primary responsibility for final content.
