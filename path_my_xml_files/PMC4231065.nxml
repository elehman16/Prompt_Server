Addition of a single dose of rituximab resulted in a long-lasting B-cell depletion.

Nevertheless, the continuous use of immunosuppressive drugs does not preclude the development of chronic rejection, which is a major cause of long-term allograft loss <xref rid="pone.0112658-Chapman1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. T cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of rejection via the recognition of alloantigens, resulting in T-cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation into CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cells and CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper cells <xref rid="pone.0112658-Safinia1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Therefore, the most commonly used immunosuppressive drugs in transplantation are directed against T cells to inhibit these processes <xref rid="pone.0112658-Kahan1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. On the other hand, regulatory T cells are able to suppress the immune response and prevent allograft rejection <xref rid="pone.0112658-Wood1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The balance between memory and regulatory T cells during the course after transplantation can be used to predict renal graft rejection following the reduction of immunosuppressive therapy <xref rid="pone.0112658-Kreijveld1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Next to T cells, B cells can be involved in graft rejection <xref rid="pone.0112658-Zarkhin1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The presence of B-cell clusters in renal grafts during acute rejection or the presence of anti-HLA antibodies before transplantation is associated with poorer graft survival <xref rid="pone.0112658-Hippen1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112658-Otten1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Notably, B cells can induce alloimmune responses by acting as professional antigen presenting cells, or by the production of various (pro-)inflammatory cytokines <xref rid="pone.0112658-Jordan1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Therefore, depletion of B cells in renal transplant recipients might help to prevent allograft rejection. Current immunosuppressive regimens consisting of steroids, a calcineurin-inhibitor, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) inhibit B-cell function directly due to inhibition of their proliferation and indirectly via the inhibition of T-cell help. B cells can also be selectively depleted by rituximab (RTX), an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody. RTX is successfully used in the treatment of B-cell malignancies and autoimmune disorders mediated by T and B cells <xref rid="pone.0112658-Thurlings1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112658-BarOr1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Although the major target of RTX-based treatment was to reduce the levels of circulating autoantibodies, additional B-cell functions may be affected, such as antigen presentation and cytokine production <xref rid="pone.0112658-Piccio1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Furthermore induction of regulatory T cells (T<sub>REGS</sub>) was reported after RTX treatment in patients with lupus nephritis <xref rid="pone.0112658-VignaPerez1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Therefore, next to its effect on B cells, RTX might decrease the chance of rejection after transplantation by affecting the T-cell compartment. Remarkably little is known about the effects of the currently used immunosuppressive strategies on the phenotype and function of T and B cells during the course after renal transplantation. Advancements in multiparameter flow cytometry have made it possible to analyze the effects of immunosuppressive agents on various T- and B-cell subsets in more detail. We had the opportunity to study the effects of standard immunosuppression (tacrolimus, MMF and steroids), with or without the addition of RTX induction therapy on the phenotype and function of T and B cells over time in renal transplant recipients participating in a randomized placebo-controlled trial, studying the efficacy and safety of RTX added to standard immunosuppression. To avoid bias by other immunological events as much as possible, we analyzed only Cytomegalovirus (CMV) seronegative patients who received a kidney from a CMV seronegative donor, did not experience a rejection episode, and were not treated with additional immunosuppressive drugs during the follow-up period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients</title><p>Patients were selected from participants of a clinical trial with RTX in renal transplantation at our hospital (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00565331). This study investigated the effectiveness and safety of RTX for prophylaxis of acute rejection after renal transplantation. Patients were randomized between treatment with a single dose of RTX (375 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) or placebo during transplant surgery. Concomitant immunosuppression consisted of tacrolimus, MMF, and steroids. Patients received 100 mg of prednisolone intravenously during the first 3 days after transplantation and subsequently an oral dose of 15&#x02013;25 mg/day, tapered to a maintenance dose of 0.1 mg/kg/day. Tacrolimus was started at 0.2 mg/kg/day and the dose was subsequently adjusted to achieve whole-blood trough levels of 15&#x02013;20 ng/ml during the first 2 weeks, 10&#x02013;15 ng/ml during weeks 3&#x02013;6, and 5&#x02013;10 ng/ml from week 7. MMF was administered at 1000 mg twice daily with a dose reduction to 750 mg twice daily at 2 weeks after transplantation, and discontinued after 6 months.</p><p>The current study was carried out as preplanned side study of the clinical trial. To create a homogeneous study population without disturbing immunological events, we selected patients who did not meet the primary end point of the clinical trial (biopsy-proven acute rejection). Moreover, we investigated only Cytomegalovirus (CMV) seronegative patients who received a kidney from a CMV seronegative donor (and thus did not develop CMV infection), and we excluded patients in whom the immunosuppressive treatment was changed during the follow-up period. After applying these selection criteria, all remaining patients were included: 14 patients in the group treated with tacrolimus, MMF and steroids, and 12 patients in the group additionally treated with RTX (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112658.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

In contrast, we performed a longitudinal analysis of T- and B-cell phenotype and function in CMV seronegative patients who received a kidney from a CMV seronegative donor and did not experience a rejection episode up to 24 months after transplantation. In this homogeneous patient population, not affected by major immunological events, we showed that treatment with the combination of tacrolimus, MMF and steroids had no effects on the total number of T and B cells. Nevertheless, these patients had a higher proportion of central memory CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells at 3 months after transplantation compared to pre-transplant levels. Interestingly, the triple drug immunosuppression resulted in a shift toward a more memory-like phenotype in the B-cell population. Addition of a single dose of RTX resulted not only in a long-lasting B-cell depletion, but also in a higher percentage of transitional B cells upon B-cell recovery at 12 months post-transplant.

In addition, we found that the ratio between CD4<sup>+</sup> central memory and T<sub>REGS</sub> was increased under triple drug immunosuppressive therapy. Concomitantly, we observed a relative increase of CXCR3<sup>+</sup> and CCR6<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, chemokine receptors associated with memory or activated Th1 and Th17 cells, respectively.

In our cohort, discontinuation of MMF at 6 months after transplantation resulted in a relative increase of virgin naive Bm1 cells, while naive Bm2 cells were decreased compared to pre-transplant levels. Transitional Bm2 cells remained low up to 24 months after transplantation, suggesting that their development is mainly suppressed by treatment with tacrolimus and/or steroids. Finally, following the discontinuation of MMF, the percentage of memory B cells became comparable to levels before transplantation. Steroids were also found to have clear effects on B cells; <italic>ex vivo</italic> immunoglobulin production by PBMC was decreased during treatment with a high dose of prednisolone (60 mg) while a lower dose (30 mg) resulted in an increased production after stimulation <xref rid="pone.0112658-Hanson1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Others have described that steroids have an effect on B-cell activation, while proliferation and activation are less affected <xref rid="pone.0112658-Cupps1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Under combined treatment with tacrolimus, MMF, and steroids, our renal transplant recipients had a more memory-like B-cell phenotype compared to before transplantation. This relative increase of memory B cells was also found in a patient cohort treated with cyclosporine, MMF, steroids, and an anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody <xref rid="pone.0112658-vandeBerg1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The observed memory-like B-cell phenotype was accompanied by an increased percentage of CD80<sup>+</sup> and CD95<sup>+</sup> B cells, which may be explained by the preferential expression of these molecules on memory-like B cells <xref rid="pone.0112658-Bohnhorst1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>Treatment with RTX provides a highly efficient means for the (temporary) depletion of B cells, with potential suppression of B cell-associated anti-graft responses. Adding a single dose of RTX to the combination of tacrolimus, MMF, and steroids in our patients indeed resulted in a long lasting B-cell depletion in peripheral blood. A remarkable characteristic of the returning B cells was a decreased expression of the receptor for B-cell activating factor (BAFF), an essential growth factor for B cells <xref rid="pone.0112658-Pieper1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The decreased percentage of BAFF-R<sup>+</sup> B cells after RTX treatment, which was also found in patients with rheumatoid arthritis <xref rid="pone.0112658-de1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> may be due to a relative increase of memory-like B cells, which have lower or no BAFF-R expression <xref rid="pone.0112658-Pieper1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.

Another interesting observation was an increase in the percentage of transitional B cells at 12 months after treatment with RTX compared to triple immunosuppression therapy alone.

Taken together, an increase in BAFF level, reduced BAFF-R expression, and an increase in the proportion of transitional B cells appear to be interrelated phenomena which are associated with RTX treatment.</p><p>Upon activation, B cells are able to proliferate, produce various cytokines and process antigen for presentation to T cells <xref rid="pone.0112658-Duddy1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112658-Janeway1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.

However, in contrast, we did not observe any changes in the T-cell compartment in our patients treated with RTX. In another <italic>ex vivo</italic> study, we neither were able to show that RTX influenced the production of IL-17 and other monocyte- and T-cell-derived cytokines by PBMCs <xref rid="pone.0112658-Smeekens1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. It should be noted however that we only analyzed peripheral blood T cells. From a previous study in renal transplant patients, we know that a single dose of RTX leads a to nearly complete B-cell depletion in peripheral blood, but not in secondary lymphoid organs, and that these remaining B cells have different functional capacities <xref rid="pone.0112658-Kamburova2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. From our current data, it seems that this population of mostly memory type B cells residing in lymphoid organs does not noticeably affect the peripheral blood T-cell compartment as compared to transplant recipients on triple immunosuppression without RTX. Interestingly, several studies on patients with autoimmune disease revealed that the T-cell compartment was affected upon RTX treatment <xref rid="pone.0112658-BarOr1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112658-Iwata1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112658-Stasi1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.
