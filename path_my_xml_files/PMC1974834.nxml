Maternal lipid concentrations were reduced in the intervention arm of the trial, while cord blood and neonatal lipids did not differ between the groups. The diet had no measured adverse effects. However, there was a marked reduction in the incidence of preterm delivery (a live birth prior to 37 complete weeks of gestation) in the intervention group. Gestational age was based on the ultrasound examination performed at week 17&#x02013;18 of gestation. There were no differences between the intervention and control groups with respect to other pregnancy complications.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref></p><p>Inflammatory mechanisms are involved in atherogenic processes as well as in several pregnancy complications including preterm delivery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> These mechanisms may be reflected in elevated blood concentrations of soluble adhesion molecules (sCAMs), markers of inflammation and endothelial activation, such as vascular adhesion molecule (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1), as has often been observed in pre-eclampsia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> On the other hand, the concentration of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), though emerging as a potential marker for cardiovascular risk,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> has not been shown to differ significantly in women who subsequently develop pre-eclampsia or fetal growth restriction compared with women with uncomplicated pregnancies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> Furthermore, markers of prothrombotic activity like von Willebrand&#x02019;s factor (vWF) and markers of abnormal fibrinolysis including plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1 activity), PAI type 2 (PAI-2 antigen) and tissue plasminogen activator antigen (tPAag) have been identified as independent markers of cardiovascular risk in several studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> and have also been related to pregnancy outcome.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref></p><p>Several studies in nonpregnant subjects have indicated that diet influences concentrations of sCAMs and other novel cardiovascular risk markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> but have not been studied in relation to dietary intervention in pregnancy. In this analysis of the CARRDIP population, we investigated the effect of an antiatherogenic diet on maternal and fetal (cord blood) concentrations of sCAMs, markers of thrombosis and fibrinolysis and on maternal levels of high-sensitivity CRP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The trial has been described in detail previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> In brief, 290 healthy, nonsmoking, pregnant white European women aged 21&#x02013;38 years, without a previous or current pregnancy complication and carrying a single healthy fetus, were randomised to follow their usual diet or the intervention diet. The randomisation list was generated from a table of random numbers drawn up by the investigator (S.T.) who had no contact with the pregnant women (as described previously).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> Sealed opaque envelopes consecutively numbered and containing the randomisation number and code (control or intervention) were given to the dietician responsible for giving the dietary advice. Thereafter, each screened and eligible woman was allocated the next available number by the dietician who opened the envelope to determine whether the woman was to follow the usual diet or the intervention diet.</p><p>The intervention diet aimed to limit dietary cholesterol and to reduce the intake of saturated fat by replacing saturated fat with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat. Women in the intervention group (<italic>n</italic> = 141) were advised to consume fish, low-fat meats, oils and low-fat dairy products instead of full-fat dairy products and meats, and to increase their intake of whole grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes. Both the intervention and control groups followed the same schedule of blood sampling, physician and dietician visits and assessments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>). Usual antenatal care was provided by the woman&#x02019;s general physician and/or midwife. The initial and all the follow-up examinations pertaining to the study were conducted by a specialist in obstetrics and gyanecology (J.K.). The physicians and midwives caring for the women, the specialist physician (J.K.) and all laboratory and other personnel were blinded with regard to treatment assignment. The subjects were asked not to reveal their dietary assignment to any of the study staff or other subjects.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Assessment and scheduling procedures.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bjo0114-0279-f1"/></fig><p>To assess dietary compliance, the weighed dietary intake was recorded on a predetermined day weekly throughout pregnancy. The women were instructed in the cumulative weighing technique using a digital dietary scale. All food and beverages consumed were described and weighed. The dietary records were entered into the database by certified personnel and scored using the software program Beregn developed by the Department of Nutrition, University of Oslo, and based on the Norwegian food table (1995; National Nutrition Council). Foods or recipes that were not part of the programme were calculated and added. Vitamin or iron supplements were not included in the analyses.</p><sec><title>Laboratory methods</title><p>Blood samples for measuring the risk markers (hereinafter referred to as biomarkers) were obtained at each visit after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours. VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and E-selectin were measured at 17&#x02013;20 weeks of gestation (baseline) and at weeks 30 and 36. High-sensitivity CRP was measured at baseline and at weeks 24, 30 and 36. PAI-1, PAI-2, tPAag and vWF were measured at baseline and week 36. All the above, except CRP, were also measured in cord blood. Serum separated within 1 hour was used for determination of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, E-selectin and CRP. Blood for the preparation of platelet-poor citrated plasma was collected, immediately placed on ice and centrifuged within 30 minutes (maternal samples) to 1 hour (cord blood samples) for determination of PAI-1, PAI-2, tPAag and vWF. All samples were kept frozen at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C until analysed.</p><p>Commercial methods were used for all analyses. sCAMs were analysed with kits provided by R&#x00026;D Systems Europe, Abingdon, Oxon, UK, and the individual CAMs had the following coefficients of inter-assay variation (CV): VCAM-1, 5.2%; ICAM-1, 4.8%; and E-selectin, 5.3%. High-sensitivity CRP was measured by means of the Roche Modular electrochemoluminescence method. CVs were 8.0, 4.0 and 6.0% at concentrations of 0.13, 1.18 and 17.0 mg/l, respectively. Commercial methods were also used for analyses of the haemostatic parameters as follows: Spectrolyse/pL PAI-1 (Biopool AB, Ume&#x000e5;, Sweden; CV 4.2%), Imubind PAI-2 (American Diagnostica Inc., Greenwich, CT, USA; CV 6.3%), TintElize tPAag (Biopool AB; CV 3.5%) and Asserachrom vWF (Stago Diagnostica, Asnieres, France; CV 8.0%).</p><p>Fatty acid measurements were carried out in serum frozen immediately after venesection and stored at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C. A single technician analysed all samples simultaneously after completion of the trial. Serum total fatty acid profiles were determined at baseline and at gestational week 36 by extracting lipids from serum. After transesterification, fatty acid methyl esters were separated by means of capillary gas liquid chromatography. The identity of each fatty acid peak was ascertained by comparison of the peak&#x02019;s retention time relative to the retention times of fatty acids in a synthetic standard of known fatty acid composition. The relative amount of each fatty acid (% of total fatty acid) was quantified by integration of the area under the peak and dividing the result by the total area for all fatty acids. All the analyses were performed at the Department of Clinical Chemistry, National Hospital, Oslo, under the supervision of Bj&#x000f8;rn Christophersen.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The assessment of the effects of an antiatherogenic diet on markers of maternal and fetal endothelial activation and inflammation was part of the secondary hypotheses of the CARRDIP study and part of the original protocol. The power calculations were, however, based on our primary hypothesis concerning the expected difference in maternal total cholesterol levels at week 36 and neonatal total cholesterol levels in the intervention versus the control groups.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> In brief, a sample size of 130 women in each group was required to detect a 5% reduction in maternal total cholesterol and a change of 15% (about 0.22 mmol/l) in neonatal total cholesterol levels between the two groups, (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> = 0.05; <italic>&#x003b2;</italic> = 0.20) in the intervention versus the control groups. A total inclusion of 300 participants was planned in case of dropouts. With an expected rate of adverse pregnancy outcome of 25% (data based on the Norwegian Birth Register), this number of participants had about 65% power with <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>set at 0.05 to find a 50% increase in the occurrence of any adverse pregnancy outcome.</p><p>Dietary energy and intake of macronutrients and food stuffs during pregnancy were expressed as mean daily intake, based on weighed recordings of intake from baseline to week 36.</p><p>All group differences (intervention versus control group), including baseline characteristics, were analysed by two-sample <italic>t</italic>tests or Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic>test, as appropriate.

Moreover, no differences were found between the groups in concentrations of the fetal blood variables measured other than a tendency to lower concentrations of tPAag in the intervention group. Thus, the previously reported preventive effect of the current dietary intervention on preterm delivery is not likely to involve modification of systemic inflammatory biomarkers.</p><fig id="fig04" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Trial profile.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bjo0114-0279-f4"/></fig><p>To our knowledge, the effect of a dietary intervention on markers of endothelial activation and inflammation has not been studied previously in women of fertile age or during pregnancy. The reported significant differences in dietary saturated and unsaturated fat intakes between the groups are supported by the observed difference in some serum fatty acid levels (myristic, eicosapentaenic) between the intervention and control groups. Dietary counselling, similar to the advice given to the intervention group in our study but which extended over a 3-year interval, has been shown to reduce ICAM and tPAag concentrations in a randomised trial of men aged 65&#x02013;75 years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref></p><p>The lack of effect of an antiatherogenic diet in pregnancy on markers of endothelial activation and inflammation may be limited to the current study population, which consisted of healthy, nonsmoking pregnant women with no previous pregnancy complications. There is also a possibility of type II error since power analysis was carried out in regard to the primary hypothesis i.e. reducing maternal and neonatal total cholesterol levels.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> The major strength of the CARRDIP study, on the other hand, is that it is a randomised dietary intervention trial in pregnancy with a prospective design. In addition, the different dietary intake between the groups was verified through characterisation of the serum fatty acid profile.</p><p>Maternal concentrations of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol increased through gestation as expected,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> but the observed decrease in LDL cholesterol concentrations in the intervention arm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> was not accompanied by lower CRP concentrations in this group. It is, therefore, notable that the significant increase in all other systemic parameters of inflammation through the study period, in accordance with previous literature,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> was not observed with regard to CRP concentrations, which remained essentially unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2d</xref>). We have not identified any previously published longitudinal studies of CRP levels in pregnancy. CRP concentrations at 13 weeks of gestation are highly correlated with pre-pregnancy adiposity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> Our findings concerning the significant positive correlation between baseline CRP and baseline BMI in the entire cohort suggest that adiposity is a factor influencing the level of CRP in pregnancy, as seen in nonpregnant populations.</p><p>In normal pregnancy, concentrations of most clotting factors are reported to increase,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> and our results agree with previous observations. Fibrinolytic activity diminishes as tissue plasminogen activator activity decreases, probably due to the increase in the plasminogen activator inhibitors PAI-1 and PAI-2.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> We observed increases in concentrations of tPAag, vWF, PAI-1 and PAI-2 from baseline to week 36 in both the control and intervention groups. However, the increase did not differ between the groups. This finding indicates that lowering total and LDL cholesterol concentrations in low-risk pregnancies by lowering dietary saturated fat<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> is not accompanied by changes in haemostatic variables, at least not within the range of LDL lowering achieved in the present study.</p><p>Inflammatory processes have been shown to take place locally in the uteroplacental unit, especially in pre-eclampsia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> Such local inflammatory processes may also occur in some cases of preterm delivery, since it has been shown that failure of physiological transformation and atherosis of the uteroplacental spiral arteries are often seen in cases of preterm delivery and bear several similarities to atherosclerosis in general, including lipid deposition and inflammatory features.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> Moreover, increased concentrations of ICAM-1 in cervicovaginal fluid have been considered as a potential predictor of preterm delivery in women with symptoms of preterm labour.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> Although we did not find significant changes in the blood concentrations of the measured inflammatory markers, we cannot exclude the possibility that the dietary intervention somehow may have lead to changes in the local uteroplacental or cervical inflammatory response involving, for example, less enhanced leukocyte/endothelial interaction. Whether lowering of maternal LDL cholesterol is directly involved in initiating a local anti-inflammatory response remains a hypothesis.</p><p>Another finding, which supports the notion of a possible local effect in the intervention group, is that we observed a tendency towards lower concentrations of fetal tPAag in cord blood of fetuses born to mothers in the intervention compared with the control group. To our knowledge, cord blood tPAag concentrations are not described in the literature. tPAag is regarded a marker of atherosclerotic activity and to be an independent marker of coronary heart disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> The effect of the diet on concentrations of tPAag in fetal blood is in accordance with the intervention study of Hjerkinn <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> However, we suggest that future studies attempting to assess a possible local effect of the intervention diet should include power calculations for tPAag in cord blood as a primary hypothesis.</p><p>In conclusion, we found no effect of an antiatherogenic diet during pregnancy on biomarkers of endothelial activation, inflammation and haemostasis. All biomarkers increased during the study period except for CRP, which was stable. Thus, the previously reported effects of the diet during pregnancy on maternal lipid profile and risk of preterm delivery do not seem to involve changes in the systemic inflammatory responses of pregnancy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the obstetric staff at Rikshospitalet-Radiumhospitalet Medical Centre, Oslo, Norway, for their help and support; Manjula Asaratnam for blood sampling;
