Baseline characteristics of the two study groups, including vein size, were comparable (median basilic vein diameter 3.5&#x02009;mm, range 2.8&#x02013;4.1&#x02009;mm). The staged group had a brachio-basilic vein fistula performed first followed by the transposition procedure performed at least 6&#x02009;weeks later to allow the basilic vein to enlarge.

More recently, staging of TBBV fistula was suggested (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), with the arteriovenous anastomosis performed during the first stage and the formal transposition performed after a period of several weeks. Interval arterialization makes staged transposition easier, because the basilic vein is enlarged and its walls are thickened and not small and friable, and perhaps faster than primary transpositions. Additionally, a small and thin-walled basilic vein can be twisted or compressed by a hematoma in the transposition tunnel or can be short, requiring a more proximal anastomosis. In case steal syndrome or venous hypertension develops after a primary TBBV fistula, an extensive and complex operation has been performed with no benefit. In staged procedures, these complications can be managed before the transposition is performed. The obvious disadvantage of procedure staging is the additional delay in TBBV fistula use.</p><p>There is some supportive evidence in favor of staged TBBV fistula from a single-center study, which found improved maturation rates with procedure staging compared with the primary technique (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). However, this study was performed in the early 1990s when preoperative vessel mapping was not used, the randomization method that was used was not reported and the exclusion criteria were not provided. At present, it remains unclear if TBBV fistula should be performed as a primary (one-stage) or staged (two-stage) procedure, particularly in smaller basilic veins. The equivalent results of case&#x02013;control studies (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), suggest that staging might not be necessary; however, their findings could be the result of bias, because staged procedures are usually performed in patients with basilic veins of smaller diameter.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to report on a randomized controlled trial (RCT, <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</uri> identifier, NCT01274117) comparing the short- and long-term results of primary and staged TBBV fistula.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Suitable patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) were randomized to have a TBBV fistula performed either as a primary or a staged procedure (randomization ratio 1:1).

Patients were excluded if they were unwilling to participate and/or not consenting, had a suitable cephalic vein to construct a radio-cephalic or brachio-cephalic fistula, the basilic vein was unsuitable for use because it measured less than 2.5&#x02009;mm or had intrinsic lesions on color-coded Duplex ultrasound (CCDU), or the basilic vein was already enlarged by a previous wrist or elbow arteriovenous fistula draining into the basilic vein on CCDU, as detailed below. Preoperative vessel mapping was performed with CCDU and selective use of venography (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), with the minimum and maximum diameter of the basilic vein being recorded, after application of a tourniquet, including the diameter of the medial antecubital (basilic) vein. Particular attention was made to identify drainage patterns of previous AVFs (radio-cephalic and brachio-median cubital) leading to enlargement of the basilic vein in order to exclude these patients from the trial and also to completely map the basilic vein in order to choose the incision site (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Patients were recruited from the Vascular Access Outpatient Clinic of the University Hospital of Patras, Greece, and enrolled during the period between December 2010 and April 2013. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of Patras, Greece; all participants provided written informed consent and the trial conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec id="S2-2"><title>Surgical techniques</title><p>All procedures were performed by the first author using magnifying loupes (&#x000d7;2.5) under local anesthesia with lidocaine 1% (Xylocaine, AstraZeneka, S&#x000f6;dert&#x000e4;lje, Sweden), preferentially on an outpatient setting. Heparinization was performed with 2,500&#x02009;iu of heparin sodium in the form of basilic vein flush.</p><p>Primary procedures (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) were performed with the modification of skip incisions to dissect the basilic vein. A large subcutaneous tunnel was created (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), and a 7-mm brachial arteriotomy was used. The staged group had a brachio-basilic vein (BBV) fistula performed first, through a transverse antecubital incision approximately 1&#x02009;cm distal to the elbow crease using the same arteriotomy length (7&#x02009;mm) as in primary procedures. Whenever the median antebrachial vein was not suitable, the main basilic vein was used to create the anastomosis through a longitudinal incision. The transposition procedure was performed at least 6&#x02009;weeks later to allow the basilic vein to enlarge, guided by an interval CCDU to confirm this (desirable vein diameter &#x02265;6&#x02009;mm), using skip incisions, basilic vein transection, placement into the tunnel, and reanastomosis (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Previously described modified techniques of basilic vein transposition, guided by the preoperative CCDU and operative findings were selectively used when indicated (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S2-3"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Primary outcomes included TBBV fistula maturation defined as usage of the fistula for three consecutive sessions with two needles (or clearance for use in case of pre-dialysis) between 6 and 10&#x02009;weeks after the transposition procedure (main primary outcome measure subject to power calculations), and long-term primary, primary assisted, and secondary patency.</p><p>Reporting standards for arteriovenous accesses of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Association for Vascular Surgery were used to define access patency (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Primary patency was defined as fully functional access, the first episode of failure or thrombosis being used to determine this outcome. Assisted-primary patency was defined as patent access without thrombectomy, including those in which any intervention had been performed to prevent what was perceived to be impending failure, so that patency is lost when the first thrombosis occurred. Secondary patency was defined as accesses that were patent after thrombectomy, the terminal thrombotic event being taken into account to estimate secondary access patency rates.</p><p>Secondary outcome measures included basilic vein diameter on ultrasound at 4&#x02009;weeks after the procedure, overall maturation (irrespective of time required to achieve this), postoperative and long-term complications (including hematoma, steal syndrome, and venous hypertension), and full time to usage of the TBBF fistula (or clearance in case of pre-dialysis) after the initial procedure.</p></sec><sec id="S2-4"><title>Sample size determination</title><p>Based on the results of a similar study (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), where maturation rates of 90% for staged procedures and 60% for primary procedures were reported, it was estimated that 20 patients in each group would be required for the main primary outcome measure, maturation (&#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05, &#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.10). A formal interim analysis was not planned; however, maturation results were closely monitored because of the open-label design of this surgical trial.</p></sec><sec id="S2-5"><title>Randomization</title><p>All patients provided written informed consent before entering the study. Randomization was performed using sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes, stratified by vein size (2.5&#x02013;3.9&#x02009;mm and &#x02265;4&#x02009;mm, based on previously suggested empirical evidence) (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). To avoid crossover of patients and minimize the possibility of consent withdrawal, the envelopes were opened up at the time of surgery, before the incision was made. Obviously, blinding was not possible for this trial on surgical procedures; however, with the course of time, the antecubital fossa scar tended to fade-away reducing detection bias, which was nevertheless based on objective hard endpoints of maturation and patency.</p></sec><sec id="S2-6"><title>Statistics</title><p>All data of our RCT were entered into a Microsoft Office Access database (Microsoft Inc., Redmond, WA, USA) and analyzed with IBM SPSS Statistics 21 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). All access patency rates were calculated with the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method and compared with the log-rank (Mantel&#x02013;Cox) test. Patients were followed-up for a minimum of 1&#x02009;year and up to the point secondary patency was lost, while initial failures were included in the calculation of long-term patency rates. Categorical data were analyzed with the chi-square or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, where appropriate; numerical data were analyzed with the Mann&#x02013;Whitney test, where appropriate. Relative risk for non-thrombotic complications was calculated, but this was not estimable for maturation because of the absence of events in the staged TTBV fistula group. Similarly, relative risks for long-term patency results were calculated using Cox proportional hazards modeling. A <italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c;0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Two-sided statistical tests were always used.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Results</title><p>Forty patients were assessed for eligibility, with 24 of them being excluded as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.

Baseline characteristics (demographics, pertinent history and co-morbidities) of the two study groups are demonstrated in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and were comparable; however, a marginally significant difference for antithrombotic treatment being used more frequently in two-staged procedures was noted. Only four patients had a basilic vein of 4&#x02009;mm or larger and three of them were randomized to primary TBBV fistula. Similarly, preoperative vessel mapping results, including minimum basilic vein size, were comparable (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). The median minimum basilic vein diameter of both groups was 3.5&#x02009;mm (range 2.8&#x02013;4.1&#x02009;mm). A relevant finding in primary procedures was one case of a duplicated basilic vein, while in four patients of staged procedures, there were quality issues of the medial basilic vein

procedures), with median minimum fistula diameter being 5.9 vs 4.6&#x02009;mm, respectively, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.09 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). The median (interquartile range) interval between the stages of the staged group was 55 (47&#x02013;76) days. In four of the patients undergoing the second stage of the staged procedure, a technical modification was required in the form of concomitant brachial vein harvesting (because of a low basilic vein junction), relocation of the brachial anastomosis above the elbow crease (because of small &#x02013; 3&#x02009;mm &#x02013; diameter of the proximal basilic vein, apparently a failure to enlarge), resection of a proximal fibrotic/stenotic part and creation of the anastomosis with the two fistula stumps, and division of the basilic vein near the axilla and reanastomosis (because of a 5&#x02009;mm/partially enlarged proximal basilic vein, likely to fail or become stenotic if anastomosis was to be made at this level). One more patient with a duplicated basilic vein underwent transposition of both ramii, each measuring at least 6&#x02009;mm in diameter.</p><p>TBBF fistula maturation by week 10 with staged operations (7/7, 100%) was significantly better compared to primary operations (3/9, 33%, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.011, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test), but also final maturation rate with staged operations (7/7, 100%) was significantly better compared to primary operations (4/9, 44%, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.034, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test), which led to premature termination of the trial. More specifically, one TBBV fistula was found thrombosed by the 1-month follow-up, a second one was thrombosed while the patient was awaiting repair of an anastomotic pseudoaneurysm (see below), a third one was abandoned due to low flows and soon was thrombosed, a fourth one thrombosed during the second postoperative month before it was deemed mature, and the fifth one was thrombosed before fully used (one needle trial) possibly in relation to prolonged bleeding requiring application of local pressure. The single patient on pre-dialysis started using his TBBV fistula 1&#x02009;year after it was released for use. There was no association between TBBF fistula maturation by week 10 and final maturation rates and use of antithrombotics (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.25 and <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.51, respectively).</p><p>Time to hemodialysis was longer after staged procedures compared to primary procedures (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Non-thrombotic postoperative and TBBV fistula-related complications after primary and staged procedures occurred in 5/9 (56%) and 3/7 (43%) patients, respectively (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.00, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.49&#x02013;3.40). In the primary TBBV fistula group, these complications included extensive arm bruising and hematoma (requiring hospitalization most likely due to an anastomotic pseudoaneurysm diagnosed at 30&#x02009;days) in two patients, respectively, a puncture-related pseudoaneurysm (requiring operative repair) in a third patient, prolonged bleeding in a forth patient and re-circulation due to the short length of the available basilic vein (requiring complementary transposition) in the fifth patient. In the staged group, these complications included grade 1 steal syndrome (after the BB fistula, spontaneously resolved), grade 1 venous hypertension (after the transposition procedure, managed conservatively) and wound infection with dehiscence after both procedure stages, requiring debridement of the axillary wound and healing by third intention after the transposition in a patient with

Primary and assisted-primary patency of the two techniques is equivalent; however, there is a trend toward a better 1-year secondary patency after staged procedures, as a result of the worse performance of primary transposition.</p><p>The present RCT has demonstrated that maturation rates after primary procedures are significantly worse than those of staged procedures. In the absence of previous arterialization, the basilic vein can be very thin-walled and friable, susceptible to damage in primary procedures. Also, the basilic vein may be twisted or compressed by hematoma in the tunnel more often in primary procedures than in staged procedures (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Our results, were not only expected but also in agreement with one of the two RCTs on this topic, which reported maturation rates of 90% with staged procedures vs 60% with primary procedures (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), raising the level of evidence (from level B to level A &#x02013; two RCTs with consistent results) (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). We attribute our somewhat worse maturation rates with primary procedures to the fact that we randomized only relatively small basilic veins and excluded those that were arterialized based on history of proximal access and also findings of CCDU scanning. The last modality was not reported to be used in the above mentioned RCT (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), performed in the early 1990s before preoperative vessel mapping was described leading to improved results of AVF construction (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). On the other hand, the second RCT failed to demonstrate a significant benefit with staged procedures. Exclusion and inclusion criteria of the two studies were not provided. In agreement with clinical experience, basilic veins already enlarged by previous more distal AVFs are associated with good results regardless of staging or not the procedure, which could explain the difference among the three trials in addition to any bias.</p><p>In the present RCT, a delay to hemodialysis was inevitable for patients randomized into staged procedures. Given the importance of achieving the goal of TBBV fistula maturation, it seems obvious that with staged procedures the large outcome advantage outweighs the relatively short inherent delay and its attendant risks, taking into account a 10% 50-day infection rate of a hemodialysis catheter (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), and a 10% 3-year infection rate of a prosthetic graft (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), should such an option be opted. Delay to hemodialysis, an obvious disadvantage of staged procedures (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), was kept at a minimum in this RCT. Obviously, arterialized basilic veins that are usually much larger do not need a staged procedure, to avoid the risks of prolonged hemodialysis catheter use. To prevent this potential problem, others have suggested selective use of staged procedures if the diameter of the basilic vein is smaller than 4&#x02009;mm, a predictor for failure of maturation (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Of note, two of the three TBBV fistulas that had a primary transposition of a basilic vein diameter &#x02265;4&#x02009;mm failed to mature; therefore, we would suggest that for a non-enlarged basilic vein a cut-off point of 5&#x02009;mm to be used. Further research could be performed to prove this suggestion.</p><p>Long-term primary patency rates of the two study groups are comparable, but our study was prematurely stopped before the trend for secondary patency in favor of staged procedures became significant. Better long-term results with staged procedures compared to primary ones (RR 3.2) have been reported in a case&#x02013;control study although the maturation rates in the two study groups were equivalent (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Primary patency of the two groups of our RCT is almost indistinguishable, indicative that regardless of procedure staging, problems relating to stenotic vein segments might arise during follow-up; however, if these develop in primary transposition, they are usually irreversible because of thrombosis of a small basilic vein that is placed inside a hostile and actively remodeling subcutaneous tunnel, while in staged procedures the basilic vein is already enlarged and less likely to thrombose. Based on our RCT presented herein, it seems that after the initial failures of primary procedures the two techniques perform equally well, similarly to what has been shown by another RCT (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The very small number of interventions that is necessary to maintain patency in our series, unlike prosthetic grafts, confirms the value of TBBV fistulas (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Postoperative and long-term non-thrombotic complications, known to occur frequently (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), are in favor of staged TBBV fistulas as previously described (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), although the difference is not significant.</p><p>Meta-analyses comparing primary and staged BBV fistulas are scarce. In such a study, which included mainly case-controlled studies and only one RCT, there was a suggestion that the two-stage technique was equally good with primary BBV fistulas in terms of similar maturation and patency results (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>The limitations of our RCT include its small size; however, its power is calculated to be 0.89 (two-sided test). An additional limitation is the fact that the study was prematurely stopped and as a result it could not detect any difference in long-term patency. The large benefit with staged procedures in patients with small and not arterialized veins precludes to our view any future trials; obviously, patients with bigger and non-arterialized veins, rare to recruit though, could be randomized into primary and staged TBBV fistula, in view of the recently reported long-term patency with the latter approach (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Future work to our opinion should also focus on techniques to improve further staged procedures (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), including the direct comparison of superficialization with formal transposition.</p><p>In conclusion, among candidates for TBBV fistula and small basilic veins, our small study demonstrated that staged transposition is superior to primary procedures in terms of maturation, a difference persisting in the long-term secondary patency of the two groups.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dagher</surname><given-names>FJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Gelber</surname><given-names>RL</given-names></name><name><surname>Ramos</surname><given-names>EJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Sadler</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name></person-group>. <article-title>Basilic vein to brachial artery fistula: a new access for chronic hemodialysis</article-title>. <source>South Med J</source> (<year>1976</year>) <volume>69</volume>:<fpage>1438</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>40</lpage>.<pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1097/00007611-197611000-00013</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">1019638</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><collab>National Kidney Foundation</collab>. <article-title>Clinical practice guidelines for vascular access</article-title>. <source>Am J Kidney Dis</source> (<year>2006</year>) <volume>48</volume>(<issue>Suppl 1</issue>):<fpage>S176</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>247</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1053/j.ajkd.2006.04.029</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16813989</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Meria</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Cussenot</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><name><surname>Stolba</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Raynaud</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Bourquelot</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group>
