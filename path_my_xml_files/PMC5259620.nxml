This is compounded by the difficulty in detecting signs in paraparetic dogs. As such, prior reports can be interpreted as describing bacteriuria. However, given the higher risk of bacteriuria and its potential to cause UTI in the period after surgery for TL&#x02010;IVDH, use of an effective preventative treatment during this period could be beneficial. Historically, cranberries are widely used to improve the health of the lower urinary tract in humans.<xref rid="jvim14613-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14613-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14613-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> They contain a mixture of organic acids as well as fructose and glucose and phytochemicals such as proanthocyanidins (PACs).<xref rid="jvim14613-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14613-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> In vitro<italic>,</italic> A&#x02010;type PACs inhibit the adhesion of type I and P&#x02010;fimbriated uropathogenic bacteria, in particular <italic>Escherichia coli (E. coli)</italic>, to uroepithelial cells reducing the risk of UTIs.<xref rid="jvim14613-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14613-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>
</p><p>There are numerous clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of cranberry juice and extract in humans with different causes of recurrent UTI. The results of these trials often appear contradictory, reflecting the use of a wide range of different cranberry products and the evaluation in different clinical scenarios. Recent meta&#x02010;analyses conclude that there is no statistical evidence that cranberry extract reduces the recurrence of UTIs across different populations,<xref rid="jvim14613-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> with the exception of young women with recurrent UTIs.<xref rid="jvim14613-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> There are several studies in humans with spinal cord injury, also with conflicting results.<xref rid="jvim14613-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14613-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14613-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14613-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> However, it is difficult to extrapolate these findings to dogs recovering from SCI, because these studies were performed in permanently paralyzed patients with no voluntary voiding. We hypothesized that oral cranberry extract would reduce the frequency of bacteriuria in the 6&#x02010;week postoperative period after surgery for acute TL&#x02010;IVDH. The aim of this randomized, double&#x02010;blinded, placebo&#x02010;controlled clinical trial was to evaluate the effect of a product containing cranberry&#x02010;derived PACs on the frequency of bacteriuria, and <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteriuria in dogs recovering from acute TL&#x02010;IVDH.</p></sec><sec id="jvim14613-sec-0008"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="jvim14613-sec-0009"><title>Study Design</title><p>This study was a prospective, randomized, double&#x02010;blinded, placebo&#x02010;controlled multicenter clinical trial performed in dogs with acute TL&#x02010;IVDH. The study was designed and reported according to the CONSORT guidelines.<xref rid="jvim14613-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> All protocols were reviewed and approved by the NCSU Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee (protocol number: 11&#x02010;009&#x02010;O). Previously reported data on the frequency of bacteriuria in this population of dogs<xref rid="jvim14613-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> were used to calculate the group size for this 2 arm trial with an online power estimator.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim14613-note-1004">a</xref> An estimate of the size of anticipated treatment effect was based on human clinical trials in which cranberry extract reduced the incidence of UTIs in women by approximately 50% when compared with placebo or lactobacillus.<xref rid="jvim14613-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref> Fifty&#x02010;two animals would be needed to produce a 50% reduction in bacteriuria with an 80% power and a 5% significance level; increasing the number of animals to 75 per treatment arm would increase power to 91.3%, allow detection of a smaller therapeutic effect, and allow for case attrition. The study aimed to recruit 75 animals per treatment group. The primary outcome measure was the total number of urine samples with bacteriuria that reached specific thresholds in terms of numbers of colony&#x02010;forming units (CFU) recorded over a 6&#x02010;week period; the number of <italic>E. coli</italic> positive cultures was defined as the secondary outcome measure.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were acute onset (less than 2 days) of nonambulatory paraparesis or paraplegia due to an acute TL&#x02010;IVDH, surgical decompression, and ability to return for rechecks at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after surgery. Dogs with an active urine sediment on urinalysis (defined as &#x0003e;5 wbc/high power field (HPF) &#x000b1; bacteriuria) that could indicate bacteriuria at time of presentation, a history of recurrent UTIs (more than 2 a year), or a disease or disease treatment that can predispose to bacteriuria (diabetes mellitus, hyperadrenocorticism, immunosuppression) were excluded.</p><p>Three centers recruited cases to the trial from April 2011 to October 2013. Owners of dogs that met the inclusion criteria were informed of the trial at time of or the day after surgery by a study coordinator in each center, and participating owners signed an informed consent. A urinalysis was performed to exclude dogs with evidence of bacteriuria at admission based on the presence of an active urine sediment (as defined above). Urine cultures were not used to exclude dogs at onset of the trial because treatment was initiated at the 48&#x02010;hour postoperative time point. Once entered into the trial, dogs were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups in a 1 : 1 ratio by the NC State Veterinary Hospital pharmacy. The randomization sequence was determined for each center with a random number generator.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim14613-note-1005">b</xref> Oral administration of either cranberry extract<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim14613-note-1006">c</xref> or placebo was started 48 hours after presentation and continued daily for 6 weeks using the manufacturer's dose rate (Table <xref rid="jvim14613-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap">1</xref>). The cranberry extract and placebo tablets were compounded by the manufacturer to look identical and were supplied to the NC State Veterinary Hospital pharmacy in matching containers labeled A or B. The pharmacists, investigators, and owners were blinded to group identity. Dogs&#x02019; routine postoperative management was determined by the attending clinician. While in the hospital, inability to urinate was managed by manual bladder expression when possible, aided by the addition of oral diazepam (0.25&#x02013;0.5 mg/kg po q8h) and phenoxybenzamine (0.5 mg/kg po q12h) at the discretion of the attending clinician. If manual expression was not possible, intermittent sterile catheterization was performed; an indwelling catheter was placed in female dogs. Dogs were discharged to their owners when their postoperative pain was adequately controlled and they could urinate on their own, or their owners were able to manually express them.</p><table-wrap id="jvim14613-tbl-0001" xml:lang="en" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Dose rate of cranberry extract based on weight.

Freshly drawn HRBCs (A1, Rh positive) were suspended in PBS, and 10 &#x003bc;L were added to the urine test suspensions. These were incubated for a further 20 minutes at room temperature on a rotary shaker and then evaluated with microscopy. Antiadhesion activity was scored based on a visual estimate of percent agglutination with 0 = no AAA; 1 = 50% AAA (interpreted as moderate urine AAA); 1.5 = 75% AAA; 2 = 100% AAA (interpreted as significant urine AAA). Antiadhesion assays were repeated 4 times per sample, and the results were averaged. Controls included wells containing bacteria and PBS, HRBCs and PBS, bacteria and test material, HRBC and test material, and bacteria and HRBC. The group identity was masked from the laboratory performing the testing. Based on the presence of AAA in the urine of dogs in the placebo group, urine was sampled from 30 additional dogs that presented to the NC State Neurology Service with acute onset of myelopathy. Wherever possible, up to 3 samples were taken over a period of 1 month with a minimum of 1 day between sampling. The samples were assayed for AAA by the Rutgers University Blueberry and Cranberry Research Center as described above.</p><p>As a quality control measure, the identity of the placebo and cranberry extract tablets was investigated using the AAA assay. Twenty bottles of placebo (10) and cranberry extract (10) from 2 separate centers (half from each center) were sent to the Rutgers Laboratory. As for the urine testing, the testing center was blinded to the identity (placebo vs cranberry extract) of the tablets. Tablets from each bottle were suspended at a concentration of 60 mg/mL in phosphate&#x02010;buffered saline, neutralized with 1 M sodium hydroxide, and diluted 2&#x02010;fold before using the same hemagglutination inhibition assay as was used for the urine samples, but the results were expressed as MIC value (in mg/mL).</p></sec><sec id="jvim14613-sec-0011"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was to be performed when 150 cases had been enrolled and completed the protocol or at the end of the enrollment period, whichever was sooner.

In the remaining 16 dogs with 20 positive cultures, 3 of the cultures were the same organism as the previous culture, the owners having failed to start the antibiotics or started them just before the follow&#x02010;up culture. One of the dogs had a positive culture at 2 and 6 weeks, but was negative at 4 weeks. This dog was classified as having 2 positive cultures; thus, 16 dogs were classified as having 17 positive cultures (Data S2). This gave an overall frequency of bacteriuria in this group of 94 dogs of 18.09% and a frequency of dogs with bacteriuria of 17.02%. Nine positive cultures occurred at the 2&#x02010;week evaluation, 3 at 4 weeks, and 5 at 6 weeks.

Fourteen of 21 dogs (67%) in the placebo group had activity (4 with a score of 1 and 7 with a score of 2) and 7 did not. Of the dogs with 2 samples evaluated, 3 of the 4 dogs in each group were positive on both samples, and 1 was negative on one and positive on the other.

Twenty&#x02010;eight of the dogs presented for surgery for acute TL&#x02010;IVDH, 2 for chronic TL&#x02010;IVDH, and 1 for cervical stenotic myelopathy. Their mean age was 5.3 years (SD: 2.45) with 15 FS, 13 MC, and 2 M. A total of 71 samples were taken, 19 dogs were sampled twice, and the remaining 11 dogs were sampled 3 times. Fifteen of these samples showed positive AAA in 9 dogs; thus, 30% of dogs tested positive for AAA at least once. Of these 9 dogs, 3 had 2 urine samples tested and 6 had 3 urine samples tested. Four dogs were positive in all the samples (2 dogs had 2 samples and 2 dogs had 3 samples), 4 were positive in 1 of 3 samples, and 1 was positive in 1 of 2 samples.</p><p>None of the placebo tablets showed any AAA, and all the cranberry extract tablets had 0.23&#x02010;0.47 mg/mL AAA thus confirming the correct identity of the tablets and appropriate AAA in the cranberry extract tablets.</p></sec></sec><sec id="jvim14613-sec-0017"><title>Discussion</title><p>This placebo&#x02010;controlled, randomized, prospective clinical trial failed to show a reduction in the risk of bacteriuria or <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteriuria in dogs receiving oral cranberry extract in the 6 weeks after decompressive surgery for TL&#x02010;IVDH. While the planned number of cases was not recruited in the designated recruitment period, reducing study power, a conditional power analysis demonstrated the low likelihood of detecting a significant difference between groups if all cases were recruited and the study was terminated. Secondary analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in the number of <italic>E. coli</italic> positive cultures in dogs with at least 1 positive test for urine AAA independent of treatment group. However, this analysis involved only a subset of dogs and this exploratory dataset should be interpreted with caution. We also demonstrated that over 60% of the dogs tested in both the placebo and cranberry extract groups had detectable urine AAA. A reevaluation of the placebo and cranberry extract tablets with blinded external testing confirmed their identity was correct. An additional group of 30 dogs from a similar demographic was tested for urine AAA; 30% had detectable activity in at least 1 sample.</p><p>This study reported the frequency of bacteriuria in the 6&#x02010;week period after surgery for acute TL&#x02010;IVDH. During this critical period, dogs are recovering neurological function and can experience suboptimal urine voiding, putting them at increased risk of persistent bacteriuria and possibly UTI. The definition of an active UTI has evolved over time to include the presence of clinical signs (stranguria, pollakiuria, incontinence). However, clinical signs of a UTI might not be evident in dogs with myelopathy due to inability to void and changes in bladder sensation; requiring the presence of clinical signs could introduce unwanted variability in interpretation. In addition, while owners were given questionnaires at each recheck to document signs of a UTI at home, their return rate was poor. Cytological analysis of the urine was performed if there was adequate urine, but urine culture took precedence if urine volume was limited. As a result of these factors, we reported the presence of bacteriuria based on the number of bacterial colonies in culture only using the same thresholds as reported in a prior study (data from which were used for purposes of study design).</p><p>The overall frequency of bacteriuria at 18% was lower than a previous study in which 38% of dogs developed bacteriuria during this period.<xref rid="jvim14613-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> This decreased frequency impacted the original study design, thus reducing the power of the planned study. Potential explanations for the lower rate include a slightly less severe mean grade of injury, and stringent exclusion of dogs that have other risk factors for developing a UTI. The other factor that influenced study power was the failure to recruit 150 cases as originally planned. Power analyses performed during design of the clinical trial demonstrated 52 dogs per treatment arm would achieve a study with 80% power, while increasing to 75 dogs would result in a study with a power of 91%. By the end of the recruitment period, we had recruited 117 dogs, reaching the number required for a study with an 80% power but not the planned 91% power. However, attrition for a variety of reasons resulted in data suitable for analysis in only 94 dogs. It is standard practice to perform interim analyses during a clinical trial with the aim of identifying positive or negative outcomes as soon as possible. If there is no evidence of treatment trend, a conditional analysis should be performed using the data collected.<xref rid="jvim14613-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14613-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref> This analysis gives an estimate for the likelihood of observing a statistically significant difference when the planned statistical analysis is performed with the data collected thus far. This analysis revealed that there was a 0.6% chance of detecting a significant result if all dogs were recruited, supporting the decision to terminate the study.</p><p>The biggest risk factor for developing bacteriuria in this study was being female. This is consistent with the findings of other studies<xref rid="jvim14613-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref> and relates to the anatomy of the female lower urinary tract. In addition, as demonstrated previously, inability to urinate voluntarily was also a risk factor.<xref rid="jvim14613-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> The influence of catheterization was also considered in this study but did not increase the risk of developing bacteriuria. Catheterization was intermittent and of short duration during initial hospitalization only, and as such, was considered unlikely to influence bacteriuria frequency at the 2&#x02010;, 4&#x02010;, and 6&#x02010;week time points evaluated in this study.</p><p>The results of this trial did not indicate a reduction in the overall or <italic>E. coli</italic>&#x02010;specific bacteriuria rate in treated dogs even though <italic>E. coli</italic> was the most common finding in positive cultures, accounting for 41% of the infections. Proanthocyanidins found in cranberry extract have been shown to reduce <italic>E. coli</italic> infections, in particular P&#x02010;fimbriated <italic>E. coli,</italic> by inhibiting adhesion to uroepithelial cells, a critical step in the generation of a UTI.<xref rid="jvim14613-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref> Many cranberry products are available, varying from purified PACs to cranberry extract to cranberry juice, and some cranberry products might actually be devoid of PACs.<xref rid="jvim14613-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> For this trial, we selected a product that provided purified PACs at a dose rate established by the manufacturer based on testing in normal dogs, and quality controlled in terms of quantification of AAA. The hemagglutination inhibition test used to measure urine and tablet AAA is validated as a means of detecting <italic>E. coli</italic> adhesion to human red blood cells and provides a surrogate marker of prevention of bacterial adhesion to uroepithelial cells.<xref rid="jvim14613-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> While not routinely used in human clinical trials, it has been shown to be of benefit in assessing dosing of products containing PACs in both humans and dogs.<xref rid="jvim14613-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14613-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref> However, there is a paucity of data available for dogs, and the relevance of this test in dogs remains to be confirmed. In spite of confirmation of the AAA or lack thereof in batches of tablets used in the trial, there was no difference in urine AAA between treated and untreated dogs and this might account for the lack of treatment effect. The failure to demonstrate efficacy could also be related to other limitations including lack of full study power due to failure to recruit all 150 dogs, and lower bacteriuria frequency when compared to the population used to design the trial. However, the data generated in this trial do not demonstrate any trend toward a therapeutic effect; indeed, there were 6 <italic>E.coli</italic>&#x02010;positive cultures in the cranberry extract group compared to 1 in the placebo group.</p><p>Potential reasons for the lack in difference of urine AAA between the groups include client noncompliance, inappropriate dose rate, and poor bioavailability. Indeed, noncompliance is cited as the most important cause of failure of human clinical trials due to the palatability and volume of products that need to be consumed.<xref rid="jvim14613-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> Owners reported that their dogs consumed the tablets, and they obtained refills at the appropriate time, but it is difficult to confirm this vital step when performed at home. Dosing of PACs is important in humans, and the recommended dose of 36 mg of PACs per person per day has recently been shown to be inadequate at achieving protective levels of AAA in the urine.<xref rid="jvim14613-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> Moreover, while once daily dosing has been used traditionally, twice daily dosing achieves nyctohemeral protection, especially important when considering that urine voiding is critical to expulsion of bacteria and does not occur overnight.<xref rid="jvim14613-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref> The dogs in this study were dosed once daily according to the manufacturer's instructions which were based on demonstration of altered AAA in dogs&#x02019; urine after dosing,<xref rid="jvim14613-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref> but it is possible that dose rates, frequency, and timing might need to be optimized for specific groups of dogs.</p><p>We performed a secondary analysis to explore the possible relationship between urine AAA and <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteriuria rate independent of treatment group. We discovered a significant reduction of <italic>E coli</italic> positive cultures in dogs with at least 1 positive urine AAA test. Urine was not evaluated in every dog, decreasing the strength of conclusions we can draw, but this exploratory finding is intriguing and further evaluation of this possible therapeutic effect is needed.</p><p>In the current study, over 60% of dogs getting placebo had urine AAA on at least 1 measurement. This high rate led us to confirm the AAA activity in blinded samples of tablets from both treatment arms and to investigate a similar population of dogs after the trial. The number of dogs with AAA in this control population was lower at 30% but still surprisingly high. Humans have been reported to have AAA as a result of production of endogenous inhibitors such as uromodulin (Tamm&#x02010;Horsfall glycoprotein).<xref rid="jvim14613-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> Diet has been recognized to have an influence, potentially explaining different rates in different populations,<xref rid="jvim14613-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> and genetic factors also play a role.<xref rid="jvim14613-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref> Urine AAA is also affected by parameters such as urine specific gravity, salt content of diet, and time of day,<xref rid="jvim14613-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> and these results raise many questions about urine AAA and the validity of this assay in dogs. Further examination of the source of urine AAA was beyond the remit of this trial, but reveals an important area of future research as there are no other reports published on canine urine AAA at this time.</p></sec><sec id="jvim14613-sec-0018"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We evaluated a population of dogs prone to bacteriuria and sometimes UTI to evaluate the effects of cranberry extract. Finding an inexpensive and low&#x02010;risk strategy to reduce the risk of <italic>E. coli</italic> UTI in groups of dogs with recurrent UTIs would be of benefit. This clinical trial failed to show a benefit in the population evaluated. However, given the association identified between <italic>E. coli</italic> positive cultures and urine AAA, further examination of the optimal dose rate, frequency, and timing of PACs in dogs is indicated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="jvim14613-sup-0001"><caption><p>
