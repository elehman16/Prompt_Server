TB has long been recognised as an illness inextricably linked with social deprivation and marginalisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Poverty predisposes individuals to TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and hidden costs associated with even free TB treatment can be catastrophic: exacerbating poverty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], leading to adverse TB treatment outcome, increasing TB transmission and potentially worsening TB control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Nevertheless, the global model for TB prevention, management and research has been principally focused on biomedical rather than socioeconomic approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. There is a pressing need to expand the traditional TB control paradigm based on case finding and treatment in order to embrace more holistic approaches that encompass the wellbeing of people and households living with TB and communities affected by TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This vision has been formally acknowledged in the World Health Organisation&#x02019;s (WHO) post-2015 global End TB Strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] which, for the first time in the modern era of TB control, explicitly identifies poverty reduction strategies, including universal health coverage and social protection, as key pillars of the future global response to TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Social protection consists of policies and programs designed to reduce poverty and vulnerability by improving people&#x02019;s capacity to manage social and/or economic risks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and includes health insurance, food assistance, travel vouchers and cash transfers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Cash transfers generally provide economic support to impoverished people with the aim of moving them out of extreme poverty and vulnerability whilst improving human capital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Cash transfers are already used to modulate behaviour in HIV/AIDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and improve maternal health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Mitigating poverty-related TB risk factors of TB-affected households using cash transfers may be a cost-effective investment from a societal perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] because it may support TB treatment, improve TB prevention and cure, and potentially enhance TB control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, there is little operational evidence to guide implementation or evaluate the impact of TB-related socioeconomic support including cash transfer interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p>For over a decade, our research group (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ifhad.org">www.ifhad.org</ext-link>) has worked with TB-affected households in the shantytowns of Callao, Peru. From 2007 to 2011, we conducted an assessment of Innovative Socioeconomic Interventions Against TB (ISIAT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The interventions had two dimensions: i) education, community mobilization and psychosocial support to increase uptake of TB care; and ii) food transfers, microcredit, microenterprise and vocational training to reduce poverty. This intervention increased preventive chemotherapy in household contacts and HIV testing and TB treatment completion in TB patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>Building on the lessons learnt during the ISIAT project, we designed a larger 6-year research project called CRESIPT: a &#x0201c;Community Randomized Evaluation of a Socioeconomic Intervention to Prevent TB&#x0201d; to test for impact on TB control. This paper aims to describe the challenges of implementation, lessons learnt and refinement of this complex socioeconomic intervention to control TB. The paper focuses on set up of a TB-specific cash transfer scheme, and thus aims to provide research groups, NGOs, civil-society representatives, policy-makers, stake-holders and the wider TB community with an interim guidance document concerning the operational logistics of TB-adapted socioeconomic interventions involving cash transfers in resource-constrained settings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Intervention objectives</title><p>The CRESIPT project aims to evaluate a socioeconomic intervention to support prevention and cure of TB in TB-affected households and, ultimately, improve community TB control. The CRESIPT socioeconomic intervention was developed over 7 months in two contiguous suburbs of Peru&#x02019;s capital, Lima: Ventanilla, 15 peri-urban shantytown communities in which our research group has been recruiting patients to an on-going cohort study for over a decade; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and Callao, an area including 17 impoverished urban communities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Intervention planning</title><p>The CRESIPT project was informed by our previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], extensive expert consultation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and a systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] of cash transfer interventions published in 2011.</p><p>We built upon an <italic>a priori</italic> conceptual framework reflecting the postulated pathways through which the intervention could lead to improved TB control in the study site (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Thus, our intervention targeted defined outcomes along the TB causal pathway. In TB patients, we aimed to improve early diagnosis and treatment, provide support to increase adherence to and completion of treatment, and achieve sustained cured.

During treatment, vouchers (15 US Dollars) that could be exchanged for foodstuffs were given to patients by local health post nursing staff. The authors opted for vouchers over cash due to: posing a lower security risk; not being able to be spent on unhealthy items such as alcohol or cigarettes; being easy to monitor; and &#x0201c;public health sector clinics would not have bank accounts, making electronic transfers difficult&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]</td><td>&#x02022; Based on our experiences and the limited published evidence, we opted for a bank cash transfer scheme.

While the new bank-provider overcame the challenges described above, these experiences have led us to question whether banks are the most appropriate delivery strategy. Indeed, conditional cash transfer programs in Sub-Saharan Africa have predominantly used specified pay points to pay participants in cash rather than banks which may be less accessible to the poor and may have user fees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. However, banks have been the favoured partner agent in existing conditional cash transfer programs in Peru (JUNTOS), Brasil (Bolsa Familia) and Mexico (Progresa) with the co-ordination of national cash transfer programs being centralised through national banks in these countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. This level of coordination may only be suitable in countries with comparatively developed financial infrastructure, information and communications technologies, and accessibility to bank branches or micro-agencies. We have reviewed other modalities of conditional cash transfers in greater detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Future research into implementation of socioeconomic interventions may compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of cash delivery mechanisms including mobile phone vouchers, mobile banking, automated or other pay points, or innovative strategies, for which rigorous evidence is currently lacking. To achieve optimal impact, implementers of conditional cash transfer programs may work more closely with the local communities and civil societies to establish how a program can be adapted to be appropriate and acceptable in that specific setting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Cash transfer size</title><p>During focus group discussions, the internal research committee debated what the most important objective of cash transfers is: mitigating TB-related costs; avoiding catastrophic costs; or reducing poverty-related TB risk factors. This confounded deciding the cash transfer amounts. To address this challenge, we analysed TB patients&#x02019; costs, which demonstrated that direct out-of-pocket expenditure was 10 % of that household&#x02019;s annual income [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These results, together with additional data characterising annual household income for TB-affected households in the study site, informed the cash transfer amount necessary to match direct out-of-pocket expenditure and subsequently avoid catastrophic costs. The optimal cash transfer size is likely to depend on the intervention setting and proposed outcomes of the intervention. This will require baseline evaluation of local TB-related costs prior to planning for and implementing cash transfers of suitable amounts. Further research is required to evaluate how cash transfer size affects intervention impact and cost-effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. It is noteworthy that the strategy we adopted in this research was a &#x0201c;costs-mitigation&#x0201d; rather than a &#x0201c;poverty-reduction&#x0201d; strategy and involved a cash transfer amount that were appropriate and feasible for the local setting. While long-term poverty reduction would be an appealing additional goal, this would likely require greater socioeconomic support than national TB programs could afford.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Cash transfer timing</title><p>During focus group discussions, the delay between incentivized behaviour and cash transfers was noted as a barrier to achieving project conditions due to the lack of a tangible &#x0201c;reward&#x0201d; and accompanying positive reinforcement loop. For example, when a household attended a participatory community meeting, it could be 1 to 2 weeks before they received the corresponding cash transfer.<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;Patients want immediate and tangible gratification on the same day as they complete their condition&#x0201d;</italic> [Ex-TB Patient Civil Society Representative].</p></disp-quote></p><p>Cash transfers were initially delayed due to the flow of information from the field, to the research office, to the bank. While cash transfer flow improved during the project, patients and households stated that such delays made household budgeting difficult:<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;Due to the initial cash transfer delays, some patients didn&#x02019;t get the money when they most needed it&#x0201d;</italic> [CRESIPT Project Nurse].</p></disp-quote></p><p>Consequently, we increased the speed of the cash transfers and plan to instigate a system during CRESIPT in which on the <italic>same</italic> day that a household attends a community meeting, they receive a small high-protein food basket and a high-quality certificate-like voucher detailing the amount and date by which the cash transfer would be made.</p><p>Participants reported that they would prefer to receive cash transfers at the beginning of the month for their adherence in the subsequent month rather than wait until the end of the month. As has been reported in other settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], the waiting was perceived as financially stressful and, on occasion, demoralising. Learning from this setting-specific qualitative feedback, in the planned CRESIPT study in these same communities, we will combine unconditional monthly cash transfer provided to all TB patients taking treatment with supplementary conditional cash transfers for meeting CRESIPT&#x000a0;project and National TB Program conditions. Furthermore, we have self-imposed penalties on our project if incentives do not reach the patient&#x02019;s bank account within 1 week of confirmation that the condition has been met. Specifically, if a delay occurs, their cash transfer is doubled.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Cash transfer conditions, levels and responsiveness</title><p>Project conditions requiring involvement of &#x0201c;100 %&#x0201d; of the TB-affected household in order to receive the cash transfer (e.g. attendance at participatory community meetings) were hard to achieve. In addition, the amount of these cash transfers was fixed and independent of household size (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) and thus felt to be inequitable because larger households received a lower cash transfer amount per household member. There was, therefore, a perceived challenge in balancing operational simplicity (e.g. fixed-amount incentives) while responding to patient household needs (e.g. variable incentive depending on household size). Consequently, on the basis of this qualitative evaluation of the implementation process, we suggest designing relevant incentives to be more equitable and responsive to household size: a fixed amount added to the patient&#x02019;s cash transfer for <italic>each member</italic> of their household on completion of the condition. In this way, larger households will receive the same amount per household member as smaller households.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A novel TB-specific socioeconomic intervention was: designed through multi-sectoral collaboration coupled with evidence from a systematic review; refined to meet patient and household needs&#x000a0;during implementation through community participation, engagement and acceptability feedback; and proved to be feasible in an impoverished, challenging environment. The intervention is now ready for impact assessment, including by the CRESIPT project. Further lessons from CRESIPT will aim to assist TB control programs to effectively implement the recent global policy change of including socioeconomic support as part of TB control activities.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec30"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12889_2015_2128_MOESM1_ESM.zip" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Figure S1a.</label><caption><p>Details of the operational conditions to meet in order to receive double incentives. b: Details of the operational conditions to meet in order to receive simple incentives.
