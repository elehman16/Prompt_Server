A total of 10, otherwise generally healthy, insulin-requiring type 1 diabetic patients between 18 and 60 years of age, without any other known or suspected health conditions, received autologous dendritic cells, unmanipulated or engineered ex vivo toward an immunosuppressive state. Ten million cells were administered intradermally in the abdomen once every 2 weeks for a total of four administrations.

Thymic and peripheral tolerance failure (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) involves dendritic cells, which are as important in diabetes onset and progression as pathogenic T cells (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In general, dendritic cells coordinate immune responses to microenvironmental anomalies (i.e., infection and tissue damage) and orchestrate tolerance to self (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Many animal studies confirm that exogenous dendritic cell administration prevents autoimmunity and facilitates allograft survival (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Such dendritic cells often are phenotypically and functionally immature and are largely defined by impaired T-cell costimulation ability. Without costimulation, T cells, including autoreactive cells, either enter into a state of functional impairment (anergy) or undergo apoptosis. Immature dendritic cells also modulate networks of suppressive immune cells, such as T cells expressing the Foxp3 transcription factor.</p><p>Our preclinical data in the NOD mouse strain demonstrating prevention and reversal of type 1 diabetes with costimulation-impaired, immunosuppressive dendritic cells (bone marrow&#x02013;derived dendritic cells treated ex vivo with a mixture of antisense oligonucleotides targeting the primary transcripts of CD40, CD80, and CD86) (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) compelled us to determine the safety of, and possible immune reactions against, such dendritic cells in humans. We therefore generated human dendritic cells analogous to the ones successfully used in those NOD studies (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), concurrently targeting the expression of the same costimulatory molecules ex vivo, envisaging type 1 diabetes cell therapy. We hypothesized that immunosuppressive dendritic cells would primarily be safe and well tolerated and, secondarily, could alter the frequency of immune cell populations potentially beneficial in type 1 diabetes.</p><sec id="s5"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>This phase I study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier NCT00445913) was conducted at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Clinical Translational Research Center after review and approval by the Food and Drug Administration, the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board, and the Data Safety Monitoring Board and after written informed consent was obtained from each patient.

This analysis concluded that in a total sample size of 10 patients, the occurrence of an adverse event in 2 patients would give a 75% probability, and the occurrence of an adverse event in 3 patients would give a 90% probability of hitting the boundary where the boundary is defined as trial suspension (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Thus, 10 patients who met all inclusion and exclusion criteria (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-0472/-/DC1">Supplementary Methods Table T1</ext-link>) were enrolled. Peripheral blood was obtained to measure baseline levels of immune cell populations, immune-reactivity indices, serum immune biomarkers, and autoantibodies, as well as for biochemistry and hematology evaluation. Urine was collected to determine kidney function. Enrolled patients were randomly assigned in a 2-to-1 ratio of immunosuppressive dendritic cells to control dendritic cells. Control dendritic cells and immunosuppressive dendritic cells were generated ex vivo from leukapheresis products. The methods for generating control and immunosuppressive dendritic cells are available in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-0472/-/DC1">Supplementary Methods</ext-link>.

Participants and research staff were blinded to the type of dendritic cell product administered.</p><p>Each patient received 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> dendritic cells once every 2 weeks for a total of four administrations. For each administration, four aliquots of cells were intradermally injected; each aliquot into one of the vertices of a rectangular quadrant of 3&#x02013;4 square inches overlying the anterior abdominal wall perpendicularly above the physical location of the stomach and pancreas. After thawing, the cells were slowly delivered by a tuberculin syringe attached to a 27-g 1/2 needle underneath a raised &#x0201c;bleb&#x0201d; of skin at each of the four individual injection sites. Patients were then monitored by the physician for at least 2 h for evidence of local or systemic allergic reaction; inflammation at the injection sites; of any grade &#x02265;2 toxicity or hypersensitivity, including chills, malaise, fever, shortness of breath, palor, or light headedness; or any subjective report of discomfort. Patients maintained their insulin-administration regimen throughout the study, with the objective of maintaining glycated hemoglobin levels within the age-specified range according to the American Diabetes Association guidelines (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In the intervening weeks between administrations, patients continued to be evaluated (physical, biochemical, hematologic, and immune monitoring) to identify possible adverse events. This evaluation was then conducted twice monthly for the first 6 months after the first dendritic cell administration and then once monthly for the remainder of the study period (6 months).</p><sec id="s6"><title>Safety evaluations</title><p>Patients were observed for treatment-related toxicity or adverse reactions during and after each course of dendritic cell administration.

Altogether, these data indicate that control and immunosuppressive dendritic cells do not induce nonspecific systemic immunosuppression.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s12"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>To date, all known dendritic cell clinical trials aimed at boosting immunity. Despite the convincing evidence supporting dendritic cell&#x02013;based prevention or reversal of autoimmunity and in facilitating allograft survival (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), no human trials have ever been conducted to determine immunosuppressive dendritic cell safety and potential benefits. Herein, we report, for the first time, that multiple intradermal injections of autologous dendritic cells, untreated or stabilized ex vivo toward an immunoregulatory tolerogenic state into an abdominal region overlying the anatomical location of the pancreas, are well tolerated and safe in adult type 1 diabetic patients with established disease longer than 5 years. There were no observable adverse events or toxicities.</p><p>Dendritic cells are strong T-cell modulators, and control and/or immunosuppressive dendritic cell administration could potentially cause general T-cell activation (with or without proliferation). By measuring the frequency of CD69+ T cells at key trial time points, we concluded that neither control nor immunosuppressive dendritic cells induced any changes in CD69+ T-cell frequency compared with baseline (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). This observation is in line with the tolerogenic nature of immature dendritic cells, which, on their own, do not activate T cells. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that T cells underwent unmeasurable differentiation activity not involving activation, per se.</p><p>Next, we probed the possibility that control or immunosuppressive dendritic cells could affect the frequency of naive antigen-inexperienced T cells (CD45RA+ T cells), which, if activated to proliferate, could induce diabetes-unrelated autoimmunities. The frequency of CD4+ CD45RA+ and CD8+ CD45RA+ T cells was statistically indistinguishable at all trial time points compared with baseline, between and within control and immunosuppressive dendritic cell recipients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>), indicating that this possibility was unlikely.</p><p>Administration of immature dendritic cells in vivo increases the prevalence of Foxp3+ T-regulatory cells (Tregs), and these cells partially mediate the beneficial effects of immunoregulatory dendritic cells (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). We observed a slight increase in CD4+ CD25<sup>HIGH</sup> Foxp3+ T cells in immunosuppressive dendritic cell recipients compared with control dendritic cell recipients, mainly during the dendritic cell administration period (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-0472/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 6</ext-link>). The differences, however, between immunosuppressive and control dendritic cell recipients as well as the difference between before and after dendritic cell injections, with the exception of three patients (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-0472/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 6</ext-link>), were not statistically relevant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>We noted an increased frequency of PBMC B220+ CD11c&#x02212; lymphocytes of all dendritic cell recipients as early as 1 week after dendritic cell administration. On average, this cell population comprises between 1.0 and 3.3% of the total PBMCs in normal individuals (data not shown). In four of seven immunosuppressive dendritic cell&#x02013;treated patients, the increases were substantial during the dendritic cell administration period compared with baseline. These differences were statistically relevant only during the first 6 weeks after the first round of immunosuppressive dendritic cell administration (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; one-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-0472/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 2</ext-link>). Although there were no statistically distinguishable differences in B220+ CD11c&#x02212; cell frequency at any time during the trial between immunosuppressive dendritic cell and control dendritic cell recipients (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05, two-tailed Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test), further characterization and in vitro functional assays suggest that this population contains at least one novel suppressive subpopulation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-0472/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 3<italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></ext-link>). A number of studies confirm the existence of immunosuppressive B cells referred to as B-regulatory cells (Bregs) (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In murine models of inflammation and autoimmunity, including collagen-induced arthritis, colitis, lupus, and type 1 diabetes, exogenously administered Bregs suppress disease (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Possible roles of Bregs in human autoimmunity recently have been identified (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Our putative Bregs do not seem to be like the recently described B10 and CD24<sup>HIGH</sup> CD38<sup>HIGH</sup> Bregs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-0472/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 7</ext-link>), even though CD24 and CD27, characteristic of the recently described human B10 Bregs, were expressed strongly on the surface of the parental B220+ CD11c&#x02212; cells (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). This does not exclude the possibility that our Bregs could in fact be a heterogeneous population consisting of memory and transitional B cells in different states of activation. That even untreated dendritic cells upregulate potentially beneficial B cells in humans is not surprising in light of analogous observations of B-cell upregulation in pioneering diabetes prevention studies with pancreatic immature dendritic cells in NOD mice (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). It would be of significant interest to determine whether type 1 diabetic patients and high-risk relatives exhibit perturbations in one or more Breg populations. We currently are exploring this possibility.</p><p>Autoantibodies often reflect an underlying autoimmunity and are an appropriate biomarker of de novo autoimmunity. One concern of our trial was the potential to induce de novo autoimmunity, especially thyroid-specific autoimmunity, which has been shown in some populations to cosegregate with type 1 diabetes. We did not observe any antinuclear antibodies or any de novo thyroid-specific autoantibodies arguing against the possibility that control or immunosuppressive dendritic cell administration could provoke a generalized autoimmunity or a potential type 1 diabetes cosegregating secondary autoimmunity.</p><p>All dendritic cell recipients exhibited normal immune responses to vaccination antigens and alloantigen stimulation in vitro, indicating that control and immunosuppressive dendritic cells do not induce any measurable level of systemic immunosuppression. In light of the outcome of this study, we believe, like others, that the widely reported adverse events, including elevated proinflammatory cytokines, fever, chills, and general malaise, associated with immunostimulatory dendritic cell immunotherapy are attributed to the normally adopted priming of the patients with cytokines such as IL-2 and granulocyte macrophage&#x02013;colony-stimulating factor (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p><p>Our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that nonmanipulated autologous dendritic cells, or autologous dendritic cells directed ex vivo toward a costimulation-impaired immunologically suppressive state, are well tolerated and safe. Our observations herein also portend beneficial outcomes when considering tolerogenic dendritic cell intervention in autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes at a time closer to the clinical onset of the disease.</p></sec>
