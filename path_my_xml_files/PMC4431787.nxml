Organoleptic stability of n-3 fortified, shelf-stable foods has been demonstrated, but chemical changes in the food matrix throughout storage could conceivably impact digestibility of the protein-based encapsulant thereby compromising n-3 bioavailability. We assessed the effect of prolonged high-temperature storage and variations in food matrix (proteinaceous or carbohydrate) on the time course and magnitude of blood fatty acids changes associated with ingestion of n-3 fortified foods. Low-protein (i.e., cake) and high-protein (i.e., meat sticks) items were supplemented with 600&#x000a0;mg encapsulated DHA+EPA, and frozen either immediately after production (FRESH) or after 6&#x000a0;months storage at 100&#x000b0;F (STORED). Fourteen volunteers consumed one item per week (randomized) for 4&#x000a0;weeks. Blood samples obtained at baseline, 2, 4, and 6&#x000a0;h post-consumption were analyzed for circulating long-chain omega 3 fatty acids (LCn3). There was no difference in LCn3 area under the curve between items. LCn3 in response to cakes peaked at 2-h (FRESH: 54.0&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;16.8&#x000a0;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL, +18%; STORED: 53.0&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;13.2&#x000a0;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL, +20%), while meats peaked at 4-h (FRESH: 51.9&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;12.5&#x000a0;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL, +22%; STORED: 53.2&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;16.9&#x000a0;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL, +18%). There were no appreciable differences in time course or magnitude of n-3 appearance in response to storage conditions for either food types. Thus, bioavailability of encapsulated DHA/EPA, within low- and high-protein food items, was not affected by high-temperature shelf-storage. A shelf-stable, low- or high-protein food item with encapsulated DHA/EPA is suitable for use in shelf-stable foods.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Absorption</kwd><kwd>encapsulation</kwd><kwd>fatty acids</kwd><kwd>omega 3 fatty acids</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Omega-3 fatty acids (n-3s) have purported anti-inflammatory properties and subsequent beneficial effects on human health (Kris-Etherton et al. <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Mamalakis et al. <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Michael-Titus et al. <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Wu et al. <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Dietary intake recommendations for n-3s range from 200&#x000a0;mg/day to 1&#x000a0;g/day (A Report of the Panel on Macronutrients <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), and sources include oily fish and plant-derived sources that are rich in <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-linolenic acid (ALA), a precursor to long-chain n-3 fatty acids (LCn3). Much of the research on health benefits of n-3s in the diet has focused on cardiac function and reductions in mortality rates associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), coronary heart disease (CHD), and myocardial infarction (MI) (Kris-Etherton et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Beyond cardiac health, some evidence suggests that n-3s reduce psychiatric symptoms such as depression and suicidal ideation (Mamalakis et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). These polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA's) have also been found to have significant therapeutic potential in acute neurological trauma, such as spinal cord and traumatic brain injuries. Further, n-3s, specifically docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been shown to have neuroprotective effects and proregenerative potential in reducing the recovery time from these neurological lesions/injuries (Michael-Titus <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Wu et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>).</p><p>Inadequate dietary intake of n-3s could be a health-risk factor for military personnel. Indeed, n-3 status is lower in military personnel compared to the general U.S. population (Lewis et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Santos et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) reported that supplementation with DHA (360&#x000a0;mg/day) and EPA (540&#x000a0;mg/day) over the course of 4&#x000a0;weeks decreased C-reactive protein (CRP), and attenuated inflammatory activity induced by five consecutive days of intense military training (i.e., constant physical exertion and sleep/food deprivation). Based on the potential health benefits of n-3s for military personnel (Santos et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), and their documented poor fatty acid profiles (Lewis et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), supplementing or fortifying the naturally occurring n-3s in military rations might be beneficial.</p><p>Adding n-3s to shelf-stable food items like those used for military rations, presents challenges. For example, ration items must meet rigorous shelf-life specifications (i.e., 3&#x000a0;years at 80&#x000b0;F or 6&#x000a0;months at 100&#x000b0;F). Omega 3 fatty acids have a high degree of unsaturation and, therefore, react readily with oxygen, becoming rancid easily during storage (Nawar <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>). Oxidation is accelerated when n-3s are exposed to high temperatures and humidity, that can occur during storage. Food scientists have developed encapsulation techniques, whereby molecules are coated in gelatin (a protein), which prevents degradation of n-3s (Torres-Giner et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In ration items fortified with microencapsulated DHA and EPA, the quantity of n-3s (and sensory characteristics of the food items) are maintained after storage under typical shelf-life conditions (Barrett et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Pilot testing in our laboratory confirmed that microencapsulated DHA/EPA was absorbed and incorporated into the plasma (&#x0223d;40% increase from baseline) within 4&#x000a0;h after volunteers consumed pound cake fortified with microencapsulated DHA/EPA (600&#x000a0;mg).</p><p>Although the bioavailability of microencapsulated n-3s has been demonstrated in response to consumption of &#x0201c;fresh&#x0201d; food items, the bioavailability of microencapsulated n-3s in foods exposed to high heat and prolonged storage conditions has not been evaluated. Pilot testing in our laboratory (Tracey J. Smith, Ann Barrett, Danielle Anderson, Marques A. Wilson, Andrew J. Young &#x00026; Scott J. Montain unpubl. data) indicated that there was no appreciable difference in LCn3 plasma absorption after volunteers consumed DHA/EPA-enriched (600&#x000a0;mg) pound cake that was either &#x0201c;fresh&#x0201d; (i.e., frozen after production) or previously stored for 6&#x000a0;months at 100&#x000b0;F (&#x0223d;40% and 45% increase from baseline, respectively). However, absorption rates may differ if DHA and EPA are incorporated into protein-rich food items (e.g., dehydrated meat sticks). For example, chemical reactions (e.g., disulfide bonding, and Maillard browning) between the gelatin encapsulate and the food protein may strengthen the encapsulate, thus making the encapsulate less susceptible to digestive enzymes (Meade et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) and, ultimately, reducing the bioavailability of the LCn3. Therefore, this study evaluated plasma n-3 concentrations following consumption of low- and high-protein containing ration items enriched with microencapsulated n-3s, that were either &#x0201c;fresh&#x0201d; (i.e., frozen after production) or previously stored for 6 &#x000a0;months at 100&#x000b0;F. We hypothesized that: (1) prolonged storage of a low-protein food item would have no effect on plasma LCn3 concentrations; (2) that food matrix (carbohydrate vs. protein) would have no effect on plasma LCn3 concentrations when products were not subjected to prolonged storage; and (3) that plasma LCn3 concentrations would be higher after ingestion of a &#x0201c;fresh&#x0201d; protein-rich food item or previously stored, low-protein food item enriched with encapsulated DHA/EPA, compared to a previously stored, protein-rich food item enriched with encapsulated n-3s. Data from this study will inform ration developers and food manufacturers as to whether microencapsulated DHA/EPA in a carbohydrate and/or protein food matrix are viable options for inclusion in shelf-stable food items.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were military and civilian personnel assigned to Natick Soldier Systems Center, Natick, MA.

DHA and EPA (600 mg; DSM Nutritional Products LLC, Parsippany, NJ) were incorporated into two different food items varying in protein content (i.e., pound cake and meat sticks, Table<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>) and storage conditions were manipulated. Nonesterified fish oil was emulsified, spray dried, then microencapsulated in gelatin prior to being incorporated into all ration items. DHA and EPA content of the ration items were chemically determined and food items were packaged in trilaminate (i.e., polyethylene-foil-polyester) pouches. Oxygen scavenger sachets were included with the cakes, while the meat sticks were vacuum packed. Further, all food items underwent microbiological testing by trained microbiologists (Combat Feeding Directorate, NSRDEC, Natick, MA) to ensure that no harmful bacteria or mold was growing in the food items prior to consumption.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Nutrient content of test meals</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pound cake</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Meat stick</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Energy (kcals)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">270</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">218</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Carbohydrates (g, %<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf1-1">1</xref>);</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">74, 55%</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8, 15%</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total fat (g, %<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf1-1">1</xref>)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24, 40%</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10, 41%</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Saturated fat (g)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Unsaturated fat (g)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Protein (g, %<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf1-1">1</xref>)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6, 5%</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24, 44%</td></tr></tbody></table><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fresh<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf1-2">2</xref></th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stored<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf1-3">3</xref></th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fresh<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf1-2">2</xref></th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stored<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf1-3">3</xref></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">DHA (mg)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf1-4">4</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">148.3&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;3.0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">147.0&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;17.4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">213.3&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;14.8</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">228.5&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;3.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">EPA (mg)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf1-4">4</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">434.8&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;24.9</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">433.3&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;13.3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">410.2&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;30.9</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">428.6&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;12.1</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tf1-1"><label>1</label><p>Percent of energy from carbohydrate, fat, and protein within each food item.</p></fn><fn id="tf1-2"><label>2</label><p>Frozen after production.</p></fn><fn id="tf1-3"><label>3</label><p>Stored for 6&#x000a0;months at 100&#x000b0;F and then frozen prior to consumption.</p></fn><fn id="tf1-4"><label>4</label><p>Three samples of each food item were analyzed for DHA and EPA content at the end of the data collection period.

Aside from the DHA/EPA-enriched ration items, volunteers were not allowed to consume any food or beverages (besides water) during each trial. Volunteers were asked to record all foods and beverages that they consumed the day before each trial to identify any potential confounders and were given oral and written instructions to do so. Volunteers were encouraged to record intake at the time the food or beverage was consumed rather than recording at the end of the day.

The slower absorption rate in response to the meat items compared to cake items is not surprising, since protein is digested more slowly than carbohydrates; and, chemical reactions between the gelatin encapsulate (e.g., disulfide bonding and Maillard browning) may strengthen the encapsulate, thus making the encapsulate less susceptible to digestive enzymes (Meade et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) and slowing digestion. Both food types are acceptable delivery vehicles, but n-3 appearance seems to follow a slower time course when the meat stick is the delivery vehicle.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Consuming omega-3 fatty acids, particularly DHA and EPA, may have beneficial effects on human health that could warrant fortification of n-3 content of combat rations and other commercial shelf-stable foods. However, incorporating n-3s into shelf-stable food items presents challenges, because they are susceptible to degradation during high-temperature shelf-storage. Microencapsulating DHA and EPA in gelatin, prior to incorporating them into food, protects against degradation of n-3s during storage. We observed no appreciable differences in n-3 bioavailability between food items that were fresh versus those that were previously stored, suggesting that prolonged high-temperature storage is not compromising n-3 absorption. The results indicate that there is a delay in LCn3 and total n-3 PUFA appearance in response to meat items versus cake items. Taken together, it appears that the microencapsulation technology successfully preserved the bioavailability of LCn3, and both the low- and high-protein food items are suitable shelf-stable food items for fortification with encapsulated DHA/EPA.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank CAPT Joseph Hibbeln and Mr. James Loewke (U.S. Public Health Service) for fatty acid analyses of the blood samples; Dr. Karen Conca and Ms. Katherine Kensil for DHA/EPA analyses of the food items; and, Mr. Jeffrey Staab and Ms. Irene Potter for total cholesterol and cholesterol ester analyses.</p></ack><sec><title>Conflict of Interest</title><p>The views expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not reflect the official policy of the Department of Army, Department of Defense, or the U.S. Government.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1"><element-citation publication-type="book"><collab>A Report of the Panel on Macronutrients SoURLoNaIaUoDRIatSCotSEoDRI</collab><source>Dietary reference intakes for energy, carbohydrate, fiber, fat, fatty acids, cholestrol, protein, and amino acids</source><year>2002</year><publisher-loc>Washington, DC</publisher-loc><publisher-name>The National Academies Press</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2"><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Barrett</surname><given-names>AH</given-names></name><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>DJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Ndou</surname><given-names>TV</given-names></name><name><surname>Kensil</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Khan</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Conca</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Quality and shelf stability of omega-3-fat-supplemented foods</article-title><source>Omega-3 fatty acids: chemistry, dietary sources and health effects</source><year>2014</year><publisher-loc>New York</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Nova Biomedical</publisher-name><fpage>213</fpage><lpage>231</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="b3"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kris-Etherton</surname><given-names>PM</given-names></name><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>WS</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Appel</surname><given-names>LJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Fish consumption, fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids, and cardiovascular disease</article-title><source>Arterioscler.
