Insecure attachment styles negatively affect therapeutic outcome. Insecurely attached patients seem to be less able to sustain positive effects of a multimodal treatment program. However, it has never been tested before if an attachment-oriented approach can improve treatment results of insecurely attached patients in a multimodal outpatient setting. To test this assumption, we compare the short- and long-term outcomes for pain patients who will receive multidisciplinary, attachment-oriented treatment with the outcomes for patients in a control group, who will receive the multidisciplinary state-of-the-art treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Two patient groups (baseline, attachment intervention) are assessed before treatment, after treatment, and at a 6 month follow-up. The study is conducted in a block design: After data collection of the first block (controls) and before as well as during data collection for the second block (treatment group), the health care personnel of the outpatient pain clinic receives training on attachment theory and its use in the therapeutic context. Pain intensity as measured with visual analogue scales and physical functioning will serve as the primary outcome measures.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The design of our study allows for a continuous exchange of experienced team members, which may help bring about concrete attachment related guidelines for the enhancement of therapeutic outcome. This would be the first attempt at an attachment-oriented improvement of multimodal pain programs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>An attachment-based approach may be a promising way to enhance long-term treatment outcomes for insecurely attached pain patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://drks-neu.uniklinik-freiburg.de/drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&#x00026;TRIAL_ID=DRKS00008715">DRKS00008715</ext-link> (registered on the 3<sup>rd</sup> of June 2015).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Attachment-based intervention</kwd><kwd>Multimodal pain therapy</kwd><kwd>Chronic pain</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Today, it is widely acknowledged that the onset and development of chronic pain syndromes is a result of complex interactions between biological, psychological and social influences, including patients&#x02019; beliefs about their self-efficacy, hypervigilant monitoring of bodily sensations, familial conflict or social support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. If patients, for example, exhibit maladaptive behavioral or cognitive responses to acute episodes of pain, the pain may become chronic, thus affecting the long-term course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p>Attachment theory provides a useful framework to classify patients&#x02019; relatively stable cognitive, emotional and behavioral response styles to stressors (such as pain), which have been successfully linked to disease processes in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and to diagnosis and processes of pain-related diseases in particular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Based on their dominant response patterns, adults can be classified to one of four attachment styles - one <italic>secure</italic> style, and the three insecure styles <italic>dismissing</italic>, <italic>preoccupied</italic>, and <italic>fearful</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Bartholomew and Horowitz developed a model based on these four attachment styles (for a simplified overview, see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This model shows that adults with a secure style see themselves and others in a positive way, whereas fearful adults tend to see themselves and others in a negative way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Attachment Model</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40359_2016_114_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>These attachment styles relate to patients&#x02019; stress responsiveness, their beliefs about their ability to cope with the experience of pain, or specific interaction patterns with spouses or health care personnel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Patients with insecure attachment patterns report higher levels of pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], higher degrees of disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], lower levels of pain efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], show less functional and more dysfunctional coping strategies such as catastrophizing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and greater levels of depression and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Bartholomew and Horowitz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] also demonstrated that secure and dismissing individuals report higher measures of self-esteem on Rosenberg&#x02019;s Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] compared to fearful and preoccupied individuals. Previous findings suggest that attachment security can be associated with higher self-esteem, whereas, low self-esteem seems to be more related to insecure attachment patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>These findings are especially relevant given that insecure attachment styles are overrepresented in patients suffering from chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Attachment insecurity also negatively influences the working alliance with health-care professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and outcome in psychosocial interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>To date, the knowledge about attachment concepts has not been used to improve pain treatment outcomes with the help of a differential approach based on individual attachment styles. Therefore, we will compare the short- and long-term treatment outcomes for pain patients who will receive multidisciplinary, attachment-specific treatment with the outcomes for patients in a control group who will receive the multidisciplinary state-of-the-art treatment (for a simplified overview, see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Our preliminary hypotheses were formulated based on the abovementioned information.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Attachment-based Working Alliance Model</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40359_2016_114_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Patients in the intervention group, who receive an attachment-based multidisciplinary treatment, will report a larger mean reduction of the pain intensity between pre-treatment and post-treatment assessments than patients in the control group, who receive the state-of-the-art multidisciplinary treatment. It is expected that this larger reduction of the pain intensity in the intervention group compared to controls can be specifically attributed to better outcomes for the intervention group patients than control group patients who have been assessed with insecure attachment styles. Moreover, patients with an insecure attachment style and patients with more attachment anxiety are expected to report higher levels of pain intensity as well as physical functioning.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The intervention is specifically designed to improve the therapeutic relationship and to hereby improve treatment outcomes.

We decided against a randomized controlled trial because (a) we had ethical concerns with a design that would put patients on a waiting list for several months, and (b) a block design ensures that the intervention&#x02019;s effects only influence the outcomes of the treatment group: After collection of data for the control group, the health care personnel of the outpatient pain clinic receives training sessions on attachment theory and its use in the therapeutic context. These training sessions will not be carried out until data collection for the control group will be complete. More attachment-related training sessions alternating with supervision meetings will be held on a monthly basis to assist the therapeutic team in the practical application during data collection for the second sample, the treatment group. During our weekly team meetings, the case reviews will be complemented with a discussion on the individual attachment style of each patient. Also these meetings will be used to collect situations, which are perceived to be critical for the forming of a working alliance by the therapeutic team (for example, situations in which the patient misses entire therapeutic sessions or appears too late to them on a regular basis). These critical situations will be subsequently used to structure the discussions of individual cases in the bi-monthly training sessions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>Our participants are enrolled as outpatients in the orthopedic clinic of the Heidelberg University Hospital and participate in a four-week outpatient multidisciplinary pain treatment including physiotherapy, ergotherapy, music and dance therapy, individual and group psychotherapy.

Based on the results of our pretests, we expected a small to medium effect of 0.4 for the comparison of the two groups (with an alpha level = 0.05, two tailed, &#x003b2; = 0.2).

Analysis of variance will be used for the evaluation of the changes of the continuous outcomes pain intensity and physical functioning (T1-T2, T1- T3).

Demographic variables such as sex, age, education and clinical variables such as opioid intake and comorbidity will be entered as covariates. Partial regression coefficients will be used to determine if the &#x0201c;working alliance&#x0201d; mediates the effect of attachment on the continuous outcomes (pain and physical functioning).</p><p>Missing data on the questionnaires will be handled according to the questionnaire protocol.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Intervention</title><p>By drawing on attachment theoretical ideas, we do not mean to change any of the overall aims of multimodal pain treatment. Also, it would be unrealistic to aim at a complete reversal of underlying insecure attachment patterns to a secure pattern in such a setting.</p><p>Rather, we aim at an improvement of the therapeutic alliance (a) in terms of the therapists&#x02019; general ability to provide a secure base for his patients, and (b) in the therapists&#x02019; ability to understand and deal with their patients&#x02019; individual attachment-based motivations and needs. Thus, the intervention&#x02019;s guidelines should help facilitate the attainment of the program&#x02019;s aims by enhancing the patient&#x02019;s sense of having a secure base. Therefore, our intervention training includes both general directions for building a meaningful therapeutic relationship, and guidelines, which are specifically tailored to the needs of individual attachment styles.</p><p>To develop general guidelines for an improvement of the working alliance, we identified as useful starting point the therapeutic approach of the complementary therapeutic relationship. This approach emphasizes the underlying motives (such as the attachment motive) of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p>We also developed more specific guidelines for each attachment style based on a further development of existing literature on the application of attachment ideas to specific therapeutic settings. For example, attachment theoretical ideas have been incorporated in therapeutic programs for the treatment of borderline personality disorder, depression, medically unexplained symptoms, family and couple therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. A multimodal rehabilitation program for children and adolescents with functional impairment in Australia applies for instance attachment principles to their family-based intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, as guidelines often remain vague, are tailored to one specific therapeutic school or are given on the assumption of a long-term therapy, all of which is not suitable for our context, we only used them as a starting point.</p><p>For example, patients with preoccupied attachment styles might benefit more from an initially concordant approach which puts emphasis on the therapist&#x02019;s role as a secure base. Patients with preoccupied or fearful attachment styles might feel overwhelmed by a program which is too fast in emphasizing autonomy, and possibly reinforce existing fears of rejection and abandonment. On the other hand, dismissively attached patients might feel uncomfortable with high levels of proximity, and the amount of guidance and care preoccupied patients favor to feel safe.</p><p>The multimodal setting requires an attachment-based concept, which can be employed by medical personnel with diverse professional backgrounds such as doctors, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, music and dance therapists. Additionally, therapists may avail themselves of diverse methodological approaches such as psychoanalytical or cognitive behavioral therapy.</p><p>Each team member is provided with a manual of the general guidelines and the attachment style-specific guidelines. In the course of data collection for the intervention group, these guidelines will also be constantly extended.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Measures</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Psychopathology</title><p>The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]) is a semi-structured interview for assessing DSM-IV Axis I diagnoses.

We decided to include both an assessment of attachment styles and attachment dimensions to enhance measurement precision and hereby facilitate the interpretation of results. The brief self-report RQ 2 captures a person&#x02019;s dominant (cognitive) schematic representation of self and others. It consists of four short paragraphs, each describing one attachment pattern (e.g. the fearful prototype reads, &#x02018;I am uncomfortable getting close to others. I want emotionally close relationships, but I find it difficult to trust others completely, or to depend on them. I worry that I will be hurt if I allow myself to become too close to others&#x02019;). The participants is then asked to rate their degree of correspondence to each prototype on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (completely true) to 7 (completely false). The therapeutic team will be informed about the results only in the treatment condition. In this way, treatment can be tailored to each patient&#x02019;s specific attachment needs.</p><p>From these four prototype ratings, the &#x02018;model of self&#x02019; and the &#x02018;model of other&#x02019; scales were calculated as proposed by the authors. Patients with positive models of both self and other were classified as &#x02018;secure&#x02019;, patients with negative/neutral models for both as &#x02018;fearful&#x02019;, and individuals with mixed results as &#x02018;preoccupied&#x02019; or &#x02018;dismissing&#x02019;. The RQ-2 has been shown to have an acceptable level of psychometric soundness as a brief screening instrument, and it is relatively independent from self-deceptive biases. The RQ-2 implemented has been used in multiple international studies and proved to be an efficient screening instrument with good construct validity across cultures.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Primary outcome measures</title><p>With two Visual Analogue Scales, we assess the pain intensity at present and within the previous week. Patients are also asked to indicate the number of days they experienced pain, and the number of days they experienced strong pain, both within the previous month. Physical functioning will be assessed with the Oswestry Disability Index by Mannion et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], which has been specifically developed for use with pain patients. Also, we included a widely used German short version of the Health Survey to assess physical functioning and health-related quality of life more generally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Pain intensity and functional impairment</title><p>Subjective pain intensity over the preceding week was measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]) ranging from 0 (no pain) to 100 (worst imaginable pain). Each patient indicated a position on the VAS in response to the question &#x0201c;How severe was your pain on average in the last seven days?&#x0201d; The VAS is a valid and reliable instrument for measuring the intensity of pain.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Physical functioning</title><p>The validated Oswestry Disability Index (ODI; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]) is currently considered by many as the gold standard for measuring degree of disability and estimating quality of life in a person with low back pain. The self-completed questionnaire contains ten topics concerning intensity of pain, lifting, ability to care for oneself, ability to walk, ability to sit, sexual function, ability to stand, social life, sleep quality, and ability to travel.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Emotional distress</title><p>The Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]) is made up of 42 self-report items, each reflecting a negative emotional symptom. Each of these is rated on a four-point Likert scale of frequency or severity of the participants' experiences over the last week with the intention of emphasising states over traits. These scores ranged from 0, meaning that the client believed the item "did not apply to them at all", to 3 meaning that the client considered the item to "apply to them very much, or most of the time". It is also stressed in the instructions that there are no right or wrong answers. The main purpose of the DASS is to isolate and identify aspects of emotional disturbance; for example, to assess the degree of severity of the core symptoms of depression, anxiety or stress.</p><p>The SF-12 Health Survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] is a shorter version of the SF-36 Health Survey that uses just 12 questions to measure functional health and well-being from the patient&#x02019;s point of view. Taking only two to three minutes to complete, the SF-12 is a practical, reliable and valid measure of physical and mental health and is particularly useful in large population health surveys or for applications that combine a generic and disease-specific health survey.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Interpersonal problems and self-esteem</title><p>The inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP 32; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]) is a self-report instrument that identifies a person's most salient interpersonal difficulties. The items provide representative interpersonal problems that are commonly reported in initial interviews.</p><p>The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], a widely used self-report instrument for evaluating individual self-esteem, was investigated using item response theory. Factor analysis identified a single common factor, contrary to some previous studies that extracted separate Self-Confidence and Self-Depreciation factors. A 10-item scale that measures global self-worth by measuring both positive andnegative feelings about the self. The scale is believed to be uni-dimensional. All items are answered using a 4-point Likert scale format ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Coping</title><p>Coping strategies in the context of chronic pain refer to the way individuals who experience pain develop ways to tolerate, minimize or reduce their pain. The Coping Strategies Questionnaire (CSQ; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]) is internationally the most widely used measure of pain coping strategies. The value of the CSQ is its ability to assess various cognitive and behavioral coping factors derived from a rationally constructed pool of strategies reported by patients experiencing pain and cross-validated by pain clinicians and pain psychologists. It identifies both active and passive coping strategies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Evaluation and therapeutic process</title><p>The Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised (WAI-SR; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]) is a recently refined measure of the therapeutic alliance that assesses three key aspects of the therapeutic alliance: (a) agreement on the tasks of therapy, (b) agreement on the goals of therapy and (c) development of an affective bond.</p><p>The German Stations-Erfahrungs-Bogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] is an instrument for the process evaluation inpatient psychotherapy. Application possibilities are in the clinical area, in science as well as in the quality monitoring of the treatment facility. The TSEB is a patient questionnaire for the assessment of experiencing inpatient psychotherapy. With 38 items, the self-assessment of patient regarding the following subscales is applicable: relationship to therapeutic team, relationship with the therapist, emotional atmosphere between the patient, need for affection by the other patients, experiencing the intensity of treatment, experience the therapeutic framework and self-efficacy (e.g. relationship with therapist: &#x02018;I found it easy to connect with my therapist&#x02019;).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec22"><title>Potential strengths</title><p>Continuous exchange of experienced team members might help bring about concrete attachment related guidelines for the enhancement of therapeutic outcome for pain patients and allow us to develop a standardized training manual for pain patients. To our knowledge, such concrete guidelines are rare in applications of attachment concepts to therapy of chronic pain patients in a multimodal setting. Also, as patients with preoccupied and fearful attachment styles are less able to maintain the positive results of multimodal pain treatment over a period of time, an attachment-based approach is a promising way to enhance the prospects especially for these patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Potential limitations</title><p>We do not believe that two training sessions for the therapeutic team will suffice to yield large effects on therapeutic outcome. However, we expect that the constant exchange within the team during weekly team meetings and monthly supervision sessions will facilitate the development of a clear understanding of attachment styles as well as a repertoire of methods to deal with incidents, which are critical for the working alliance. Therefore, therapists are likely to become more seasoned in recognizing and dealing with the attachment behavior of their patients in the course of the study. As a result, effects might only become apparent in an advanced phase of data collection for the intervention group.</p><p>Patients with a preoccupied attachment style and, even more pronounced, the ones with a fearful attachment style, gain the least from the state-of-the art multidisciplinary pain treatment. These patients are known to have difficulty with the regulation of distance and proximity to other people. Our program in the outpatient clinic offers many opportunities to express distancing or proximity-seeking behavior in dealing with doctors, physiotherapists, psychologists and the group of other patients and therefore provides many chances for difficulty. Even if the therapeutic team is trained in attachment concepts, the time frame might not be enough to use this new knowledge to their advantage. It is very likely that in such a setting, patients with insecure attachment patterns will at some point elicit (negative) reactions either from staff or from other patients similar to the ones they continuously experience in their every-day lives. This would confirm their general expectations of themselves and others in relationships, hereby reinforcing these expectations.</p><p>The short time frame of this setting, which is already packed with activity, might simply not be enough to adequately absorb these experiences and to tap into them in a therapeutic sense. Therefore, the setting in itself could be unsuited to a treatment concept which is individually tailored to specific attachment styles. It might even be unsuited altogether for patients who are known to have difficulty to become self-dependent once the intense support they receive throughout the program discontinues. On the other hand, as such an individually tailored attachment concept has never been applied to multimodal pain treatment and attachment styles clearly are very relevant in this setting, there is also the chance that treatment can be largely improved. Moreover, we do not aim at altering the individual attachment patterns of the patients themselves. Rather, we use the knowledge about these patterns to form an adequate basis from which we can start working with the patients on their pain related goals without overstraining them.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Conclusions</title><sec id="Sec25"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment of patients for the control group started in March 2012.
