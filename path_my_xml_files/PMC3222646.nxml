Intervention group was indicated by colour code, but neither participants, researchers, nor field staff knew who received what intervention. Those with <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection at baseline were treated with artemether-lumefantrine. The primary outcome, an episode of malaria, was assessed among children reported sick at a primary care clinic, and pre-defined as current <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection with an inflammatory response, shown by axillary temperature &#x02265;37.5&#x000b0;C or whole blood C-reactive protein concentration &#x02265;8 mg/L. Nutritional indicators were assessed at baseline and at 251 days (median; 95&#x00025; reference range: 191&#x02013;296 days). In the primary intention-to-treat analysis, we adjusted for pre-specified baseline factors, using Cox regression models that accounted for multiple episodes per child. 592 children completed the study. The primary analysis included 1,572 malaria episodes during 526 child-years of observation (median follow-up: 331 days). Malaria incidence in groups receiving zinc, multi-nutrients without zinc, multi-nutrients with zinc and placebo was 2.89/child-year, 2.95/child-year, 3.26/child-year, and 2.87/child-year, respectively.

Half of the world's population is at risk of this parasitic disease, which kills a million people (mainly children living in sub-Saharan Africa) every year. Malaria is transmitted to people through the bites of infected night-flying mosquitoes. Soon after entering the human body, the parasite begins to replicate in red blood cells, bursting out every 2&#x02013;3 days and infecting more red blood cells. The presence of the parasite in the blood stream (parasitemia) causes malaria's characteristic recurring fever and can cause life-threatening organ damage and anemia (insufficient quantity of red blood cells). Malaria transmission can be reduced by using insecticide sprays to control the mosquitoes that spread the parasite and by avoiding mosquito bites by sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets. Effective treatment with antimalarial drugs can also reduce malaria transmission.</p></sec><sec id="s5a2"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>One reason why malaria kills so many children in Africa is poverty. Many children in Africa are malnourished, and malnutrition&#x02014;in particular, insufficient micronutrients in the diet&#x02014;impairs the immune system, which increases the frequency and severity of many childhood diseases. Micronutrients are vitamins and minerals that everyone needs in small quantities for good health. Zinc is one of the micronutrients that helps to maintain a healthy immune system, but zinc deficiency is very common among African children. Zinc supplementation has been shown to reduce the burden of diarrhea in developing countries, so might it also reduce the burden of malaria? Unfortunately, the existing evidence is confusing&#x02014;some trials show that zinc supplementation protects against malaria but others show no evidence of protection. One possibility for these conflicting results could be that zinc supplementation alone is not sufficient&#x02014;supplementation with other micronutrients might be needed for zinc to have an effect. In this randomized trial (a study that compares the effects of different interventions in groups that initially are similar in all characteristics except for intervention), the researchers investigate the effect of supplementation with zinc alone and in combination with other micronutrients on the rate of uncomplicated (mild) malaria among children living in Tanzania.</p></sec><sec id="s5a3"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers enrolled 612 children aged 6&#x02013;60 months who were living in a rural area of Tanzania with intense malaria transmission and randomly assigned them to receive daily oral supplements containing zinc alone, multi-nutrients (including iron) without zinc, multi-nutrients with zinc, or a placebo (no micronutrients). Nutritional indicators (including zinc concentrations in blood plasma) were assessed at baseline and 6&#x02013;10 months after starting the intervention. During the study period, there were 1,572 malaria episodes. The incidence of malaria in all four intervention groups was very similar (about three episodes per child-year), and there was no evidence that multi-nutrients influenced the effect of zinc (or vice versa). Moreover, none of the supplements had any effect on malaria rates when compared to the placebo, even though the occurrence of zinc deficiency was strongly reduced by zinc supplementation. In a secondary analysis in which they analyzed their data by iron status at baseline, the researchers found that multi-nutrient supplementation increased the overall number of malaria episodes in children with iron deficiency by 41&#x00025;, whereas multi-nutrient supplementation had no effect on the number of malaria episodes among children who were iron-replete at baseline.</p></sec><sec id="s5a4"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>In this study, the researchers found no evidence that zinc supplementation protected against malaria among young children living in Tanzania when given alone or in combination with other multi-nutrients. However, the researchers did find some evidence that multi-nutrient supplementation may increase the risk of malaria in children with iron deficiency. Because this finding came out of a secondary analysis of the data, it needs to be confirmed in a trial specifically designed to assess the effect of multi-nutrient supplements on malaria risk in iron-deficient children. Nevertheless, it is a potentially worrying result because, on the basis of evidence from a single study, the World Health Organization currently recommends that regular iron supplements be given to iron-deficient children in settings where there is adequate access to anti-malarial treatment. This recommendation should be reconsidered, suggest the researchers, and the safety of multi-nutrient mixes that contain iron and that are dispensed in countries affected by malaria should also be carefully evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="s5a5"><title>Additional Information</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001125">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001125</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Information is available from the World Health Organization on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/topics/malaria/en/">malaria</ext-link> (in several languages), on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/micronutrients/en/">micronutrients</ext-link>, and on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/publications/cra/chapters/volume1/0257-0280.pdf">zinc deficiency</ext-link>; the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/malaria/world_malaria_report_2010/en/index.html">2010 World Malaria Report</ext-link> provides details of the current global malaria situation</p></list-item><list-item><p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provide information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/">malaria</ext-link> (in English and Spanish), including a selection of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/stories/index.html">personal stories</ext-link> about malaria</p></list-item><list-item><p>Information is available from the Roll Back Malaria Partnership on the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rollbackmalaria.org">global control of malaria</ext-link> and on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rollbackmalaria.org/cmc_upload/0/000/015/370/RBMInfosheet_3.htm">malaria in Africa</ext-link>

If effective against malaria, it would be an important advance in public health, particularly in Africa, where 90&#x00025; of malarial deaths occur. Anti-malarial efficacy of zinc supplementation has thus far been investigated in four trials of which we are aware, with discordant results. In one trial in Gambian children, twice-weekly zinc seemed to reduce the mean number of clinic visits for malaria by 32&#x00025; <xref rid="pmed.1001125-Bates1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, but this trial was not designed to evaluate protection from malaria, and the statistical evidence was weak. In another trial in Papua New Guinean children, daily zinc reduced rates of malaria due to <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> by 38&#x00025; <xref rid="pmed.1001125-Shankar1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. By contrast, in trials in Burkina Faso and Peru <xref rid="pmed.1001125-Mller1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001125-Richard1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, there was no evidence of protection against malaria in the children enrolled, despite zinc deficiency being highly prevalent at baseline and reversed by supplementation.</p><p>In these trials, malaria was detected among children self-reporting at clinics in Papua New Guinea and The Gambia, whereas cases were detected through regular home visits in Burkina Faso and Peru. This could indicate that zinc supplementation is more efficacious in preventing severe malaria than mild episodes, for which mothers do not immediately seek treatment. Alternatively, the response to zinc may be suppressed when children are also deficient in other nutrients <xref rid="pmed.1001125-Ronaghy1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001125-Ronaghy2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Simultaneous supplementation with other nutrients may be required to overcome a lack of effect of zinc supplements when given alone.</p><p>There are concerns, however, about the safety of supplementation with micronutrients in malaria-endemic areas. In a large trial among children aged 1&#x02013;35 months in Pemba <xref rid="pmed.1001125-Sazawal1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, supplementation with iron and folic acid increased the incidence of serious adverse events by 12&#x00025;, which was assumed to be due to malaria. Results from a sub-study within this trial suggested that the overall effect tended to be beneficial in settings with improved basic care facilities. Also, the increase in adverse events appeared restricted to those who were iron-replete, whereas supplementation seemed beneficial in those who were iron-deficient <xref rid="pmed.1001125-Sazawal1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001125-Stolzfus1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Based on these findings, the World Health Organization now advocates a policy of restricting iron supplementation to children with iron deficiency <xref rid="pmed.1001125-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. To strengthen the basis of this recommendation, the interaction with iron status and the safety of iron supplements in iron deficient children should be confirmed in other studies.</p><p>Although randomised trials in malaria-endemic areas have consistently shown that preventive iron supplementation (with or without other micronutrients) reduces the prevalence of anaemia <xref rid="pmed.1001125-Ekvall1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1001125-Verhoef1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, we have not found reports on its effect on haemoglobin concentrations during febrile episodes of malaria. By increasing parasite propagation during such episodes, supplementation may potentially exacerbate haemolysis. Thus, gains in haemoglobin concentrations due to supplementation before febrile malaria attacks may be more than compensated for by greater haemoglobin losses during such episodes. In a study in Papua New Guinean infants (aged 6&#x02013;12 months), the decrease in haemoglobin concentration associated with asymptomatic <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection at two surveys seemed more pronounced among those receiving iron <xref rid="pmed.1001125-Oppenheimer1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. By contrast, while supplementation with iron and folic acid increased rates of cerebral malaria in Pemba, it seemed to reduce rates of severe anaemia, although the statistical evidence for this reduction was not strong <xref rid="pmed.1001125-Sazawal1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>The primary aim of our study was to assess the effect of supplementation with zinc, alone or in combination with other nutrients, on rates of uncomplicated malaria. Secondary aims were to compare intervention effects in subgroups pre-defined by age, presence of parasitaemia, and zinc and iron status at baseline. We also assessed the effect of multi-nutrient supplementation on haemoglobin concentrations during febrile malaria episodes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Population</title><p>We conducted the study between February 2008 and March 2009, in a rural area in Handeni District, Tanzania <xref rid="pmed.1001125-Veenemans1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001125-Veenemans2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> where malaria transmission is intense <xref rid="pmed.1001125-Ellman1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

Interventions were indicated by colour code on paper slips in opaque, consecutively numbered envelopes that were prepared in advance, in excess of the expected number required. A simple colour code (one colour to distinguish each of the four supplement types) was used to minimize the possibility of children receiving the wrong supplements. This code was not revealed to researchers, field staff, or participants, who therefore did not know who received what intervention. At the end of each screening day, the names of eligible children were listed by screening number and each name was randomly allocated to an intervention by drawing the next envelope from a box that corresponded to the age- and malaria-specific stratum for that child.</p><p>Supplements, as powder in colour-coded capsules, were contained in blister packs, and administered orally after suspending capsule contents in clean water or breast milk. All types of powder had similar appearance, smell, and taste. At the end of each screening day, when eligibility had been fully established, children were individually allocated in order of their screening number to intervention groups by drawing successive envelopes from a box corresponding to the infection- and age-specific stratum for that child. The number of the envelope was then recorded on a list before the envelope was opened. The randomisation code was not revealed to researchers, field workers, or participants until data collection was completed and the database had been finalised and sent to the Trial Oversight Committee.

Episodes with pre-defined parasitaemia thresholds (1,000, 3,000, and 5,000 asexual parasites/&#x000b5;L) were considered as secondary outcomes.

We used Cox models with robust estimates of the standard error to account for correlation between episodes within children and interpreted the hazard ratio as a proxy for the incidence ratio. We calculated the percentage reduction (or increase) due to the intervention as 100&#x000d7;(1&#x02212;hazard ratio). Following the analysis plan, we adjusted for prognostic factors at baseline (age class [6&#x02013;18 months, 18&#x02013;35 months, and 36&#x02013;59 months], <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection, mosquito net use, distance between homestead and clinic, height-for-age z-score). We evaluated possible interaction between zinc and multi-nutrients by including an interaction term in the Cox regression model. We also conducted a pre-specified secondary analysis to assess the influence on effect estimates of excluding observations in a 14-day post-treatment prophylactic period. To assess changes in intervention effect over time, we explored effects on all malaria episodes within the first 100 days of supplementation versus the subsequent period. We arbitrarily defined a cut-point of 100 days because this period covered almost half of all episodes, and adjusted for baseline factors as described above.

Of 2,462 episodes of reported fever, 1,618 (66&#x00025;) were accompanied by <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection as detected by dipstick test; for 46 children parasitaemia was not accompanied by confirmed fever or inflammation. Hence, 1,572 episodes classified as malaria: 1,499 (95&#x00025;) due to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and 73 (5&#x00025;) due to other <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species. The incidence of malaria was 3.0 events/child-year. There were 1,408, 1,314, 1,248, 1,119, and 263 episodes with densities exceeding 1,000, 3,000, 5,000, 10,000, and 100,000 parasites/&#x000b5;L, respectively. Of all hospital admissions (68), almost half (30 cases occurring in 27 children) were due to malaria: five were admitted for life-threatening disease (respiratory distress or prostration; none had neurological manifestations); 25 lived far from the dispensary, and the clinician referred them as a precaution (18 for haemoglobin concentrations &#x0003c;60 g/L without respiratory distress or dehydration and seven for other reasons). There were no episodes of cerebral malaria.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Primary Analysis: Effects on All Episodes of Malaria</title><p>Compared to placebo, there was no evidence of a meaningful effect of either zinc or multi-nutrients alone on the incidence of malaria. The hazard ratio for all episodes of malaria by zinc was 0.99; 95&#x00025; CI 0.82&#x02013;1.18 (adjusted model, as compared to placebo). Thus for zinc, the lower limit of the confidence interval is compatible with a reduction in incidence of all episodes of malaria of 18&#x00025; only. The hazard ratio for all episodes of malaria by multi-nutrients (as compared to placebo) was 1.04, 95&#x00025; CI 0.87&#x02013;1.23 (adjusted model; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-1001125-t003">Table 3</xref>). Incidence of all episodes of malaria was slightly higher in the group that received both zinc and multi-nutrients, as compared to placebo (HR 1.14, 95&#x00025; CI 0.96&#x02013;1.35), but there was no evidence of an interaction between zinc and multi-nutrients in their effects on malaria incidence (interaction ratio 1.10, 95&#x00025; CI 0.84&#x02013;1.43).

In the primary analysis, there was no evidence that multi-nutrients influenced malaria rates, but results from a secondary analysis suggest that multi-nutrient supplementation may have increased the incidence of first malaria episodes by approximately 30&#x00025;. The effect of supplementation on overall malaria rates seemed to vary with iron status at baseline: among children with iron deficiency, multi-nutrients increased rates of malaria episodes by 41&#x00025;, while they had no effect in those who were iron replete. This difference in effect was unlikely to have been observed by chance (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.01).</p><p>One limitation of our study is that supplements were colour-coded and not in packs labelled with individual identity numbers. During the field work, however, we received no indication that participants or field staff discovered who received what intervention, or that participants favoured a particular type of supplement. It should be noted also that the clinical outcome assessors were blinded to what intervention had been assigned to individual children. HIV infection was not assessed in our study but is unlikely to have confounded its results: the prevalence of HIV infection in this paediatric population is probably below 5&#x00025; and, due to the randomisation process, marked imbalances in HIV infection at baseline are unlikely.</p><p>By excluding children with height-for-age z-score&#x0003e;&#x02212;1.5 SD, the children enrolled in our trial probably were more zinc deficient than the general population from which they were sampled. Thus the effect on malaria rates that could potentially be attained in the general population, without this exclusion criterion, is probably smaller than that reported here. Two previous trials indicated that zinc can protect against malaria. The Gambian trial <xref rid="pmed.1001125-Bates1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> was not designed to assess this association, and episodes were recorded through routine clinical procedures. In Papua New Guinea, zinc reduced the incidence of febrile episodes with parasitaemia &#x02265;9,200/&#x000b5;L and &#x02265;100,000/&#x000b5;L by 38&#x00025; (95&#x00025; CI 3&#x00025;&#x02013;60&#x00025;) and 69&#x00025; (95&#x00025; CI 36&#x00025;&#x02013;87&#x00025;), respectively <xref rid="pmed.1001125-Shankar1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Both studies were smaller than our study (91 cases of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria in Papua New Guinea, as compared to 1,499 in our study). It seems unlikely that discrepancies with our findings are explained by differences in access to health care and a differential effect on rates of severe malaria: even with episodes with parasitaemia &#x02265;100,000/&#x000b5;L, our confidence intervals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-1001125-t003">Table 3</xref>) are incompatible with the magnitude of the protective effect reported from Papua New Guinea. In addition, the overall and malaria-specific mortality reduction found in Pemba (7&#x00025; and 10&#x00025;, respectively) <xref rid="pmed.1001125-Sazawal2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, seems inconsistent with the 69&#x00025; reduction in episodes with parasitaemia &#x02265;100,000/&#x000b5;L that was reported from Papua New Guinea. The intensity of malaria transmission in Papua New Guinea was much lower than in Burkina Faso, Pemba, or our study, raising the question of whether zinc affords protection only in populations with low acquired immunity. The absence of an age-dependent decrease in efficacy of zinc supplementation in our study makes this unlikely. Thus the divergent results from Papua New Guinea may be due to unknown differences in host, parasite, or environmental factors that predict the response to zinc.</p><p>Because malaria parasites are transmitted through mosquito bites, they bypass epithelial barriers that form the first line of defence against pathogens that cause diarrhoea and respiratory infections. Zinc is known to play a critical role in maintaining epithelial barrier function <xref rid="pmed.1001125-Prentice1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1001125-Zalewski1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. In vitro studies using Caco-2 cells suggest that tight junctions between intestinal epithelial cells have impaired function in zinc deficiency <xref rid="pmed.1001125-Zalewski1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, whilst morphological studies and findings from a zinc supplementation trial in Bangladeshi children with diarrhoea suggest that zinc deficiency adversely affects intestinal permeability <xref rid="pmed.1001125-Finamore1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001125-Moran1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. The protective effect of zinc against diarrhoea and respiratory infections, as compared to the absence of such an effect against malaria, suggest that this nutrient primarily acts by strengthening barrier function rather than through immunity.</p><p>Our results also suggest that an increase in overall malaria rates may have occurred in children with iron deficiency. Subgroup analyses should generally be interpreted with caution <xref rid="pmed.1001125-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. On one hand, we did not specify interactions between multi-nutrient supplementation and iron status <italic>a priori</italic>, and the direction of the subgroup effect is in contrast with the findings previously obtained in the Pemba sub-study with iron and folic acid <xref rid="pmed.1001125-Sazawal1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. On the other hand, the difference in effects of multi-nutrients between children with and without iron deficiency was large, the statistical evidence for effect modification was strong and consistent for other malaria-related outcomes (haemoglobin concentration and malaria episodes with higher parasite densities).</p><p>Because the effect of multi-nutrient supplementation on malaria in our trial depended on initial iron status, it would seem most likely that this was caused by iron, and not by other nutrients in the supplement. Diverse lines of evidence suggest that, of all the micronutrients, iron is the most critical mediator of host&#x02013;pathogen interactions <xref rid="pmed.1001125-Roy1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, and our findings build on existing evidence suggesting that supplementation with iron can increase malaria risk <xref rid="pmed.1001125-Sazawal1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001125-Murray1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1001125-Shankar2" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>.</p><p>In their report of the findings from the Pemba sub-study <xref rid="pmed.1001125-Sazawal1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, the authors were cautious in their interpretation of the subgroup effect, stating that their results suggested that supplementation with iron and folic acid is beneficial in children with iron deficiency, but unsafe in those who are iron-replete. Based on these findings, an expert group convened by the World Health Organization recommended that iron supplements should be administered routinely to iron-deficient infants in settings with adequate access to anti-malarial treatment <xref rid="pmed.1001125-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Unfortunately, our findings contradict those from the Pemba study, and thereby cast doubt on the assumption that iron is safe in iron-deficient children. In the Pemba study, iron deficiency (found in 75&#x00025; of children) was defined by elevated molar ratios of zinc protoporphyrin and haem. Although to their credit, ZPP&#x02236;H ratios react more slowly to inflammation than plasma ferritin concentrations, elevated ratios may occur due to (longstanding) inflammation, (asymptomatic) <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection, and thalassaemia (Veenemans, unpublished data), and hence falsely indicate iron deficiency. Plasma ferritin concentration below 12 &#x000b5;g/L as indicator of iron deficiency may fail to detect deficient children in the presence of inflammation, but it is a highly specific marker of iron deficiency, probably more so than the ZPP&#x02236;H ratio.</p><p>We speculate that iron may have enhanced parasite proliferation specifically in children with iron deficiency, because iron absorption in this subgroup is more efficient and thus may lead to transient production of non-transferrin bound iron <xref rid="pmed.1001125-Hutchinson1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1001125-Dresow1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, which may act as a nutritional source and favour the proliferation of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites <xref rid="pmed.1001125-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Evidence in support of this hypothesised mechanism is, however, lacking. In addition, children with a low plasma ferritin concentration are probably free of inflammation and likely to absorb iron rapidly. Because children with iron deficiency were substantially younger, the difference in effect between subgroups of iron-replete and -deficient children may also (partly) have been mediated by the lack of protective immunity in these younger children, and the higher dose of supplemental iron per kilogram of bodyweight. It seems plausible that the magnitude of potential adverse effects of iron is determined by a combination of the host's immune status, dose of iron per kg bodyweight, and the amount of iron absorbed. The qualitative interaction with age and iron status as observed in our study emphasizes the need for trials to take these into account in the analysis, as overall estimates may tend towards a neutral effect <xref rid="pmed.1001125-Prentice2" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>.</p><p>We found no support for our initial hypothesis that, at the time of malaria episodes, haemoglobin concentrations would be lower in children receiving multi-nutrients. In fact, young children with iron deficiency (who were most vulnerable to declines in haemoglobin) were better able to maintain their haemoglobin concentration when they received multi-nutrients. The critical issue remains whether the benefits of higher haemoglobin concentrations during acute malaria and thus the expected reduced risk of severe malarial anaemia, on one hand, outweigh the potential risk of severe disease manifestations that can be associated with an increased frequency of malaria, on the other hand. Access to primary care facilities may be a critical factor determining this balance, and in the absence of early treatment, the youngest children with iron deficiency may be a vulnerable subgroup.</p><p>The estimated amount of iron absorbed from our supplement is close to that absorbed from multi-nutrient mixes used for home fortification <xref rid="pmed.1001125-WHO2" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1001125-Verhoef3" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. Our data question the safety of supplying these mixes to vulnerable populations, particularly in settings with poor malaria prevention, but even in conditions where access to diagnosis and therapy for malaria is excellent, as in our study.</p><p>In conclusion, when results from all trials are considered together, there is no evidence that zinc interventions can reduce the burden of malaria in African children. We have presented evidence that multi-nutrient supplementation may increase the risk of malaria in children with iron deficiency, strengthening earlier concerns about the safety of multi-nutrient supplementation in malaria-endemic areas, even in settings with good access to health care and appropriate treatment. Similar risks may apply to home fortification in such settings. Although safety may be improved by modifying the formulation of supplements (in particular by reducing the iron dose) implementing multi-nutrient supplementation or home fortification as a public health measure should be carefully monitored until this has been demonstrated. The World Health Organization recommendation that iron should be supplemented to iron-deficient children needs reconsideration, not because we claim that our study provides conclusive evidence that targeting this group is unsafe, but because the current guideline is based on weak evidence from a single study that is contradicted by our findings using highly specific markers of iron deficiency.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1001125.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
