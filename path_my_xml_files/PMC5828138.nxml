Non-pharmacological interventions to treat and prevent these co-morbidities are urgently needed. Bright light therapy (BLT) improves day&#x02013;night rhythm and is an emerging therapy for major depression. Exercise intervention (EI) reduces obesity and improves depressive symptoms. To date, no randomized controlled trial (RCT) has been performed to establish feasibility and efficacy of these interventions targeting the prevention of co-morbid depression and obesity in ADHD. We hypothesize that the two manualized interventions in combination with mobile health-based monitoring and reinforcement will result in less depressive symptoms and obesity compared to treatment as usual in adolescents and young adults with ADHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This trial is a prospective, pilot phase-IIa, parallel-group RCT with three arms (two add-on treatment groups [BLT, EI] and one treatment as usual [TAU] control group). The primary outcome variable is change in the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology total score (observer-blinded assessment) between baseline and ten weeks of intervention. This variable is analyzed with a mixed model for repeated measures approach investigating the treatment effect with respect to all three groups. A total of 330 participants with ADHD, aged 14 &#x02013; &#x0003c;&#x02009;30 years, will be screened at the four study centers. To establish effect sizes, the sample size was planned at the liberal significance level of &#x003b1; = 0.10 (two-sided) and the power of 1-&#x003b2; = 80% in order to find medium effects. Secondary outcomes measures including change in obesity, ADHD symptoms, general psychopathology, health-related quality of life, neurocognitive function, chronotype, and physical fitness are explored after the end of the intervention and at the 12-week follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This is the first pilot RCT on the use of BLT and EI in combination with mobile health-based monitoring and reinforcement targeting the prevention of co-morbid depression and obesity in adolescents and young adults with ADHD.

With a ~&#x02009;5% prevalence in childhood and ~&#x02009;3% in adulthood, ADHD is among the most common psychiatric disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Being a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder with childhood onset, ADHD is also often the entry point into a trajectory defined by a high risk for co-morbid conditions. Co-morbidity is a hallmark of adult ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]: around 85% of adults with ADHD suffer from at least one co-morbid psychiatric disorder including, most often, mood (~&#x02009;60%), anxiety (~&#x02009;30%), substance use disorders (~&#x02009;45%), and personality disorders (~&#x02009;35%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Children and adolescents with ADHD are at high risk of developing these psychiatric conditions, specifically depression, when they reach adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, the prevalence of obesity, which is about 40% higher in children and adolescents with ADHD compared to individuals without ADHD, is further increased during adulthood (about 70% higher in adults with ADHD compared with individuals without ADHD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Thus, obesity&#x02014;accompanied by an increased risk of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease&#x02014;can be regarded as an important somatic sequel of ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Co-morbid psychiatric and somatic conditions significantly increase disease burden leading to higher rates of detrimental outcomes on health (i.e. more than doubling mortality rates) and socioeconomic status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Therefore, effective treatments of ADHD&#x02019;s co-morbid disorders, specifically depression and obesity, are urgently needed. Moreover, prevention of these co-morbid conditions during the potentially sensitive phase of adolescence and young adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] is of upmost importance.</p><p id="Par65">Stimulant medication (e.g. methylphenidate) is the first-line pharmacologic treatment of the core symptoms of ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, their effects on co-morbid depression and obesity are largely unclear due to a lack of randomized controlled studies (RCTs). Also, the effects of non-stimulant medication (e.g. atomoxetine) on these co-morbid symptoms have been rarely studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par66">With regard to depression, evidence derived from animal models suggests that early exposure to stimulants may increase the long-term risk of depressive-like behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In contrast, retrospective and prospective clinical studies following adolescents with ADHD found none or protective effects of stimulants on the risk of later depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Stimulant medication has also been associated with reduced rates of concurrent depression and suicide-related events in patients with ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In contrast, atomoxetine has not been shown to be effective in improving co-occurring depressive symptoms in adolescents with ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par67">With regard to obesity, a meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies found that rates of obesity were decreased by about 40% in pharmacologically treated patients (mainly with stimulants) compared with non-pharmacologically treated ADHD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, although an anorexigenic effect of stimulants has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], to our knowledge, RCTs and prospective clinical studies targeting (1) the effects of pharmacological ADHD treatment on disordered eating and obesity in adolescents and adults with ADHD and (2) the risk for developing obesity in adulthood are lacking.</p><p id="Par68">In conclusion, the available evidence for potential protective effects of pharmacological ADHD treatments on co-occurring depressive symptoms and obesity is largely limited in adolescents and young adults with ADHD. In addition, non-adherence to medication typically increases during adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], further complicating effective treatment and prevention of ADHD co-morbidities during this particularly risky developmental phase. Therefore, alternative or adjunct non-pharmacological interventions to treat and prevent ADHD and its co-occurring symptoms are needed for this population.</p><p id="Par69">Only few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in adolescents with ADHD taking co-morbid conditions into account. The available evidence suggests some benefit of skills training coupled with parent and teacher training for academic and organizational skills, whereas effects on core ADHD as well as on co-occurring emotional and behavioral symptoms have been inconsistent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Manualized cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) combining operant (i.e. skills training) with cognitive strategies (i.e. cognitive restructuring) is another treatment option that has been assessed in RCTs in adolescents and adults with ADHD. The findings of the few studies consistently reported beneficial effects on core ADHD symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] which were accompanied by additional improvements of co-morbid symptoms, such as depressive, anxiety, and oppositional-defiant symptoms, organizational skills, and functional impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Preliminary data suggest that adolescents with co-morbid depression and anxiety might benefit most from manualized CBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], a finding that warrants further investigation.</p><p id="Par70">Taken together, the development of effective pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments to improve and prevent co-morbid depression and obesity in adolescents and adults with ADHD is still in its infancy. Guidelines for treatment and prevention of co-morbid depression and obesity in adolescents and young adults with ADHD are not yet available. Therefore, a wider range of treatment and prevention approaches need to be evaluated in RCTs and these interventions should directly target the known pathophysiological mechanisms of ADHD and its co-morbidities. Following these goals, the present phase-IIa trial aimed at establishing feasibility and effect sizes of two kinds of non-pharmacological interventions&#x02014;physical exercise (exercise intervention [EI]) and bright light therapy (BLT)&#x02014;in order to prevent the development and progression of depression and obesity in adolescents and young adults with ADHD.</p><p id="Par71">Physical exercise is thought to directly modulate a dopamine (DA) dysregulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] which has been established as a key pathophysiological mechanism underlying ADHD but also plays a role in mood disorders (especially in anhedonic behavior) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and obesity, conceptualized as addictive food intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Following the idea of a shared DA dysregulation that can be modulated by physical exercise, therapeutic effects of this intervention on ADHD symptoms and co-morbid depression and obesity can be hypothesized.</p><p id="Par72">Previously, the effectiveness of physical exercise in reducing depressive symptoms has been demonstrated in mildly and moderately depressed adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. It is also known that physical exercise and higher cardiorespiratory fitness attenuates the health risks of obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Physical exercise interventions have been successfully implemented in programs to prevent obesity in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and have been shown to effectively reduce weight in overweight and obese adults and adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Moreover, physical fitness has been associated with improved cognitive function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. With regard to ADHD, some evidence suggests that physical exercise improves neurocognitive function in children with ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], and therefore has been discussed as a potential protective factor for ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Specifically, physical exercise may release DA in the brain, improving attention and cognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], and therefore it may be used to regulate hyperactivity as well as inattentive symptoms in people with ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. These previous findings strongly suggest that physical exercise bears the potential of improving and/or preventing the core symptoms of ADHD; however, its effects on obesity and depression await systematic investigation in patients with ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].</p><p id="Par73">BLT is thought to modulate the circadian (CIRCA) system dysfunctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]&#x02014;another key pathophysiological mechanism possibly linking ADHD to co-morbid symptoms of depression and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Following the idea of a shared CIRCA dysregulation possibly associated with the striatal dopaminergic system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] that can be modulated by BLT, therapeutic effects of this intervention on ADHD symptoms as well as co-morbid depression and obesity can be expected.</p><p id="Par74">In ADHD, circadian system dysfunctions are indicated by phase delays in the sleep/wake cycle with changes in diurnal preference towards greater eveningness, nocturnal rise in melatonin, and early morning increase in cortisol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Physiologically, when administered in the early morning, BLT suppresses the night-time melatonin production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>] and decreases the cortisol levels that usually peak after waking up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Hence, with morning light administration, the wake-time can be shifted to an earlier time (phase advance) and circadian rhythms can be stabilized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. BLT has been shown to be efficacious for the treatment of seasonal and non-seasonal depression in adults and adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>], whereas findings on the prevention of seasonal affective disorder have been inconclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Accumulating evidence also suggests its efficacy in eating disorders and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. In patients with ADHD, a recent study demonstrated that morning BLT advanced sleep timing which was associated with decreased ADHD symptoms, specifically hyperactivity and impulsivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. One open-label trial also examined the potential of BLT on improving co-morbid depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Three weeks of morning BLT advanced the circadian phase in ADHD adults as measured by a questionnaire and led to significant reductions in both subjective and objective measures of core ADHD symptoms as well as depressive symptoms. Together, these findings suggest that chronobiological therapies bear substantial innovation potential, but RCTs are needed to systematically test their feasibility and effectiveness on improving ADHD and co-morbid depression and obesity in adolescents and young adults.</p><p id="Par75">Importantly, targeting adolescents and young adults with these interventions implies specific problems, as this age group usually has little motivation for lifestyle change. Therefore, the PROUD trial will make use of cutting edge mobile technology, which is generally viewed very favorably by this age group, assuming that this might booster motivation. Both interventions will be supported by a mobile health (m-health) application that monitors physical exercise, light exposure, and related parameters and feeds them back to the user to improve motivation for change. A recent meta-analysis has concluded that reinforcement-based exercise interventions using m-health approaches improve effects on weight loss in obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Although commercial apps for mental disorders which have no empirical evidence are omnipresent, scientific studies using m-health applications as a tool to monitor and reinforce interventions in mental disorders, specifically ADHD, are largely lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>].</p><p id="Par76">In conclusion, the aim of the present multicenter, prospective, pilot, observer-blinded, parallel-group (allocation ratio 1:1:1), phase-IIa RCT is to establish feasibility and effect sizes of two add-on ten-week interventions&#x02014;EI and BLT in combination with m-Health-based reinforcement&#x02014;targeting the prevention of the development and progression of co-morbid depression and obesity in adolescents and young adults aged 14 &#x02013; &#x0003c;&#x02009;30 years with ADHD. Both interventions are risk-free, cost-effective, easy-to-use, and portable, and therefore can be easily implemented in the daily life of adolescents and young adults. If at least medium effects can be established with regard to the prevention of depressive symptoms and obesity, a larger scale confirmatory phase-III trial may be warranted.</p><p id="Par77">It is hypothesized that the two manualized ten-week interventions will result in a smaller increase of depressive symptoms and obesity compared to a treatment as usual (TAU) control condition. In addition, pre-existing depressive symptoms and obesity are expected to decrease after ten weeks of either BLT or EI compared to TAU. TAU includes ten weeks of stable pharmacotherapy, group-based or individual CBT (not including elements of BLT or EI). To assess the stability of these secondary prevention effects, follow-up assessment will be done 12 weeks after the end of the intervention. Furthermore, immediate and long-term intervention effects on core ADHD symptoms, general psychopathological symptoms, health-related quality of life, neurocognitive function, chronotype, body-related measures such as blood pressure and heart rate, physical fitness, and hormone concentrations will be assessed. Variables possibly moderating treatment effect, including age, sex, medication, physical fitness and activity, daily light exposure, chronotype, and mood regulation will be explored as well as variables possibly mediating treatment effects, such as reward processing, stress reactivity, and compliance with the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par78">This protocol is presented in accordance with the 2013 SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) Statement (See Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for the populated SPIRIT Checklist) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study setting</title><p id="Par79">The trial is performed by close cooperation of four large European clinical centers: Goethe University Hospital Frankfurt, Germany (Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatics and Psychotherapy, and Department of Psychiatry, Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy); Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands (Karakter Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and Department of Psychiatry); Vall d&#x02019;Hebron Research Institute (Group of Psychiatry, Mental Health and Addiction), Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; and Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King&#x02019;s College London (Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre), UK.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p id="Par80">Participants&#x02019; inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

The exact time of day of implementation (either during the morning between 06:00 and 08:00 am or the evening between&#x000a0;06:00 and 08:00 pm and) is determined by the type of chronotype (morning or evening type) of each study participant determined by the Morningness&#x02013;Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. The light therapy device is handed over by trained psychologists or psychiatrists along with an introduction to the operation and how to carry out the light therapy at home. When receiving light therapy, participants sit approximately 50&#x02013;75 cm from the light box, facing the illumination and glancing at the light occasionally. Participants are encouraged to read, watch TV, or work on a computer while the bright light is directed at their eyes.

These guidelines are based on a systematic review of &#x0003e;&#x02009;2000 references and are the basic platform for designing any exercise intervention. In accordance with the guidelines, most of the time during the exercise sessions is spent in aerobic exercise of moderate-to-vigorous intensity and strength activities. The physical exercise intervention consists in training three days a week for ten weeks. Participants will perform three days of proposed aerobic activities and on two of these days they will also do muscle-strengthening exercises. Specifically, a training day consists of: (1) a 5-min warm-up period; (2) 10&#x02013;35 min of muscle-strength training on two of the three days; (3) 20&#x02013;40 min of aerobic training; and (4) 5 min of flexibility/stretching cool-down. During the course of the ten weeks, the duration and intensity of the exercises increases gradually by combining number of exercises, repetitions, rests, and frequency.</p><p id="Par83">(1) The warm-up consists of doing an activity at a slower speed or lower intensity. A warm-up before moderate or vigorous intensity aerobic activity allows a gradual increase in heart rate and breathing at the start of the episode of activity. Warm-up includes light walking and joint mobilization of the upper (neck, shoulders) and lower limbs (hips, knees, and ankles). (2) The muscle-strength training includes whole-body exercises, which incorporate push-ups, front plank, lunge, chair squat, hip thrust, etc. (3) Aerobic activities are physical activities in which people move their large muscles in a rhythmic manner for a sustained period. Aerobic activity makes a person&#x02019;s heart beat more rapidly to meet the demands of the body&#x02019;s movement. Running, brisk walking, bicycling, playing basketball, dancing, and swimming are all examples of aerobic activities. (4) A cool-down after activity allows a gradual decrease at the end of the episode. The cool-down period includes breathing, stretching, and relaxing exercises.</p><p id="Par84">The participants can decide which days of the week they want to perform the physical exercises. Participants are recommended to complete training sessions separated by 48-h rest periods whenever possible. Not all participants will have the same fitness level at the beginning of the intervention. Consequently, and in order to ensure compliance by all participants, we prescribe three physical exercise programs of differing intensity based on the participant&#x02019;s baseline cardiorespiratory fitness. In particular, we use the Chester Step Test, which is included in the pre-test measurements for that task, to assess the baseline cardiorespiratory fitness level. The Chester Step Test can predict maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). Based on the value obtained in the Chester Step Test, participants are allocated to one of the three exercises programs (light, moderate, or high intensity). All three exercise programs have the same warm-up and cool-down exercises. The participants do the same exercise program proposed at baseline during the ten-week intervention.</p><p id="Par85">Instruction, monitoring, and feedback are realized by the m-health system including a smartphone (Motorola Moto G3) equipped with the m-health app (movisensXS software, movisens GmbH, 2016), SD cards to store the exercise videos, as well as an activity sensor (LightMove 3 wrist, movisens GmbH, 2016) equipped with a mobile sensor for the acquisition of physical activity (LightMove 3 wrist, movisens GmbH, 2016, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The sensor is equipped with a Bluetooth Smart interface and offers the possibility of doing online analysis of data on the sensor. The sensor records the raw data of three-dimensional (3D) acceleration, barometric air pressure, and temperature. From these data, secondary parameters such as activity class, body position, steps, energy expenditure, and metabolic equivalents can be calculated with the movisens DataAnalyzer software. The sensor can be fixed with a band at the wrist. Participants are asked to wear the sensor daily (24 h) during the ten-week intervention period. Participants are introduced to the usage of the m-Health app by trained psychologists or psychiatrists and a user&#x02019;s guide is handed over.</p><p id="Par86">Strengthening exercises are presented in the form of video sessions on the smartphones which are executed while watching the videos. The videos present an exercise specialist who carries out the different physical exercises proposed and subtitles showing graphical description, intensity, and rest of each exercise. The m-health app also allows monitoring when participants start and stop their aerobic and strengthening exercises; in addition, the EI is monitored by the activity sensor. Acoustic signals to remind participants of their EI as well as individual feedback (a reward summary including information on duration of the excises, movement acceleration intensity, and number of steps accompanied by a motivational message) are provided by the m-health app at the end of each day. Physicians or therapists will not receive this feedback.

The BLT device implemented in this study (Chronolux Medic-4) uses UV and infrared (IR) filtered therapeutic light (10,000 lx) and is thus safe for the eyes and skin. If side effects occur (e.g. nausea, headache, eyestrain), they are usually mild and short-lived [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. In rare circumstances, BLT can trigger a manic episode in bipolar disorder, which is therefore an exclusion criterion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Regarding the EI arm of the intervention, it should be said that the risks associated with exercise are directly related to the &#x0201c;dose&#x0201d; of exercise and top athletes are at a high risk of suffering different types of injuries. However, in this study, the exercise administered will be recreational and only small injuries (e.g. ankle sprain) might occur with a comparable probability to school recess (in the case of adolescent participants) or in any daily activity. If any undesirable effect occurs, this will be reported as an adverse event (AE) and reported to the local primary investigator and to the principal investigator (PI) who will decide about withdrawal of participants from the clinical trial (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).

T3 (mid-intervention assessment) will take place five weeks after T2 (&#x000b1;&#x02009;3 days). This mid-intervention assessment aims at obtaining the primary and secondary outcome measures during the ongoing trial to get some information on participants dropping out from the study before T4 (duration of T3 = approximately 3 h for adults and children/parents including breaks). Experimental groups will continue with the interventions for another five weeks while the control group continues with TAU. After ten weeks of intervention or TAU (control group) (five weeks after T3 &#x000b1;&#x02009;3 days), primary and secondary outcome measures are assessed again (duration = approximately 4 h for adults and children/parents including breaks), followed by a one-week post-intervention assessment with the m-health system including the same parameters as during the baseline m-health assessment. Saliva will be taken during one day of the one-week period (using the same procedure as during the baseline assessment) in the Frankfurt subgroup. One week after T4, participants will be contacted via email to administer the RAVLT recognition subtest. To assess the stability of the therapy effects, the study also includes a follow-up (T5) assessment 12&#x02013;14 weeks after T4 (T5, duration = approximately 4 h for adults and children/parents including breaks). One week after T5, participants will be contacted via email to administer the RAVLT recognition subtest.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Trial time flow.

The sample size calculation is based on the expectation to find a clinically relevant medium effect size (d = 0.5) with a two-sample t-test of at least one of the two interventions compared to TAU on the primary endpoint. As this is a pilot study to establish effect sizes, the sample size is planned at the liberal significance level of &#x003b1; = 0.10 (two-sided) and the power of 1-&#x003b2; = 80%. Taking into consideration the three-group design and an expected drop-out rate of about 30%, n = 219 participants will be allocated and analyzed. Based on the information received from the clinical study centers, it is expected that about 25&#x02013;35% of the screened participants cannot be included in the study due to violation of inclusion/exclusion criteria. Hence, n = 330 participants will be assessed for eligibility. It can be expected that application of an analysis of covariance in the evaluation will reduce the standard deviation thus increasing the actual power of the study.

Participants are recruited by flyers, public notices, and personal contact from inpatient and outpatient departments of the participating sites, as well as by public announcements, press releases, newspaper advertisements, and Internet/social media campaigns. Measures are in place to mitigate risk in the case of under-recruitment: reimbursement to individual centers will be done in the form of case payment, as stipulated in an agreement before beginning of the trial; pre-financing is carried out on an annual basis. In the case of a participating site falling short of the recruitment plan, the CoCA (EU project Comorbid Conditions of Attention deficit&#x000a0;/ hyperactivity disorders) steering committee, advised by an independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB, see below), reserves the right to stop study participation for this site and either increase recruitment numbers at the remaining sites or include a new recruitment site.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Assignment of interventions</title><p id="Par95">After written informed consent, participants are successively randomized to one of the three groups (BLT, EI, TAU).

Randomization is a block randomization per center and is done in an allocation ratio of 1:1:1 with fixed block length and stratified for each participating center. The randomization list will be kept in safe and confidential custody at the Institute of Medical Biometry and Informatics (IMBI). Participants withdrawn from the trial will retain their identification codes (e.g. screening number, if already given). New participants must always be allocated a new identification code. As the proposed study is a non-pharmacological therapy intervention study, blinding of participants as well as therapists is not possible. However, the design is observer-blinded. Clinicians, who assess the primary outcome measure, the IDS-C30 total score, and the ADHD Rating Scale total score, are blind to treatment allocation. Therefore, at each site, randomization will be done only by the trial coordinator who is also the only person who will manage the investigator site file (ISF). Clinicians are not involved in the randomization procedure and are not allowed to receive information about group assignment. Clinicians will be provided with data recording sheets and data will be entered into the CRF by the trial coordinator.

Gender effects are of particular interest. If there are not enough events per category for the different covariates, gender effects will be excluded from the MMRM analysis and investigated in a secondary analysis. The MMRM approach, by which the missing values with respect to post-baseline primary outcomes are dealt with, demonstrates favorable characteristics in terms of type I error rate, power, and bias of estimates compared to alternative methods dealing with missing values, such as last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>].</p><p id="Par114">The first (global) hypothesis to be tested states that the change in the IDS-C<sub>30</sub> total score is equal in all three treatment groups: H0: &#x003bc;I1 = &#x003bc;I2 = &#x003bc;TAU.

With regard to BLT, only one open-label trial exists and reported positive effects on core ADHD symptoms and co-morbid depressive symptoms in adult patients with ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. With regard to physical exercise, preliminary findings in children with ADHD point to its effectiveness mainly on core clinical ADHD and cognitive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Furthermore, according to this systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], higher-quality intervention research is needed including large sample sizes, adequate control groups, observer-blinded assessments, and the use of a wide variety of clinical, cognitive, behavioral, and physical/(neuro)physiological outcome measures. The PROUD study is a prospective RCT that fulfils rigorous methodological requirements by including a large sample of 219 participants at four study centers, a TAU control condition, and observer-blinded assessment of the primary outcome measure. This is a critical aspect because participants cannot be blinded with regard to the intervention. Also, an automated online randomization procedure is clearly defined and reflects the study design with respect to the multicenter study and the group-based randomization. The statistical analysis also takes the different study centers into account. A strong advantage of this trial is the inclusion of several additional secondary outcome measures to assess immediate as well as long-term intervention effects on obesity (measured in terms of several body composition parameters), ADHD-specific symptoms, general psychopathological symptoms, health-related quality of life, neurocognitive functions, chronotype, and body-related measures such as blood pressure and heart rate, physical fitness, and concentrations of hormones. In addition, variables possibly moderating or mediating treatment effects will be explored.</p><p id="Par129">The PROUD trial also bears substantial innovation potential by making use of a mobile technology developed specifically for this trial by the KIT. Both interventions will be supported by the m-health application which has three strong advantages. First, targeting adolescents and young adults with BLT and EI implies specific problems, as this age group usually has little motivation for lifestyle change. The mobile technology is generally viewed very favorably by this age group and therefore it is reasonable that the app-based instruction reminders and reinforcement strategies booster their motivation for change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Second, the sensor allows recording of relevant parameters such as physical activity and light exposure throughout the study phase which makes it possible to monitor compliance during the intervention. Third, the m-health system will be used to assess physical activity, light exposure and additional cognitive-emotional parameters (i.e. reward processing and stress reactivity) online at home pre- and post-intervention. These parameters will then be included in the analyses as variables moderating or mediating the treatment effects.</p><p id="Par130">The manualized interventions, combining BLT and EI with m-health-based monitoring and reinforcement to increase the participant&#x02019;s motivation and compliance are easy to implement both for the clinicians and the participants. The interventions are portable, cost-effective, and almost entirely free of side effects. Therefore, if the PROUD trial can prove their feasibility and efficacy in adolescents and young adults with ADHD, they have the potential to act as adjuncts to treatment as usual or even as primary treatments in the future.</p><p id="Par131">In conclusion, the high risk for co-morbid depression and obesity for adolescents with ADHD has been increasingly recognized and guidelines for treatment and prevention are urgently needed. The PROUD trial is a rigorous designed RCT on m-health-based BLT and EI to provide first insights into the feasibility and efficacy of these non-pharmacological interventions to prevent co-morbid depression and obesity in adolescents and young adults with ADHD. If at least medium effects can be established with regard to the prevention of depressive symptoms and obesity, a larger scale confirmatory phase-III trial may be warranted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec33"><p>
