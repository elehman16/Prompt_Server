the population in North America for the treatment of different ailments<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>. In Brazil complementary therapies are known as Complementary and Integrative
Practices (PIC) based on Official Government Notice 971 from the Ministry of Health
(2006) and it is made up of group of therapies that includes: acupuncture,
auriculotherapy, homeopathy, hydrotherapy, herbal medicine, eastern massage, oriental
physical exercises like Tai Chi Chuan, Lian Gong, Qi Gong, amongst others<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>Despite the advances in conventional western medicine, the interest for the use of PIC
has increased principally in developed countries. It was observed that in 2012 33.2% of
adults in North America used some form of complementary health therapy. The therapies
that encompass mind and body that are commonly sought after by adults have been yoga,
the use of chiropractic and osteopathic practices, meditation and massage therapy<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>The results of a piece of research conducted in 2007 in the United States allowed us to
estimate that 18 million people over the age of 18 had used massage therapy in the last
12 months<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>. The massage therapy has been offered with a preference to hospitalized patients
to support the management of symptoms of pain, anxiety and tension<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>. Also, what was shown was a reduction in lower back pain, improvements in work
related activities and improvements in the quality of life of the nursing teams in the
general hospitals in Brazil<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>In the classification of complementary therapies proposed by the <italic>National Center
for Complementary and Alternative Medicine</italic> (NCCAM), massage belongs to the
sub-category of mind-body therapies. In general, the therapies put pressure on, rub and
massage the muscles and other soft tissue in the body. The scientific investigations on
massage are preliminary and conflicting, but the studies show benefits in relation to
the pain and other associated symptoms. A large part of the evidence suggests that the
effects are short term and that the people need to continue having sessions to maintain
the benefits that are received<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>.</p><p>In post-modern society, the high levels of stress have become such a problem for health
that it is very common and what can be seen is that the excessive and continuous effect
can compromise health having a triggering effect in the development of innumerable
illnesses. They can affect the quality of life and the productivity of human beings
which has been generating major interests in relation to causes and the methods for
their reduction<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">

anxiety include psychiatric treatment and pharmacotherapy. Amongst the PIC that can
contribute to preventing diseases and reducing the levels of stress and anxiety, one can
put the spotlight on massage<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> and Reiki that has been the subject of research as a complementary energy
therapy that can help to strengthen the capacity of the body to cure itself. There is a
growing interest amongst nurses for the use of Reiki in assisting patients especially in
relation to self-help. Research being integrative and revisionary selected
investigations using Reiki to reduce stress, to relax, to treat depression, pain and the
healing of injuries<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>To evaluate the effectiveness of massage and reiki in the reduction of stress and
anxiety in clients at the Institute for Integrated and Oriental Therapy in Sao Paulo
(Brazil). </p></sec><sec><title>Material and Method</title><p>There was a clinically controlled test conducted in a random way that was parallel with
three study groups: Massage + Rest Group (G1), Massage + Reiki (G2) and a Control Group
without treatment (G3). For the Massage + Rest Group (G1) the Anm&#x000e1; protocol was applied
followed by 10 minutes of rest. The Massage + Reiki group (G2) received the massage
protocol and the Reiki treatment. The Control group (G3) did not receive an intervention
protocol. </p><p>The sessions took place two times per week totaling eight sessions in one month of
services. To guarantee the uniformity of the treatment offered the team of 11 people
were trained by the Institute for Integrated and Oriental Therapy (ITIO). They were
students studying massage and they conducted the collection of data that was monitored
by the teachers who had experience in these techniques. </p><p>The population that was studied was made up of volunteers that sought ambulatory care at
the ITIO and for military personnel from the IV-Regional Area Command Force in S&#x000e3;o Paulo
(IV-COMAR) located next to ITIO. The participants fulfilled the following inclusion
criteria: having a score between 37 to 119 points based on Vasconcelo's Stress Symptoms
List (LSS)<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>. The following people were excluded: pregnant women, participants and military
personnel from the IV COMAR that had holidays booked for the period of the research or
who were on sick leave, those that started to use anxiolytics and antidepressants at the
commencement of the research, those that stated they felt discomfort during the massage
sessions or who had some sort of tissue injury in the areas that were being massaged. </p><p>In the recruitment phases 141 volunteers on 30 June 2015 were selected, by the team of
teachers that were in charge and 13 student collectors from ITIO were used. Of these
141, only 122 were subject to random blocks, from the program called <italic>Research
Randomizer Quick Tutorial</italic>
<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>. The data was tabulated by the team on Excel spreadsheets and was subsequently
analyzed using the program SPSS 19.0. The minimum number of 30 participants for the
group was determined by the analysis of the sample (with the power of 80% and a level of
confidence of 95%). </p><p>In addition to the LSS, a questionnaire was used with socio-demographic data and the
Trace State Anxiety Inventory. Amongst the tools used for the evaluation of anxiety, the
Trace State Anxiety Inventory (IDATE) is considered the gold standard and has been
widely used in different studies for the reduction of anxiety<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>. The anxiety-state varies in intensity and can modify itself in time, referring
to acute and momentary situations. On the other hand, anxiety-trace relates to the
individual difference and are generally more stable. It is characterized by a tendency
to react to situations perceived as threatening or provoking anxiety. </p><p>

</p><p>Many of the techniques used in massage and in this study, were focused on the Japanese
massage Anm&#x000e1; which is one of the most popular massage techniques in Japan. The Anm&#x000e1; aims
to re-balance the energy based on pressure and rubbing in specific areas on the
body<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>The use of Anm&#x000e1; involves kneading and putting pressure on the back, neck, thorax,
lumbar, gluteus, rubbing the thighs down to the feet (for 20 minutes), using the special
meridian line from the bladder and small intestine. The sequence includes: pressure with
the palm of the hand on the spine (2 times), pressure on the paravertebral (twice),
kneading on the paravertebral (twice), kneading from the start of the spine from the
scapula to the top angle of the scapula (twice), pressure on the medium portion of the
trapezium (twice), kneading on the medium portion of the trapezium (twice), pressure on
the occipital line (twice), kneading with all fingers on cervical spine (3 times),
pressure on the gluteus - 2 lines (twice), kneading on the gluteus - 2 lines (twice),
pressure on the front part of the thigh - 2 lines (twice), pressure on the popliteal
line (twice), kneading in the supra-carpian region on the sural triceps - (twice),
pressure on the incept region of the feet - 3 lines (twice) and kneading on the incept
region of the feet - 3 lines (twice). Pressure is placed for approximately one second.
Kneading is defined as the carrying out of three circular movements when putting on
pressure. </p><p>With reference to, Reiki this is a complementary health approach in which the users
place their hands lightly on or above the person with the objective of curing the
person. Reiki is supposed to mobilize the "vital universal energy" that gives support to
the innate and natural abilities of the body and mind supplying force, harmony and
equilibrium. Its origins go back thousands of years from Tibet and it was established in
1800 by a Japanese monk called Dr. Mikao Usui<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>The Reiki protocol considered the laying of hands for 2.5 minutes on every position:
eyes, occipital region, laryngeal region and on the breastplate on the heart region
(during a total of 10 minutes) for the re-equilibrium of the chakras which are important
for the mental and emotional state. </p><p>The data was noted down for the relative frequency and the measurements of central
tendencies. The comparison between the groups was done through Pearson's chi-squared
test and the qualitative variables and the ANOVA to test the average differences. Also,
the Levene test was used to check the variance equality. To compare the before and
after, the ANOVA test was used for repeated measurements and the Tukey test for multiple
comparisons. The size of the effect of the interventions was measured through the Cohen
d test and the adopted significance level equaled &#x003b1; = 5%.</p><p>The projects theme was "Applicability of the Complementary Practices for the reduction
of pain, stress, anxiety and to improve the quality of life" to which the present study
is connected which was approved by the Ethics Committee on Research in the School of
Nursing at USP (n&#x000ba; 1.105.429/2015). The participants filled in and signed the consent
form when being recruited to take part. There were no losses or damages due to the
study. </p></sec><sec><title>Results </title><p>The study finally settled with 101 participants. The majority were female (66%) with a

</p><p>Quantitatively the symptoms that obtained statistical differences and significant
reductions were greater for the Massage and Reiki Group (2) in relation to the Control:
being worn out at the end of the day, lack of appetite, tightened jaws, waking up tired
in the morning, feeling tired, insomnia, anger, irritation, speechless, watery eyes and
obscured vison. With reference to the symptoms "having nightmares", only Group 2 was
able to improve in relation to Group 1. </p><p>No reports of undesirable effects and injuries were mentioned for each of the groups.
</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The general stress symptoms were reduced with the treatment demonstrating that stress
affects the whole of the body resulting in physiological and psychological changes. With
stress the cerebral cortex sends signals to the autonomous nervous system turning the
sympathetic into being active. This results in the increase of cardiac frequency and
changes in the variability of the frequency reducing the flow of peripheral blood and
the flow of renal blood. This increases the blood pressure and the vascular
resistance<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>Moderate massaging seems to reduce depression, anxiety, cardiac frequency and the
patterns of changes of the electroencephalogram in response to the relaxation that is
achieved. This can also lead to an increase in vagal activities and a reduction in the
levels of cortisol. In stress data from MRI scans, the scans suggested that the massages
using moderate pressure reached the cerebral regions including the amygdala, the
hypothalamus, the cingulated cortex and all of the areas involved in stress and
emotional regulation<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Massage therapy comprises complementary techniques which can be used as a treatment on
its own or associated with other practices which is normally the case in daily clinics
being offered to their users. In a study that explored massage therapy combined with
meditation it concluded that the results were better for the massage and meditation
groups than when compared with the group that received just massage therapy although
there were no statistical differences between both groups. The 40 participants in the
study were women in the post-operational phase of a mastectomy after having had breast
cancer and they showed reductions in the symptoms of stress and anxiety amongst them
were: insomnia, a state of alert, fatigue, tension, pain and they referred to relaxation
as having given them a better mood and more energy based on the points on the visual
analogical scale for each one of the symptoms<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>In this study massage associated with reiki increased by 24% the reduction in the stress
levels and 16% for the IDATE-state in relation to the Massage and Rest group (G1) also
it went to 33.0% for stress and 21.0% for the IDATE-state. </p><p>One can consider that there only being 10 minutes of Reiki post-massage with positive
results when it was used in combination (Massage + Reiki) means that an association of
these two energy techniques allowed for a reduction to be had in the time for the
application of Reiki. The other studies used approximately 20 to 30 minutes in the Reiki
sessions as the only technique. In a study where the sessions were 20 minutes the
intervention showed positive effects in the reduction of blood pressure being a
complementary technique for the control of hypertension<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>19</sup>
</xref>. Another study evaluated the effect of 30 minutes of Reiki in the control of
anxiety, pain and well-being for patients with cancer (118 patients) in chemotherapy
treatment. The evaluations before and after the application of Reiki promoted
improvements in well-being, the quality of sleep, relaxation, the alleviation of pain
and reductions in the level of anxiety<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>20</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The immediate results of Reiki were seen in relation to cardiac beats, the levels of
cortisol and the body temperature of professionals with Burnout Syndrome. They suggest
that Reiki has an effect on the parasympathetic nervous system when applied to health
care professionals<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref>. Reiki has an important advantage amongst complementary therapies as it can be
self-applied and it was used in this way in research with 20 university students for the
program on the reduction of stress and relaxation based on accompanying its effects for
20 weeks<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>22</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>Positive symptoms were only seen for the Massage + Reiki Group (G2) relating to physical
and emotional state with special attention being drawn to the reduction of nightmares
and the reduction of insomnia. However, there is a long journey to be made for the
scientific community to recognize the effects of Reiki on its own or as a practice that
is integrated with other PIC techniques. A systematic review of Reiki leads us to the
conclusion that the evidence is insufficient to say that Reiki is an effective treatment
after twenty-three random clinical sessions based on the electronic data<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>23</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>Also, the literature is controversial on the issue with reference to the effect of Reiki
on the levels of cortisol. In a clinical test with health psychology students no
significant changes were found in the levels of cortisol after the application of
Reiki<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>24</sup>
</xref>. The studies also suggest that one single Reiki sessions is not sufficient to
immediately reduce the levels of saliva cortisol. Also, it is not known if there would
be changes in the concentrations of saliva cortisol and post-intervention taking place
two, six or twenty-four hours on health care professionals with burnout (nurses and
doctors)<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>In relation to the limitation of the present study, there was no placebo group for Reiki
and it was not possible to compare the effect of the technique in relation to the
expectation of the patients. For the next study the placebo could be used where Reiki is
not applied. The results provide incentives to carry out new research with evaluations
on physiological markers of stress and an evaluation of the time of the Reiki sessions
so that the findings can be extended to other populations. </p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Massage and massage combined with Reiki has been shown to be effective in reducing the
levels of stress and anxiety. The techniques associated with Massage + Reiki produced
better results on the variables of measurements of intervention than when conducted only
as Massage + Rest. The symptoms that resulted in positive outcomes in relation to the
Massage + Reiki intervention were physical and emotional in nature spotlighting the
all-encompassing effects of Reiki. It is therefore suggested that another study with a
placebo group for Reiki should be conducted to evaluate the technique on its own. Also,
focus should be placed in the use of physiological measures to better evaluate the
effects of the techniques on stress and anxiety. </p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>To acknowledge the students, professors and clients at the Institute for Integrated and
