The primary objective was progression-free survival (PFS) without grade 4 toxicity (G4PFS). Secondary end points were PFS, overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and safety.

Patients in the Pac+Cb+Bev arm received additional standard prophylaxis against allergic reactions according to the paclitaxel label. Randomization was stratified for disease stage (M1a versus M1b), ECOG PS, and sex. After four cycles of induction therapy every 21 days, maintenance continued until disease progression or intolerance. Planned chemotherapy doses were pemetrexed 500 mg/m<sup>2</sup>; carboplatin, area under the curve = 6, (as of December 31, 2010, maximum possible dose of 900 mg), paclitaxel 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup>; bevacizumab 15 mg/kg.</p><p>Any required dose reductions, per label indication for each drug or regimen, were maintained for the remainder of the study per CTCAE.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> A maximum of two dose reductions were permitted before the patients were discontinued from the study therapy. Bevacizumab doses were not reduced due to toxicity but bevacizumab was interrupted for any unresolved adverse events (AEs). Upon resolution of select AEs, bevacizumab was resumed at the full dose at the next cycle. The maximum allowable length of any study treatment interruption was 42 days.</p><p>The primary objective of this trial was to compare G4PFS between the two treatment arms in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> G4PFS was measured from the date of randomization to the earliest occurrence of the first of grade 4 AEs, disease progression, or death from any cause, regardless of whether or not the event leads to discontinuation. Secondary end points included PFS (gated secondary end point), OS, overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR = complete response + partial response + stable disease), and safety. Associated resource use data were also collected.</p><p>If a patient discontinued study therapy without disease progression, the tumor measurements were performed at 30 days and subsequently every 6 weeks (&#x000b1; 2 weeks) until objective disease progression.

Cox regression model (non-stratified) was used to estimate the treatment HR. Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests were used to compare differences in the ORR and DCR between the two treatment arms. The safety analysis included the maximum grade CTCAEs of laboratory and nonlaboratory events, serious AEs, treatment-emergent AEs, hospitalizations, transfusions, and the use of concomitant medications.

Among the ITT population, the use of second-line treatment was similar between the two treatment arms (47.3% in Pem+Cb versus 52.5% in Pac+Cb+Bev, <italic>p</italic> = 0.344).

This trial attempted for the first time to prospectively measure the novel primary end point of G4PFS. Although G4PFS has not been validated, a previous clinical trial that showed similar survival with pemetrexed versus docetaxel<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> was retrospectively analyzed for OS without grade 3/4 toxicity and suggested a benefit-to-risk favoring pemetrexed compared with docetaxel in the second-line treatment of patients with NSCLC.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> A similar primary end point (survival without grade 3/4 toxicity) was also used in a phase III clinical trial comparing pemetrexed/carboplatin with docetaxel/carboplatin as first-line treatment for advanced, nonsquamous NSCLC.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> This end point (survival without grade 3/4 toxicity) also has been analyzed post hoc in a large phase III trial.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> The current study prospectively evaluated PFS without grade 4 toxicity and did not show superior benefit-to-risk for Pem+Cb compared with Pac+Cb+Bev. Both the treatments showed similar severity and temporal onset of toxicity, although the specific toxicities differed between the arms. The G4PFS end point as applied here did not discriminate between different, similarly graded AEs that may have different significance for patient quality of life.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p><p>The G4PFS end point was hoped to provide an indication of toxicity and efficacy. A substantial number of patients met this end point from a toxicity standpoint although still responding to their assigned regimen and continued on study. As might be expected, the majority of non-PD G4PFS end points occurred in the first four cycles of therapy during platinum doublet/triplet treatment. This provides some reassurance about the tolerability of maintenance with either pemetrexed or bevacizumab.</p><p>Regular weekly complete blood cell counts in the experimental setting compared with clinical practice may have contributed to the observed higher incidences of laboratory toxicities, sometimes referred to as paper toxicities. If the G4PFS end point is used in future studies, consideration should be given to excluding nonclinically significant laboratory toxicities and to including some lower grade toxicities such as grade 2 neuropathy or alopecia, that are considered clinically relevant to the patients. The practice of weekly laboratory testing in asymptomatic participants in clinical trials where this is not standard in a nonstudy population treated with similar regimens should be carefully considered for future studies.</p><p>The PFS and OS values reported here are comparable with other recently reported phase III trials with pemetrexed and platinum combinations and with other chemotherapy and bevacizumab combinations.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Because of the small number of patients, we did not evaluate the differences in safety and efficacy in the &#x0003e;70 years age subgroup. Earlier studies have shown conflicting outcomes with or without differences by age groups.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> These data when analyzed will be reported elsewhere.</p><p>The efficacy of the control arm (Pac+Cb+Bev) in this study showed lower median survivals compared with previous trials<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> possibly due to differences in the study populations and smaller sample size. The estimation of median OS in the control arm was 11.66 months with 95% CI (9.17&#x02013;14.32), which is similar to the outcome in the ECOG 4599 study (12.3 months).<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>Patients experienced acceptable and expected toxicities on both the arms of this study based upon comparable rates of total AEs reported in previous pemetrexed plus platinum-based regimens<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> and bevacizumab combinations.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>Several AEs considered most important to patients<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> including grade 1 and 2 alopecia and sensory neuropathy were significantly more common with Pac+Cb+Bev than with Pem+Cb (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), whereas grade 1 nausea was significantly more common in patients receiving Pem+Cb (<italic>p</italic> = 0.003). Other grades of sensory neuropathy, febrile neutropenia, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting were similar between the treatment arms. The specific toxicity profiles and resource use differed by regimen.</p><p>In addition to the traditionally measured toxicities, financial burden is becoming recognized as an additional toxicity that may affect a patient&#x02019;s potential course of treatment or quality of life.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Using data from the PRONOUNCE trial, a post hoc cost analysis estimated differences in costs of treatment and related patient care between the two study regimens. Clinical data, resource use, and postdiscontinuation therapy data were used to estimate preprogression and postprogression inputs to which the respective 2013 unit costs were applied. The costs were obtained from three sources: Truven Health Analytics (drug wholesale acquisition costs), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (drug administration and transfusion costs), and HCUPnet (hospital charges for treating toxicities). Results suggest that the average total cost of treatment with Pem+Cb was $4,690 less than Pac+Cb+Bev ($30,334 versus $35,024), and Pem+Cb was cost-saving in 99% of 10,000 iterations of a probabilistic sensitivity analysis that used Monte Carlo methods.<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup></p><p>The recently published results for the PointBreak study comparing Pem+C+Bev followed by Pem+Bev to Pac+C+Bev followed by Bev showed no statistical difference in OS, though PFS was statistically longer in the pemetrexed arm; different toxicities were noted between the two study arms. Similarly, this PRONOUNCE trial that compared Pem+Cb followed by Pem to Pac+Cb+Bev followed by Bev demonstrated no significant difference of efficacy for OS and PFS between the treatment arms, and again different toxicities were noted. Comparison of the results of these two studies are informative when choosing a chemotherapy regimen for a given patient who may not tolerate certain regimens and reassures the clinicians that the standard of care therapy is being offered to each patient based upon individual preferences and comorbid conditions.</p><p>In conclusion, the PRONOUNCE study objective of superiority of G4PFS was not met; no superiority was observed for the standard end points such as PFS, OS, ORR, or DCR in Pem+Cb compared with Pac+Cb+Bev. The safety profiles of both the treatment regimens are reasonable, though different. Differing toxicity profiles are often a deciding factor considered by treating oncologists when choosing an effective regimen for nonsquamous NSCLC.</p></sec><sec><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This study was funded by Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN.
