The benefit of thrombolytic treatment in this particular subgroup is still a subject of debate. The purpose of this study was to compare stroke outcomes in Thai patients aged over 70 years treated with and without intravenous rtPA. This was a retrospective review of sequential cases and was not a randomized controlled study. One-hundred and five patients with acute ischemic stroke aged over 70 years who were treated with intravenous rtPA and 105 patients without rtPA treatment (control group) were included in the study. Patients&#x02019; base-line characteristics and study outcomes of interest were compared. There were significant differences in the base-line characteristics of the two groups. However, for the subgroup of patients aged over 80 years, these characteristics were similar. Those who were treated with intravenous rtPA had a higher rate of favorable outcomes (40% <italic>vs</italic> 16%; P=0.137) and a lower rate of mortality (22% <italic>vs</italic> 44%; P=0.128) than patients who did not receive rtPA treatment. In well-matched subgroups of patients aged over 80 years, our retrospective review revealed there was a trend of a higher rate of favorable outcome and lower mortality in patients receiving rtPA treatment.

Many studies have revealed a higher mortality rate and lower favorable outcome rate in patients aged over 80 years. In some studies, the rate of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) was higher in patients aged over 80 years while in others it was similar to that observed in younger patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref2 ref3 ref4 ref5"><sup>1-6</sup></xref> However, a large study and a meta-analysis have both recently shown that older patients benefit from treatment at least as much as younger patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup></p><p>Most of the data are from Western countries.

However, after the publication of the European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study III (ECASS III), and the recommendations with regard to widening the time window for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke with intravenous rtPA issued by the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> we extended the time window for treatment with rtPA to 4.5 h.

Patients with high blood pressure (systolic blood pressure &#x0003e;185 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &#x0003e;110 mmHg) were not excluded as long as blood pressure could be controlled by intravenous nicardipine (as defined by achieving target systolic blood pressure &#x0003c;185 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure &#x0003c;110 mmHg) before administration of rtPA. Abnormal findings from brain computed tomography (CT) including: i) hyperdense lesions suggestive of bleeding; and ii) hypodense lesions accounting for more than one-third of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) distribution were also contraindications for thrombolysis. Patients who were treated with intravenous rtPA (0.9 mg/kg) were admitted to an intensive care unit or stroke unit to monitor and control blood pressure with a clinical follow up for the first 24 h. The severity of the stroke was evaluated using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) by the same doctors before and after receiving rtPA. Another CT brain scan was performed within 36 h in all patients who received rtPA. However, follow-up brain CT was not routinely performed in all of those patients who were not treated with intravenous thrombolysis. The modified Rankin scale (mRS) was used to assess outcomes of the patients three months after the stroke onset. Symptomatic ICH was also classified by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders (NINDS) stroke rtPA criterion, <italic>i.e.</italic> hemorrhage associated with worsening of 1 point or more in the NIHSS score.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1"><sup>16</sup></xref> Early improvement was defined as having complete recovery or marked clinical improvement (decrease in NIHSS from baseline &#x0003e;8 points) 24 h after admission.</p><p>The base-line characteristics of patients, including age, gender, cardiovascular risk factors, blood glucose at presentation, platelet count, prothrombin time, severity of stroke, and stroke subtypes were studied. The measured outcome variables of this study were early improvement at 24 h, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, favorable outcome (mRS 0.1) and death at three months. Patients&#x02019; demographics, vascular risk factors and measured outcome variables were compared between those who were treated with and those without intravenous thrombolysis; an independent-samples t-test for continuous variables and the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test for dichotomous variables were used.

Our study showed non-significant differences in the rates of favorable outcomes, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhages and mortality in patients aged over 70 years with or without thrombolytic treatment. However, there were significant differences in several base-line characteristics between the groups. Older age, severe stroke, high blood glucose, cardioembolic stroke had been reported to be the independent factors of poor outcomes and death. Thus, it is not possible to conclude that thrombolytic treatment is ineffective in aging patients. Differences in favorable outcomes and death between those with and without rtPA treatment were obvious in subgroups of patients aged over 80 years. Patients with the rtPA treatment had a higher rate of favorable outcomes (40% <italic>vs</italic> 16%; P=0.137) and a lower rate of mortality (22% <italic>vs</italic> 44%; P=0.128) compared with those without the rtPA treatment. However, the difference did not reach statistical significance, which may largely be due to the small number of patients in this subgroup.</p><p>The mechanism of early recovery or improvement is not clearly understood.

Firstly, this was a retrospective review of sequential cases and was not a randomized controlled study. Non-thrombolytic patients (&#x0003e;70 years of age) were classified by the duration of time required to reach similar numbers to those achieved in patients treated with rtPA. Significant differences in base-line characteristics of the two groups were noted. The differences in stroke severity between the case and control groups may represent more rapid stroke awareness in patients with more severe stroke, as this subgroup of patients was more likely to receive thrombolytic treatment. However, for the subgroup of the patients aged over 80 years, characteristics were fairly similar. Second, a follow-up brain CT or MRI was not performed in some of the patients who did not receive rtPA treatment; therefore, the rate of asymptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage may be underestimated.</p><p>This is the first study in Thailand comparing stroke outcomes in aging patients with and without rtPA treatment. The study showed that the very old patients receiving rtPA did not have poorer outcomes. Further randomized controlled studies are still needed to confirm the suggested benefit of thrombolysis in aging Asian patients.</p><p>In conclusion, in subgroups of patients aged over 80 years, this retrospective review revealed that there was a trend of higher rate of favorable outcome and lower mortality in patients receiving rtPA treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Engelter</surname><given-names>ST</given-names></name><name><surname>Bonati</surname><given-names>LH</given-names></name><name><surname>Lyer</surname><given-names>PA</given-names></name></person-group>
