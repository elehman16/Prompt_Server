Radiographs from RA-BUILD baseline, and weeks 24 and 48 in RA-BEYOND were scored in the reading campaign used to generate the data for these analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study protocol and oversight</title><p>RA-BEYOND is a phase III, multicentre, extension study evaluating the long-term efficacy and safety of baricitinib (2&#x02009;mg once daily (QD) and 4&#x02009;mg QD) in patients with RA.</p><p>Patients who completed RA-BUILD and entered RA-BEYOND continued to receive the dose of baricitinib they were receiving at the end of RA-BUILD (baricitinib 2 or 4&#x02009;mg). Patients receiving placebo at the end of RA-BUILD were switched to baricitinib 4&#x02009;mg on entry into RA-BEYOND. Although patients and investigators were aware that all patients would be receiving baricitinib in the extension study, those who had not been rescued remained blinded to randomised treatment assignment from RA-BUILD. In RA-BEYOND, patients could continue to receive background open-label csDMARDs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, analgesics and/or corticosteroids (&#x02264;10&#x02009;mg of prednisone or equivalent per day) being received at the completion of RA-BUILD. Patients with a Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score&#x000a0;&#x0003e;10 at or after 3 months following enrolment into BEYOND could be rescued to baricitinib 4&#x02009;mg. After rescue, all patients would receive 4&#x02009;mg and remain blinded to their previous treatment assignment.

It was conducted in accordance with ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines and approved by the institutional review board or ethics committee for each centre. All patients provided written informed consent before the first study procedure. The study commenced in June 2013 and was ongoing at the time the present manuscript was prepared.

Radiographs were scored by two primary readers separately and independently, blinded to chronological order, patient identity and treatment group. The mean score obtained between the two readers was used in the analyses.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> Radiographic progression was determined by the change from baseline in mTSS, bone erosion and joint space narrowing. Progression versus non-progression was defined based on change from baseline in mTSS using thresholds of 0, 0.5 or the smallest detectable change (SDC). The initial radiographs taken at RA-BUILD baseline served as the baseline radiographs for comparison throughout RA-BEYOND. The time points presented in this manuscript were all relative to the RA-BUILD baseline. Radiographs were obtained at baseline, weeks&#x000a0;24 and 48. The 48-week radiographs were obtained during the RA-BEYOND study. If the patient was rescued or had an early termination visit, radiographs were obtained only if the most recent radiographs were &#x0003e;12 weeks earlier. All these radiographs were analysed in a single reading campaign.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Safety</title><p>Clinical laboratory tests, vital signs and other safety assessments were performed at scheduled visits.

Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to analyse radiographic progression, and a logistic regression model was used to analyse percentage of patients with no progression of structural joint damage, with baseline value (for ANCOVA model only), treatment, region and centrally&#x000a0;confirmed presence of baseline joint erosions in the model. The Fisher exact test was used for categorical safety data or when sample size requirements for the aforementioned logistic regression model were not met. Analyses were assessed with a significance level of 0.05 (two-sided). The SDC in mTSS was computed from the variability in week 0 to 24 or to week 48 (1&#x02009;year) changes in scores assigned by the two blinded readers.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
</p><p>Patients who were rescued or discontinued in either RA-BUILD or RA-BEYOND, or did not enter RA-BEYOND, were defined thereafter as non-responders (non-responder imputation) for categorical clinical efficacy outcomes. To account for missing mTSS and data obtained after rescue or treatment switch, data were analysed using (1) linear extrapolation (LE) and (2) observed/last observation carried forward (LOCF). The LE method used radiographic data at baseline and the last radiograph taken before discontinuation, rescue or switch to impute missing data. The observed/LOCF method used all available observed data, including after rescue or switch, with patients analysed according to original treatment assignment. The result obtained from the last obtained radiograph after baseline was used for subsequent timepoints. Safety observations were analysed by assigned treatment until the time of rescue or switch or completion of the treatment period.

Both 2&#x02009;and 4&#x02009;mg doses of baricitinib were associated with structural benefit, but the 4&#x02009;mg dose demonstrated more consistent reduction of structural progression when examined using both the LE and observed/LOCF analysis methods at both timepoints. The effect was seen for both the erosion and the joint space narrowing score. All radiographs, including baseline and week 24, were re-read as part of the scoring of the week 48 data. The change in mTSS at week 24 is consistent with the original reductions in structural progression reported in Dougados <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic> 2017.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Additionally, patients initially randomised to placebo who then switched to active treatment after 24 weeks had a larger increase in mTSS at the 48-week timepoint than patients who were initially randomised to treatment with baricitinib. This is consistent with previous findings that earlier control of disease is associated with reduced radiographic progression.</p><p>Treatment with baricitinib not only reduced the rate of radiographic progression at week 48, but clinical efficacy (SDAI and HAQ-DI) was also maintained out to week 48 (online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary table S2</xref>).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> No new safety signals appeared through week 48. Rates of SAEs (including infections) and TEAEs were higher in the baricitinib 4&#x02009;mg group than the baricitinib 2&#x02009;mg group during weeks 0&#x02013;48, while AEs leading to discontinuation were similar across baricitinib groups at week 48.</p><p>These findings are consistent with those seen in other studies evaluating the effects of treatment with baricitinib on structural progression over 1&#x02009;year.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> For a molecule to be classified as a DMARD, an ability to inhibit the rate of radiographic progression of structural joint damage must be shown.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> These data provide further support that baricitinib is an effective DMARD for treating RA in csDMARD-inadequate response patients. Data from an open label LTE describing the long-term effects of tofacitinib on progression of radiographic structural damage were recently reported.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Slightly over 1000 patients were followed for up to 48 months; the patients were receiving either 5 or 10&#x02009;mg two times per day of tofacitinib with and without background csDMARDs. Mean change in mTSS from entry into the LTE through 12 months was 0.25 for all patients. Although it is dangerous to compare data across trials, the baricitinib data reported in patients who all had an inadequate response to csDMARDS were similar.</p><p>This study had limitations. Patients who completed the RA-BUILD study were included in this analysis whether or not they entered the long-term extension study, RA-BEYOND; however, 85% of the randomised and 95% of the completed patients of RA-BUILD entered RA-BEYOND, thereby limiting the influence of dropouts. Data were imputed for patients who did not enter the extension study or those with missing radiographs. The extension study was open-label in that all patients were aware that they were receiving baricitinib. However, the original treatment assignment as well as the actual dose of baricitinib remained blinded to the patient and investigator, and the readers scored all images blinded to all clinical information. Finally, the focus of the present manuscript is radiographic progression of joint damage from a single Phase three study and associated long-term extension data - limited conclusions can be drawn from the safety analyses, as evaluations from larger datasets that integrate information across multiple studies are better suited for this purpose.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
</p><p>In summary, these data provide evidence that the positive structural efficacy response in csDMARD-IR patients initially observed at 24 weeks was maintained over 48 weeks of treatment with baricitinib. The most robust benefit across measures of radiographic progression was seen with the 4&#x02009;mg dose. Additional annual radiographic assessments will continue during the extension study to determine if these affects are maintained during longer term treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the patients who participated in this study.
