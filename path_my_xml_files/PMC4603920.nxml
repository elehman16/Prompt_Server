While use of pharmacopuncture, a combined form of acupuncture and herbal medicine, for lumbar disc herniation is widespread in Korea and China, there is a paucity of research.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This study is the protocol for a three-armed, randomized, patient, physician, and assessor-blinded controlled pilot study. Sixty patients with severe non-acute sciatic pain diagnosed with lumbar disc herniation (NRS&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;5, onset between 4&#x000a0;weeks and 6&#x000a0;months) will be recruited and randomized 20 each to the <italic>Shinbaro</italic> pharmacopuncture (pharmacopuncture with acupuncture), acupuncture, and usual care groups, respectively. The 2 acupuncture groups will receive 2 sessions/week of acupuncture alone or with pharmacopuncture for 4&#x000a0;weeks (total 8 sessions), and the usual care group will receive conventional medication 2&#x02013;3 times/day and physical therapy 2 sessions/week over 4&#x000a0;weeks (total 8 sessions). The initial acupuncture physician will administer acupuncture at 5 acupoints (GB30, BL40, BL25, BL23, GB34) in the 2 acupuncture groups, and mark an additional acupoint. A second acupuncture physician will administer pharmacopuncture to the marked acupoint in the pharmacopuncture group, and acupuncture in the acupuncture group during acupuncture needle retention. The second physician will administer acupuncture and pharmacopuncture in a similar manner in terms of advice and manual stimulation to maintain patient-blinding, treat the patient out of view of the initial physician, remove the additional acupuncture needle immediately, and cover the area with adhesive bandage to maintain physician-blinding. The primary endpoint will be at 5&#x000a0;weeks post-randomization, and the primary outcome will be Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of sciatic pain. Secondary outcomes will be VAS of low back pain, Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) of low back pain and sciatic pain, ODI, SF-36, EQ-5D, and PGIC. Post-treatment evaluations will take place 5, 7, 9, and 12&#x000a0;weeks after randomization.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial will evaluate the comparative clinical effectiveness of pharmacopuncture for severe non-acute sciatic pain patients diagnosed with lumbar disc herniation with usual care of conventional medicine and that of Korean medicine (acupuncture), monitor its safety, and serve as basis for a large-scale, multicenter trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/NCT02384928">NCT02384928</ext-link>, registered 27 February 2015.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Acupuncture</kwd><kwd>Pharmacopuncture</kwd><kwd>Usual care</kwd><kwd>Lumbar disc herniation</kwd><kwd>Protocol</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Sciatica occurs due to lumbar disc herniation (LDH) in approximately 90&#x000a0;% of cases, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and is characterized by ipsilateral radiating leg pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] secondary to an inflammatory response from nerve root irritation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The prevalence of sciatica ranges from 1.6&#x000a0;% in the general population to 43&#x000a0;% in specific working populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The annual incidence of sciatica in Western countries is estimated at 5 cases per 1,000 adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Although the natural history of sciatica is known to be favorable in most patients, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] a sizable percentage (up to 30&#x000a0;%) report pain persisting for 1&#x000a0;year or more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. LDH incurs considerable medical expenses, and according to Benefits by Frequency of Disease data from the 2013 Korean National Health Insurance Statistical Yearbook, the number of patients with intervertebral disc disorders (Korean Standard Classification of Diseases (KCD): M50-M51) was 2.5 million, and yearly medical expenses have reached 790 billion Korean won (excluding the Korean medicine sector of the KCD). Low back pain (LBP) was the most frequent disease in both outpatient and inpatient care in National Health Insurance reimbursements for Korean medicine, and the number of patients with intervertebral disc disorders (KCD: M51) was approximately 19,000 and reported medical expenses were 47 billion Korean won in 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. As these statistics only include items eligible for reimbursement, total expenses are expected to be much higher taking into account non-reimbursable and indirect expenditures, and lost productivity.</p><p>Many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing non-surgical treatment with surgery in LDH patients with sciatica have reported that between-group differences were not significant at long-term follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Though guidelines and experts agree that first-line treatment for sciatica should be conservative, they are divided regarding specific treatment modality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Recently, more multidimensional approaches are being considered in conservative treatment, and are not limited to conventional treatment, but include complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. According to a 2004 survey, 43&#x000a0;% of peripheral neuropathy patients use CAM to manage symptoms, and many patients cited dissatisfactory pain control with standard medical treatment as the reason for selecting CAM. Most commonly used CAM treatments included acupuncture, chiropractic manipulation, herbal medicine, magnetic therapies, and vitamins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Pharmacopuncture is a treatment that combines two of the most frequently used Korean medicine treatment methods &#x02013; traditional acupuncture and herbal medicine &#x02013; by injecting herbal medicine extracts into acupoints. This method prolongs the mechanical and chemical effect of acupuncture and herbal medicine by optimizing acupoint access [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Current usage of pharmacopuncture for musculoskeletal diseases in Korea may be roughly estimated from medical service use of patients with spine surgery sequelae at 2 spine-specialty Korean medicine hospitals where 69&#x000a0;% of 702 patients received pharmacopuncture. Taking into consideration the fact that 88&#x000a0;% received acupuncture, a reimbursable item [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], this data suggests that pharmacopuncture is used almost as frequently as acupuncture. Also, the &#x0201c;Korean Medicine Clinical Practice Guideline for Lumbar Herniated Intervertebral Disc in Adults&#x0201d; published by the Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine (a subsidiary organization of the Korea Research Council of Fundamental Science and Technology under the Korean Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning) includes pharmacopuncture in major treatment guidelines for Korean medicine doctors (KMDs), recommending bee venom and <italic>Shinbaro</italic> pharmacopuncture amongst others for LDH patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>However, there is a paucity of rigorous RCTs on pharmacopuncture unbefitting its widespread use and inclusion in clinical guidelines for musculoskeletal diseases in Korea. Hence, we will evaluate the effects of a combined treatment of <italic>Shinbaro</italic> pharmacopuncture with acupuncture in non-acute sciatica patients due to LDH through: 1) comparison with usual care in pain severity, functional scales, quality of life, and adverse events to assess its comparative effect and safety; 2) comparison with acupuncture to determine the specific effect of <italic>Shinbaro</italic> pharmacopuncture; 3) comparison of acupuncture and usual care to evaluate the comparative effect of acupuncture; and thus appraise the feasibility of a large-scale clinical trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design and recruitment</title><p>This trial is a randomized, patient, physician, and outcome assessor-blinded pilot study with three parallel arms. Participants will be recruited at Jaseng Hospital of Korean medicine, situated in Seoul, Korea, from May to December 2015. Sixty sciatic pain patients with LDH as confirmed by MRI will be recruited from outpatients visiting Jaseng Hospital of Korean medicine, which is a spine-specialty hospital designated as such by the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare (900,000 outpatient cases per year).

Only MRIs taken after the onset of the current episode of sciatic pain will be considered relevant. Additional MRIs will be conducted at the investigation site as needed in participants with no MRIs for the current episode, or in discrepancy between and/or change in current symptoms and prior MRI. After confirmation by physicians of consistency of sciatic pain symptoms and MRI findings, the patient will be randomly allocated to one of three groups &#x02013; <italic>Shinbaro</italic> pharmacopuncture, acupuncture, or usual care group. The patient will receive 8 sessions of the assigned treatment for 4&#x000a0;weeks.

At the post-treatment phase, patients will be allowed pain medication intake, as needed, regardless of type or dose, and patterns of use will be investigated at each follow-up evaluation. To encourage attendance of follow-up evaluations and reduce number of drop-outs, all participants will have the choice to be provided with acupuncture and <italic>Shinbaro</italic> pharmacopuncture at the end of the trial phase (12&#x000a0;weeks post-randomization).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Participants</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Age 25&#x000a0;years or older, and 55&#x000a0;years or younger</p></list-item><list-item><p>Sciatica patients with average sciatic pain on the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) of 5 or higher during the 3 preceding days</p></list-item><list-item><p>Onset of at least 4&#x000a0;weeks to 6&#x000a0;months previous for current sciatic pain episode</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients whose sciatic symptoms correlate with MRI findings of LDH</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients who have agreed to follow the trial protocol</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Patients who have received invasive treatments (e.g. nerve blocks, pharmacopuncture, acupuncture) within the past week</p></list-item><list-item><p>Non-spinal or soft tissue pathologies which may cause LBP or sciatic pain (e.g. spinal tumors, rheumatoid arthritis)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Pregnancy</p></list-item><list-item><p>History of spinal surgery, or spinal pathologies other than LDH (e.g. spinal dislocation, fracture)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Severe progressive neurologic symptoms (e.g. cauda equina syndrome, progressive muscle weakness)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients for whom acupuncture may be inappropriate or unsafe (e.g. hemorrhagic diseases, blood clotting disorders, intake of anti-coagulation medicine, severe diabetes with risk of infection, severe cardiovascular diseases, or other conditions deemed unsuitable)</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Randomization and allocation concealment</title><p>Random numbers will be generated by a statistician unaware of the design and purpose of this study through stratified block randomization in random blocks of 3 (1:1:1) using a computerized random number generator to allocate patients into 3 groups.

The education program will inform the patient of the favorable prognosis of LDH, and give instructions for everyday activities and self-management. The education program will consist of handbooks, with weekly reminders and encouragement from the physician. However, the physician will maintain a neutral stance in answering questions about the effect of each treatment modality. KMDs assigned with patient education will also receive five prior training sessions to ensure homogeneity in education content. The 2 acupuncture groups will undergo a total 8 sessions of acupuncture, 2 sessions/week for 4&#x000a0;weeks. Disposable sterile needles (40&#x000a0;mm&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;0.25&#x000a0;mm; Dong-bang Acupuncture, SeongNam, Korea) will be used.

The 5 points will be disinfected with disposable 70&#x000a0;% isopropyl alcohol cotton swabs, and needled to about 1-cm depth assisted by an acupuncture guide tube with no manual stimulation such as twirling or lifting and thrusting. In selecting left or right side in the 5 acupoints, GB30, BL40, and GB34 will be needled on the side with sciatic symptoms, and BL25 and BL23 on the contralateral back region. The reason for contralateral needling is to avoid overlapping with the area marked for secondary acupuncture or <italic>Shinbaro</italic> pharmacopuncture. The secondary acupuncture physician will disinfect the marked area with a povidic saturated swabstick (Gumi Pharma, Gimpo, Korea) using gradually expanding circular strokes to about a 5-cm radius. Needle retention will be standardized at 20&#x000a0;minutes. The initial acupuncture physician will leave a piece of paper marked with the patient&#x02019;s random allocation number on the bed for the secondary acupuncture physician.

We will evaluate the specific mechanical and chemical effect of pharmacopuncture minus the mechanical effect of acupuncture at acupoints through comparison of pharmacopuncture and acupuncture. This study is also a practical comparative study comparing acupuncture, pharmacopuncture, and usual care, which are the most frequently used treatments for LDH in Korea.</p><p>Though clinical guidelines on LDH issued by the Health Council of the Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and the North American Spine Society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] support use of conservative treatment as first-line treatment in absence of cauda equina syndrome, the efficacy of many conservative treatments for LDH remains unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. For determination of the contents of the usual care group for LDH in our study, we referred to several clinical guidelines and systemic reviews, but found conflicting evidence on the efficacy of various conservative treatments. While US national guidelines recommend epidural steroid injections for short term (2&#x02013;4 weeks) pain relief, a report from the Korean National Evidence-based Healthcare Collaborating Agency analyzing the results of systemic reviews and National Health Insurance reimbursement claims states that evidence to make a recommendation for use of epidural steroid injections for pain or functional recovery is weak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Also, evidence for or against other pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), muscle relaxants, antidepressants, physical therapy, traction, and exercise was mostly insufficient or against use. We therefore decided to apply interventions most frequently used in actual clinical practice in Korea in selecting usual care group treatment rather than follow evidence-based guidelines. Korea has a government-operated national health security system, based on a health insurance scheme that covers the entire population and all medical facilities. The system reimburses approved medical expenses of most diseases including LDH, and the HIRA service database contains information on medication and medical service use, and diagnoses. The HIRA database is, therefore, a useful source of epidemiologic data and allows for nationwide population studies of various neurologic and non-neurologic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. We summarized most frequently used treatments in patients with a primary diagnosis of LDH (KCD: M51, M541) in the 2011 HIRA National Patients Sample for physician reference in the usual care group in an effort to establish a rational and legitimate method of usual care.</p><p>The effect of pharmacopuncture is believed to be produced through a combined effect of placebo, needle stimulation, and the mechanical and chemical effect of the solution. We reasoned that evaluation of the specific effect of pharmacopuncture against the non-specific effect of acupuncture (placebo effect and needle stimulation effect) at matching acupoints would validate pharmacopuncture use as distinct from acupuncture. As acupuncture points and needle-type hold relevance in determining effect, we will assign acupoint selection for <italic>Shinbaro</italic> pharmacopuncture and acupuncture to the blinded initial acupuncture physician and administer acupuncture perpendicularly at the acupoint with an acupuncture needle of the same shape and size as <italic>Shinbaro</italic> pharmacopuncture needles. To strengthen blinding and induce a homogeneous placebo effect in groups, the second physician will evoke a sensation similar to that of pharmacopuncture stimulation by twirling the acupuncture needle and refrain from exposing any factors that may inform the patient of the method of treatment (e.g. advice, precautionary measures, disposal of used products) in accordance with the protocol and prior education and training.</p><p>Limitations of our study include that recruiting at a mainly Korean medicine-based hospital may lead participants to have higher expectations for pharmacopuncture or acupuncture than conventional treatment due to the cultural and medical environment of Korea. We will attempt to assess the effects through Credibility and Expectancy Questionnaires, and will discuss the results in the results paper.</p><p>GCSB-5, which is the primary ingredient of <italic>Shinbaro</italic> pharmacopuncture, has a long history of clinical use for spinal disorders such as LDH in Asia, and recent interest in natural products has led to pharmacological studies on its effects, showing that GCSB-5 modulates acute and chronic inflammatory processes, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] has neuroprotective, nerve regeneration promoting and motor functional recovery accelerating properties by reducing oxidative stress, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and articular cartilage protective effects against progression of osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].

An analysis of the publication types of pharmacopuncture-related papers published in the journal &#x0201c;<italic>The Acupuncture</italic>,&#x0201d; registered in the National Research Foundation of Korea, showed that 438 pharmacopuncture-related papers were published up to August 2006, which takes up about 34.6&#x000a0;% of the total 1,268 papers published in the journal. Of these papers, 355 were non-clinical, 70 clinical, and 14 literature reviews, showing a large proportion of non-clinical papers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The &#x0201c;<italic>Journal of Pharmacopuncture</italic>,&#x0201d; also registered in the National Research Foundation of Korea, has published 196 papers (73.9&#x000a0;%) on pharmacopuncture out of 265 manuscripts published up to June 2006 since its foundation in 1997, and though the percentage of clinical studies was higher at 35&#x000a0;% (67 papers), clinical study papers on pharmacopuncture in both journals were generally limited to observational studies and case series. The most frequently studied type of pharmacopuncture was bee venom pharmacopuncture in both journals, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] illustrating the need for more clinical studies on different types of pharmacopuncture.</p><p><italic>Hyeopcheok</italic> points are situated at or in close proximity to the nerve roots, and stimulation of this area is comparable to nerve root blocking therapy commonly used in conventional treatment for LDH. It can be surmised that the reason why <italic>Hyeopcheok</italic> points, in addition to regular meridian acupuncture points, has a long history of use in spinal disorders was at least partly due to a need to stimulate surrounding deep tissue and the nerve root that was being irritated from protruded disc tissue. While the current study aims to assess whether using pharmacopuncture is more effective at <italic>Hyeopcheok</italic> points than regular acupuncture, we will consider further comparisons with nerve root blocking therapy using steroidal injections. Comparative effect studies on bee venom pharmacopuncture, which has been rigorously studied and is widely used in Asia, should also be given due consideration.</p><p>While regulations for post-marketing surveillance of medicine and medical supplies do not apply to pharmacopuncture products, agreements to the aim of regulatory standard enforcement in products not obligated to receive post-marketing surveillance in pharmaceutical affairs laws have been reached by the Korean Food and Drug Administration and Ministry of Health and Welfare. Despite the fact that over 200 types of herbal medicine injections are available from pharmaceutical companies in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and the market is fast growing in Korea also, with pharmacopuncture recognized in private insurance sectors such as car insurance, rigorous pharmacopuncture trials utilizing appropriate controls (placebo or active), randomization and blinding are scarce. This trial will evaluate the comparative clinical effectiveness of deep pharmacopuncture for severe non-acute sciatic pain patients diagnosed with LDH with the usual care of conventional medicine and that of Korean medicine (acupuncture), and apply randomization and group allocation concealment, with physician, patient, and outcome assessor-blinding to effectively remove bias. This study will be the first well-designed rigorous RCT to assess the comparative effectiveness of pharmacopuncture in accordance with Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) and Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA) guidelines, monitor its safety, and serve as the basis of a large-scale, multicenter trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Trial status</title><p>This study is expected to recruit patients from September to April,2015, and be completed in September 2016.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AD</term><def><p>anxiety/depression</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CAM</term><def><p>complementary and alternative medicine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CONSORT</term><def><p>Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EQ-5D</term><def><p>EuroQol-5 Dimension</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HIRA</term><def><p>Health Insurance Review and Assessment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HRQoL</term><def><p>health-related quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KCD</term><def><p>Korean Standard Classification of Diseases</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>K-GMP</term><def><p>Korean Good Manufacturing Practice</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KMD</term><def><p>Korean medicine doctor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LBP</term><def><p>low back pain</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LDH</term><def><p>lumbar disc herniation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>M</term><def><p>mobility</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MRI</term><def><p>magnetic resonance imaging</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NSAIDS</term><def><p>non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NRS</term><def><p>Numeric Rating Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ODI</term><def><p>Oswestry Disability Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PD</term><def><p>pain/discomfort</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PGIC</term><def><p>patient global impression of change</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ROM</term><def><p>range of movement</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAE</term><def><p>serious adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SC</term><def><p>self-care</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SF-36</term><def><p>Short Form Health Survey 36</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SLR</term><def><p>straight leg raise</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SOP</term><def><p>standard operating procedure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>STRICTA</term><def><p>Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UA</term><def><p>usual activities</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p>Visual Analog Scale</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>JHL is responsible for supervising the clinical study as primary investigator.
