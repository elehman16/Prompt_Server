Within the observation period, the nano-hybrid and micro-hybrid restorations evolved better in polishability with improved surface gloss retention than the conventional hybrid counterpart. The three hybrid composites showed enamel-like vertical wear and cavity-size dependant volume loss magnitude.

Hybrid composite resins combine colloidal silica with micro-fine glass fillers with an average particle-size diameter of around or less than 1&#x02009;&#x003bc;m. Typically, these composites are loaded to 58% to 75% by volume and are radiopaque. The introduction of extremely small fillers in the micro-hybrids and nano-filled hybrids is assumed for the excellent physical properties with enhanced polishability when compared to the conventional hybrid composite resins.</p><p>An important factor affecting the intra-oral performance of posterior composite restorations in occlusal stress-bearing areas is wear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The aspect of wear behaviour seen clinically is a cumulative manifestation of variables like attrition, abrasion, abfraction, corrosion and fatigue, collectively defined as bio-tribo corrosion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The complexity of the intraoral wear tribology of posterior composite restorations manifests clinically as loss of contour, increase in surface roughness, staining and plaque retention, structurally as microscopic alterations of surface morphology and mechanically as hygroscopic expansion, fatigue and catastrophic breakdowns. Most in vivo wear studies have generally used the subjective criteria of US Public Health Service (USPHS) to qualitatively evaluate the clinical wear performance of composites, while other in vitro studies have used the quantitative measurements of occlusal wear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] which is extremely relevant considering posterior teeth. A very few studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] have investigated qualitatively the micro-morphological wear characteristics through surface morphology analysis of restorations imaged using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Human enamel has been considered ideal as a reference material in in vivo studies and as a reference standard in in vitro studies to compare and evaluate the wear tribology of restorative materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The present study is in fact in continuation of these interests, but intends to compare the wear resistance of three different types of hybrid composites, clinically, quantitatively and qualitatively, in parallel in a 3-year randomised controlled trial study. We intend to compare a nano-hybrid (such as Tetric EvoCeram (TEC), Ivoclar-Vivadent) and a micro-filled hybrid (such as Gradia Direct Posterior, GC) versus a conventional hybrid composite (such as Tetric Ceram) for this purpose.</p><p>The study hypotheses are (a) there are no significant differences between the clinical wear performance among the nano-hybrid (TEC), micro-filled hybrid (Gradia Direct Posterior) and the conventional hybrid (Tetric Ceram) with time, (b) the magnitude of wear generated in nano-hybrid, micro-hybrid and the conventional hybrid composite restorations would not be different from that of enamel and (c) there would be no difference in the qualitative wear patterns between the nano-hybrid, micro-hybrid and the conventional hybrid composite restorations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>In this 3-year longitudinal, prospective randomised controlled clinical trial, the nano-hybrid (TEC), micro-hybrid (Gradia Direct Posterior) and the conventional hybrid (Tetric Ceram) were compared.

The 49 teeth to be treated were structured in advance according to the type of restoration in two main cavity groups (class I and class II). The filling materials, TEC or Gradia Direct Posterior or Tetric Ceram, were randomised over these two cavity groups following a percent distribution of class I versus class II as 76:24 for TEC, 81:19 for Gradia Direct Posterior and 69:31 for Tetric Ceram.A strict placement technique was followed. The restorations were placed under local anaesthesia and rubber dam. Diamond instruments in a high-speed handpiece with water spray were used to make all cavity preparations. All enamel margins were bevelled for maximum adhesive retention and optical blending using the Sonic-Sys (KaVo Company) torpedo and hemisphere diamond-coated bevel tips.Appropriate enamel and dentin shades were selected using the Vita shade guide supplied by the study sponsor under ambient lighting condition. The teeth needing CaOH<sub>2</sub> basing, i.e. preparations closer than 0.5&#x000a0;mm to the pulp, were covered with a glass ionomer light cured liner, before bonding procedures. Enamel and dentin conditionings were performed with a self-etching adhesive system (AdheSe for Tetric Ceram and TEC restorations, UniFil Bond for Gradia Direct Posterior restorations) of each composite resin manufacturer, according to their directions.Placement of resin composites followed the incremental technique (2-mm-thick layers) and cured with the light (Astralis) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instruction for use. The light tip was held approximately 1.0&#x000a0;mm away from the tooth surface during curing.

One experienced dentist rated all restorations under magnification loupes with mirror and probe subsequent to a brief soft tissue survey and recording of gingival conditions. The direct clinical evaluation of restorations was performed using the modified USPHS criteria listed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>. If a parameter was judged to be clinically unacceptable, then the exact cause of failure was recorded, and it was decided whether the restoration can be repaired or requires replacement. However, the repaired restorations were still kept in the study for further recalls. Attention was paid while grading the marginal adaptation to differentiate cavomarginal discoloration, recurrent caries and marginal deterioration. Intra-oral radiographs were taken and post-operative sensitivity, if present, was also evaluated with CO<sub>2</sub> snow (Fricar, Odontotest) and the sensitivity was scored as positive or negative. An alginate impression was made first and then a gypsum cast from which acrylic posterior custom trays were fabricated. The same custom trays were used for impression procedures at each registration session. Each restoration was documented photographically (with and without articulation paper). Impressions of restoration were made at baseline. At each recall, two impressions per air-dried, cotton-roll isolated tooth were taken with polyvinyl siloxane impression material using individualised custom trays. One impression was poured with white stone gypsum GC Fujirock EP White (Dental stone type IV, GC Europe, Leuven, Belgium) for laser scanning and another impression in Araldite D, Ciba Geigy (Belgium) for morphological observation complemented with SEM study. All replicas were uniformly trimmed and mounted on aluminium stubs for easy handling and repositioning.

The lateral displacement of the laser beam on reflection from the object, corresponding to the height (<italic>Z</italic>) at each surface point, was detected by a charge-coupled device chip. The grey scanned baseline images were then super-imposed automatically, and the images at 6, 12, 24 and 36&#x000a0;months were subtracted from baseline with Match-3D, specially developed image analysis software (volume, mean vertical loss, 0.5% quantiles). This digital subtraction resulted in a differential image used to quantify the wear magnitude. Based on the blue articulation spots in the clinical pictures at baseline and at the different recall sessions, the following wear facets were identified on the difference image: occlusal contact area on enamel (OCAE)&#x02013;heavy and light, occlusal contact area on composite (OCAC), differential wear (shared OCAE and OCAC), contact-free occlusal area (CFOA) and restoration margins. Using the zoom function and the cursor, the <italic>Z</italic> value of 15 points were noted for each of the aforementioned spots. The maximum and minimum values wear excluded. The mean of the remaining eight values was taken to be the vertical loss of the wear facets. The deepest wear point in the most deteriorated area on the margin of each of the restorations was measured as the maximum vertical loss along the margin, the shallow point as the minimal vertical loss. The average of 15 points on the localised, deteriorated margins was recorded as mean vertical loss of marginal degradation. The number of surface points along the grey scanned image was recorded as total surface area. Using the edit function, the area with restoration and the surrounding unrestored enamel surface were separately defined manually on each grey scanned image of baseline and recall. Once the restoration and the cavosurface were separated, the Match 3D software calculated the surface area of restoration and surface area of enamel. Using the statistic mode of the difference images, the volumetric wear along the total occlusal surface (restored surface + enamel) was determined in cubic millimetre as total surface volume loss (TSV loss), restorative surface volume loss (RSV loss) and enamel surface volume loss (ESV loss).Statistical analysis was performed with Statistica (version 8.0) for the clinical USPHS data and the wear quantification data. Sign test provided the comparative statistical analysis of the materials over the study period. For each evaluated USPHS criterion of each material group, further analysis was done using the Friedman ANOVA (by ranks) and Kendall&#x02019;s concordance test for changes from baseline to 6-, 12-, 24- and 36-month data. The McNemar&#x02019;s test assessed the statistical significance of the changes in lower ranking criteria. The level of significance was set at <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05 for all tests. In addition to ranking, the vertical loss, volume loss and differential wear rates of materials are compared with that of referenced enamel for inferring the statistical significance for the observed differences in rating the clinical wear performance as acceptable or unacceptable. The correlation coefficient (<italic>r</italic>) was calculated for the paired vertical and volume loss data to determine whether a relationship exists between them.</p><p><bold>SEM evaluation</bold> The epoxy replicas were gold sputtered, subjected to high magnification dental surgical optical microscopy (OPMI Pro ergo, Carl Zeiss surgical GmbH, Oberkochen, Germany), prior to SEM imaging, in order to downsize the samples for SEM view. The potential samples demonstrating interesting micro-morphologic features such as defined wear facets, differential wear steps, degrading margins and fractures were further explored under SEM. Quadrant-wise photomicrographs of each sample was made initially followed by thorough scanning area by area up to the magnification of 200.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Results</title><p>The present study covers the recall periods of baseline, 6, 12, 24 and 36&#x000a0;months.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Clinical evaluation&#x02013;USPHS qualitative analysis</title><p>Three years after placement, 16 Tetric Ceram, 17 TEC and 16 Gradia Direct Posterior restorations could be evaluated and scored according to the USPHS criteria.

The marginal integrity of the restorations showed predominantly bravo scores for all the three types of composite restorations, due to the presence of several small, discontinuous enamel fractures along the restoration margins, chipping of the filling material from the marginal ridge or/and a gap along the cavosurface margin. All of the above chipped areas and fractures were rated bravo.

Within 1&#x000a0;year of clinical service, these overhangs fractured as standalone in 70% of teeth in our study. In the remaining 20%, overhang fracture was associated with cavosurface margin opening (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6f</xref>) or margin fracture (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Clinical performance</title><p>The clinical assessment of the loss of anatomical form of restorations is essentially an indication of the proportion of the restored surface exhibiting morphological alterations due to the wear. Based on the steady state of the alpha scores of the criteria anatomic form and retention in almost all restorations throughout the study period, it is suggestive that the effect of wear on the restoration morphology and retention was small and macroscopically barely visible to the naked eye. Therefore, all the three hybrid composites have evolved smoothly in time regarding the anatomic form and retention.</p><p>The technique of incremental filling of composites adopted in this study to reduce the shrinkage stress and micro-leakage at the adhesive interface, as suggested by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and the better oral hygiene status of the patients could justify the absence of failures due to secondary caries after 36&#x000a0;months. The time and attention devoted to the restoration placement techniques and the clinically acceptable mechanical properties of the restorative materials that minimise the hydrostatic dentin fluid movements might explain the lack of post-operative sensitivity after 36&#x000a0;months in the present study. This has also been addressed in a number of studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Ninety-nine percent of the cases recorded as not having lost the inter-proximal contact in the present study could be explained with the special attention given to the appropriate use of the matrix in building up the critical area of the marginal ridge of the proximal part of the restoration. In the remaining 1% of cases, all the three hybrid restorative materials were susceptible to cyclic stress resulting in occlusal&#x02013;proximal marginal fractures, weakening the proximal contact points in the evolving period of 36&#x000a0;months.</p><p>Slightly rougher surface with moderate staining was observed in very few cases of all the three materials after 36&#x000a0;months. This could be mainly due to the friction with food and antagonist teeth during mastication. In addition, from baseline to 36&#x000a0;months, the progressively decreasing alpha scores of colour match for all the three hybrid restorative materials could also be related to pigment absorption of the rough restorative surfaces from dietary habits. However, the evolution of colour mismatch between the restoration and the tooth structure was within the normal range of tooth colour and the colour stability of all the three hybrid materials was acceptable after 3&#x000a0;years of clinical service. Nevertheless, the colour mismatch between the surrounding tooth structure and the restoration is a rather subjective observation because of lighting conditions, chameleon effects and surface staining.</p><p>The polishability of Tetric Ceram was not only significantly worse than TEC and Gradia Direct Posterior at 36&#x000a0;months, but significantly worst (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0156) over time from baseline to 36&#x000a0;months. This is suggestive that the differences in filler sizes between the three restoratives might have led the nano-hybrid and micro-hybrid material to be better evolved in polishability with improved surface gloss retention than the conventional hybrid counterpart. The marginal degradation scores were quite similar for TEC, Tetric Ceram and Gradia Direct Posterior used in the present study.</p><p><bold>The recall rate in this study</bold> One hundred percent is in accordance with that in other clinical trials of micro-hybrid and nano-composites (59&#x02013;100% recall rate) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. TEC, Tetric Ceram and Gradia Direct Posterior restorations did not differ in their susceptibility to marginal degradation throughout the study. For comparable observation periods but with different micro-hybrid composites, most studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] have reported similar deterioration of marginal integrity due to factors such as shrinkage stress, the effect of cavity geometry on C-factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], butt-joint occlusal margin and self-etch adhesives. The failure rate of 0% observed in this 3-year study is within the range of 0% to 45% annual failure rates reported in systematic reviews on clinical trials assessing the longevity of posterior composite restorations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. While several studies are available in literature demonstrating the acceptability of conventional hybrid (Tetric Ceram) composite in posterior stress bearing areas, only a very limited number of clinical trials have reported the clinical performance of the novel micro-hybrid (Gradia Direct Posterior) and nano-hybrid (TEC) composites.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Quantitative wear performance</title><p>The enamel-like wear is necessary for composites, as they should simulate the properties of enamel and dentine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. As time evolved during clinical service, all the three hybrid restoratives underwent a running-in wear period followed by the steady state/stabilisation period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The absence of significant difference in the OCA wear/vertical loss magnitude of the three hybrid composite restorations versus enamel, until 36&#x000a0;months recall, has conferred an enamel-like wear resistance to the three hybrid composites.</p><p>The significantly increased volume loss of the restorative materials (RSV loss) versus enamel (ESV loss) over time could be attributed to the difference in proportion of restorative surface area versus the surrounding enamel surface area. This confirms the hypothesis that the greater the dimensions of restorations, the larger the amount of surface area exposed to the masticatory stresses and the faster the restoration will undergo loss of material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The mean occlusal wear volumes of ceramic crowns for molars were 0.34&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.08&#x000a0;mm<sup>3</sup> after 1&#x000a0;year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This wear volume is lesser than of the three restoratives in the present study. The difference in hardness between the veneering materials and the composite restoratives could explain the difference in the wear volume. The linear relationship between vertical and volume loss is suggestive that vertical wear is directly proportional to volumetric wear over time. Such correlation has already been demonstrated for in vitro wear data quantified using profilometry (Perthometer) and optical sensors (FRT MicroProf) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>The evolving material loss along the cavosurface margins appeared to occur regardless of the type of restorative material. Nevertheless, it is not impossible that the application of self-etching primer bonding system might have lead to a compromise concerning adhesion to the cavosurface margins. In vitro studies have shown that self-etching adhesive systems and the all-in-one adhesives were less effective than total etch systems concerning dentin and enamel bond strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The present study did not evaluate the effectiveness of the adhesive system regarding the criteria of marginal adaptation, which was not its objective.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Qualitative wear performance</title><p>The surface appearance of hybrid composite resin wear facets at heavy OCAs assessed qualitatively under SEM revealed fatigue crack propagation, irrespective of the type of the hybrid composite. This is suggestive that none of the evaluated hybrid composite resin restorations could sustain the fatigue induced by the cyclic stress during mastication. The light OCAs of the three hybrid resin composite restorations were susceptible to pitting over time. However, the severity of pitting was lesser in the nano-composite and the micro-hybrid resin restorations due to their smaller filler particles. In addition to the pitting micro-wear, fine scratches or striations of different length were evident along the food escape pathways of the occlusal surfaces of almost every restoration. The striation pattern has previously been reported in human enamel due to prophylaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], fossil hominids and non-human primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] reflecting the impact of coarse particles and foreign body in dietary constituents.
