In comparison with clinical guidance, contemporary statin prescribing is sub-optimal and achievement of cholesterol targets falls short of accepted standards, for patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease who are at highest absolute risk and who stand to obtain greatest benefit. We hypothesised that a pharmacist-led complex intervention delivered to doctors and nurses in primary care, would improve statin prescribing and achievement of cholesterol targets for incident and prevalent patients with vascular disease, beyond one year.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We allocated general practices to a 12-month Statin Outreach Support (SOS) intervention or usual care. SOS was delivered by one of 11 pharmacists who had received additional training. SOS comprised academic detailing and practical support to identify patients with vascular disease who were not prescribed a statin at optimal dose or did not have cholesterol at target, followed by individualised recommendations for changes to management. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients achieving cholesterol targets. Secondary outcomes were: the proportion of patients prescribed simvastatin 40 mg with target cholesterol achieved; cholesterol levels; prescribing of simvastatin 40 mg; prescribing of any statin and the proportion of patients with cholesterol tested. Outcomes were assessed after an average of 1.7 years (range 1.4&#x02013;2.2 years), and practice level simvastatin 40 mg prescribing was assessed after 10 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>We randomised 31 practices (72 General Practitioners (GPs), 40 nurses). Prior to randomisation a subset of eligible patients were identified to characterise practices; 40% had cholesterol levels below the target threshold. Improvements in data collection procedures allowed identification of all eligible patients (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;7586) at follow up. Patients in practices allocated to SOS were significantly more likely to have cholesterol at target (69.5% vs 63.5%; OR 1.11, CI 1.00&#x02013;1.23; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.043) as a result of improved simvastatin prescribing. Subgroup analysis showed the primary outcome was achieved by prevalent but not incident patients. Statistically significant improvements occurred in all secondary outcomes for prevalent patients and all but one secondary outcome (the proportion of patients with cholesterol tested) for incident patients. SOS practices prescribed more simvastatin 40 mg than usual care practices, up to 10 years later.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Through a combination of educational and organisational support, a general practice based pharmacist led collaborative intervention can improve statin prescribing and achievement of cholesterol targets in a high-risk primary care based population.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials Register <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN61233866">ISRCTN61233866</ext-link>

Using computerised Read code searches in each practice, we produced lists of eligible patients, to minimise selection and observation bias. In 26 practices, each eligible patient&#x02019;s electronic and paper-based record was consulted and in the remaining five, largest practices, because of time constraints, every third patient&#x02019;s record was accessed. Baseline data was therefore collected on a subset of eligible patients rather than all eligible patients. Patient level baseline data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0113370.s001">File S1</xref>, Page 27) were collected in a cross-sectional sample of 4,040 patients&#x02019; records in all 31 participating general practices (clusters) at baseline.</p><p>We categorised recruited General Practices depending on whether they were a Group practice (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;16) with several GPs, or a Single Handed practice (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;15) with only one GP in the practice.

Using patient-level and summary prescribing information, pharmacists provided organisational support comprising identification of patients with potential for statin initiation and optimization, by screening medical records. Through discussion with GPs and Nurses, they identified individuals&#x02019; barriers to prescribing change e.g. scepticism about the strength of evidence for initiating a statin. Pharmacists subsequently devised ways to help GPs and Nurses overcome these barriers then provided individualized support to enact plans. Pharmacists aimed to improve practices&#x02019; patient call and recall by systematically identifying and categorising all eligible patients in the disease register according to what the practice needed to do for those patients who were not prescribed simvastatin 40 mg (or another statin at sufficient dose, if that was the individual GP&#x02019;s strong preference (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0113370.s001">File S1</xref>, page 4, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0113370-t001">Table 1</xref>) or if recommended by local guidance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0113370.s001">File S1</xref>, Page 7). Using information from patients&#x02019; records and comparing with management as described in local guidance, pharmacists prepared individualised, written, evidence based recommendations for each patient and passed these to the GP for consideration and implementation. Practices subsequently contacted patients to advise of changes to their prescription and/or invite for a cholesterol test. Pharmacists systematically followed up each patient&#x02019;s plan to maximise patient uptake and minimise dropout.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0113370-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0113370.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Baseline patient characteristics.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0113370-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0113370.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SOS (15 practices; n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2373 patients)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Usual Care (15 practices; n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1667 patients)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">P-value</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years; mean (SD)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">68.2 (12.1)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">68.5 (12.0)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.311</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sex, male</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1207/2373 (52.9%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">890/1667 (53.4%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.192</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4" align="left" rowspan="1">

Practices were free to choose to prescribe a statin other than simvastatin e.g. atorvastatin, pravastatin or fluvastatin, but these choices were countered in the public interest, by the pharmacist describing the lower cost of simvastatin and greater weight of evidence.

Follow-up coincided with financial incentivisation for general practices to create and maintain accurate disease registers for patients with conditions including coronary heart disease or diabetes <xref rid="pone.0113370-Roland1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and therefore data recording in practices&#x02019; computers had improved to the point where some practices were paperless and others were paper-light. Due to these improvements, at follow up, researchers were able to collect more patient outcome data during each visit to a practice, compared with baseline data collection. Follow up data were therefore collected for all 7586 eligible patients&#x02019; records in 30 general practices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113370-g001">Fig. 1</xref> Trial profile), rather than from a subset as was the case at baseline. However, due to limited availability of opportunities to access practice computers, simultaneous collection of data from 30 general practices was not possible. Scheduling of different time slots for practice visits by researchers, led to different dates of follow up between pairs. Outcome data were collected for all eligible patients in 30 general practices between 1.4 and 2.2 years (mean 1.7 years) after randomisation. Data collection within each pair started in the same week, to ensure comparable follow up duration within pairs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0113370.s001">File S1</xref>, Page 8).</p><p>Follow up analyses compared data in SOS with Usual Care practices.

Assuming that data for 40 patients per practice would be collected, we estimated that approximately 20 practices (10 per group) would be required to have 80% power, allowing for the cluster randomisation, to detect an increase in the proportion of patients with cholesterol at target to 90% in intervention practices.</p></sec><sec id="s2b14"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Analysis was by intention to treat. Descriptive statistics for continuous variables are presented as mean and standard deviation, and for categorical variables as percentages. Due to the non-normal distribution of cholesterol levels, a log-transformation was applied; therefore geometric means describe cholesterol level outcome measures. The logged values for this measure are used for all analyses. Linear and logistic regression models were used to test for differences in the primary and secondary outcomes between SOS and Usual Care groups for continuous and binary outcomes respectively. Fixed effects models were adjusted for practice pair as a covariate to account for the matching at randomisation. Results are presented as intervention effect or odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (CI) and p-value. Secondary analyses investigated the sensitivity of the results to adjustments for age and sex. ICCs are presented for all outcomes. A sensitivity analysis was carried out for the primary outcome, adjusting for any statin prescribing at follow up, to assess whether the treatment effect could be explained by increased statin prescribing.</p><p>Subgroup analyses were carried out according to the following variables: age; gender; practice-level socioeconomic deprivation; practice type (SH/G); patient type (prevalent or incident); number of co-morbidities (one vs. &#x02265;2); ischaemic heart disease (IHD) comorbidity; statin prescribed/not prescribed and cholesterol at target or not, at baseline. Note that these baseline characteristics were defined by data collected at follow-up, since data collected before randomisation could not be linked to data collected at follow-up because matching required each patient&#x02019;s Community Health Index number (CHI) and these were not collected at baseline. Subgroup analyses were performed by adding subgroup and the interaction between subgroup and treatment to the models described above. Results are presented graphically as the treatment effect (and corresponding 95% confidence interval) for each subgroup; the p-value for the interaction term is also presented.</p><p>We consider p-values less than 0.05 to be statistically significant.

Incident patients in SOS arm practices also fared better than incident comparators in usual care, for the remaining two outcomes (cholesterol target achieved and cholesterol tested) but the extent of these improvements did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0113370-t003">Table 3</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="pone-0113370-t003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0113370.t003</object-id><label>Table 3</label><caption><title>Primary and secondary outcomes in incident and prevalent patients.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0113370-t003-3" xlink:href="pone.0113370.t003"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td colspan="4" align="left" rowspan="1">Prevalent prescribing (30 practices;

When we did this, the treatment effect was neutralised, suggesting the difference observed in the primary outcome was driven mainly by the prescribing of statins. There are other plausible although less likely explanations for the favourable primary outcome: practices in the SOS arm may have responded more positively to the General Medical Services (GMS) contract Quality and Outcomes Framework which asked all practices to create a register of patients with CHD, Stroke and Diabetes and manage patients&#x02019; cholesterol without any influence from the pharmacist intervention <xref rid="pone.0113370-Department2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>; or patients in SOS practices may have developed improved statin adherence during the study period.</p><p>The results show practices in the SOS arm had significantly improved prescribing for incident patients, but not achievement of cholesterol targets.

Performance bias was therefore possible through usual care practices trying harder to achieve the outcomes for which their SOS group counterparts received support. Patients remained blinded to allocation throughout the study, because there was no requirement for written consent at patient level and the intervention was mediated through practices. The Hawthorne effect was unavoidable for participating GPs and Nurses, as is the case in all randomised controlled trials involving an educational component that cannot be masked by design.</p><p>Patients in the SOS arm had lower cholesterol levels at follow up, suggesting adherence to prescribing changes, despite a known tendency for non-adherence in the first year of prescribing and following dose-intensification <xref rid="pone.0113370-Pittman1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113370-Chapman1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>.

In addition, variation in outcomes was minimised at follow up in SOS practices compared to usual care (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0113370.s001">File S1</xref>, Pages 15&#x02013;20). This result may be due to the systematic approach to call and recall introduced by pharmacists, ensuring all patients were contacted by their practice on several occasions, by letter, phone or opportunistically and offered a statin or cholesterol test. In this respect, because of the additional time spent working through lists of patients, the pharmacists may have enabled practices to reach patients who had previously not responded to written invitations. SOS may be more appropriately used in practices with outlying (low levels) of statin prescribing and cholesterol target achievement. Because of the volume of work involved, usual care practices were unlikely to have had the time to adopt this approach, and the GMS contract does not incentivise the additional work involved in persistently following up patients to increase uptake of statins or other interventions among patients who do not respond to initial invitations <xref rid="pone.0113370-Department2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113370-Fleetcroft1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Limitations</title><p>The directions of baseline imbalances in two variables which were related to the outcome (a reduced proportion of SOS arm patients prescribed a statin and a reduced proportion prescribed an optimal dose) are likely to have led to there being a greater burden of work for pharmacists and practices in the SOS arm than for practices in the Usual Care arm. The additional work comes from there being proportionately more patients requiring changes to their statin prescribing and cholesterol management, for tasks such as patient identification, engagement and appointment booking, prescribing, test ordering and booking follow up appointments. Pharmacists supported practices to carry out all of these tasks, and as SOS practices had a proportionately greater burden at baseline, additional work was required to overcome the burden. If practices were balanced at baseline in relation to these variables, the pharmacists would have had less of these tasks to address, and more time to focus on other tasks e.g. providing relevant educational support to GPs.</p><p>The clinical significance of the finding that achievement of cholesterol targets was not statistically significantly greater in incident SOS practices is unclear, given that cholesterol lowering may not form a necessary part of the causal chain between statin prescribing, consumption and improved clinical outcomes <xref rid="pone.0113370-Collins1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113370-DonnerBanzhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. However, recent UK consensus recommendations suggest statins should be prescribed to achieve values of at least &#x0003c;2.5 mmol/l for non HDL cholesterol <xref rid="pone.0113370-JointBritishSocieties1" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. Any improvement in clinical outcomes resulting from this study are likely to be conditional on improved statin prescribing persisting in both prevalent and incident patients over the long term.</p><p>Baseline cholesterol data was only collected for a sample of the prevalent patients at this time. The method of data collection did not allow for linkage to follow-up data, therefore we did not have baseline cholesterol levels for all prevalent patients identified at follow-up.</p><p>As with other trials of complex, multifaceted interventions, the effective components remain unknown without testing each component individually <xref rid="pone.0113370-OBrien1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113370-Medical1" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>.</p><p>Due to improvements in statin prescribing since the study completed, if implemented today, to retain effect size, the intervention may need to be targeted at underperforming practices rather than a random selection.</p><p>We did not conduct an economic analysis and therefore the policy cost-effectiveness of the SOS intervention remains unknown. The cost of delivering the intervention over a single year could be weighed against any longer term washover effect on statin prescribing, and a comparison made with usual care (in the UK) where general practices are financially incentivised annually for continuing to achieve targets for prevalent and incident patients. Previous economic analyses of pharmacist led outreach interventions have shown mixed results <xref rid="pone.0113370-Avery1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113370-Mason1" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>.</p><p>By design, we did not track individual patients from baseline to follow up, which precluded interpretation of results relative to pre-intervention characteristics in the same patients. Follow up analysis did not adjust for baseline differences however, these were in a direction that acted against the intervention effect, and so would not be expected to change findings. Improved achievement of cholesterol targets at follow up in the intervention group may have resulted from a combination of patients becoming more adherent with their statins and more patients receiving statins and retaining the same level of adherence. A greater proportion of SOS group patients were prescribed optimal dose statins, which suggests the latter, but we did not capture data on adherence which limits interpretation of the impact of the intervention on patients&#x02019; behaviour.</p><p>It is possible that other healthcare professionals could deliver SOS, and the model could generate improved outcomes in other therapeutic areas, but these hypotheses require further testing. The possibility of a null effect in the primary outcome cannot be ignored because of the narrow difference between the observed p-value and the a-priori threshold value of 0.05, and because the lower limit of the confidence interval included 1.00. However, all other outcomes were statistically significantly different and in a direction which favours the intervention. In particular, cholesterol levels were reduced in the SOS group, indicating some degree of change in practice by patients.</p><p>In 2004, coinciding with the study commencing, UK general practitioners&#x02019; national contract was revised to financially incentivise attainment of evidence based clinical quality indicators including statin prescribing and cholesterol targets <xref rid="pone.0113370-Roland1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. While this raised practices&#x02019; awareness of the need to address this area, the effect applied equally to all participating practices. Outcomes remained statistically significant despite confounding introduced by the UK pay-for-performance contract.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Given the challenges of an ageing population with multiple long term conditions and sub-optimal prescribing, healthcare providers require effective approaches to improve prescribing and therapeutic targets that are effective over the long-term. Morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease remains high, and statin prescribing remains sub-optimal. SOS offers a pragmatic model for improving long term evidence-based statin prescribing, and attainment of cholesterol targets, in a high risk population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0113370.s001"><label>File S1</label><caption><p>
