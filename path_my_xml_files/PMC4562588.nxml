During exercise, increased skeletal muscle metabolic demands are associated with progressive and intensity-dependent increases in body heat production, which must be dissipated to prevent excessive increases in the rate of body heat storage and, by extension, core and muscle tissue temperatures (Ingram and Mount <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">1975</xref>; Kenny and Jay <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In humans, evaporation of sweat from the skin surface accounts for &#x0223c;80% of heat loss during physical activity and is thus the primary means of thermoregulation during exercise (Gavin <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Kenney et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). As such, any disturbance to evaporative heat loss from the skin surface, especially during strenuous exercise, has the potential to compromise the net rate of heat loss to the environment and increase the rate of body heat storage with attendant compromisation of thermoregulatory balance (Aoyagi et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>) and exercise performance.</p><p>Clothing represents a layer of insulation that forms a barrier to evaporative heat loss by compromising heat dissipation from the skin surface, ultimately decreasing cooling efficiency and increasing core body temperature, skin temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>skin</sub>) and subjective ratings of skin wettedness and body temperature, particularly during exercise (Berglund and Gonzalez <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">1977</xref>; Nagata <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">1978</xref>; Pascoe et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Gavin <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Davis and Bishop <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). It follows that clothing fabrics that impose the least amount of resistance to evaporation (i.e., high vapor permeability, low thermal insulation) have the potential to optimize thermoregulatory balance (i.e., maintain the rate of heat storage near zero) during physical activity (Gavin <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>) and enhance exercise performance.</p><p>Clothing and textile manufacturers have created synthetic fabrics with enhanced evaporative characteristics that have been marketed to consumers as having superior heat loss (or &#x0201c;cooling&#x0201d;) properties capable of improving human exercise performance by enhancing physiological (e.g., thermoregulatory) responses to exercise (Bishop et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Davis and Bishop <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). These claims have been largely unfounded, with the majority of published studies indicating a lack of thermoregulatory advantage during exercise while wearing clothing made of synthetic versus natural (e.g., cotton) fabrics (Bishop et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Davis and Bishop <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). However, the majority of these studies was performed during mild-to-moderate intensity exercise (30&#x02013;70% of maximal rate of O<sub>2</sub> consumption; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="phy20003-e12505-mu2.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>) of fixed and variable durations (10&#x02013;60&#x000a0;min) in relatively small groups (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;11) of healthy trained (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="phy20003-e12505-mu3.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;55&#x000a0;mL&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000b7;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and untrained/recreationally active adults (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="phy20003-e12505-mu4.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;55&#x000a0;mL&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000b7;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) (Gavin et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Dai et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Brazaitis et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Corbett et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; De Sousa et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Furthermore, these studies were designed to unveil the cooling properties of synthetic fabrics worn during outdoor sporting activities and were thus carried out in environmental chambers with controlled temperature, humidity, and wind speeds. However, given the recent indoorization of outdoor sports (van Bottenburg and Salome <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and the use of&#x000a0;wind-free, humidity controlled, and temperate (&#x0223c;20&#x02013;23&#x000b0;C) indoor training/sporting facilities, clothing made of synthetic cooling fabrics will invariably be worn by athletes competing and/or training indoors, where (1) sweat rates as high as 1.8&#x000a0;L&#x000b7;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> can be achieved (Hamouti et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>); and (2) sweat rate and cooling efficiency becomes largely dependent on exercise intensity and duration, cardiorespiratory fitness (Sawka and Young <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) and clothing; and largely independent of ambient temperature, wind velocity and relative humidity. As such, wearing clothing made of a synthetic fabric with enhanced cooling properties may be especially advantageous during strenuous exercise performed indoors by trained athletes.</p><p>Accordingly, the purpose of this randomized, double-blind, crossover study was to test the hypothesis that wearing a clothing ensemble made of a synthetic fabric promoted by the manufacturer as having superior cooling properties would improve exercise performance of endurance trained athletes under ambient laboratory conditions that mimic the temperate environmental conditions of indoor training/sporting facilities. We further hypothesized that this improvement in exercise performance would be associated with improvements in thermoregulatory, cardiometabolic, ventilatory, and perceptual responses to exercise.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials &#x00026; Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Participants included nonsmoking men and women aged 18&#x02013;40&#x000a0;years with normal spirometry and a <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="phy20003-e12505-mu5.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> on incremental cycle exercise testing of &#x02265;60&#x000a0;mL&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000b7;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and/or &#x02265;125% of the predicted maximum value (Jones et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>).

(<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) recently reported no effect of wearing a t-shirt made of synthetic fabrics (81% polyester:19% elastin) versus 100% cotton on <italic>T</italic><sub>skin</sub>, cardiometabolic and perceptual responses to 45&#x000a0;min of cycle exercise at 50% of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="phy20003-e12505-mu14.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> in a hot (33&#x000b0;C) and humid (60% RH) environment.</p><p>The COOL and CTRL fabrics studied herein were not sufficiently distinct to provoke a change in subjective ratings of thermal sensation, skin wettedness, clothing comfort, breathing, and/or leg discomfort during exercise. These findings are consistent with previous studies reporting no effect of synthetic (e.g., polyester) versus natural (e.g., cotton) fabrics of varying assemblies (e.g., semi-nude or fully clothed) on perceptual responses to exercise (Gavin et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Brazaitis et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Sperlich et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; De Sousa et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>About 50&#x02013;60% of our athletes favored the COOL versus CTRL ensemble as it related to their level of perceived comfort, cooling, exercise performance, and training suitability. When asked to qualify their choice, the athletes cited the COOL ensemble as being lighter, thinner, more comfortable, and less compressive. These qualitative descriptors accurately depict the differences in yarn weight and size used to create the two ensembles; and are consistent with the most important clothing attributes discussed by Bishop et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Collectively, these findings suggest that garment properties related to comfort, and not cooling, per se, are important during high-intensity exercise. As such, consumers are likely to purchase athletic clothing based on its weight, thickness and perceived comfort, even in the absence of measurable (i.e., objective) improvements in exercise tolerance. Future studies, therefore, should consider the role of perceived clothing comfort on exercise performance in endurance-trained athletes, independent of and in relation to the thermal and comfort properties of the garment.</p><sec><title>Methodological considerations</title><p>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the purported &#x0201c;cooling&#x0201d; properties of a synthetic fabric on the exercise performance of endurance-trained athletes in an indoor environment. As such, tests were carried out under ambient laboratory conditions on a stationary bicycle (i.e., no convection) using a high-intensity constant power output exercise test protocol with participants fully clothed (vs. semi-nude) so as to mimic the environment of an indoor training/sporting facility as well as elicit relatively high sweat rates and marked increases in <italic>T</italic><sub>eso</sub> within a relatively short period of time. The net effect of the relatively short exercise duration, however, was that fluid (sweat) loss was &#x0223c;0.5% of body mass (representing minor dehydration); the rate of heat storage was modest; and the majority of our participants stopped exercise because of intolerable leg discomfort rather than thermal strain. For these reasons, we cannot preclude the possibility that the COOL ensemble may have resulted in improved exercise tolerance had mild-to-moderate intensity exercise of longer duration been carried out in a hot and/or humid environment where (1) more severe dehydration and rates of heat storage would have been present; and (2) exercise performance would have been more severely limited by thermal strain.</p><p>The COOL ensemble was not compared to an ensemble made of a natural fabric, such as cotton. Although cotton has good water-absorbing properties, it also tends to retain water, which hinders moisture transfer and impairs heat dissipation from the skin. Despite our lack of a natural fabric (cotton) control, several previous studies were not able to demonstrate a difference in thermoregulatory responses during exercise in a hot environment (&#x0003e;30&#x000b0;C) while wearing a cotton garment compared to a garment with professed enhanced &#x0201c;cooling properties&#x0201d; (Gavin et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Brazaitis et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Sperlich et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; De Sousa et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). As the COOL ensemble in this study was compared to a synthetic control ensemble specifically chosen by the manufacturer, and not to a 100% cotton ensemble, the purported superior &#x0201c;cooling&#x0201d; properties of the COOL ensemble, as it may relate to the established &#x0201c;cooling&#x0201d; properties of cotton, remains a matter of conjecture.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study do not support the hypothesis that wearing a garment composed of a synthetic &#x0201c;cooling&#x0201d; fabric improves exercise performance of trained athletes by enhancing thermoregulatory, cardiometabolic, ventilatory, and perceptual responses to exercise, at least not during high-intensity cycle ergometer exercise under ambient laboratory conditions that mimic the temperate environment of indoor training/sporting facilities.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the participants for their time and cooperation.</p></ack><sec><title>Conflict of Interest</title><p>The authors have no real or perceived conflicts of interest to disclose.
