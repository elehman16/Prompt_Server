</xref>The Bayley Scales are considered the gold-standard to assess childhood development; therefore, they are commonly used in the world, in comparison to other instruments of psychomotor development evaluation.</p><p>In this context, the objective of this study was to verify the correlation between the areas assessed by the Brunet-L&#x000e9;zine and the Bayley Scale III in the development of preterm infants at risk up to the age of two years.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHOD</title><p>This study included 88 children, 45 male (51.1%) and 43 female (48.9%), assessed between January and October 2011. The following inclusion criteria were adopted: birth weight &#x0003c;1500 g and attending the High Risk-Infant Outpatient Clinic at the University Hospital Polydoro Ernani de S&#x000e3;o Thiago, in Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC), or the High-Risk Follow-up Clinic Carmel Dutra, during the period of data collection. Exclusion criteria were diagnosis of genetic conditions, and congenital and/or heart malformation.</p><p>The following instruments were used for assessment: the Bayley III Scale and the Scale of Psychomotor Development of Children (the Brunet-L&#x000e9;zine Scale), in a single opportunity. The order of application was random. The scales were administered by two researchers, each of whom was in charge of one of the instruments from the beginning to the end of the study. Both researchers were trained for both instruments, and the reliability rate obtained for the application was considered adequate.</p><p>The Bayley Scale was created by the American psychologist Nancy Bayley, in 1969, and revised in 2006. It is composed of three sub-scales carried out by the child: cognitive scale, language scale (receptive and expressive communication), and motor scale (fine and gross motor areas). It is also composed of the socioemotional scale and the adaptive behavior questionnaire, which is answered by the people in charge of the child.<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">

</p><p>The Scale of Psychomotor Development of Children (the Brunet-L&#x000e9;zine Scale) is a French scale, developed in the 1950s by Odette Brunet and Ir&#x000e8;ne L&#x000e9;zine. After going through some changes, it was published in 1976. The manual and the items were translated to Portuguese in 1981.<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref> The scale aims at assessing children aged between 1 and 30 months as to the following areas of development: posture, hand-eye coordination, language, and sociability.</p><p>Considering the corrected chronological age (CCA) at the time of evaluation, the sample was divided into three groups: Group 1 (1 to 5 months and 29 days of CCA), with 32 children; Group 2 (6 to 11 months and 29 days of CCA) with 36 children; and Group 3 (18 to 23 months and 23 days of CCA) with 20 children. Prematurity correction was carried out by subtracting the chronological age according to the time left to complete 40 weeks.</p><p>Considering that the Brunet-L&#x000e9;zine Scale is conducted month by month, in Group 1 the choice was to include only children aged more than one month of CCA; this decision aimed at preventing children aged less than a month old did not perform any item, thereby generating zero score, this would lead to the underestimation of the child&#x02019;s performance.</p><p>When the children showed mild developmental delay, their tutors were advised as to the proper stimulation. Children with severe developmental delay were referred to specialized professionals after communication with the doctor in charge of the follow-up.</p><p>The calculation of concurrent validity between the Brunet-L&#x000e9;zine and the Bayley III scales was conducted based on the correlation between the scores in the areas assessed by the Brunet-L&#x000e9;zine score in relation to the scores in the Bayley III Scale, after the latter was corrected by constant -7. The scale manual found means seven points higher than the means found by the Bayley Scale evaluation.<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref> To neutralize the overestimation of development, a &#x0201c;correction&#x0201d; was carried out in the scores of the Bayley III scale, subtracting seven points from all composed or converted scores, aiming at analyzing, in a more reliable way, the psychomotor development, and to improve the precision of delay diagnoses.</p><p>Gross motor skills were analyzed based on the correlation between the developmental quotient for posture (DQP), in the Brunet-L&#x000e9;zine Scale and the gross motor score in the Bayley III Scale. The fine motor skills were related to the correlation between the developmental quotient for hand-eye coordination, in the Brunet-L&#x000e9;zine Scale, and the fine motor skills in the Bayley III scale. In the language field, there was a correlation between the developmental quotient for language (DQL) in the Brunet-L&#x000e9;zine scale, and the score of language in the Bayley III scale. To assess the sociability factor, the quotient for social reactions (QSR), in the Brunet-L&#x000e9;zine Scale, was correlated with the socioemotional score in the Bayley III Scale.</p><p>The concurrent validity between the Brunet-L&#x000e9;zine and the Bayley III Scales was calculated using the Pearson correlation, or its non-parametric version, the Spearman correlation. The levels of correlation were categorized - based on the following classification: 0.00-0.19, weak; 0.20-0.39, very weak; 0.40-0.59, moderate; 0.60-0.79, strong; and &#x0003e;0.80, very strong.<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>22</sup>
</xref> The analysis of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of the Brunet-L&#x000e9;zine Scale was conducted by the relations between the delay diagnoses in this scale with the Bayley III Scale; the values were corrected by the -7 constant. These measures were calculated based on the results of all participants. Data were exposed in the matrix for calculation. This demonstration in the matrix and the precision measures of the Brunet-L&#x000e9;zine Scale were obtained using formulas in the literature about clinical epidemiology.<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">

Between the Bayley III Scale and the Peabody Developmental Motor Scale - Second Edition (PMDS-2), there was similar moderate correlation (0.59) between the gross motor score (Bayley III Scale), and the gross motor quotient (PMDS-2) of 81 children aged 2 to 42 months.<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">

</p><p>In the fine motor skill area, there was positive moderate correlation between the modified version of the Brunet-L&#x000e9;zine Scale and the Bayley III Scale in Groups 1 (0.45) and 2 (0.49). In another study, it was possible to observe that the correlation of the fine motor score in the Bayley III Scale, with the PDI of the Bayley II Scale, was moderate (0.52). In another study conducted by the authors of the Bayley Scale, the fine motor score (Bayley III Scale) was compared with the motor fine quotient and with the visual-motor integration subtest, both in the PDMS-2, in which both correlations were moderate (0.59 and 0.55, respectively).<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref> In this study, the fine motor correlations in Groups 1 and 2 were moderate, as well as the correlation between the Bayley III Scale and other scales assessing fine motor skills.</p><p>In the field of language, there was very weak positive correlation between DQL (Brunet-L&#x000e9;zine) and the score composed of language (Bayley III Scale) in Group 1 (0.383), and there was strong positive correlation between both scores in Group 3 (r=0.890). By correlating the composed language score (Bayley III Scale) with the Mental Developmental Index (MDI) in the Bayley II Scale, as evident in the study published by the scale manual, there was strong correlation between them (0.71). A recent study that analyzed the presence of correlation between the language area of these two scales, indicated that there was strong correlation (0.81) between the language score in the Bayley III Scale and the MDI score.<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> When assessing the Bayley III Scale and another scale specific for language (Preschool Language Scale Fourth Edition - PLS-4), there was moderate correlation (0.66) between the composed scores, assessed in 69 children aged 5-42 months.<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref> It is worth mentioning that the correlation with higher value between the scales analyzed here was verified in the language area of Group 3.</p><p>By observing the social skills, there was moderate correlation in Group 2, higher than the one found in the specific analysis of the scale, which compared the socioemotional scores of the third version of the Bayley Scale, mental (MDI) and behavioral classification (Behavior Evaluation Scale for Children - BRS). In both correlations, between the children mentioned in the study presented in the Bayley Scale, the level of strength was weak, with values ranging from 0.25 to 0.37, respectively.<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> Values that low can be explained by the lack of scales that assess only socioemotional matters, as was the case of the previous version of the Bayley Scale.</p><p>When both test formats are used for important decision-making, the correlations must be very high, around 0.95.<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> Considering this statement, it is not possible to ensure that the Brunet-L&#x000e9;zine Scale is efficient to assess the neuro psychomotor development of children aged 1 to 24 months. However, by considering that strong correlations are a good level of relationship between the tests, it is observed that the Brunet-L&#x000e9;zine was more appropriate to assess the language of children aged between 18 and 24 months. In the other variables, when correlation was present, it was mostly moderate, which does not show the effectiveness of the evaluation of the area, since, in this study, the Bayley III Scale was considered as gold standard.</p><p>Sensitivity measures the ability of a test to properly detect individuals with a specific disease or condition.<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> Based on that, high values are essential for a discriminatory test to be classified as good, because children with developmental delay should not be left without a diagnosis. The earlier the intervention begins, the better the prognosis.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref> The modified version of the Brunet-L&#x000e9;zine Scale presented low sensitivity in all areas, ranging from 10% in the fine motor area (weak), to 75% in language (regular), which requires attention from the evaluators, adding to the evaluation a full observation of the children&#x02019;s development. The Brunet-L&#x000e9;zine Scale showed high values of specificity in all areas of development, that is, it identifies children without delay. The percentages of specificity ranged between 96.3% in social skills, and 95.2% in fine motor and language areas, all with specificity rates above recommendation.<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref> As to the PPV, the Brunet-L&#x000e9;zine Scale showed low numbers in all areas, ranging between 20% for fine motor skills and 43% for language. This means that a few individuals who had actual delay were among the diagnosed ones. On the other hand, this scale showed good NPV, ranging between 89.3%, in gross motor skills, and 98.8% in language. In the language area, the Brunet-L&#x000e9;zine Scale had high ability to identify individuals without any alteration. It is worth mentioning that predictive values are very much influenced by the prevalence of the event in the analyzed population, and probably did not reflect completely the reality of this scale as to the predicted development. Finally, the Brunet-L&#x000e9;zine Scale presented acceptable accuracy percentage rates in this study, ranging between 86.4% in gross motor skills, and 94.2% in language. Therefore, its ability to conduct proper diagnoses, both positive and negative, was not strong.</p><p>The choice of the researchers to use the Bayley III Scale as gold standard to assess the development of children, aimed at identifying more delays than its previous version, because, according to the Flynn effect,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">

This suggests that it is valid to assess children aged between 18 and 24 months in the language area. The Brunet-L&#x000e9;zine Scale showed low sensitivity and high specificity in all areas, besides PPVs below recommendation, and NPVs above recommendation in all areas. Accuracy was within the acceptable limits.
