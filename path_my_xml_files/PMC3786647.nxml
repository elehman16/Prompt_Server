A case&#x02013;crossover design compared the infrastructure of injury and control sites within each injured bicyclist's route. Intersection injury sites (N=210) were compared to randomly selected intersection control sites (N=272). Non-intersection injury sites (N=478) were compared to randomly selected non-intersection control sites (N=801).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At intersections, the types of routes meeting and the intersection design influenced safety. Intersections of two local streets (no demarcated traffic lanes) had approximately one-fifth the risk (adjusted OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.66) of intersections of two major streets (more than two traffic lanes). Motor vehicle speeds less than 30&#x02005;km/h also reduced risk (adjusted OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.92). Traffic circles (small roundabouts) on local streets increased the risk of these otherwise safe intersections (adjusted OR 7.98, 95% CI 1.79 to 35.6). At non-intersection locations, very low risks were found for cycle tracks (bike lanes physically separated from motor vehicle traffic; adjusted OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.59) and local streets with diverters that reduce motor vehicle traffic (adjusted OR 0.04, 95% CI 0.003 to 0.60). Downhill grades increased risks at both intersections and non-intersections.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These results provide guidance for transportation planners and engineers: at local street intersections, traditional stops are safer than traffic circles, and at non-intersections, cycle tracks alongside major streets and traffic diversion from local streets are safer than no bicycle infrastructure.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Despite many potential health benefits of cycling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1 R2 R3 R4">1&#x02013;4</xref> as an active transportation mode, safety concerns deter people from cycling in North America.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> Injury data from the USA suggest these concerns are valid: Beck <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> found that cyclists there were at greater risk of both fatal and non-fatal injuries than motor vehicle occupants. However, cycling injury risk could be much lower, as shown by continental differences in cycling safety. Canadian and American cyclists are two to six times more likely to be killed while cycling than Danish or Dutch cyclists<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> We reviewed the evidence on route infrastructure and injury risk,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> and found evidence that bicycle-specific infrastructure (eg, bike routes, painted bike lanes and off-road bike paths) was associated with the lowest injury risks, that sidewalks and multi-use trails were associated with higher risks, and that major roads had higher risks than minor or local roads. At intersections, roundabouts, higher vehicle volumes and multiple vehicle and turning lanes were associated with higher risks. However, the evidence on infrastructure and injuries remains sparse and faces challenges that have rendered conclusions difficult and often controversial. Many studies have unclear route definitions, broad route groupings and insufficient adjustment for exposure to risk and confounders.</p><p>We conducted a case&#x02013;crossover study in the Canadian cities of Vancouver and Toronto<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> to examine the influence of infrastructure on injury risk, while ensuring strict control for denominators (ie, exposure to risk, cyclist traffic volume) and for personal and trip characteristics (eg, propensity for risk-taking, time of day). The study design included two main sets of analyses. The first set, reported elsewhere,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> compared injury sites to randomly selected control sites of any type, and showed that bicycle-specific route infrastructure was associated with decreased injury risk, providing more detailed support to previous findings.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>

The following were differences in cycling-related circumstances between the cities: Toronto had streetcar tracks on many major streets and Vancouver was subject to a helmet law for adults, had traffic circles at some local street intersections, and had cycle tracks alongside a few major or minor streets (see route infrastructure definitions, <xref ref-type="table" rid="INJURYPREV2012040561TB1">table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="INJURYPREV2012040561TB1" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Definitions of route types and bicycling infrastructure, and selected characteristics as observed at the randomly selected study control sites</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Route types</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Major streets</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Paved city streets with more than two demarcated moving lanes of motor vehicle traffic, mainly arterials; median* motor vehicle speed 40&#x02005;km/h; median motor vehicle traffic 966/h, median cyclist traffic &#x02009;36/h</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Minor streets</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Paved city streets with two demarcated moving lanes of motor vehicle traffic, mainly connectors; median motor vehicle speed 37&#x02005;km/h; median motor vehicle traffic 576/h, median cyclist traffic 24/h</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Local streets</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Paved city streets with no demarcated lanes for motor vehicle traffic; most were in residential areas; median motor vehicle speed 30&#x02005;km/h; median motor vehicle traffic 48/h, median cyclist traffic 0/h</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Separated</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Routes that were physically separated from traffic, at least on segments between intersections; no motor vehicle traffic, median cyclist traffic 24/h, median pedestrian traffic 12/h</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" rowspan="1">Bicycling infrastructure</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Cycle track</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Paved path meant for cyclist use alongside major or minor streets, separated by a physical barrier, for example, a curb or bollards</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Bike lane</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Bicycle-only lane on a major or minor street, marked with solid or dotted lines on the street surface</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Bike path</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Bicycle-only paved path meant for cyclist use away from streets, &#x000a0;for example, in parks</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Multi-use path</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Paved or unpaved path meant for non-motorised use by pedestrians, cyclists, skaters and others, either alongside city streets or away from streets, &#x000a0;for example, in parks</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Sharrows or shared lane</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Section of a major or minor street with markings on the street surface indicating shared bike&#x02013;high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane, shared bike&#x02013;bus lane, or sharrows indicating bikes and motor vehicles share space</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Traffic diverter on local streets</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Median, diverter and any other treatment (at the nearest intersection) designed to prevent some or all motor vehicle traffic from entering the street</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Traffic slowing device on local streets</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Traffic circles or curb extensions (at the nearest intersection) and speed humps or bumps (within 100&#x02005;m of the site); designed to reduce motor vehicle speeds and, in the case of curb extensions, also facilitate pedestrian crossing</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Traffic circle</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">A small version (usually 6&#x02013;8&#x02005;m in diameter) of a roundabout implemented at intersections of two local streets (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="INJURYPREV2012040561F4">figure 4</xref>); all traffic is required to travel around the central circular island to the right</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>*Median vehicle speeds and traffic counts as measured at the randomly selected control sites.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>We conducted a case&#x02013;crossover study,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></p><p>The study population included injured cyclists aged 19&#x02005;years and over who were treated at emergency departments at study hospitals in Vancouver (St Paul's, Vancouver General) or Toronto (St Michael's, Toronto General, Toronto Western) between 18 May 2008 and 30 November 2009. Canadian hospitals are publicly funded so those injured and seeking emergency treatment in the catchment areas (the cities&#x02019; urban cores) are likely to present to one of the study hospitals. All study hospitals were university affiliated, and one regional tertiary trauma centre was included in each city. Injured cyclists were identified on intake as having been injured in a cycling crash. Hospital research staff reviewed intake records at least weekly, then relayed contact information to the study coordinators in their respective city. Introductory letters were sent to all potential participants, followed by a phone call from the study coordinator to invite participation and screen for eligibility. Up to 10 contact attempts per injured bicyclist were made over 3&#x02005;months following the injuries. We excluded cyclists who were:

The structured questionnaire<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> took 25&#x02013;45&#x02005;min to complete. The interviewers collected data on characteristics of the trip (eg, weather conditions, time of day, clothing worn, helmet use, etc) and of the cyclist (age, sex, education, income, cycling experience), although these were not required as adjustment factors in the analysis due to the crossover design. Characteristics of the injury and control sites, described below, were also documented (eg, presence of construction, where the cyclist was riding at the time&#x02014;eg, on the sidewalk or the street, which lane or side of street).</p><p>Participants traced their trip route on a city map (scale 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;31&#x02005;250) and indicated the injury site. The interviewer used a map wheel (Calculated Industries ScaleMaster 6020 Classic, Carson City, Nevada, USA) to determine the trip distance. Control sites on the same route were identified by multiplying a randomly generated proportion (MS Excel, Microsoft, Redmond, Washington, USA) by the trip distance, then tracing the resulting distance along the route using the map wheel. One control site was deliberately matched to the intersection status of the injury site, by adjusting it forward or back (even or odd random number, respectively) along the route until it matched. The other control site was selected in the same way, except without matching on intersection status. These unmatched sites were used in the first set of study analyses, reported earlier,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> but as some of them did match the injury site on intersection status by chance alone, we were able to include them as additional controls in this analysis to augment statistical power.</p><p>Trained observers completed a site observation form<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> developed for the study in consultation with transportation engineering personnel. The form was pretested for feasibility, detail and clarity at 16 sites, revised, then tested for intra-observer reliability at 25 sites, reported elsewhere.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> The observers were blinded to the injury or control status of the sites. Observations were timed to match the time of day of the injury trip (weekday vs weekend; morning rush, mid-day, afternoon rush, evening, night). The observation form recorded information at the location of the cyclist at each site and considered the cyclist's direction of travel. Observations included the characteristics of the routes and intersecting streets, the presence of cycling infrastructure (eg, bike lanes, cycle tracks, signage), presence and type of intersection (eg, two-way stop, four-way stop, stoplight, traffic circle), streetcar tracks and street lighting. Measurements included surface grade (measured using a Suunto PM-5 clinometer, Vantaa, Finland), distance visible along the direction of travel (measured using a Rolatape Measure Master MM-12 trundle wheel, Watseka, Illinois, USA), counts of motor vehicle, cyclist and/or pedestrian traffic volume in 5&#x02005;min in both directions and average motor vehicle traffic speed (five vehicles measured at normal traffic speeds, ie, not as they were accelerating from or decelerating to a stop, using a Bushnell Velocity Speed Gun, Overland Park, Kansas, USA).</p><p>Separate analyses were performed to evaluate the effects of infrastructure (<xref ref-type="table" rid="INJURYPREV2012040561TB1">table 1</xref>) in crashes occurring at intersections and non-intersections. Conditional logistic regression with one or two control sites per injury site was used to estimate associations between injury and infrastructural characteristics. The dependent variable was binary (1=injury site or 0=control site), and OR were calculated using the following model:<disp-formula id="INJURYPREV2012040561M1"><label>1</label><graphic xlink:href="injuryprev-2012-040561ueq1"/></disp-formula>
where &#x003c0;<sub>ij</sub> is the probability of injury for the ith subject and jth site, given the covariates x<sub>ij1</sub>, x<sub>ij2</sub>, &#x02026;, x<sub>ijp</sub>. i=1, &#x02026;, N; j=1, &#x02026;, n<sub>i</sub>. N is the number of subjects; n<sub>i</sub>=2 if there was one injury site and one control site and n<sub>i</sub>=3 if there was one injury site and two control sites; and p is the number of covariates.</p><p>Independent variables including route types and bicycling infrastructure were defined (<xref ref-type="table" rid="INJURYPREV2012040561TB1">table 1</xref>) with the help of city transportation engineering personnel. Most infrastructure variables offered in the models were the same for intersection and non-intersection analyses. For intersections, two additional design variables were offered: the route types meeting at the intersections and the type of intersection control. Initial analyses tested the effects of each variable in simple bivariate models. Two final multiple logistic regression models (one for intersections and one for non-intersections) were constructed using backwards selection, starting by offering all variables of interest. The variable with the highest p value (Wald test) was removed and the model refit with the remaining variables until all variables were statistically significant (p&#x0003c;0.05). Analyses were performed with SAS V.9.2.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Participants and trips</title><p>Of 2335 injured cyclists who were treated at a study emergency department during the study period, 927 were ineligible, 741 were eligible and 690 agreed to participate (414 from Vancouver and 276 from Toronto).

Low motor vehicle speeds were also protective. Average observed speeds less than 30&#x02005;km/h had about one-half the risk of higher speeds at intersections. Speed limits of 30&#x02005;km/h are mandated on residential streets in northern European countries where cycling is safer.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></p><p>Traffic circles were more hazardous than all other intersection types (traffic lights, two-way stops, four-way stops and uncontrolled intersections). All traffic circles were in Vancouver, at intersections of two local streets (intersections that were otherwise found to be very safe). In Vancouver, local street traffic circles are small (approximately 6&#x02013;8&#x02005;m in diameter; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="INJURYPREV2012040561F4">figure 4</xref>) unlike major street roundabouts common in Europe. Comparisons are difficult because of the size difference, but other studies have shown that large roundabouts (&#x0223c;30&#x02005;m in diameter) reduce injury risk for motor vehicle occupants and this has fostered interest in this intersection design.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> Despite the reduced risk for motor vehicles at roundabouts, studies of cyclists have found increased risks.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20 R21 R22">20&#x02013;22</xref> Br&#x000fc;de and Larsson<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> showed that roundabouts with radii greater than 10&#x02005;m were safer than smaller circles.

While not an infrastructural variable, it can be related to infrastructure (eg, sidewalk riding) or forced by infrastructure (two-way cycle lanes at one side of the street). At the time of the study, none of the route infrastructure in Vancouver or Toronto mandated cycling in the direction opposite to traffic. The wrong-way crashes in this study were among cyclists entering the intersection from sidewalks (n=10) or local streets (n=8; traffic lanes are not demarcated and cyclists rode on the left instead of the right side of the street). One other study found an increased risk of a crash for cyclists riding on sidewalks when entering an intersection in the direction opposite to traffic flow.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></p><p>Intersections with high cycling traffic counts (more than 75/h) were associated with increased injury risk. Most of these crashes were with motor vehicles (n=51), not with other cyclists (n=1). Many studies have found increased safety with increased trips by bicycle.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> Most data about &#x02018;safety in numbers&#x02019; is at the macro level (ie, city or country level), whereas our analysis examined the micro level (intersections). Two other recent studies examined the impact of increased cyclist volume at intersections: one in Finland showed lower crash risk with increased cyclist volume at a newly installed raised bicycle crossing;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> and one in Montr&#x000e9;al found injury risk increased at a lower rate than cyclist volumes at signalised intersections.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> Our results may thus not be generalisable.</p><p>At intersection locations, we found that any bike or pedestrian infrastructure that the cyclist was riding on before entering the intersection (eg, cycle tracks, bike lanes, sidewalks) was not significantly associated with injury risk. This is probably because, in Vancouver and Toronto at the time of the study, this type of infrastructure was implemented along streets between intersections, not through intersections themselves. Although many northern European countries implement special features for cyclists at intersections, these were almost never observed in our study cities. We could only measure the effects of infrastructure implemented at the time of the study.</p><p>The benefits of cycling-specific infrastructure were apparent at non-intersection locations. Our consistent finding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> that cycle tracks decrease risk are similar to findings by Lusk <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> in Montr&#x000e9;al.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref> some North American transportation safety advocates argue against cycle tracks and other bicycle-specific infrastructure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref> However, our results support separation from motor vehicles for injury prevention. Conversely, infrastructure that pairs cyclists with either motor vehicles (shared lanes and sharrows) or pedestrians (multi-use paths, sidewalks) offered no such protection. Shared lanes and sidewalks were associated with increased odds of injury, albeit not statistically significantly. Our findings highlight the importance of distinguishing bicycle-specific from mixed-use infrastructure in analyses of risk.</p><p>Similar to cycle tracks, local streets with diverters to reduce motor vehicle traffic were found to have very low risk, probably because they reduce motor vehicle volumes. Traffic slowing devices (eg, traffic circles, curb extensions and speed bumps or humps) are also considered &#x02018;traffic calming&#x02019; measures and were implemented to slow traffic on local streets, but were not found to have a significant benefit. One study found that motor vehicles may speed up immediately after a traffic-slowing device.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></p><p>We found that streetcar tracks and construction were associated with increased risk of cycling injury, consistent with our previous analysis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> The construction finding suggests the need for demarcated route detours to allow cyclists to avoid construction zones. Our finding that streetcar tracks are associated with injury appears to be new to the empirical literature, although these have long been thought hazardous by Toronto cyclists.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></p><p>Downhill grade was associated with increased risk at both intersections and non-intersections, similar to findings elsewhere,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>

While the overall topography of a city is not modifiable, routes targeted for bicycle-specific infrastructure can be selected to minimise elevation changes to improve safety and simultaneously reduce exertion from uphill travel. Level surfaces and gentle slopes have been shown to be preferred by potential riders.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> The importance of grade to both cycling safety and attractiveness highlights the opportunity to foster cycling in naturally flat cities.</p><p>The current study used a case&#x02013;crossover design<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> that addresses many of the challenges of observational studies of bicycle safety,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> including effective control for both exposure to risk and personal factors that may affect both risk and environmental exposure such as experience and risk aversion. The blinded observations and lack of reliance on self-report of site characteristics offer advantages over previously used methods.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> Cycling conditions were observed after the injury event, so we cannot be sure they were exactly as occurred on the injury trip. This should not affect stable infrastructure such as route type, but may affect more transient conditions, such as traffic counts. Because observations were made in the identical way for injury and control sites, misclassification is likely to be non-differential and to bias risk estimates to the null.</p><p>The most significant limitation of the current analysis was that we could only examine the effects of infrastructure that was present in the study cities, and not the full range of infrastructure that could be used to mitigate cyclist risk. This calls for replication of our study in other cities with different types of infrastructure, and for further studies as new infrastructure is built.</p><p>The analyses reported here do not take the severity of the injuries into account. A severity analysis is planned for the study data, but the main focus of the study was the initial risk of being involved in an injury crash, rather than the injury consequences. The study was restricted to cyclists whose injuries were serious enough to result in a visit to a hospital emergency department. By using hospital records, injuries caused by all kinds of crashes were included (eg, with a motor vehicle or not). We could not include individuals who were so severely injured that that they could not recall their trip route; however, few were excluded by this eligibility criterion (two fatally injured and 26 who could not remember their route). The results of this study therefore may not apply to those with minor injuries not requiring emergency treatment or with the most serious injuries.</p><p>We offered multiple variables to the models and some were likely to be significant by chance alone. We have attempted to be cautious in our interpretations, by looking for consistency with other studies, and recommending verification in future studies in which a result is novel. In addition, we have presented complete tables showing all variables in the unadjusted and adjusted models in supplementary tables (available online only) for examination by interested readers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Different infrastructure characteristics influenced risk at intersections and non-intersections. At intersections, significant variables were route types meeting at the intersection, intersection type, cyclist travel direction, motor vehicle speed, cyclist traffic count and route grade. At non-intersection locations, significant variables were bike or pedestrian infrastructure, streetcar or train tracks, construction and route grade. Only route grade was significant in both analyses.</p><p>Despite the differing variables important in the two analyses, there are consistent patterns: features that separate cyclists from motor vehicles and pedestrians (cycle tracks, local streets, traffic diverters) and lower speeds (motor vehicle speeds less than 30&#x02005;km/h, level grades) were associated with significantly lower injury risk to cyclists. These features are incorporated into transportation design in northern European countries with high cycling modal shares and low injury risk, and have been shown to encourage cycling in North America.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7 R8 R9">7&#x02013;9</xref> Important additional evidence from this study includes the importance of obstacles in reducing safety (traffic circles, streetcar or train tracks, construction). Transportation planners and engineers in many North American cities are interested in promoting cycling and will benefit from the accumulating evidence about the value of building environments sensitive to cyclists.
