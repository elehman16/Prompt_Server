Limited evidence in clinical studies suggests hormone changes after menopause may have a negative effect on tendon. This protocol describes a randomised controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) and exercise therapy in reducing pain and dysfunction associated with GTPS in post-menopausal women.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>One hundred&#x000a0;and sixteen post-menopausal women will be recruited and randomised to receive one of two exercise programs (sham or targeted intervention exercise) and transdermal creams (MHT cream containing oestradiol 50mcg and norethisterone acetate 140mcg or placebo cream). Interventions will be 12-weeks in duration and outcomes will be examined at baseline, 12-weeks and 52-weeks. The primary outcome measure will be the VISA-G questionnaire and secondary outcomes measures will include three hip pain and function questionnaires (Hip dysfunction and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Oxford Hip Score, Lateral Hip Pain questionnaire), a global change in symptom questionnaire (using a 15-point Likert scale) and a quality of life measure (AQoL-8D questionnaire). Data will be analysed using the intention to treat principle.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study is the first randomised controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of menopausal hormone therapy therapy alone, and with the combination of exercise therapy, to treat pain and dysfunction associated with GTPS. This study has been pragmatically designed to ensure that the interventions in this study can be integrated into policy and clinical practice if found to be effective in the treatment of GTPS in post-menopausal women. If successful, there is potential for this treatment regimen to be explored in future studies of other persistent tendon conditions in the post-menopausal population.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=366865&#x00026;isReview=true">ACTRN12614001157662</ext-link> Registered 31 October 2014.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12905-016-0311-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Hormone therapy</kwd><kwd>Exercise</kwd><kwd>Gluteal</kwd><kwd>Oestrodiol</kwd><kwd>Post-menopausal</kwd><kwd>Greater trochanteric pain syndrome</kwd><kwd>Tendinopathy</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is an overarching term used to describe a degenerative condition of the gluteus medius and minimus tendons (gluteal tendinopathy) and trochanteric bursa (trochanteric bursitis). The condition is characterised by intermittent or continuous pain at, or around, the greater trochanter of the femur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], often with long-term pain and disability. Greater trochanteric pain syndrome most commonly affects post-menopausal women between 45 and 63&#x000a0;years old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and is severely debilitating, resulting in limited activity, quality of life, employment and capacity to exercise. The reported incidence of GTPS is 1.8 per 1000 patients per year in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and prevalence rates of 23.5&#x000a0;% in women at risk of knee osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and 54&#x000a0;% in recipients of renal transplants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These statistics likely underestimate the prevalence of GTPS since misdiagnosis and lack of recognition of GTPS are common.</p><p>The increased prevalence of GTPS in post-menopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] suggests that deficits in female sex hormone may be implicated in the condition. A number of risk factors for tendinopathy are associated with levels of circulating female sex hormones - advancing age, female gender and body composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In pre-menopausal women, the likelihood of developing lower limb tendinopathy is lower than that of age matched men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In post-menopausal women, as oestrogen levels decline, collagen production declines, tendon becomes thinner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and rates of tendon pathology and the likelihood of tendon rupture increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It is known that supplemental oestrogen is beneficial for increasing skeletal muscle strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], reducing fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], preserving bone mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and preventing a decline in the collagen content of skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It is feasible that supplemental oestrogen in the post-menopausal population may also preserve tendon collagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and decrease tendon abnormality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Despite this theory, current knowledge of the physiological effect of female sex hormone on tendon is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], with some evidence of increased type 1 collagen upregulation and turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], increased fibroblast proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Animal studies also point to the upregulation of relaxin receptors and a resultant effect on the extracellular matrix of the tendon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], however the literature is limited, inconsistent and generally of poor quality. A small number of observational studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and one poorly designed randomised controlled crossover study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] have investigated the effects of hormone therapy on the Achilles and patellar tendon. None of these studies examined patient reported outcome measures (pain, function, quality of life) to evaluate the effects of such interventions. As yet, there are no studies looking at the effects of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) on gluteal tendon and no rigorous prospective RCT&#x02019;s have been published in any other tendon. In addition, the optimal dosage, duration and method of administration of MHT to affect molecular, mechanical, and morphological tendon outcomes are unknown.</p><p>Traditionally, physiotherapy and exercise are first line interventions in the clinical management of tendinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] with any form of injection (e.g. cortisone, platelet rich plasma or autologous blood) and operative interventions offered subsequent to conservative tendon management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. However, for gluteal tendon conditions, an abundance of research exists for both injection and operative methods and little exists for conservative treatment options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. If like other lower limb tendons, the gluteal tendons are responsive to load, then a similar treatment algorithm used in that of the patellar and Achilles tendon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], should be effective in reducing pain and dysfunction.</p><p>The most recent systematic review on the effects of treatment of gluteal tendinopathy concluded that there was a need to conduct further randomised controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Treatment interventions investigated included shockwave therapy, &#x02018;home training&#x02019;, corticosteroid injections and operative procedures (arthroscopic and open bursectomy, ilio-tibial band release, open bursectomy, tendon reattachment, trochanteric reduction osteotomy and endoscopic repair of gluteus medius tears). Only 1 out of the 14 included studies used exercise as an intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Rompe et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] compared a home training program involving progressive slow repetitive exercise (piriformis and ilio-tibial band stretching, straight leg raise, wall squat with ball and gluteal strengthening) with shock wave therapy and corticosteroid injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Exercise therapy was found to be less superior to corticosteroid injection at 1&#x000a0;month follow up but more superior at the 15&#x000a0;month follow up, indicating the longer-term benefits of exercise therapy. This response is similar to that seen in other tendons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This review demonstrates that the role of exercise therapy in the management of greater trochanteric pain syndrome needs further investigation.</p><p>The proposed study will investigate two feasible management options for post-menopausal women with GTPS - hormone supplementation and exercise. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of menopausal hormone therapy and exercise on pain and function in post-menopausal women with GTPS. We hypothesise that supplemental hormones and exercise may be beneficial for reducing pain and dysfunction measured by a clinical significant change in VISA-G scores and a significant improvement in quality of life measures. If successful, there is potential for this treatment regimen to be explored in future studies of other persistent tendon conditions such as Achilles, rotator cuff and lateral elbow tendinopathy in the post-menopausal population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>The trial has been registered on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12614001157662) and has a Universal Trial Number (U1111-1160-2743).

Upon presentation to their medical examination, participants will again be educated on the nature of the trial and asked to provide informed consent. Potential participants will be advised at that point that inclusion in the trial is on the provision that their medical history, clinical examination, blood samples and electrocardiograph (ECG) meet inclusion criteria.</p><p>The medical consultation will involve a full medical history to determine risk factors that would contraindicate the use hormone supplementation, and perform a clinical examination for the presence of greater trochanteric pain. Medical history will detail the history of presenting condition, family history, past medical history, social history (demographics, occupation, and recreation/activity participation), medication usage, substance use/abuse (alcohol, recreational drugs, smoker status) and allergies.</p><p>Clinical assessment to assess GTPS will involve five clinical pain provocation tests. Tests will include the Trendelenburg test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], palpation of the greater trochanter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], the Patrick-Faber test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], resisted external de-rotation test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and modified external de-rotation test (increased hip adduction moment). Participants are asked if testing reproduces reported symptoms or pain, the location of the symptoms and intensity of pain on a 0&#x02013;10 Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). A positive test is defined as a spontaneous reproduction of the participant&#x02019;s lateral hip pain. To be eligible for the trial, clinical testing must reproduce pain in 3 of 5 pain provocation tests.</p><p>Where a participant meets inclusion criteria and has not had a platelet-rich plasma (PRP), analogous blood injection (ABI) or corticosteroid injection in the hip region in the last 3&#x000a0;months, but is excluded from the hormone intervention on medical grounds, they will be randomised into a single arm (intervention exercise or sham exercise).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Blood sampling and electrocardiography</title><p>Participants who remain eligible for the study following medical consult, will be referred for blood tests and an electrocardiograph to confirm eligibility in the trial. Blood tests will examine lipid levels (fasting cholesterol, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein: HDL, low density lipoprotein: LDL), liver function (LFT), diabetes indicators (glucose, HbA1c), iron (Fe) studies and thyroid function (TFT). Serum levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and oestradiol will also be recorded as a baseline measure and compared to levels post pharmacological intervention. A 12 lead echocardiograph (ECG) will be undertaken to monitor if any arrhythmia or irregularities are present. Indicators for inclusion or exclusion of a participant will be made on clinical judgement by the treating physician, taking into account all individual tests results and their normative values.</p><p>Once deemed eligible for the trial, participants will be randomly allocated into an exercise group and a transdermal cream group.

To account for potential drop-out, we will recruit 116 participants (29 per group).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Randomisation, allocation and blinding</title><p>A block randomisation schedule will be generated using a web based randomisation program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.randomizer.org/">https://www.randomizer.org/</ext-link>) with the sequence tranferred onto a computer spreadsheet by a researcher external to the trial investigators, who will have no contact with participants throughout the duration of the trial. This external researcher will complete concealed allocation of participants to groups in accordance with the randomisation schedule. All data collected will be de-identified and only made accessible to the study investigators.</p><p>Participants will be blinded to allocation for both the exercise therapy and hormone therapy group. Placebo creams and sham exercise groups, may increase the success of participant blinding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The success of blinding will be formally measured during week 1 of the trial by asking participants to indicate which group for both interventions they believe they are allocated to. It is important to assess the success of blinding to determine if protection against participant expectation effects is maintained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The treating physiotherapists will be blind to cream type, but due to the nature of the intervention, cannot be blinded to exercise group. Detailed training of physiotherapists will be provided to ensure equivalent provision of care and motivation for both groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Unblinding of a participant and trial investigators to cream allocation will only be permissable in the unlikely event of an adverse reaction requiring medical team involvement.</p><p>Data analysts and outcome measure assessors will be blinded to group allocation. This will be achieved through direct communication from the external researcher preparing the randomisation schedule to the trial physiotherapist implementing the exercise intervention&#x000a0;and the pharmacist implementing the hormone cream intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Interventions</title><p>All participants will be educated on the nature of their pathology, the rationale for exercise treatment, the importance of adherence to their home program as well as activities to avoid (ascending and descending stairs, sitting in low chairs, lying on hip during sleep). They will be provided an information booklet that includes this information. The booklet details pain relieving postural strategies (standing, sitting and lying/sleeping) to adopt during the 12-week intervention. Participants may apply an ice pack to the lateral hip region at any time; are encouraged to stay active within their pain limits and to continue their normal pain medication regime during the 12-week intervention. Both medication use and ice application will be recorded throughout the trial in the participant&#x02019;s exercise/transdermal cream application diary. All participants are able to continue normal daily activities but will be asked to identify any medication usage for their tendinopathy (e.g. NSAIDs) and cease any other physical treatment (physiotherapy, etc.).</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Exercise therapy</title><p>Both exercise therapy groups will complete a 12-week exercise program prescribed by a physiotherapist. Participants in both groups will attend a physiotherapy consultation at baseline, 4-weeks, 8-weeks and 12-weeks post randomisation for progression of their exercise program and monitoring of adherence. A booklet that features photos and explanations of each exercise will be given to each participant for further reference and participants are invited to contact their physiotherapist at any time during the 12&#x000a0;week intervention if they have queries about their cream or exercise program. Before, during and after the 12&#x000a0;week program, participants are invited to contact the researchers with any questions about the trial. Two cycles of the exercise program will be completed twice daily (AM and PM). Both programs should take approximately 15&#x000a0;min to complete.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Gluteal La Trobe trial (GLoBE) protocol/intervention exercise therapy</title><p>Participants randomised into the intervention exercise group will be instructed in the GLoBE protocol, a gluteal tendon exercise program designed by clinicians who are expert in treating tendon pathology. Although numerous rehabilitation exercises (eccentric [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], concentric [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] and isometric [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]) have been described for the management of Achilles and patellar tendinopathy, there is little evidence on effective exercise therapy in the rehabilitation of GTPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. There is evidence that the use of isometric exercises may reduce tendon pain in the initial stages of rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] and allow the continuation of sporting activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. This pain relief may provide a window of opportunity for lower limb strengthening with isotonic exercise. The effectiveness of isometric exercises is yet to be validated in the GTPS population. The GLoBE protocol largely focuses on isometric loading of the gluteus medius and minimus, and strengthening of the kinetic chain &#x02013; quadriceps and calf muscle groups. It is a graduated exercise program where participants are able to progress through the stages in each subsection of gluteal, quadriceps and calf strengthening. The gluteal strengthening commences with a hip hitch in standing, whereby the participant, holding onto a wall or chair for balance, hitches their unaffected leg up off the ground (approximately 1&#x000a0;cm) whilst keeping their knee in full extension, causing the contralateral/affected gluteal tendons to be loaded out of a compressed position. This hip hitch is then integrated into dynamic exercises by adding a toe taps or hip swings as progressions. The most advanced exercise in the gluteal series, is a single leg wall squat. Quadriceps strengthening commences with a double leg &#x000bc; squat and progresses to a &#x000bd; squat, sit to stand exercise and then to step ups. Calf strengthening involves double leg calf raises, calf raises with toe taps and progresses onto single leg calf raises.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Sham exercise program</title><p>The control group will receive a sham exercise program not suitable for the rehabilitation of gluteal tendons, instructed by a physiotherapist. Like the GLoBE protocol, the program is completed as a cyclic three-stage approach, where participants are able to progress through each subsection of sham gluteal, quadriceps and calf strengthening. The sham program involves exercises for the kinetic chain in an unloaded environment (sitting) and thus, does not therapeutically load the gluteal tendons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Physiotherapy treatment integrity</title><p>A variety of methods will be used to ensure the integrity of the exercise intervention is maintained. All treating physiotherapists will have a minimum of 2&#x000a0;years clinical experience in private musculoskeletal physiotherapy practice and will undertake a compulsory 1&#x000a0;day training course. This will incorporate extensive education about GTPS, a step-by-step approach to the two exercise interventions and guidelines on trial reporting (participant adherence, adverse events, and clinical note taking). The education session will include group discussions and portions of experiential learning such as patient role play and formal clinical mentoring as outlined by Main et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] for training physiotherapists delivering interventions. Regular phone and email contact with the researchers and provision of a comprehensive treatment manual will aim to maximise therapist adherence to the protocol. Additionally, a large emphasis will be placed on the importance of equal service provision and standardisation of enthusiasm of both exercise protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p><p>Physiotherapists will use structured electronic recording forms for sham and intervention exercise programs. These will include a series of check boxes to prompt the clinician through each stage of the program and to ensure standardisation of treatment intervention. Additionally, the physiotherapist will be instructed to record exercises prescribed, adherence, use of pain or NSAID medications and/or ice application and any adverse events. These measures adhere to the recommended requirements for ensuring treatment fidelity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Clinical notes will be audited by research staff at 4-weeks and 12-weeks to ensure that all documentation is standardised, legible and complete.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Transdermal cream</title><p>All participants will be required to apply 1&#x000a0;g of the compounded transdermal cream daily to thin-skin areas of the body to aid absorption and rapid distribution of active ingredients. Cream application sites will be rotated every 5&#x000a0;days &#x02013; alternating between the inner right wrist and the inner left wrist. Rotation of sites every 5&#x000a0;days will reduce the likelihood of up-regulation of receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]; skin sensitivity by constant application to the same area and undesired build-up and delayed uptake of active ingredients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Participants will be advised to not to rub in too hard, but simply to spread the gel over the skin as thinly as possibly to optimise absorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].</p><p>Both the placebo and intervention transdermal creams will be applied using a metered dose pump dispenser manufactured by Medisca, a Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) registered supplier of pharmacy compounding products. This dispenser accurately delivers the required dose (1&#x000a0;ml) in one pump (mean error&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.056&#x000a0;ml, relative SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.4&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Both intervention and placebo groups will receive an identical instruction sheet for the application of the cream. The method of application will also be reinforced verbally by the physiotherapist in the first exercise treatment session. Any significant or severe adverse reactions will immediately be referred to a medical practitioner or emergency department for assessment.</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>Menopausal hormone therapy transdermal cream</title><p>The MHT cream is based on the active ingredients used in the Estalis Continuous transdermal patch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Cream application will involve transdermal delivery of supplementary oestradiol (50mcg) and norethindrone acetate (NETA) (140mcg), a progestin, in a VersaBase&#x000ae; for 12&#x000a0;weeks in duration. This is likely to increase serum levels of E<sub>2</sub>, with an aim to reach an optimum level of 295&#x02013;550pmol/L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].

This questionnaire contains a visual analogue score for pain, four questions related to pain, one question related to difficulty with moving after sitting and two activity related questions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. The VISA-G was found to have a test retest reliability of ICC<sub>2,1</sub> (95&#x000a0;% CI) of 0.83 (0.64 to 0.78) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Internal consistency was high with a Cronbach&#x02019;s Alpha of 0.81.

This study has been pragmatically designed to ensure that interventions implemented in this study can be integrated into policy and clinical practice if found to be effective in the treatment of GTPS in post-menopausal women. It aims to minimise bias through methodological features of randomisation, blinding where possible, concealed allocation and intention to treat analysis.</p><p>There are risks with any study involving pharmacological interventions, however considerable efforts have been made to minimise these. A transdermal method of administrating hormones has been chosen as it combines an efficacious use of oestrogen replacement with the safest route of administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Additionally it is the gold standard for menopausal hormone replacement therapy, as it has a lower risk of venous thromboembolism than oral administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]; it is easily formulated and titrated; and has an additional safety benefit of avoiding the hepatic &#x02018;first pass&#x02019; effect associated with oral administration, thus avoiding changes in clotting factors and sex hormone-binding globulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>].</p><p>The validity of GTPS as a clinical entity has been determined using convergence of validity principles, previously described by George and Delitto [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>], and diagnostic criteria based on by Fearon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. The convergence of validity principles involves gathering evidence from multiple sources with differing methodologies to determine if the underlying constructs are of similar meaning. Three main principles have been selected for the current study: expert opinion; biological plausibility; and diagnostic tests/strategies for minimising false positive diagnoses.</p><p>The validity of GTPS as a clinical entity is supported by research on biological plausibility. Pathological features of gluteus medius and minimus tendinopathy have been likened to that of supraspinatus tendinopathy and subacromial bursitis of the shoulder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Anatomically, the gluteus medius tendons inserts onto the lateral and posterior-superior portion of the greater trochanter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>], and the gluteus minimus onto the anterior portion of the greater trochanter and acts as a femoral head stabiliser through hip joint range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. The positioning of these tendons is such that loss of the lateral stability mechanism (frontal plane femoropelvic alignment and medio-lateral stability in standing) from hip abductor weakness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>], can cause compression of these structures and reproduction of lateral hip pain. Similarly, pain reproduction with passive elongation of the involved tendons or active contraction of these same tendons is reported as a clinical feature of gluteal tendinopathy/GTPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Clinical tests used to assess for GTPS in the trial are likely to reveal symptoms associated with one or both of these mechanisms. Additionally, common subjective clinical findings such as difficulty lying on their side at night [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>] and pain with weight bearing activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>] will be identified using the VISA-G questionnaire.</p><p>Due to the difficulties in diagnosing GTPS, there are aspects of our diagnostic criteria that are likely to improve diagnostic accuracy and minimise false positive diagnoses. Tendon experts recommend a battery of tests be used for clinical assessment and interpretation of hip abductor function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. This study will only include participants if they score &#x0003c;80 on the VISA-G questionnaire (a measure of pain and dysfunction associated with the condition) and have reproduction of lateral hip pain on a minimum of 3/5 diagnostic clinical tests.</p><p>Based on the convergence of this quantitative research, as well as the expertise of one of the authors (JC) who is a world-renowned tendon expert, with over 30&#x000a0;years of clinical experience in the area of tendon structure, function and dysfunction, the diagnostic criteria used to identify GTPS in this study have acceptable validity.</p><p>Development of the gluteal tendon rehabilitation program is based on expert opinion and guided by management strategies of other lower limb tendons. Commencing the program with gluteal isometrics is used as an initial pain relieving strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] prior to loading with internal perturbations (toe taps and hip swing). All gluteal exercises are performed avoiding compression of the gluteal tendons (no hip adduction/crossing midline), since compression is thought to induce tendon pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>] by altering mechanotransduction and causing fibrocartilage formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Additionally, activities involving hip adduction including side-lying in bed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>], and weight-bearing activities (stair climbing, rising from a chair) have been associated in lateral hip pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. In this program, all exercises aim at loading the gluteal tendon occur on a single leg as double leg exercises allow compensation with the other leg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>] and inefficient tendon loading. Furthermore, this program focuses on rehabilitation of the kinetic chain - sequenced physiologic muscle activations that allow performance of an integrated biomechanical task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. This has been recommended to ensure complete restoration of lower leg muscle-tendon function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. The sham exercise program, although activating the same muscle groups as the intervention, clinically, these exercises are not aimed at strengthening muscle groups or loading the gluteal tendons.</p><p>Study results will be disseminated to the wider health network by journal publication, and reported back to participants via email. The findings of this study will help determine the effectiveness of menopausal hormone therapy and exercise therapy in post-menopausal women with GTPS. Additionally it will identify if an exercise program targeted at loading of the gluteal tendons in addition to kinetic chain strengthening is more superior to that of a low load lower limb sham exercise program. The results of this study aim to help guide medical and allied health practitioners to make an informed decision on the management of GTPS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Trial status</title><p>Ongoing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AQoL, assessment of quality of life; Fe, iron; FSH; follicle stimulating hormone; GTPS, greater trochanteric pain syndrome; HbA1c, haemoglobin A1c; HDL, high density lipoprotein; HHS, harris hip score; HOOS, hip dysfunction and osteoarthritis outcome score; LDL, low density lipoprotein; LFT, liver function test; MHT, menopausal hormone therapy; ODI, oswestry disability index; OHS, oxford hip score; TFT, thyroid function tests; VISA-G; victorian institute of sport Australia &#x02013; gluteal questionnaire</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec33"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12905_2016_311_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>Participant Consent Form.
