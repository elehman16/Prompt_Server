Vitamin K antagonists, mainly warfarin, have been used for decades to prevent ischemic stroke in AF, but their use is limited due to interactions with food and other drugs, as well as the requirement for regular monitoring of the international normalized ratio. Rivaroxaban, a direct factor Xa inhibitor and the most commonly used non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant, avoids many of these challenges and is being prescribed with increasing frequency for stroke prevention in non-valvular AF. Randomized controlled trial (RCT) data from the ROCKET-AF(Rivaroxaban once daily oral direct Factor Xa inhibition compared with vitamin K antagonism for prevention of stroke and embolism trial in atrial fibrillation) trial have shown rivaroxaban to be non-inferior to warfarin in preventing ischemic stroke and systemic embolism and to have comparable overall bleeding rates. Applicability of the RCT data to real-world practice can sometimes be limited by complex clinical scenarios or multiple comorbidities not adequately represented in the trials. Available real-world evidence in non-valvular AF patients with comorbidities &#x02013; including renal impairment, acute coronary syndrome, diabetes mellitus, malignancy, or old age &#x02013; supports the use of rivaroxaban as safe and effective in preventing ischemic stroke in these subgroups, though with some important considerations required to reduce bleeding risk. Patient perspectives on rivaroxaban use are also considered. Real-world evidence indicates superior rates of drug adherence with rivaroxaban when compared with vitamin K antagonists and with alternative non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants &#x02013; perhaps, in part, due to its once-daily dosing regimen. Furthermore, self-reported quality of life scores are highest among patients compliant with rivaroxaban therapy. The generally high levels of patient satisfaction with rivaroxaban therapy contribute to overall favorable clinical outcomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>rivaroxaban</kwd><kwd>atrial fibrillation</kwd><kwd>anticoagulation</kwd><kwd>thromboembolism</kwd><kwd>adherence</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) remains the most frequent sustained cardiac arrhythmia<xref rid="b1-vhrm-14-013" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> causing significant morbidity and mortality, and estimates suggest that its prevalence is increasing.<xref rid="b1-vhrm-14-013" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> AF is a chronic disorder that results in left atrial stasis and is thus associated with an increased risk of left atrial thrombus formation, and subsequent embolization to the brain causing stroke or systemic arterial thromboembolism.

Since their introduction in the UK in 2008 (initially for thromboprophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis), prescriptions for NOACs have increased significantly, so that they now account for the majority of OAC prescriptions.

Fatal bleeding events were seen to occur at a rate of 0.2 per 100 patient-years, intracranial hemorrhage at a rate of 0.4 events per 100 patient-years, and major gastrointestinal bleeding events at 0.9 events per 100 patient-years. Strokes occurred at a rate of 0.7 events per 100 patient-years (43 strokes in all, of which 32 were ischemic). In addition, a further eight patients experienced a systemic embolic event (0.1 events per 100 patient-years).

NOACs have the advantage of being given in a fixed dosing regimen, for example, rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily for patients with creatinine clearance &#x0003e;50 mL/minute, or a reduced dose of 15 mg once daily in patients with creatinine clearance 15&#x02013;50 mL/minute.</p><p>Therefore, as might be expected, adherence to OAC is better in patients taking NOACs than that in patients on a VKA. An Australian study of 2,819 patients with NVAF (1,471 taking NOACs &#x02013; 15% apixaban, 44% dabigatran, 41% rivaroxaban &#x02013; and 1,348 taking warfarin), looked at the proportion of patients not filling a first repeat prescription and discontinuing the treatment within 12 months.<xref rid="b48-vhrm-14-013" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> In the NOAC group, 9% failed to fill a first repeat prescription and 30% discontinued within 12 months compared with 14% and 62%, respectively, in the warfarin group. Regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, heart failure, diabetes, and hypertension, showed that overall, patients on warfarin were 2.5 times more likely to stop taking their prescribed anticoagulant than were patients on an NOAC (HR 2.47, 95% CI: 2.19&#x02013;2.79).<xref rid="b48-vhrm-14-013" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> Danish experience shows a similar story. Registry data from 46,675 patients with NVAF were used to compare adherence with VKA to that seen with NOACs. Accordingly, 57.3% of patients were taking a VKA, 29.8% dabigatran, 8.5% rivaroxaban, and 4.4% apixaban.<xref rid="b49-vhrm-14-013" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> The highest levels of adherence, as measured by the Proportions of Days Covered (PDC) &#x0003e;80%, were seen in patients taking rivaroxaban. In comparison with rivaroxaban, the odds ratio for a PDC &#x0003e;80% for apixaban was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.69&#x02013;0.92), for dabigatran was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.66&#x02013;0.80), and for VKA was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.69&#x02013;0.83). Again, using rivaroxaban as a reference, the hazard ratio for repeat prescription gaps of between 7 and 89 days for apixaban, was 1.52 (95% CI: 1.36&#x02013;1.69), for dabigatran, 1.72 (95% CI: 1.60&#x02013;1.85), and for VKA, 2.36 (95% CI: 2.20&#x02013;2.52).

A study of 14,469 patients with NVAF, comparing adherence with once-daily rivaroxaban (11,477 patients) and twice-daily apixaban (2,992 patients) at 90 and 180 days, found that rivaroxaban users had a higher PDC &#x0003e;80% than apixaban users at 90 days (85.3% vs 79.9%, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) and at 180 days (75.8% vs 72.2%, <italic>p</italic>=0.001).

In preventing stroke and SE, both the ESC and National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend NOAC over VKA in patients with NVAF in whom anticoagulant therapy is indicated. Rivaroxaban is an NOAC approved for and indicated to reduce the risk of stroke and SE in patients with NVAF, and has been shown to be non-inferior in this regard to VKA. Rivaroxaban has been shown to be well tolerated with superior safety with regards to bleeding events compared with warfarin. Trial data from ROCKET-AF are supported by a huge wealth of data from post-marketing surveillance registries with rivaroxaban showing safety and efficacy, in line with what was seen in clinical trials. Such registries also provide important insights into the safety of rivaroxaban use in NVAF patients with comorbidities, including renal impairment, ACS, diabetes mellitus, malignancy, or old age. Post-marketing observational studies of rivaroxaban complement the outcomes of landmark trials through the use of unselected real-world populations and conditions and show that rivaroxaban use in patients with NVAF is associated with a low risk of major bleeding and stroke.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>DAG has received honoraria from Bayer (UK) PLC and AstraZeneca.
