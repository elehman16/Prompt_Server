Despite the publication of practice guidelines on prevention and treatment, not all patients with the disease receive the recommended healthcare, particularly with regard to smoking cessation advice where applicable. We have developed a tailored implementation strategy for enhancing general practitioners&#x02019; adherence to the disease management guidelines. The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of this tailored implementation intervention on general practitioners&#x02019; adherence to guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A pragmatic two-arm cluster randomized trial has been planned to compare care following the implementation of tailored interventions of four recommendations in COPD patients against usual care. The study will involve 18 general practices (9 in the intervention group and 9 in the control group) in Poland, each with at least 80 identified (at the baseline) patients with diagnosed COPD. The nine control practices will provide usual care without any interventions. Tailored interventions to implement four recommendations will be delivered in the remaining nine practices. At follow-up after nine months, data will be collected for all 18 general practices. The primary outcome measure is physicians&#x02019; adherence to all four recommendations: brief anti-smoking advice, dyspnea assessment, care checklist utilization and demonstration to patients of correct inhaler use. This measurement will be based on data extracted from identified patients&#x02019; records. Additionally, we will survey and interview patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease about the process of care.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of this trial will be directly applicable to primary care in Poland and add to the growing body of evidence on interventions to improve chronic illness care.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This trial has been registered with Clinical Trials Protocol Registration System.

Worldwide it has been ranked as the sixth leading cause of death for both genders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In 2020 COPD is projected to rank fifth worldwide in burden of disease. It is also projected to be the fourth leading cause of death worldwide by 2030 due to an increase in smoking rates and demographic changes in many countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. A national survey conducted in Poland in 2007 indicated that 34% of men smoked daily, 2% were occasional smokers, 19% were former smokers and 45% had never smoked. In women these percentages were 23, 3, 10 and 64% respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Epidemiological studies of COPD on a representative sample have not been performed in Poland, but estimates from smaller studies suggested a relatively high prevalence. Studies in selected geographical areas found that signs and symptoms of COPD were seen in about 10% of patients over 40-years old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Studies in large cities in Poland showed a 9.8% prevalence of COPD in populations between 41 and 72&#x000a0;years old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. These data are similar to other European data, describing prevalence rates of 4 to 11% in adults in Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The total number of people suffering from COPD in Poland is estimated to be about 2 million (on a population of 38 million inhabitants). This places COPD as the third most frequent chronic illness, and it is the fourth most common cause of death in Poland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>In Poland, most COPD patients are treated in primary care, which is the entry point to the public health care system. The system is based on compulsory health insurance, managed by the National Health Fund (NHF), which purchases health services from physicians and health care enterprises. Patients register with a particular primary care practice, signing on to an individual general practitioner&#x02019;s list of patients, and can be referred for specialist out-patient consultation or to a hospital, if needed. Ambulatory care (primary and out-patient specialist services) is provided by therapeutic entities (clinics or dispensaries) and by medical practices. Rehabilitation and long-term care are provided within both the health care sector and the social care sector, but coordination between the two is poor. Furthermore, limited financial resources available to the NHF and shortages of medical personnel have negative effects on access to health care services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>There is no national consensus on the care paths for COPD, and various guidelines on COPD are used, some of which national and some international [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, the guidelines in use share most of recommendations that we have identified and prioritized for the purpose of this trial. There is very little evidence on the degree of adherence to the guidelines for the management of COPD used by Polish physicians. One study, which evaluated the NHF funded COPD prevention program aiming to reduce the incidence and disability related to COPD by complex educational, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in people at risk, showed low rates of participation of primary health care providers despite additional funding. An interesting finding was that the extent of program completion was strongest for qualified general practitioners compared to physicians without specialty training or non-generalists: internal diseases specialists and pediatricians working at primary care setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>It is unclear whether studies on the implementation of evidence-based recommendations for primary care in COPD patients from countries with well-developed primary care systems, like the United Kingdom and the Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] can be translated to Poland. In searching the Polish medical literature, we did not find published research on the implementation of COPD guidelines or recommendations in Poland. The authors identified three papers with results partially related to the subject of this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. These found that 30% of patients with the diagnosis do not fulfill criteria for COPD, in 15% of cases spirometry had not been performed, and more than 70% of patients received inhaled steroids. Such findings suggest that adherence to diagnostic and management recommendations are inadequate.</p><p>Preliminary qualitative evidence from the authors&#x02019; earlier work showed that not one single guideline for COPD was used by all GPs or medical specialists. However, responders pointed out the individual recommendations most commonly used and the barriers to their implementation. The identified barriers for adhering to specific recommendations were: (1) lack of knowledge on smoking cessation brief intervention, (2) dyspnea evaluation tool was unavailable, (3) lack of a care plan, and (4) lack of demonstration-inhaling devices. Other research has indicated that the treatment parameters from the (COPD) guidelines are not always measured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The consequence is that not all patients receive recommended advice and treatment from their physicians.</p><p>This study is part of the Tailored Implementation for Chronic Diseases (TICD) international collaborative research project, which is being undertaken in Germany, Norway, Poland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The aim is to develop and test methods of tailoring knowledge-implementation interventions to determinants of practice in chronic illness care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In Poland, the focus is on the implementation of COPD guidelines in primary care. The research group in Poland selected four key recommendations applicable to primary care (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) from the four COPD guidelines most relevant to primary care and used in Poland.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Key recommendations for COPD management</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">A<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Brief smoking cessation counseling is effective and every tobacco user should be offered stop-smoking advice at every contact with health care providers.<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">B<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The prognosis of COPD should be estimated using the mMRC dyspnea scale.<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">C<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The patient should be given the basic information about his/her disease, its treatment and the expected effects of applied drugs, in order to enhance that the patient takes an active, participating role in the long-term treatment.<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">D</td><td align="left">The patient should be trained in the correct use of all devices which he/she will use for inhalation.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec><title>Objective</title><p>The objective of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a tailored implementation strategy for enhancing physicians&#x02019; adherence to four recommendations for the management of COPD patients in primary care.

It is localized in Lodz, the third largest city in Poland, with a population of about 750.000 inhabitants with broadly average mortality and morbidity, although specific health data are lacking. It aims to include general practices with adult patients with COPD under their care. The general practices will be randomized into two equally sized groups</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>The sample size calculation indicated that, for a two-arm cluster controlled randomized trial, a minimum number of 16 primary care practices with minimum of 30 COPD patients per practice is required. A total of 16 clusters and at least 480 subjects is required at baseline and follow-up (8 clusters in each study arm) to detect a difference, or change in adherence, of between 40% and 60% with selected COPD recommendations, between the intervention group (facilitating adherence to guidelines) and the control group without intervention (usual care), with 80% power, a two-tailed alpha of 0.05, and intra-cluster correlation of 0.05.</p><p>A standard sample size formula was used to calculate the initial unadjusted sample size requirements, followed by appropriate adjustment for clustering by general practice according to Campbell <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], with expected small clustering effect (ICC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05).

It was decided to increase the sample by 10% to account for contingencies such as non-response or recording error, giving a total of 18 practices.</p><p>With regard to the number of patients with COPD per practice, an assumed response rate of 58% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and a dropout of 35% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], which led to a total of 80 COPD patients needed per general practice at baseline.

Some of the practices were previously involved in other studies and have an established agreement with the Medical University of Lodz in the field of research and vocational training. The main study has been planned to take place between December 2013 and September 2014. After having given informed consent, primary care practices will be randomly allocated to one of two groups.

Missing values will be inputted with a multiple imputation method. Data will be coded, cleaned and locked before any analyses are made. Quantitative data will be analyzed in aggregate, using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS, (version 17, IBM Corp.) and Statistica (v10, StatSoft Inc.). Study groups will be compared with respect to the determinants of COPD and its improvement. Only members of the research team who need access to the database to fulfill their roles within the study will be granted access to the database. Demographic characteristics of the practices and the participants within the practices will be described using percentages, measures of central tendency (means or medians) and measures of variation (standard deviations or ranges). The analysis will be based on the patients nested within practices two-level model. The primary endpoint is the GPs adherence to four COPD guidelines after nine months, in each practice. Secondary endpoints are the change in smoking status and health care utilization during the nine months amongst included patients. Data will be compared between arms using logistic regression (with logit link function and binomial distribution) with patient at level one and practice at level two. The ICC and odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals will be estimated using two-level random intercepts logistic regression models. The significance level will be set at &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05 for all analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>This study has been approved by the Bioethical Committee of Medical University of Lodz, Poland (reference RNN/491/13/KB of 18 June 2013).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>COPD care improvement in primary care has not been studied extensively. Schermer <italic>et al.</italic> observed a small and late effect of e-learning and repeated feedback on the quality of spirometry as performed by family practice nurses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Kennedy <italic>et al.</italic> studied at practice-level training in a whole systems approach to self-management support for patients with chronic conditions and found no statistically significant differences between patients attending trained practices and those attending control practices, although this study looked at three conditions simultaneously (diabetes, COPD and irritable bowel syndrome) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. While these trials focused on specific aspects of COPD care (spirometry and self-management education, respectively), the intervention program in this study intends to improve COPD care more broadly.</p><p>Meulepas <italic>et al.</italic> studied the effect of a primary care model that included smoking cessation, inhaler technique training and dyspnea scoring according to the MRC scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. V an den Bemt <italic>et al.</italic> also studied guideline based COPD-management in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However their interventions were at least partly directed at patients, while this study targets general practitioners. This study is probably the first randomized trial of a tailored implementation program for improving primary care for patients with chronic illness in an East European country. The study has some limitations, such as possible selection bias since practices with less than 80 COPD patients were excluded as well as those that have some GPs teachers. Nevertheless, it is the authors&#x02019; belief that the results will be directly relevant and applicable to primary care in Poland. If the implementation program is effective, then wide-scale application would be warranted.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>Registration has been completed, general practices have been recruited and randomized, and interventions delivered.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ATS: American Thoracic Society; COPD: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; CRCT: Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial; ERS: European Respiratory Society; EU: European Union; GOLD: Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease; GP: General Practitioner; ICC: Intracluster Correlation Coefficient; ICD: International Classification of diseases; mMRC: Modified Medical Research Council; NHF: National Health Fund; NICE: National Institute on Health and Clinical Excellence; P: practice; PSLD: Polish Society on Lung Diseases; SPSS: Statistical Package for the Social Sciences; TICD: Tailored Implementation for Chronic Diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>MG-C and JK developed the idea and wrote the draft version of this protocol, which was commented by AK, IZ and KK.
