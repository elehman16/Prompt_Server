Many peri- and postmenopausal women experience various symptoms, including vasomotor symptoms, such as hot flashes, sweating, or palpitations, owing to decreased ovarian function and female hormone imbalance, which is referred to as climacteric syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Climacteric syndrome usually begins at the perimenopause period and persists for years, maybe even 20 to 30&#x000a0;years after menopause [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">According to a survey that targeted postmenopausal women in five Asian countries, more than 90% of the respondents reported that they experienced climacteric syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Another survey of natural menopausal women in South Korea reported similar results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Climacteric syndrome is not only a very common condition among peri- and postmenopausal women; it also interferes with their activities of daily living and deteriorates their quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Hormone therapy has been known to be the first option for the management of a variety of symptoms of climacteric syndrome, particularly vasomotor symptoms, but the range of use is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It is contraindicated in women with active liver disease, a history of breast or endometrial cancer, unexplained vaginal bleeding, coronary heart disease, or a history of venous thromboembolic events or stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. For this reason, there is a growing demand for safe and effective nonhormonal therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and complementary and alternative therapies, such as yoga, acupuncture, and herbal medicine, are becoming increasingly popular among postmenopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Traditional medicine is still widely used in East Asian countries, such as Korea, China, and Japan. Doctors of traditional East Asian medicine usually use a system called &#x02018;pattern identification&#x02019; for diagnoses and to determine how to treat a disease, based on the pattern of the symptoms and the signs observed in the patient. Danggwijagyaksan (DJS) and Gyejibongnyeonghwan are commonly prescribed herbal medicines for the management of climacteric syndrome in women in the peri- and postmenopausal periods, according to this system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The authors are already conducting a pilot trial to explore the feasibility and the effects of Gyejibongnyeonghwan for patients with a blood stasis pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]; this protocol explores the other popular herbal medicine, DJS. In traditional East Asian medicine, DJS has mainly been prescribed to patients with a dominant pattern of blood deficiency according to the system of pattern identification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The indications for DJS, as approved by the regulatory authorities of Korea or Japan, also include climacteric symptoms of weakness, fatigue, or easy exhaustion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">A clinical study conducted in Korea has shown that administration of DJS for 30&#x000a0;days can improve the Menopause Rating Scale scores of postmenopausal women with a blood-deficiency dominant pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In Japan, a retrospective review of medical records suggested that sleep disturbances among peri- and postmenopausal women with deficiency dominant patterns significantly improved after 5&#x000a0;months of DJS treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. They also reported a minor but significant increase in lean body mass and decreased diastolic blood pressure in the subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Another study demonstrated that DJS could effectively control headache and concomitant depressive symptoms in menopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Tanaka [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] demonstrated that DJS was effective in alleviating hot flashes induced by hormone therapy in climacteric women. According to results from experimental studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], this effect of DJS against climacteric syndrome seems to be due to the female hormone regulation of DJS. However, it has also been observed that DJS improved lutein deficiency in ovarian-deficient women, and that it did not cause hormonal disturbances in nonmenopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">In addition to anticlimacteric activity, DJS has been reported to be effective for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and anemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Recently, it has been actively studied for potential use as a promising cognitive enhancer in Parkinson&#x02019;s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] or Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] based on its neuroprotective effect in the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Danggwijagyaksan appears to be very useful for management of the symptoms of climacteric syndrome, but evidence based on rigorously designed randomized controlled trials is still lacking. The North American Menopausal Association has mentioned that herbal medicines such as DJS are widely used around the world as a means of nonhormonal therapy for the management of climacteric syndrome, but the lack of a scientific and clinical basis for this therapy remains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">The goal of this pilot study is to explore the efficacy, safety, and clinical trial feasibility of DJS for climacteric syndrome in peri- and postmenopausal women with a blood-deficiency dominant pattern.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par18">This is a randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial.

Based on a preliminary study similar to ours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], we assumed that the Menopause Rating Scale score of the placebo-treated group will change by 2.16, which is 20% of the mean difference of DJS group. Therefore, the mean difference between the Menopause Rating Scale scores of the DJS group and the placebo group is calculated to be 8.64. The standard deviation is estimated to be 8.012 according to the data acquired from the DJS-treatment group in the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Under this assumption, the required sample size was calculated to be 14 per group, with a significance level of 0.05 and a power of 0.8. Considering a dropout rate of 15%, 17 people are ultimately required per group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Data collection</title><p id="Par71">The investigators at the clinical trial center will obtain written informed consent after explaining the outline of the trial to the potential participants and then screen the eligibility of the participants. For the eligible subjects, baseline characteristics regarding the outcome measures of this study, as well as the social and demographic information and medical background, will then be collected. After randomized group allocation and medication, outcome measures regarding the effectiveness and safety of the intervention will be obtained at weeks 3, 5, and 9. The data will be collected through the patient-reported questionnaires and the participants will be blinded to the group allocation. The results of the questionnaires completed by the subject will be transferred to the clinical report form by the researchers, who are also blinded to the group assignment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par72">The statistical analysis will be performed by an independent statistician using SAS&#x000ae; version 9.4. When the demographic and sociological data of the subjects are continuous, they will be presented in the form of means and standard deviations. Differences between the two groups will be analyzed using Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test (or the Wilcoxon rank sum test). Categorical data will be presented in frequencies and percentages and analyzed using the chi-square test (or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test). The missing values will be processed using the multiple imputation method.</p><p id="Par73">The full analysis set will be the main analysis set, and the per-protocol set will be supplementary. The full analysis set will be used to achieve the ideal intention-to-treat principle as completely as possible. It will include all randomized participants unless the following criteria are met: the eligibility criteria are not met, the test drug has not been taken, or data cannot be collected because the participant was never evaluated after random assignment. The per-protocol set will include the participants who have completed the study without any major protocol violations.</p><p id="Par74">The analysis of covariance will be performed to analyze the between-groups differences of the primary and secondary outcome measures. The dependent variables will be the values acquired after intervention, the covariate will be the baseline value, and the fixed factor will be the group. A small group analysis will also be performed to explore the differences in the effect of DJS among the peri- and postmenopausal participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Data management and monitoring</title><p id="Par75">Any research-related information collected during the course of the study will be recorded in the clinical report form.

The medication, called Danggwijakyaksan (&#x07576;&#x06b78;&#x0828d;&#x085e5;&#x06563;, &#x0b2f9;&#x0adc0;&#x0c791;&#x0c57d;&#x0c0b0;), Danger Shaoyao san (&#x05f53;&#x05f52;&#x0828d;&#x0836f;&#x06563;), and Toki-shakuyaki-san (&#x05f53;&#x05e30;&#x0828d;&#x085ac;&#x06563;, &#x030c8;&#x030a6;&#x030ad;&#x030b7;&#x030e3;&#x030af;&#x030e4;&#x030af;&#x030b5;&#x030f3;) in Korea, China, and Japan, respectively, is one of the most commonly used prescriptions for menopausal syndrome in postmenopausal women in these countries. As mentioned, modern scientific studies have shown that DJS may be helpful for women suffering from climacteric symptoms via hormonal control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, the major indications for the commercial product of DJS, as approved by the regulatory authorities in Korea and Japan, include climacteric syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par78">However, there is still a lack of rigorously designed randomized controlled trials to assess the effects of DJS on climacteric syndrome in peri- and postmenopausal women, which is why we intend to explore the efficacy and safety of DJS and investigate the feasibility of a clinical study for this issue. The Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) checklist for this protocol is given in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. The findings acquired from this study will inform the design of a confirmative, full-scale randomized controlled trial in the future.</p><p id="Par79">One characteristic of this study is that it is designed based on pattern identification, a theory of diagnosis and a therapeutic system that is unique to traditional East Asian medicine. Danggwijagyaksan has been used predominantly in patients who are identified as having blood-deficiency patterns under this system. Therefore, this study will only include patients who have been identified as having a pattern of blood-deficiency using the Blood Deficiency Scoring System questionnaire in the screening phase. We are working on another pilot study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Gyejibongnyeonghwan (also called Guizhifulingwan or Keishibukuryogan in China and Japan) for the treatment of climacteric syndrome in peri- and postmenopausal women who are diagnosed with blood stasis patterns under the pattern identification system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A series of these studies involving the unique theory of traditional medicine is expected to provide a basis not only for the efficacy and safety of the herbal medicine for the treatment of climacteric syndrome but also for the means of applying the old and historical concepts of traditional medicine in East Asia in clinical settings today. It is expected that the results of these studies will be able to provide basic data to guide physicians or traditional medical doctors at clinics more clearly in prescribing candidate herbal drugs, such as DJS or Gyejibongnyeonghwan, for patients with climacteric syndrome.</p><p id="Par80">The first limitation of this study is that the primary outcome measure is the Menopause Rating Scale, which is entirely dependent on the participants&#x02019; subjective assessments. To compensate for this problem, we will also measure the levels of female hormones, such as follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol, as objective indicators of changes in the menopausal condition.</p><p id="Par81">The second limitation is the incompleteness of the placebo. The intervention in this study is a granule-form herbal medication acquired from the water extract of a mixture of medicinal plants that has a unique taste and flavor. The appearance of the control intervention, including the color, formulation, and packaging, will be identical to that of DJS, but it is very difficult to reproduce the taste and flavor precisely. To overcome this, we will do our best to ensure that the taste, flavor, and appearance mimic DJS as perfectly as possible. In addition, to ensure that these efforts were successful, we will assess the achievement of participant blinding after the end of the treatment period.</p><p id="Par82">Another limitation is that the scale of this study is too small, and the duration of medication administration and follow-up is short. This is because of the time and financial constraints of the research projects supporting this trial. However, based on the findings that will be acquired from this exploratory pilot study, we will be able to design a further study with improved treatment and follow-up durations.</p><sec id="Sec29"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par83">The recruitment of participants is currently underway.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec30"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par91">
