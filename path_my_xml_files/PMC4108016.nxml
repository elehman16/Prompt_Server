On the basis of limited evidence from both human and animal studies, the World Health Organization (WHO) has classified RF-EMFs as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. WHO considered the RF-EMFs provocation studies on children of different ages to be a high-priority research in the 2010 Research Agenda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Russian National Committee on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (RNCNIRP) announced that absorption of EMF in a child&#x02019;s brain was greater than in an adult&#x02019;s brain because larger brain areas including those responsible for intellectual development were exposed in a child&#x02019;s brain in their resolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. As a child&#x02019;s brain is also undergoing development and its intellectual functions are maturing, it is more susceptible to environmental hazards than an adult&#x02019;s brain.</p><p>Lindholm et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] monitored local cerebral blood flow during exposure to Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) mobile phone radiation in a teenager group (14 &#x02013; 15&#x000a0;years old). They also measured electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure, and temperature simultaneously. They concluded that there were no significant changes during the short-term RF-EMFs exposure. Kramarenko and Tan recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) changes during the exposure of ten adults and ten children (12&#x000a0;years old) to a GSM phone. They suggested that cellular phones may reversibly influence the human brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Preece et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] examined whether a standard mobile phone exposure at 902&#x000a0;MHz had a significant effect on cognitive function in 18 children (10 &#x02013; 12&#x000a0;years old). There was a tendency for reaction time to be shorter during exposure to radiation than in the sham condition, but no effects reached statistical significance after the Bonferroni correction. Haarala et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] investigated the potential effects of a standard 902&#x000a0;MHz GSM mobile phone on 10 &#x02013; 14&#x000a0;year old children&#x02019;s cognitive function, and found that the mobile phone had no effect on children&#x02019;s cognitive function. Kwon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] investigated the effects of GSM mobile phone use on the auditory sensory memory in 17 children (11 &#x02013; 12&#x000a0;years old). They found that a short exposure to mobile phone EMF had no statistically significant effects on the neural change-detection profile measured with mismatch negativity. Although such studies as mentioned above have examined the effects of GSM mobile phone on teenagers or children, there are a few studies investigating about the effects of WCDMA mobile phone radiation on children or teenagers.</p><p>The autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays an important role not only in physiological situations, but also in various pathological settings. Among the different available noninvasive techniques for assessing the ANS, heart rate variability (HRV), which is obtained from heart rate, has emerged as a simple and noninvasive method to evaluate the sympathovagal balance at the sinoartrial level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Respiration rate is also closely associated with HRV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Therefore, we selected the three physiological variables including heart rate, respiration rate, and HRV to assess ANS activity.</p><p>In this double-blind study, two volunteer groups of 26 adults and 26 teenagers who were mostly middle school students were simultaneously investigated by measuring physiological changes in heart rate, respiration rate, and HRV for ANS, eight subjective symptoms, and perception of RF-EMFs during sham and real exposure sessions. In contrast to many other studies that have examined certain aspects of physiological changes, subjective symptoms, or perception respectively, this study investigated simultaneously these three factors to more reliably examine the bio-effects of WCDMA mobile phone radiation on two groups, especially teenagers. The aim of this study was to test whether RF-EMFs affected heart rate, respiration rate, and HRV, or gave rise to subjective symptoms in adults and teenagers. We also compared the ability of adults and teenagers to perceive exposure to RF radiation. We tested the null hypothesis that adult and teenager groups would have no differences in ANS, subjective symptoms, or perception between sham and real exposures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>The experiment was performed as a double-blind study with a total of 52 subjects: 26 adults and 26 teenagers.

We used the electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS) screening tool developed by Eltiti et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] to exclude EHS subjects. We excluded electromagnetic hypersensitive individuals, because their conditions were more psychological than physiochemical, resulting in some possible bias in our results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].

Background extremely low frequency (ELF) fields at the head level in the laboratory were measured to ensure that they did not influence the subjects. The average ELF electric and magnetic fields were 1.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.0&#x000a0;V/m and 0.02&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.01 &#x003bc;T, respectively, measured using an electric and magnetic field analyzer (EHP-50C; NARDA-STS, Milan, Italy).

Both the average background ELF and RF-EMFs were negligible.</p><p>To achieve better control over exposure, we used a WCDMA module with Qualcomm chipsets (baseband: MSM6290, RF: RFR6285, power management: PM6658, San Diego, CA) to generate WCDMA RF-EMFs instead of a regular smart phone. The WCDMA module continuously transmitted at a mean output power of 250&#x000a0;mW (24 dBm) at 1950&#x000a0;MHz, which was measured using a wireless communication test set (E5515C, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). The module was inserted into a dummy phone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and the location of the module was varied to meet the recommended restriction in specific absorption rate (SAR)<sub>1g</sub> of 1.6&#x000a0;W/kg for general public, according to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Standard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The SAR measurements were made with a DASY 4 measurement system (SPEAG, Zurich, Switzerland), and a Twin SAM (specific anthropomorphic mannequin) phantom was filled with head tissue-equivalent liquid (mass density, 1000&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>3</sup>) as specified by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

Heart rate, respiration rate, and HRV were obtained with a computerized polygraph (PolyG-I, Laxtha, Daejeon, Korea) with a sampling frequency of 512&#x000a0;Hz. The data were transferred to a laptop computer (X-note R500, LG Electronics, Seoul, Korea) and analyzed using data acquisition software (Telescan 0.9, Laxtha) and analysis software (Complexity software, Laxtha).

For LFP/HFP, however, significant differences were seen between some stages during both real and sham exposure sessions in both groups. One disadvantage of the LFP/HFP analysis is that it is considerably influenced by stress, which can increase or decrease LFP/HFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Hjortskov et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] reported that psychological stress could result in an increased LFP/HFP. Nam et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] reported that LFP/HFP monotonically increased at each stage during 30&#x000a0;min of sham exposure in both EHS and non-EHS groups. In this experiment, one of the potential sources of stress was the requirement that the subjects not move during the 64-min experiment. In fact, the &#x0201c;no-movement&#x0201d; requirement was the factor that drew the most complaints from the participants, especially the teenagers. Therefore, the significant increase in LFP/HFP with time in the real and sham exposure sessions of both groups must have resulted from factors other than field exposure such as psychological stress, anxiety, or environmental factors.</p><p>For the eight subjective symptoms attributed to WCDMA mobile phone radiation, neither the adult group nor the teenager group showed significant differences between sham and real exposures in any of the four stages. Cinel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] found no evidence suggesting that exposure to mobile phone RF-EMFs affected subjective symptoms. Koivisto et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] also reported that the RF-EMFs exposure did not produce any consistent subjective symptoms or sensations such as headache, dizziness, and fatigue in the non-EHS subjects. In conclusion, RF-EMFs did not give rise to subjective symptoms in adults or teenagers in this study.</p><p>No significant differences were seen in the percentages of participants who believed they were being exposed between the real and sham exposures in either the adult or the teenager group. Kwon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] reported that they found no evidence that their 84 participants perceived GSM mobile phone EMFs. All participants, even including six subjects with high self-rated sensibility, were not able to perceive mobile phone EMFs. No significant differences in percentages of perception were seen for either group among participants who believed they were being exposed during either pre-exposure or post-exposure periods between real and sham exposures. Also, no significant differences were observed in the percentages of perception for either the adult or teenager groups during sham exposure sessions (pre-exposure, sham exposure, post-exposure). Therefore, our experimental protocol appeared to be minimally biased since we confirmed no delayed effects, no differences in pre-exposure condition, and no difference in the percentages of those who believed they were being exposed during the pre-exposure, sham exposure, and post-exposure periods. In this study, the subjects had only two choices, &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;no&#x0201d;, to the perception inquiry of RF-EMFs. However, it could have been biased against subjects who were not sure. For future study, it is recommended to give subjects another choice, &#x0201c;unsure&#x0201d;, and to exclude the answer in calculating the perception accuracy.</p><p>Children are more preferable to teenagers as participants in this study because the former are more vulnerable than the latter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, it is difficult for children due to stress to participate in our experiment, which needs a &#x0201c;no-movement&#x0201d; requirement for approximately one hour. It is also difficult to recruit children because of difficulty in obtaining parents&#x02019; approval. We finally recruited teenagers as the second best. Those are the reasons why there are only a few provocation studies with children. Croft et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] measured alpha activity for both GSM and WCDMA exposure among adolescents, young adults, and elderly groups. They reported an effect of GSM exposure in young adults, but observed no effect in adolescents or the elderly, or in any age group, as a function of WCDMA exposure. This result for WCDMA exposure is consistent with ours, even though they examined brain activity and we did heart rate.</p><p>There are three limitations in this study. The first limitation is the small number of participants. The number of 26 adults and 26 teenagers may not be to conclude that there are no effects of radiation emitted by WCDMA in both adults and teenagers. Moreover, any effect of WCDMA mobile phone radiation on the autonomic system might be quite limited and difficult to detect. Therefore, to draw some more definitive conclusions on this, a much larger sample will be needed. Secondly, in our study, more subjects received sham exposure for the first session. Ideally, the same number for each session would be better. However, the skewness is small and probably makes no difference. Lastly, we did not investigate the effects of the repetitive and daily regular exposure to RF radiation emitted by WCDMA mobile phones, which could be hazardous to teenagers, as well as adults. Therefore, further study on repetitive and daily regular exposure is necessary to examine the long-term effects, especially on teenagers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In both adults and teenagers, there were no significant differences in heart rate, respiration rate, or LFP/HFP, which are all related to ANS, between sham and real exposure to a WCDMA module (average power, 24 dBm at 1950&#x000a0;MHz; specific absorption rate, 1.57&#x000a0;W/kg) for 32&#x000a0;min. There was no association between eight subjective symptoms and short-term RF-EMFs exposure in either group. We could not find evidences of the hypothesis that the self-perception of the exposure between two groups was different. Therefore, based on our physiological data, survey of subjective symptoms, and percentages of participants who believed they were being exposed, no effects were observed in teenagers or adults as a result of 32&#x000a0;min exposure to RF radiation emitted by WCDMA mobile phones.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ANOVA: Analysis of variance; ANS: Autonomic nervous system; ECG: Electrocardiogram; EEG: Electroencephalograms; EHS: Electromagnetic hypersensitivity; ELF: Extremely low frequency; EMF: Electromagnetic field; ERP: Ear reference point; FCC: Federal Communications Commission; GSM: Global System for Mobile Communications; HFP: High-frequency power; HRV: Heart rate variability; IEEE: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers; LFP: Low-frequency power; max: Maximum; min: Minimum; n: Number; RF-EMFs: Radio frequency-electromagnetic fields; RNCNIRP: Russian National Committee on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection; SAR: Specific absorption rate; SD: Standard deviation; WCDMA: Wideband code division multiple access; WHO: World Health Organization; yr: Year; 3&#x000a0;G: Third generation.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>SBC set up the WCDMA module and collected experimental data.
