Cannabidiol (CBD), the non-intoxicating cannabinoid found in cannabis, has shown pro-cognitive effects and preliminary evidence has indicated it can reduce the number of cigarettes smoked in dependent smokers. However, the effects of CBD on cognition have never been tested during acute nicotine withdrawal. The present study therefore aimed to investigate if CBD can improve memory and reduce impulsivity during acute tobacco abstinence. Thirty, non-treatment seeking, dependent, cigarette smokers attended two laboratory-based sessions after overnight abstinence, in which they received either 800&#x02009;mg oral CBD or placebo (PBO), in a randomised order. Abstinence was biologically verified. Participants were assessed on go/no-go, delay discounting, prose recall and N-back (0-back, 1-back, 2-back) tasks. The effects of CBD on delay discounting, prose recall and the N-back (correct responses, maintenance or manipulation) were null, confirmed by a Bayesian analysis, which found evidence for the null hypothesis. Contrary to our predictions, CBD increased commission errors on the go/no-go task. In conclusion, a single 800&#x02009;mg dose of CBD does not improve verbal or spatial working memory, or impulsivity during tobacco abstinence.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Nicotine withdrawal consists of multiple physiological, affective and cognitive symptoms that can peak within hours of stopping smoking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Grabski, <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> recently conducted a meta-analysis of cognitive tasks sensitive to tobacco abstinence. Abstinent smokers, in comparison to satiated smokers, show greater impulsivity on two specific tasks, <italic>delay discounting</italic> (defined as the degree to which one prefers smaller, immediate rewards over larger, more delayed rewards<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>) and <italic>response inhibition</italic> (the ability to stop a pre-potent response e.g. craving for cigarettes; a marker of executive functioning; and theoretically important for successful smoking cessation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>). Abstinent smokers also showed impaired arithmetic and recognition memory ability, both of which includes a core component of working memory and were therefore interpreted as potential evidence for effects of abstinence on working memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Therefore, pharmacotherapies targeting improving cognition during tobacco abstinence may be useful for the treatment of tobacco use disorders.</p><p id="Par3">Cannabidiol (CBD), the non-intoxicating cannabinoid found in cannabis, may have a novel application in nicotine withdrawal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Thus far, CBD has been shown to reduce craving in both pre-clinical and clinical models of heroin addiction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Furthermore, it may have a specific utility in cigarette smoking. Morgan, <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> found that a single week of ad-hoc CBD via inhaler, compared to placebo, reduced cigarette smoking by almost 40%, however craving was unaffected. Hindocha <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> found that 800&#x02009;mg oral CBD, in comparison to placebo, reversed attentional bias away cigarette cues, and reduced explicit liking of cigarette stimuli but this also occured in the absence of changes in withdrawal and craving. CBD may also have pro-cognitive effects and has, in multiple studies, been shown to protect against the detrimental cognitive effects of THC, and particularly in the domains of verbal episodic and recognition memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In regards to impulsivity, Bhattacharyya, <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> found opposite effects of THC and CBD in the para-hippocampal gyrus during a response inhibition task. Borgwardt, <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> found CBD deactivated the left temporal cortex and insula but was not associated with increases in regional activity relative to placebo.

For example, Ren <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> conducted a preclinical study investigating heroin self-administration and found that although self-administration itself was unaffected by CBD, cue-induced heroin-seeking behaviour and reinstatement were both reduced. CBD also inhibited relapse behaviour during active heroin intake. In regards to human research, Hurd, <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> conducted a pilot double-blind, placebo-controlled investigation in opioid-dependent individuals who were abstinent for 7 days. They found that cue-induced craving was significantly reduced after a single administration of CBD, and this persisted for 7 days. In regards to the effects of CBD on cigarette smoking, Morgan, <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> found a 40% reduction in cigarettes smoked after one week of ad-lib CBD inhaler vs. placebo, however no mechanisms were investigated. The study was based on previous research showing that higher levels of CBD in smoked cannabis reduced the &#x0201c;wanting&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;liking&#x0201d; of cannabis related stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Finally Hindocha <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> found that CBD reversed attentional bias away from cigarette cues, compared to placebo, in abstinent, dependent cigarette smokers. Participant&#x02019;s attentional bias under CBD was therefore no longer different from satiety. Moreover, Hindocha <italic>et al</italic>. found a reduction in explicit &#x0201c;pleasantness&#x0201d; of cigarette cues. Taken together, these findings are consistent with the possibility that CBD has utility in modification of the salience of drug cues (bottom-up cognition) and not necessarily with the modulation of top-down cognitive processes such as impulsivity. Further investigation is required to confirm this.</p><p id="Par18">This study has several methodological strengths including using tasks and domains that have been previously been shown to be impaired during tobacco abstinence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Furthermore, this study had a moderately large sample size in a crossover design, informed by a power calculation and inflated by 50% to account for &#x0201c;winner&#x02019;s curse&#x0201d;. The experimental medicine design of the study allowed for an economical and mechanistic evaluation of CBD on tobacco withdrawal. Finally, abstinence was confirmed by biological verification (carbon monoxide). However, there are also some limitations. Given the incompletely elucidated mechanism of CBD, the present study may have not selected the correct dose for the therapeutic effects of CBD. There has only been one published dose-response study of CBD in humans which was specifically designed to test the anxiolytic effects in public speaking but only tested three doses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Therefore dose selection generally copies that used in previous single-dose studies. The dose-response effects of CBD may follow an inverted U shaped curve, and thus our 800&#x02009;mg dose may be too high for the therapeutic dose window<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. We did not collect plasma to monitor the pharmacokinetics of CBD. However, this study was informed by previous pharmacokinetic data from the same 800&#x02009;mg oral dose of CBD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Furthermore, only a single dose of the drug was given, and it may be that CBD is more effective with repeated dosing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Future research should investigate multiple doses and repeated administration to reach plasma concentrations that are at a steady-state. Finally, some participants in our sample (17 out of 30) had a history of cannabis use although none were current cannabis users (confirmed by urinalysis and drug history). The average last use of cannabis was 100 days previously (over 3 months; See Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). It may be that the effects of CBD are dependent on cannabis use history, therefore future hypothesis-driven studies should investigate if CBD has differential effects in cannabis users and cannabis na&#x000ef;ve volunteers.</p><p id="Par19">In conclusion, this study finds that in dependent cigarette smokers who were abstinent overnight, CBD did not improve cognition on tasks that have been shown to be impaired during cigarette abstinence and this was confirmed by Bayesian analyses in support of the null hypothesis. This research suggests that CBD is not efficacious in reversing the cognitive impairments associated with acute nicotine abstinence in cigarette dependence, although future research is required to investigate different doses and dosing schedules.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Design and participants</title><p id="Par20">Thirty participants attended 3 sessions (7.85&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.77 days between sessions).

Participants were instructed to remain abstinent from midnight the night before the two experimental &#x02018;abstinent&#x02019; sessions resulting in an average of 11&#x02009;hours abstinence (range 9.5&#x02013;13&#x02009;hours).
