This is especially evident in the emergency department (ED), which continues to be the primary location where patients receive care prior to hospital admission, or are discharged. Additionally, since the acute setting of the ED serves as the initial point of entry for newly diagnosed HF, patient data pertaining to this event is important to explore.</p><p>Whereas there is extensive information in acute myocardial infarction (MI) trials, registries and population health data sets regarding the use of the ambulance,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> there is little describing the mode of presentation (either ambulance or self-present) in acute HF (AHF). In patients with acute MI, extensive networks and resources as well as public health initiatives have been developed to enhance and improve the use of ambulance services. Patients with acute MI using ambulance services are at higher baseline risk and higher risk for subsequent short-term (eg, 30-day) clinical events.</p><p>Data from Canadian patients enrolled in Acute Studies of Nesiritide in Decompensated Heart Failure (ASCEND-HF) showed that 27% of trial and 52% of registry patients arrived by ambulance.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Other population health data have also shown that 50% of patients admitted to hospital for AHF arrive via ambulance, and although associated with other high-risk features, ambulance arrival independently predicted early mortality.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;6</xref> However, uncertainty exists with respect to the use of emergency services across a broader group of patients including those that utilise an emergency service call as the start of their healthcare encounter. Furthermore, there has been no description of the detailed timeline of care provided from symptom onset through hospital admission of patients with AHF that would mirror information available on patients with acute MI.</p><p>Accordingly, we designed a substudy to collect prehospital data on individuals enrolled in the ASCEND-HF trial. We hypothesised that patients who presented via ambulance would be at higher risk for early mortality after controlling for patient-related factors. We further describe the relationship of mode of presentation on the clinical outcomes including mortality, rehospitalisation and dyspnoea.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>The study design and results of the ASCEND-HF trial have been previously published.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Briefly, the ASCEND-HF study evaluated nesiritide versus placebo in 7007 patients with acute decompensated HF (ADHF) enrolled within 24&#x02005;h of first intravenous HF-related treatment. Participants were required to have each of the following at time of randomisation: dyspnoea at rest or with minimal activity; &#x02265;1 accompanying sign (respiratory rate &#x02265;20 breaths/min or pulmonary congestion/oedema with rales &#x02265;1/3 base); and &#x02265;1 objective measure of HF (evidence of congestion/oedema on chest X-ray; B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) &#x02265;400&#x02005;pg/mL or <italic>N</italic>-terminal pro-BNP &#x02265;1000&#x02005;pg/mL; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure &#x0003e;20&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg; or left ventricular ejection fraction &#x0003c;40% in the previous 12&#x02005;months). There was no requirement for patients to have presented via emergency services (eg, ambulance) or self-present, but all patients had to be admitted to hospital for treatment of the ADHF.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Early process of care substudy design</title><p>Patients in the prospectively planned early process of care substudy were enrolled between April 2009 and August 2010 at 206 sites in Canada and the USA. Patients from outside North America were also eligible but based on differences in the structure and organisation of emergency medical services (EMS), inconsistent data capture and enrolment into this substudy, these patients (n=1742) were excluded from further analysis. The patients were required to provide written informed consent for the ASCEND-HF trial.</p><p>Sites were asked to provide information on whether or not patients had called emergency services (eg, 911, 000, 112), and if they arrived via ambulance or self-presented (SP; eg, walk-in, come by private vehicle or public transit). Additional information was collected on time from symptom onset, hospital or ED contact, first laboratory work and time of admission. Length of stay and other times were captured in the main case report form. Symptom onset was defined as the date and time of the qualifying HF event. Hospital arrival time was defined as when the patient arrived to the ED. Time to first medication was defined as when the study drug or placebo infusion was started. Most patients (n=960, 89.9%) received an intravenous diuretic after presentation to the ED and before the study drug; however, the times were not recorded.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The aim of this study was to compare two groups of patients: those who presented by ambulance versus SP. Baseline characteristics for the selected cohort were tabulated according to presentation groups. Categorical variables were summarised through percentages and continuous variables by median and IQR for each presentation groups separately. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was applied to test the unadjusted differences between groups for continuous variables, and the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test for the discrete variables.</p><p>The relationship between the mode of presentations and outcomes (both short term and long term) was explored through multivariable analysis. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models were applied for short-term (30-day) and long-term (31-day to 180-day) outcomes, respectively. The model for 30-day all-cause death was adjusted for age, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), sodium, qualifying episode of dyspnoea and systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline. Both models for composite event of 30-day death or HF rehospitalisation and 31-day to 180-day death were adjusted based on age, BUN, creatinine clearance, sodium, qualifying episode of dyspnoea, SBP at baseline; and history of cerebrovascular disease, depression, HF, chronic respiratory disease. The adjusted list of covariates was validated through the ASCEND-HF risk model.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Dyspnoea, measured using a Likert scale, at 6 and 24&#x02005;h was compared using the same methods as the overall trial.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>

When additional variables were added, including time of presentation, weekday or weekend, none of these were independently significant predictors of the above outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this prospectively designed substudy, we demonstrated that 22% of patients with AHF in the ASCEND-HF trial presented via ambulance. There are three principal novel observations emerging from our study: the patients presenting via ambulance: (1) are older, more likely to female and have a higher ejection fraction; (2) their risk by traditional markers including vital signs, natriuretic peptides and renal function do not differ from those who self-present; and (3) their early and adjusted mortality was twofold that of patients who self-present.</p><p>Prior studies have described the rate of ambulance use in unselected populations of patients with AHF seen in the ED. In two prior Canadian studies, between 38% and 52% of patients with AHF seen in the ED arrived via ambulance.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In the study by Lee <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> patients arriving via ambulance were at an over twofold higher risk for 7-day mortality and factor into the risk score intended to predict poor outcomes. Since an ambulance trip by itself confers (to the best of our knowledge) no direct detrimental effect, this likely reflects the patient population more likely to utilise EMS: patients who are older, socially isolated and female.</p><p>Should the mode of arrival be incorporated into patient-level decisions or triage? It is likely that this feature is confounded by the above factors in addition to cost concerns, symptom duration and availability of other modes of transport, and thus captures unmeasured confounders and patient preferences rather than actually providing a risk factor linked to the disease state. This is supported by our analysis demonstrating no difference in traditional or advanced biomarkers such as BNP, yet a twofold difference in the risk of death at 30&#x02005;days.</p><p>Whether or not patients with AHF should be directed to call emergency services and be transported by an ambulance as those with acute stroke or MI are encouraged to do so via public service messages is uncertain. The prevalence of HF is high in the community,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and thus the implications to patients, payers and providers should be considered before deploying a community-wide public health message. Additionally and since RCT-proven therapies for treating AHF are non-existent, what additional benefit will the rapid arrival, diagnosis, triage and transport have on clinical outcomes? Research involving integrated health teams equipped with the appropriate knowledge, equipment (such as rapid turn-around biomarkers including BNP) and treatments need to be systematically studied. One such randomised trial is underway testing the utility of rapid access testing of BNP in the ambulance trying to shorten the time to therapy and potentially clinical outcomes (NCT01634425, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>). In the ED, use of biomarkers has aided in the diagnosis of HF,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> provides improved discrimination when used in diagnostic scores<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and once integrated into clinical practice, is cost-effective.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Early trials involving therapies available prehospital for acute MI and stroke have demonstrated a reduction in early mortality or morbidity. One AHF trial using prehospital high-dose nitrates demonstrated a reduction in early adverse clinical events.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Replication of this and other novel therapies need to be tested in appropriately designed RCT, as other therapies with an early positive signal have yet to demonstrate efficacy.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>

For example, patients who live alone may be unable to get to the ED at night, or on the weekends due to availability of family or friends to transport them to the ED and other factors such as patient preferences may play a role in mode of transportation.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Prehospital delay has also not been linked to clinical outcomes; however, patients with &#x0003c;24&#x02005;h since symptom onset have a lower BNP and a shorter length of stay.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Indeed, when added to the multivariable model, these factors were not independently significant predictors of clinical outcomes in ASCEND-HF.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>While this is a prospectively designed substudy of a high-quality RCT, certain limitations deserve mention. First, in designing the study, we recognised the difficulty in capturing information in a global trial given the substantial differences in the meaning and delivery of ambulance services in different countries (and within countries). We therefore had to limit the data presented to that of North America where services are more homogeneous. Whether similar findings are evident elsewhere in the world is uncertain. Second, we captured detail about time from symptom onset; however, patient description of symptoms and their timing may vary based on severity of symptoms, chronicity of disease, prior similar events and other unknown confounders. The sites captured this information in an identical fashion; yet, there is limited information on the other potential confounders including the trigger for needing emergent care which may vary significantly across patient groups and regions. Third, ASCEND-HF represents a more pragmatic RCT and differences may exist in non-RCT populations due to the certainty in the diagnosis of HF; however, our findings should stimulate registry and population health studies to adequately describe and report their findings.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> ASCEND-HF, required signs, symptoms and an objective marker of HF to ensure that HF was present&#x02014;prior validated criteria such as the Framingham,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Boston<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and other criteria need validation in the current era given the improvements in understanding the clinical phenotype of HF. Fifth, ASCEND-HF required patients to be identified and subsequently consent to participate. Both of these further limit generalisability as clinical trial sites and research team members had to be available and may have approached individuals who were less symptomatic yet still requiring hospitalisation for HF. Similarly, patients who participated may have also had less overall symptom burden or risk than patients who declined participation. Finally, we present HRs with 95% CI, and for some of our outcomes, these cross the 1.0 on the lower boundary. These should be interpreted accordingly and are considered hypothesis generating in their meaning.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In the ASCEND-HF trial, 22% of patients presented via ambulance and these patients were older and more likely to be female, yet did not differ in other major prognostic measures such as natriuretic peptides. However, the adjusted mortality rate was twice the rate for patients presenting via ambulance than those who self-present. Understanding patient-related and system-related factors of ambulance use for patients with AHF is important. Future studies should be cautious about utilising ambulance use in risk scores.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> JAE, MP, AFH, PWA, RCS, CMO and RMC are solely responsible for the design and conduct of this study, all study analyses, the drafting and editing of the manuscript, and its final contents.
