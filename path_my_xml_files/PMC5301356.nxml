The objectives of the current analyses were to evaluate T1 lesions and other magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures, including whole brain volume and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) of normal appearing brain tissue (NABT), and the proportions of patients with no evidence of disease activity (NEDA), over 2&#x000a0;years.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Patients enrolled in the ADVANCE study received continuous peginterferon beta-1a every 2 or 4&#x000a0;weeks for 2&#x000a0;years, or delayed treatment (placebo in Year 1; peginterferon beta-1a every 2 or 4&#x000a0;weeks in Year 2).

A limitation is the need for frequent administration and associated injection-site adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Attachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules (pegylation) has been shown to improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of protein therapeutics, including interferon beta-1a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The approved dosing schedule of pegylated interferon beta-1a (peginterferon beta-1a) for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) of one subcutaneous (SC) injection every 2&#x000a0;weeks is less frequent than other currently available injectable therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>The efficacy and safety of peginterferon beta-1a in patients with RRMS were demonstrated in the ADVANCE study, a 2-year, Phase 3, multicenter study with a 1-year placebo-controlled period. In Year 1, peginterferon beta-1a (125 mcg SC) administered every 2 or 4&#x000a0;weeks resulted in a significantly lower annualized relapse rate (ARR), risk of relapse, and 12-week confirmed disability progression than placebo, with a safety profile similar to established interferon beta-1a therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. After 96&#x000a0;weeks of treatment, ARR was further reduced in patients who continued on peginterferon beta-1a every 2&#x000a0;weeks, and was maintained in the every 4&#x000a0;weeks treatment group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results reflected the clinical findings, showing that peginterferon beta-1a every 2&#x000a0;weeks significantly reduced the mean number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions, new T1 hypointense lesions, and gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions, and the mean volume of T2 hyperintense and T1 hypointense lesions, when compared with placebo and with the peginterferon beta-1a every 4&#x000a0;weeks treatment group at Week 24 and Week 48. In Year 2, there were further relative reductions in the number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions in both continuous peginterferon beta-1a groups compared with the delayed treatment group (patients who received placebo in Year 1, and were re-randomized to peginterferon beta-1a every 2 or 4&#x000a0;weeks in Year 2). The mean number of Gd&#x02009;+&#x02009;lesions at 2&#x000a0;years was significantly lower in the peginterferon beta-1a every 2&#x000a0;weeks group than in patients who crossed over from placebo to peginterferon beta-1a every 2 or 4&#x000a0;weeks at Week 48 (delayed treatment group) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Overall, patients receiving continuous peginterferon beta-1a throughout the study displayed better efficacy than the delayed treatment group, and every 2&#x000a0;weeks dosing was more efficacious than every 4&#x000a0;weeks dosing. Peginterferon beta-1a was well tolerated across all treatment groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and the safety profile was maintained over the 2&#x000a0;years. In total there were 9 deaths (7 had received at least 1 dose of study drug), which an independent data safety monitoring board concluded were not likely related to study drug and did not change the risk-benefit profile of peginterferon beta-1a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>As treatments have improved, achievement of minimal disease activity has become a realistic goal and ARR endpoints have become a less sensitive measure with which to evaluate new therapies in RRMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. No evidence of disease activity (NEDA; also known as freedom from measured disease activity [FMDA]) is a new, more stringent clinical endpoint in MS incorporating both clinical and MRI aspects of disease activity, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and has been evaluated in several clinical trials of disease-modifying therapies (natalizumab, cladribine, combiRx [interferon beta-1a and glatiramer acetate], fingolimod, peginterferon beta-1a), although there has been variation in the definition used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Analysis of NEDA in Year 1 of ADVANCE showed that significantly more patients receiving peginterferon beta-1a every 2&#x000a0;weeks achieved NEDA compared with the peginterferon beta-1a every 4&#x000a0;weeks and placebo groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].

Patients who met the following key eligibility criteria were recruited between June 2009 and November 2011: diagnosis of RRMS as defined by the McDonald criteria, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] age 18&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;65&#x000a0;years, Expanded Disability Status Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] (EDSS) score of 0&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;5, and at least two clinically documented relapses in the previous three years (at least one within the 12&#x000a0;months prior to randomization). Patients with progressive forms of MS, and those who had previously received interferon treatment for MS for longer than four weeks&#x02019; duration, or less than six months prior to baseline, were excluded. The protocol was approved by each site&#x02019;s institutional review board and was conducted according to the International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. Every patient provided written informed consent prior to study entry.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Randomization and blinding</title><p>For the first year of the study, patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive SC injections of placebo, or peginterferon beta-1a 125 mcg every 2&#x000a0;weeks or every 4&#x000a0;weeks. To maintain dose blinding, all patients received an injection every 2&#x000a0;weeks; patients assigned to peginterferon beta-1a every 4&#x000a0;weeks received alternate injections of placebo and peginterferon beta-1a. During Year 2, all patients received dose-blinded peginterferon beta-1a, with patients initially randomized to active treatment continuing on the same dose regimen, and patients receiving placebo in Year 1 re-randomized to peginterferon beta-1a every 2 or 4&#x000a0;weeks at Week 48 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>All management, site personnel, investigators, and patients were blinded to treatment assignment.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The MRI analysis population comprised patients in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population who entered Year 2, consented to participate in MRI analysis and had any MRI data. Negative-binomial regression was used for analysis of new or newly-enlarging hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images (adjusted for baseline number of T2 hyperintense lesions); multiple logit regression was used for the analysis of Gd&#x02009;+&#x02009;and new T1 hypointense lesions (adjusted for baseline number of respective lesions). The total number of new active lesions was determined based on Gd&#x02009;+&#x02009;and T2 lesion numbers without double counting. This was compared for each continuous peginterferon beta-1a group versus the delayed treatment group based on negative binomial regression, adjusted for baseline number of Gd&#x02009;+&#x02009;lesions. Changes from baseline in T2, T1 and Gd&#x02009;+&#x02009;lesion volumes, whole brain volume, and MTR of NABT were compared using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Post-hoc NEDA proportions were calculated directly, based on the definitions described above, using data from all eligible patients.</p><p>The primary analysis used last observation carried forward (LOCF) data (patients who did not have all measurements, but had no evidence of disease activity on any of the available measurements, were considered as NEDA). In a sensitivity analysis, patients who did not have all MRI measurements were excluded from the calculation of NEDA, even if they had no evidence of disease activity on available measurements. A logistic regression model was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding p-values for between-group comparisons.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Discussion</title><p>The outcomes from this analysis of MRI data and NEDA status are consistent with those data previously reported in the ADVANCE study, supporting the efficacy of peginterferon beta-1a dosed every 2&#x000a0;weeks. Continuous peginterferon beta-1a every 2&#x000a0;weeks consistently provided significant improvements in MRI lesion-based endpoints (including reduced numbers and/or volumes of new or newly-enlarging T2 lesions, new T1 lesions, Gd&#x02009;+&#x02009;lesions, and new active lesions) versus delayed treatment. Data from the first year of the ADVANCE study showed that improvements observed in many of these endpoints was statistically significant for peginterferon beta-1a every 2&#x000a0;weeks versus placebo at the first brain MRI scheduled at Week 24, and sustained through to Week 48 of the ADVANCE study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Alongside recently published 2-year data from the same study, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] which shows significantly lower mean numbers of new or newly-enlarging T2 and Gd&#x02009;+&#x02009;lesions when compared to delayed treatment or peginterferon beta-1a every 4&#x000a0;weeks, the analyses of T1 lesions and new active lesions presented here suggest that the effect of peginterferon beta-1a every 2&#x000a0;weeks on reducing mean numbers of lesions is further sustained throughout the 2-year study period.</p><p>We explored additional MRI measures besides lesions. Analysis of whole brain volume at 96&#x000a0;weeks did not reveal statistically significant treatment effects on brain atrophy. However, this analysis could have been confounded by the occurrence of pseudoatrophy, a phenomenon whereby brain volume decreases significantly during the first 6&#x02013;12 months of anti-inflammatory treatment, possibly reflecting resolution of edema and inflammation present before treatment initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Looking at change in brain volume from Week 24 to Week 96, (to eliminate the first 6&#x000a0;months of treatment in the continuous peginterferon beta-1a groups, when the impact of pseudoatrophy was likely to be greatest) the trend was reversed: there was a significantly smaller reduction in whole brain volume with both peginterferon beta-1a every 2&#x000a0;weeks and every 4&#x000a0;weeks, compared with delayed treatment. This suggests that peginterferon beta-1a could slow brain atrophy in the long term, although the 2-year overall treatment duration in this study was not sufficient to overcome the effects of pseudoatrophy in the first few months, and comparisons may be further confounded by onset of pseudoatrophy on initiation of treatment in Year 2 in the delayed treatment group. Furthermore, MTR measured in NABT over 96&#x000a0;weeks showed a trend for improved outcomes with continuous peginterferon every 2&#x000a0;weeks compared with delayed treatment. If reductions in brain volume over time were a result of true atrophy, it may be expected that this may also coincide with myelin loss (reflected by a decrease in MTR of NABT). Opposing trends for these measures during the first year of treatment with peginterferon beta-1a every 2&#x000a0;weeks (increased loss of brain volume coinciding with decreased reduction in MTR of NABT) support the suggestion that initial acceleration of loss of brain volume resulted from pseudoatrophy. A significant difference between peginterferon beta-1a every 2&#x000a0;weeks and delayed treatment in MTR of NABT change was apparent at Week 48, but was not sustained to Week 96; this may reflect a combination of attenuation of differences between the groups after peginterferon beta-1a treatment was commenced in the delayed treatment group and uncertainty in the point estimates given the small changes and variability in this measurement.</p><p>In addition to the MRI data, the present NEDA analyses support the efficacy of peginterferon beta-1a treatment every 2&#x000a0;weeks. Post-hoc analyses of efficacy data from ADVANCE showed that proportions of patients meeting criteria for overall-, MRI- and clinical-NEDA from baseline to Week 96 were significantly higher with peginterferon beta-1a every 2&#x000a0;weeks versus delayed treatment. MRI components of the NEDA composite appeared to be more sensitive to detecting treatment differences than clinical components; a high proportion of patients across all of the treatment groups met criteria for clinical-NEDA, supporting the value of including MRI components to support clinical-NEDA analyses. Nonetheless, NEDA criteria appear to be sufficiently robust to withstand missing MRI data, since the sensitivity analysis showed that inclusion of patients with missing MRI data in the LOCF analysis did not notably affect results. Currently, MRI-NEDA is defined as no Gd&#x02009;+&#x02009;lesions at Week 24, Week 48, or Week 96 and no new or newly-enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions compared with baseline over 96&#x000a0;weeks. Our analyses of MRI endpoints alongside post-hoc NEDA analyses support the use of this definition, since it reflects new active lesions detected on MRI scans. T1 lesion formation was also reduced during treatment with peginterferon beta-1a every 2&#x000a0;weeks, but any added value of incorporating this measure into the MRI-NEDA definition is not clear. We found limitations to potential incorporation of brain volume to the definition of NEDA: the small changes observed over periods of clinical interest, such as one or two years, and the noise in this measurement, as well as the complication of pseudoatrophy, make it unsuitable as a component of the MRI-NEDA and overall-NEDA composite endpoints.</p><p>Our results are consistent with our previous analysis of interim ADVANCE data, in which 39.8% of patients in the peginterferon beta-1a every 2&#x000a0;weeks group, and 17.8% in the placebo group, achieved overall NEDA in Year 1 (based on an LOCF analysis using the same NEDA definition as the current analysis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In the current analysis, overall NEDA rates over 2&#x000a0;years (baseline to Week 96) were 36.7% in the continuous peginterferon beta-1a group and 15.8% in the delayed treatment group. However, when we looked specifically at Year 2, these values increased to 56.6% and 34.9%, respectively. This supports the suggestion, based on our previous analysis, that it may be preferable to begin to assess NEDA status after a standard period of time (i.e., 6&#x02013;12 months) following initiation of treatment, since MRI components may be affected by accrual of lesions early on before treatment efficacy becomes apparent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>The finding that more than half of patients on peginterferon beta-1a every 2&#x000a0;weeks achieved overall NEDA in Year 2 is encouraging, as recent longitudinal study in which NEDA status was monitored in a cohort of patients with MS over 7&#x000a0;years suggested that NEDA status at 2&#x000a0;years was a prognostic indicator for long term outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Future analyses of data from the ongoing ATTAIN study (an extension of ADVANCE) will reveal whether NEDA status is maintained for a high proportion of patients with longer-term peginterferon beta-1a treatment.</p><p>NEDA (sometimes referred to as FMDA or disease activity free [DAF]) has been assessed for many of the newer disease-modifying therapies becoming available for the treatment of MS. Rates are quite variable, with reported rates for overall-NEDA over 2&#x000a0;years ranging from 18% to 46% in trials of teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate (DMF), fingolimod, natalizumab and cladribine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Rates should be compared with caution, as differences in study design, patient populations and MRI analysis techniques could contribute to variation, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] although NEDA rates in placebo groups in these trials did not vary as widely as those in active treatment groups (7&#x02013;16%). Considering differences in terms of ORs helps to account for differences in the sensitivity of the analyses, although ORs are not always provided in reporting of NEDA analyses. In a combined post-hoc analysis of data from the DEFINE and CONFIRM studies, the OR for achieving overall NEDA with DMF 240&#x000a0;mg twice daily versus placebo was 2.7 (23% vs 11%; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and in the CLARITY study ORs for cladribine 3.5&#x000a0;mg/kg and 5.25&#x000a0;mg/kg versus placebo were 4&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;28 and 4&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;62, respectively (44% and 46% vs 16%; both <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Peginterferon beta-1a administered continuously every 2&#x000a0;weeks for 2&#x000a0;years approximately tripled the likelihood of achieving overall-NEDA (OR 3.09) compared with delayed treatment.</p><p>Determining the relevance of this data to real-world experience will require further investigation, as patients are rarely completely lesion-free and have varying degrees of lesion activity. Interpretation is complicated by &#x0201c;noise&#x0201d; in the measurement of new lesions related to technical factors associated with the MRI acquisition and rater variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In part for these reasons, clinicians often look at a threshold for new lesions, which may be different between physicians, hospitals, and even different countries. A consensus on the use of MRI techniques and analysis may prove to be very beneficial to the study of MS, its pathophysiology, and potential treatments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Analyses of MRI outcomes and NEDA outcomes, along with efficacy for clinical endpoints previously reported, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] show that the efficacy of peginterferon beta-1a is extended beyond the first year of the ADVANCE study, illustrating the benefits of peginterferon beta-1a on a number of different MRI outcomes as well as clinical-NEDA status. SC peginterferon every 2&#x000a0;weeks is the least frequently dosed interferon therapy for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, and the present analysis further supports the use of this therapy in patients with RRMS.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec13"><title>Additional files</title><p>
