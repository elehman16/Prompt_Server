The objective of this study was to test whether intensive lifestyle modification, shown previously in tightly-controlled clinical trials to be efficacious for diabetes risk-reduction among high-risk individuals, can reduce cardiovascular risk factor levels in the primary care setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology / Principal Findings</title><p>The Swedish Bj&#x000f6;rkn&#x000e4;s study was a randomized controlled trial conducted from 2003 to 2006 with follow-up on cardiovascular risk factors at 3, 12, 24 and 36 months. A total of 151 middle-aged men and women at moderate- to high-risk of cardiovascular disease from northern Sweden were randomly assigned to either an intensive lifestyle intervention (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;75) or control (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;76) group. The intervention was based broadly on the protocol of the Diabetes Prevention Program. The three-month intervention period was administered in the primary care setting and consisted of supervised exercise sessions and diet counselling, followed by regular group meetings during three years. The control group was given general advice about diet and exercise and received standard clinical care. Outcomes were changes in anthropometrics, aerobic fitness, self-reported physical activity, blood pressure, and metabolic traits. At 36 months post-randomisation, intensive lifestyle modification reduced waist circumference (&#x02212;2.2 cm: p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.001), waist-hip ratio (&#x02212;0.02: p&#x0003c;0.0001), systolic blood pressure (&#x02212;4.9 mmHg: p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.036), and diastolic blood pressure (&#x02212;1.6 mmHg: p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.005), and improved aerobic fitness (5&#x00025;; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.038). Changes in lipid or glucose values did not differ statistically between groups. At 36 months, self-reported time spent exercising and total physical activity had increased more in the intervention group than in the control group (p&#x0003c;0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion / Significance</title><p>A program of intensive lifestyle modification undertaken in the primary health care setting can favourably influence cardiovascular risk-factor profiles in high-risk individuals.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00486941">NCT00486941</ext-link>

Participants were enrolled in the study by the medical supervisor of the health care at the center. All individuals aged 18&#x02013;65 years with a clinically documented diagnosis of hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, obesity or any combinations thereof were identified from computerised case records. Individuals with a diagnosis of coronary heart disease, stroke, transient ischemic attack, severe hypertension (SBP&#x0003e;180 or DBP&#x0003e;105 mmHg), dementia or severe psychiatric morbidity were excluded. The remaining 340 eligible individuals were invited by letter to participate in the trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005195-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

An independent statistician generated the allocation sequence and randomisation numbers were kept in sealed, opaque envelopes. The allocation was concealed until after the baseline examinations were completed and participants were assigned to their groups by the research physiotherapist. After excluding four subjects who were allocated to the lifestyle intervention but did not start the intervention period, and excluding two subjects with incomplete baseline data allocated to control group, the numbers of participants were 71 and 74 in the intervention and control groups, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Ethics</title><p>All participants provided written informed consent to participate and the study protocol was approved by institutional review board of Ume&#x000e5; University, Sweden.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Clinical examination</title><p>At each examination, measurements of weight, height, circumferences of the waist and hips, blood pressure by a standard auscultatory method, and an estimate of maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>max) were obtained. Body mass index (BMI: weight in kg / height in meters squared) and waist-to-hip ratio were calculated. VO<sub>2</sub>max was estimated as described by &#x000c5;strand <xref rid="pone.0005195-strand1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> from each participant's individual heart rate response to a given submaximal workload (i.e. 50&#x02013;150 W, depending on the participant's weight and self-reported physical activity) using a bicycle ergometer (Monark, Varberg, Sweden) and recorded at steady-state with a heart rate of &#x02265;120 beats/min.

Changes in pharmacological treatment were followed yearly. A trained research physiotherapist (ME) performed all interviews and undertook the anthropometric and blood pressure measurements to minimize observer bias. Two other trained physiotherapists performed the exercise stress tests. The physiotherapists were not blinded to allocation of treatment at the follow-up examinations.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Laboratory measurements</title><p>The methods for blood collection, storage and analysis have been described in detail previously <xref rid="pone.0005195-Eriksson1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In brief, total cholesterol and triglycerides were analysed by enzymatic colorimetry (slide method, Vitros 5.1.Ortho-Clinical diagnostics, Raritan, New Jersey). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was analysed by enzymatic (dextran sulfate procedure) colorimetry (Hitachi 917, Roche Diagnostics Scandinavia AB, Bromma, Sweden). Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was calculated using the Friedwald equation. Serum glucose was analysed by enzymatic (glucose oxidase) colorimetry (Vitros 5.1, Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Raritan, New Jersey). Glycosylated haemoglobin (Hb) A1c was analysed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography, Ion exchange Chromatography, Photometry (VARIANT&#x02122;II, BIO-RAD laboratories, Hercules, California). All biochemical analyses were performed at the clinical chemistry laboratory at Sunderby Hospital, Lule&#x000e5;, Sweden. All non-diabetic participants underwent a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test, using the protocol recommended by the WHO, at two and three years post-randomisation.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Behaviour assessments</title><p>Physical activity and tobacco habits were assessed using a self-administered questionnaire, previously used in the national project &#x0201c;physical activity on prescription&#x0201d; by the Swedish Institute of Public Health <xref rid="pone.0005195-Kallings1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The questionnaire has also been used by a number of Swedish regional health authorities to assess public health within the community. However, no validation studies have been performed for this questionnaire. The questionnaire is intended to characterise a participant's levels of leisure time activity (LTPA), structured exercise, and total physical activity (TPA). LTPA includes activities such as housekeeping, gardening, walking or biking to work, and &#x02018;exercise&#x02019; includes structured activities such as aerobics, jogging, swimming, and ball games carried out during a normal week. Four activity levels were determined for LTPA and exercise; &#x02018;none&#x02019;, &#x02018;&#x0003c;30 min/d&#x02019;, &#x02018;30&#x02013;60 min/d&#x02019; and &#x02018;&#x0003e;60 min/d&#x02019;. Nine questions on TPA were included that were intended to estimate all forms of physical activity undertaken during the past 12 months. A TPA index with four activity levels was constructed: &#x02018;sedentary&#x02019;, &#x02018;minimally active&#x02019;, &#x02018;moderately active&#x02019;, and &#x02018;very active&#x02019;. Participants in both groups were also requested to complete physical activity logs.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Interventions</title><p>The lifestyle intervention consisted of supervised exercise training and diet counselling, followed by regular group meetings. The first three months of the intervention included three sessions per week of supervised progressive exercise training and diet counselling on a total of five occasions. The exercise training sessions consisted of aerobic exercises such as Nordic walking (brisk walking with poles), interval training on a bicycle ergometer, circuit-type resistance exercise, and aqua-aerobics. These activities were led by physiotherapists and physiotherapy assistants at the primary care centre. The physiotherapists were responsible for both the clinical examinations and delivering the exercise intervention. Exercise training was performed in small groups (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10&#x02013;13) with each group comprising participants of similar ages and fitness levels. All groups were offered one session of each activity every week. The exercise training sessions lasted 40&#x02013;45 min during the first month and increased to 60 min during the second and the third months. The duration of the bicycle ergometry exercise was increased from 20 min to 30 min after one month. The resistance training consisted of 12 different movements per circuit: two sets of 10&#x02013;15 repetitions were performed at each station. The load was individualized and increased over time as the participant's strength improved. All programmes included a warm-up and a cool-down period with stretching. The aim of the exercise sessions was to increase cardiorespiratory fitness and to improve functional capacity and strength of the large muscle groups of the arms, torso and legs. To approximate optimal exercise intensity, the Borg scale of perceived exertion was used <xref rid="pone.0005195-Borg1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. A moderate intensity (60&#x02013;80&#x00025; of maximal heart rate) corresponding to 13&#x02013;15 on the Borg scale was recommended for all activities.</p><p>A trained dietician was responsible for the diet counselling. The dietary advice was given in small groups but no individual counselling was provided. The participants received both written and verbal dietary information. The counselling was in accordance with the Nordic nutrition recommendations <xref rid="pone.0005195-Becker1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Briefly the participants were encouraged to increase their intake of fish, fruits, vegetables fibre-rich products and complex carbohydrates. Participants were also advised to restrict total caloric intake by reducing consumption of sugar and saturated fat and to use low-fat milk products, soft margarines and vegetable oils rich in monosaturated fatty acids (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0005195-t001">table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="pone-0005195-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005195.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Summary of physical activity and diet recommendations provided to participants randomized to the control and intervention groups.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0005195-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0005195.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group (standard recommendations)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intervention group (extended recommendations)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

The objectives of the follow-up meetings were (i) to improve the participant's knowledge about the relationships between lifestyle and health, (ii) to encourage participants to favourably modify their lifestyles, and (iii) to provide social support and to facilitate adherence to the intervention. The stages-of-change model of behavioural change was used as theoretical basis for the intervention <xref rid="pone.0005195-Proshaska1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The techniques used were standardized for all participants. After the active intervention period most individuals were in the &#x02018;preparation&#x02019; or &#x02018;action&#x02019; phases. Participants were asked to investigate benefits, barriers, and costs of adherence to a healthier lifestyle and were encouraged to establish individual goals for weight reduction and to develop a personal physical activity plan. They were encouraged to maintain at least 30 min/day of physical activity. Participants also received information about community-based physical activity and a study visit at a local gym was provided for each training group.</p><p>At the group meetings discussions focussed on physical activity, diet, coping with stress, and the effects of tobacco on health. The progress of each participant was discussed at the meetings during the follow-up period. Emphasis was placed on identifying situations that inhibit healthy behaviours such as holidays or heavy workloads and strategies to handle these situations were discussed. During the final stage of the trial, the importance of maintaining healthy habits and on avoiding relapses was reinforced.</p><p>Physiotherapists supervised most of the in-person meetings, and a dietician provided further diet counselling on three occasions, once each year during the follow-up period. The medically responsible physician took part in one meeting at the beginning of the study and one at the end of the study to answer participants' questions about the health aspects of the intervention and to reinforce the messages being delivered by the physiotherapists and the dietician.</p><p>Participants in the standard care control group were given verbal and written information about healthy behaviours, including exercise and diet. This information was delivered by the physician, a physiotherapist and a dietician at a group meeting following the baseline examination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005195-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Blinding</title><p>Neither the participants nor the family practitioners or physiotherapists who delivered the intervention were blinded to the allocation of treatment. Each year, participants in both groups were given a written summary of their laboratory and clinical test results.

For sample size calculations, we assumed 20&#x00025; of participants from our study would withdraw before completion, and that our intervention would yield approximately half the weight loss at three years post-randomisation than observed in the DPP (i.e. 2.1 kg, SD &#x000b1;1 kg). We also assumed that because the control group was receiving standard health advice and was not blinded to treatment allocation, those in that group would lose up to 1 kg (SD &#x000b1;1 kg) in weight during the trial. We selected a two-sided p-value of 0.001 to account for multiple statistical comparisons. With these parameters, our study was powered at &#x0223c;99&#x00025; to detect the predicted difference in weight change between groups at 3 years follow-up. Power was calculated using STATA v9.2 SE (StataCorp, TX, USA)</p></sec><sec id="s2l"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>SPSS for Windows (v15.0, Chicago, IL) and SAS for Windows (V9.1, Carey, NC) were used for all statistical analyses. Data were analysed on an intention-to treat (ITT) basis, regardless of adherence to the intervention and included all randomly allocated persons, with the exception of the six individuals excluded for the reasons given above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005195-g001">Figure 1</xref>). If data were missing, the last observation was carried forward.</p><p>Generalized linear models with repeated measures analysis of variance and univariate tests of variance were used to investigate changes in the dependent variables (as continuous traits) over time at each of the follow-up time points, adjusted for baseline values. To determinate the independent effects of the intervention on blood pressures, lipids, or HbA1c, these variables were adjusted for &#x0201c;medication load&#x0201d;. To this end, a variable was computed from the number of specific drugs prescribed to treat the respective trait by assigning values of 1 for low doses and 2 for high doses and subsequently summing these values.</p></sec><sec id="s2m"><title>Ancillary analyses</title><p>Mixed-model analyses were used to calculate the adjusted effects of the intervention at each of the follow-up points for continuous trait outcomes and to investigate the overall effect of the intervention. The mixed-model included all available follow-up data. To account for multiple observations within individual, models were fitted using an unstructured covariance matrix. The choice of matrix was determined by comparing Akaike's Information Criterion for different structures and selecting the matrix that best fitted the data. This method allows for trait correlations between different examinations within the same individual. The results of these models indicate whether changes in the values of a trait from baseline to follow-up differ significantly between the intervention and the control groups. In addition to the fixed effects, the mixed-model estimates components of variance (random effects) representing the relation between different observations for the same individual. For continuous or rank-ordered data, the parameters of these variables were estimated by a maximum-likelihood procedure. For ordinal data such as those obtained from questionnaires, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was used for analysis between groups at each follow-up time point, and mixed-models were used to assess the overall effects of the intervention. For other discrete variables, the Pearson Chi-Square test and repeated measures analysis were used. A p-value &#x0003c;0.05 was considerer statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Participants were recruited in January 2003 and underwent baseline examinations in February 2003.

In the DPP, the level of diabetes risk reduction in people who met the goals for weight loss, physical activity and diet modification was 89&#x00025; <xref rid="pone.0005195-Hamman1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Other reports from the DPP have highlighted the beneficial impact of lifestyle modification on other cardiovascular risk factors including glucose homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, lipid levels, inflammation, coagulation, and obesity <xref rid="pone.0005195-Franks1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. These observations illustrate the remarkable potential of lifestyle change for diabetes and cardiovascular risk reduction.</p><p>Notwithstanding the considerable health benefits conferred by the DPP lifestyle intervention, the protocol was costly and, as delivered in the DPP, beyond the scope of many primary health care agencies (for further details, see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bsc.gwu.edu/dpp/lifestyle/dpp_part.html">www.bsc.gwu.edu/dpp/lifestyle/dpp_part.html</ext-link>). The within-trial costs of the DPP lifestyle intervention totalled $24400 (USD) per case of diabetes prevented or delayed <xref rid="pone.0005195-Herman1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. By the conclusion of the initial intervention period, the running costs of the DPP had totalled $174.3 million (USD) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/alerts/diabetes01.html">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/alerts/diabetes01.html</ext-link>). An important and hitherto largely unanswered question is whether the DPP protocol of lifestyle intervention is effective outside a tightly controlled and well-funded setting of an extensively supported multi-centre randomised clinical trial. Although a small number of studies have attempted to address this question <xref rid="pone.0005195-Ackermann1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0005195-Seidel1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, all were non-randomised and none was carried out in the primary care setting with long-term follow-up.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Interpretation</title><p>In an earlier publication from the Swedish Bj&#x000f6;rkn&#x000e4;s Study we reported the interim (one year) results of the trial <xref rid="pone.0005195-Eriksson1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. We presented crude between-group comparisons showing favourable effects on waist circumference, waist-hip-ratio and diastolic blood pressure. In the present report, we show that through reductions in central obesity, physical activity and smoking cessation, the lifestyle intervention also favourably impacted blood pressure levels. However, we did not observe improvements in glycemic control or weight reduction, which contrasts the results from the DPP and Finnish DPS. The lack of impact on glucose homeostasis in the present study may be explained by the relatively modest level of weight loss observed here and the close biologic relationship between weight and glucose concentrations.</p><p>We observed a significant improvement in VO<sub>2</sub>max during the first three months of the trial. At 3 years the improvement in VO<sub>2</sub>max persisted only when expressed in absolute terms but not when expressed per unit body mass. This difference is likely to reflect the fact that when VO<sub>2</sub>max is expressed relative to weight, changes in VO<sub>2</sub>max are influenced by changes in body mass. This is partly because muscle is a highly oxidative tissue type, whereas adipose tissue is not. Thus changes in weight and in body composition impact aerobic capacity differently depending on whether the trait is expressed relative to weight or in absolute terms.</p><p>Reductions in waist circumference were observed in the absence of reductions in weight, which is consistent with results from other exercise studies <xref rid="pone.0005195-Church1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Moreover, we observed no discernable impact of the intervention on lipid levels, which is consistent with the findings of other studies <xref rid="pone.0005195-Norris1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005195-Orozco1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005195-Boul1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005195-Church1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0005195-Holme1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. However, in this study, lipid-lowering treatment was common and baseline lipid levels were consequently close to target levels, which may have masked any subtle changes in lipids resulting from the intervention.</p><p>We calculated the power available in our study to detect the same level of change in fasting glucose and HbA1c that was observed one-year post-randomisation in the DPP. In our study, the power to detect these changes was approximated 95&#x00025; for changes in fasting glucose concentrations and 67&#x00025; for changes in HbA1c at p&#x0003c;0.05. However, although this study was well powered to detect a clinically and statistically significant change in body weight, the magnitude of this change was less than the average amount of weight lost in the DPP. One would anticipate, therefore, that in the present study any effect of lifestyle intervention on fasting glucose levels or HbA1c would also be less, which likely explains the lack of effect on these traits observed here.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Generalizability</title><p>One of the most important findings of the present study is that a program of lifestyle modification, using the core features of the DPP and Finnish DPS, can reduce cardiovascular risk factor levels in at-risk adults, even when applied in the conventional primary care setting, without additional resources. However, it is worth highlighting that although our cohort is likely similar in demographic characteristics to the cohorts enrolled in the Finnish DPS, which yielded comparable results to the DPP, the population in the northern part of Sweden is culturally and ethnically different from the cohorts enrolled into the DPP. It is also important to highlight that participants in the present study were invited by health care providers from their own health care centres to participate in this study, which may have facilitated recruitment rates. For example, more than half of those eligible to participate in our study were eventually randomised to treatment. By contrast, in a recent report from the same region of Sweden in which advertisements were used to recruit participants for a similar lifestyle intervention program, only 16 &#x00025; of eligible individuals agreed to participate <xref rid="pone.0005195-Ruge1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Thus, our strategy of recruiting through the established health care infrastructure may be fundamental to the success of our project and others that may follow.</p><p>It is also important to bear in mind that, as in all other lifestyle intervention trials, neither the participants nor the study staffs in this study were blinded to the allocation of treatment. Thus it is possible that placebo effects explain some of the beneficial changes in health associated with the lifestyle intervention. On the other hand, providing participants in the standard care arm of the trial with information about lifestyle and health, activity logs, and regular follow-up exams may have diluted differences between groups.</p><p>We present data analysed on an ITT basis, which is a highly conservative method for assessing the impact of an intervention. We also used mixed-models incorporating all available data without imputation of missing data points. Both methods yielded similar results, highlighting the robustness of our findings.</p><p>At baseline we asked the participants &#x0201c;if the beneficial effects of physical activity and drug treatment were the same, which method would you prefer?&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;if both physical activity on prescription and drug treatment were free of charge, which would you prefer?&#x0201d; The vast majority of our participants responded that they would prefer the physical activity option and none opted for drug therapy. This preference for physical activity as a form of treatment may reflect the cultural emphasis on healthy living in the north of Sweden. However, in both groups there was an increased use of lipid and blood pressure lowering medication during the study, which may reflect current treatment recommendations that emphasise reaching specific target levels.</p><p>Although this intervention was not designed to specifically promote smoking cessation, tobacco habits and the effects of tobacco on health were discussed at the follow-up meetings. That broad focus on healthy living may explain why more smokers quit in the lifestyle than in the control group. In combination with the reductions in waist circumference and systolic blood pressure observed in this trial and increased exercise and overall physical activity levels, the reductions in tobacco usage are likely to yield continuing improvements in the health of our participants.</p><p>Our study addresses the important objective of translating the findings from extensively resourced trials, which focussed on highly selected populations and study settings, to a real-life setting where resources are limited and the population is more heterogeneous. However, an inherent limitation of studies that seek to do this is that they suffer from lower internal validity. In this respect, the Bj&#x000f6;rkn&#x000e4;s study was not blinded and the intervention was less tightly controlled and less well resourced than several previous studies. In this study as in the DPP, only half of all eligible subjects were randomized to treatment <xref rid="pone.0005195-Edelstein1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. However, those who declined to participate did not differ from those who took part with respect to all key characteristics. Because attrition rates were modest and we used ITT analyses, our findings may be less prone to bias than some other studies. Nonetheless, as indicated by the wide confidence intervals for several traits, our study was underpowered to detect small improvements in the clinical traits examined. Thus, some of our findings may be prone to type 2 error.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Overall evidence</title><p>In summary, a lifestyle intervention program applied in the primary care setting beneficially impacts cardiovascular risk profiles. These findings provide some of the first empirical evidence that affordable programs of lifestyle intervention, which can be widely prescribed effectively reduce risk factors for cardiovascular disease in initially high-risk individuals. Our study also shows that such interventions can be integrated within existing health care infrastructures, at least in the Swedish setting. Studies such as ours support a de-emphasis of the use of drug therapies in favour of safer, more holistic, and more effective treatments combining diet and exercise prescription.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0005195.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT Checklist</p><p>(0.04 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0005195.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0005195.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol</p><p>(0.04 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0005195.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding: </bold>This study was supported by the Norrbotten Local County Council, Division of Primary Health Care, Lule&#x000e5;, Sweden.
