have led to transformations in the restorative treatment of dental caries. The most
striking change involves the selective removal of carious tissue and maximal
preservation of healthy dental tissue. Traditional methods involving a drill and a bur
are incompatible with this philosophy<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>.</p><p>Chemo-mechanical caries removal (CMCR) is an alternative to the conventional method and
consists of the application of a proteolytic substance that softens carious dentin
tissue and facilitates its removal using manual instruments<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. This method can be employed without the use of local
anesthesia or burs, thereby preserving sound dental tissue<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.</p><p>Papacarie<sup>TM</sup> is one of the products marketed for CMCR. This gel contains
papain and chloramine. Papain is an enzyme similar to human pepsin that acts as a
debriding agent with no harm caused to healthy tissue. This substance accelerates the
healing process and exhibits bactericidal, bacteriostatic and anti-inflammatory
properties<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Chloramine has properties related to
disinfection<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. A number of
studies have demonstrated the efficacy of Papacarie<sup>TM</sup> and report that its
cost is lower than similar products found on the market<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>.</p><p>There is a scarcity of well-standardized clinical trials comparing the traditional
cavity preparation method to chemo-mechanical caries removal with the use of
Papacarie<sup>TM</sup> gel. Thus, the aim of the present study was to compare the
effectiveness of Papacarie<sup>TM</sup> gel for the chemo-mechanical removal of carious
lesions on primary teeth to conventional caries removal with a low-speed bur with regard
to execution time, clinical aspects and radiographic findings, using a longitudinal
design.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><p>A randomized, controlled, clinical trial with a "split-mouth" design was carried out to
assess the efficacy of Papacarie<sup>TM</sup> gel. The investigation was designed,
analyzed and interpreted according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials
(CONSORT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>). Thirty children aged four to
seven years who sought dental treatment at the Pediatric Dentistry Clinic of the
University Nove de Julho (Brazil) were recruited. The control group was submitted to the
traditional method (bur) for the removal of carious tissue. All parents/guardians
received information on the objectives and procedures of the study and signed a
statement of informed consent in compliance with Resolution 196/96 of the Brazilian
National Health Board. This study received approval from the Human Research Ethics
Committee of the University Nove de Julho (Brazil) under process n&#x000ba; 219047. The clinical
trial registration number is NCT01811420.</p><fig id="f01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flowchart of the protocol</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jaos-22-04-0307-g01"/></fig><sec><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>The sample size was calculated using the Dinam 1.0 program with data from a pilot
study. Calculations were performed considering time, discomfort, colony-forming
bacteria and radiographic density. As the variable colony-forming bacteria required
the largest number of teeth <italic>per</italic> group, this variable was chosen as
the reference (n=19 teeth <italic>per</italic> group).</p></sec><sec><title>Calibration exercise</title><p>The calibration exercise was carried out during the pilot study. An operator
performed the treatment and a "gold standard" examiner performed the clinical
evaluation of the removal of carious tissue. The examiner was blinded to the
technique applied (chemo-mechanical caries removal with Papacarie<sup>TM</sup> and
removal of carious dentine with low-speed bur). The "gold standard" examiner
evaluated all cavities following the respective interventions and was responsible for
testing the hardness of the remaining dentin. The clinical evaluation involved an
inspection of the texture of the remaining dentin with a blunt exploratory probe,
observing the vitreous aspect (cavity free of carious tissue). Caries removal was
only considered complete when agreement was achieved between the operator and
examiner. Intra-examiner agreement was determined using the Kappa statistic and was
considered excellent (K=0.92).</p></sec><sec><title>Sample selection</title><p>Twenty children aged four to seven years participated in the study. The sample was
made up of 40 primary teeth (two <italic>per</italic> child). The following were the
inclusion criteria: good health, with no systemic conditions and good behavior.
Clinically, the children need to have at least two primary molars with active, acute
carious lesions not surpassing 2/3 of the dentin and involving only the occlusal
facet, with no clinical or radiographic signs or symptoms of pulp involvement
(spontaneous pain, pain upon palpation, fistula, abscess, sensation of enlarged
tooth, periapical radiolucency, increase in the space of the periodontal ligament in
the apical region, periapical radiopacity, lateral lesions and lesions in the
furcation due to the impairment of accessory canals). The exclusion criteria were
Class II, III or IV carious lesions in the Black classification, clinical
impossibility of restorations, carious lesion involving the enamel, presence of
deficient restorations, small carious lesions in dentin (without access for manual
excavators) and hidden caries.</p><p>Each child underwent both procedures and served as his/her own control. Randomization
of the techniques was determined by lots using numbered tiles. For each individual,
one tooth was randomly selected for one treatment (also randomly selected) and the
other tooth automatically received the other form of treatment.</p><p>Group 1 (G1) - chemo-mechanical caries removal with Papacarie<sup>TM</sup></p><p>Group 2 (G2) - removal of carious dentin with low-speed bur (traditional method -
TM)</p></sec><sec><title>Treatments</title><p>Treatments were performed by a single dentist who had previously undergone the
calibration exercise (Kappa statistic: 0.92). All procedures were initiated without
the prior administration of local anesthesia, but the patients were informed that
anesthesia was available if needed.</p></sec><sec><title>G1 - Chemo-mechanical caries removal with Papacarie<sup>TM</sup>
</title><p>Initially, periapical radiographs were taken and prophylaxis was performed with a
Robinson brush and fluoride toothpaste, followed by relative isolation (lip bumper,
cotton roll and saliva aspirator) of the tooth. The starting time was then recorded.
The Papacarie<sup>TM</sup> gel was applied. After 30 to 40 seconds, the softened
carious tissue was removed with the blunt end of a curette. The gel was reapplied, if
necessary, until the complete removal of the carious tissue. Successful removal was
determined by clinical examination involving the inspection of the texture of the
remaining dentine with the use of an exploratory probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>). The finishing time was then recorded. The restorative
procedure was performed with glass ionomer cement (Ketac Molar Easy mix - 3M
ESPE<sup>TM</sup>, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, SP, Brazil). The treated teeth were submitted to
clinical and radiographic follow-up.</p><fig id="f02" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Clinical aspect of cavity before and after removal of carious tissue with

method)</title><p>The initial protocol was the same as that used for G1. Once the starting time was
recorded, caries removal was performed with low-speed burs, followed by a clinical
evaluation and recording of the finishing time. The restorative procedure was the
same as that used in G1 and the treated teeth were submitted to clinical and
radiographic follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluations</title><sec><title>Evaluation of time required to perform procedure</title><p>The time required to perform the procedure was measured in minutes and seconds
using a digital chronometer (Kenko<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>).</p></sec><sec><title>Radiographic evaluation</title><p>Periapical radiographs were first taken to include or exclude teeth based on the
previously-defined criteria. Immediately after the clinical procedure, the first
interproximal radiograph was taken. This procedure was repeated in a standardized
fashion on three different occasions. The radiographic evaluation was performed
using the radiographic subtraction method and the assessment of the density of the
remaining dentin immediately following the caries removal procedure as well as
after one (T1), six (T2) and 18 (T3) months. Radiographic density was determined
by gray-scale analysis.</p><p>A positioner for interproximal radiographs was used for standardization. A portion
of self-curing acrylic resin was placed on the surface of the tooth analyzed and
its antagonist for the impression of the anatomy of the surfaces and adapted to
the positioner to allow the same positioning of the film in the different
evaluations as well as the standardization of the same incidence of x-rays, the
same vertical and horizontal angles and the same distance on all radiographs of
the same patient. The interproximal radiographic images were scanned to allow the
analysis of the difference in density between the different evaluation times using
the Imagelab 2.3 program. Therefore, a greater degree of density on the image
denoted greater success.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical evaluation</title><p>The clinical evaluation of the restorations followed the criteria of atraumatic
restorative treatment<sup><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, based
on the retention of the material in the cavity and the presence of secondary
caries. The scoring system was as follows: 0=present, without defect; 1=present,
small defects on the margin measuring less than 0.5 mm in depth, with no need for
repair; 2=present, small defects on the margin measuring 0.5 to 1.0 mm in depth,
with need for repair; 3=present, gross defects on the margin measuring 1.0 mm or
more in depth, with need for repair; 4=absent, restoration completely lost, need
for treatment; 5=absent, other treatment had been performed for some reason;
6=tooth absent for some reason; 7=present, wear on surface less than 0.5 mm, with
no need for replacement; 8=present, wear on surface greater than 0.5 mm, with need
for replacement; 9=diagnosis impossible<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The SPSS 12.0 program for Windows was used for the statistical analysis. The
following tests were performed: t-test complemented by the Mann-Whitney test for
differences in the mean time required for treatment; Wilcoxon test for data related
to the clinical evaluation and differences between evaluation times; and analysis of
variance (ANOVA) complemented by Tukey's test for differences in mean radiographic
density.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The sample was made of 20 children (10 girls and 10 boys) between four and seven years
of age.</p><p>No statistically significant difference was found between groups regarding the time
required for the procedure (p=0.144) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table 1</xref>).
The use of anesthesia was only necessary in one case (G2). The administration of
anesthesia was considered in the analysis of the time required for treatment, but did
not significantly increase the duration of the overall procedure.</p><table-wrap id="t01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Time (in minutes) required for treatment in both groups</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr style="background-color:#dcddde"><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">CMCR</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">TM</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">p-value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.66</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.30</td><td rowspan="4" align="center" colspan="1">0.144</td></tr><tr><td style="background-color:#dcddde" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Standard deviation</td><td style="background-color:#dcddde" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.13</td><td style="background-color:#dcddde" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.03</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Minimum</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.12</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.05</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#dcddde"><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Maximum</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.48</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.30</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>CMCR=Chemo-mecanical caries removal</p></fn><fn><p>TM=Traditional method</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Restorations having received a score of 0, 1 or 7 were considered successful and those

required to perform the different procedures. This is in agreement with findings
described by Kotb, et al.<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> (2009).
However, other researchers have investigated this issue and report that CMCR with
Papacarie<sup>TM</sup> requires a shorter execution time in comparison to
conventional treatment<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. While execution time is essential in
any dental procedure, especially in the treatment of children, anxious adults and
individuals with disabilities<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, CMCR
should be considered based on the fact that it causes less patient discomfort<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>
and is in line with the philosophy of minimally invasive treatment<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.
This was evidenced by Bohari, et al.<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>
(2012), who compared four methods (burs, Carisolv<sup>TM</sup>, Papacarie<sup>TM</sup>
and Laser), as CMCR and laser are minimally invasive methods and considered less
painful. Similar results are described in another study<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.</p><p>In all the cases examined in the present study, the radiographic analysis revealed an
increase in density in the affected dentin, demonstrating the success of treatment. The
philosophy of minimally invasive treatment involves the maximum preservation of sound
dental tissue that is capable of remineralization<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, which is what remains
after the use of the gel. The outermost layer - denominated the infected dentin tissue -
is irreversibly denatured, infected, incapable of remineralization and dead. The
innermost layer - denominated the affected dentin tissue - is reversibly denatured,
slightly infected or non-infected, capable of remineralization, sensitive and vital. In
minimally invasive treatment, the former layer should be removed and the latter should
be preserved<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Assessments of the
mineral content following the use of Papacarie<sup>TM</sup> on deciduous teeth suggest
that this gel only acts on carious tissue<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>.</p><p>Studies have also shown the lack of a smear layer after the use of
Papacarie<sup>TM</sup>, along with the deposition of minerals around the dentinal
tubules<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, which may have contributed to the clinical success of
the restorations following CMCR. The conventional method achieved an 80% success rate
after 18 months. This may have occurred due to the fact that the use of a bur removes
more enamel, which can affect the subsequent adhesion of the restoration and inherently
leads to the formation of a smear layer. The cavity size is the same, but the support
structure may be more compromised. It should be stressed that the manufacturer's
recommendations were followed for the restorative procedure in both groups, including
the use of polyacrylic acid for 15 seconds in the pretreatment of the surface. This is a
weak acid and there may have been residual remnants after its use, which would also
affect the adhesion mechanism<sup><xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. With
the use of Papacarie(tm), there is no formation of a smear layer. Moreover, studies
addressing bond strength report satisfactory results with
Papacarie<sup>TM</sup><sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, whereas polyacrylic acid is a weak acid
and partially removes the smear layer, which implies lesser mechanical imbrication.</p><p>Clinical success has also been reported in a study carried out by Bussadori, et
al.<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> (2011) involving young
permanent molars treated with Papacarie(tm) and restored with glass ionomer cement, for
which 13 of the 14 cases were successful throughout the 24-month follow-up period.</p><p>Survival rates of the restoration materials are related to factors such as the presence
of secondary caries, fractures, type of tooth and pulp vitality<sup><xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Despite the occurrence of failed
restorations, no secondary carious lesions were found in either of the groups. This may
be attributed to the inherent properties of the restoration material, such as
adhesiveness to dental tissue, biocompatibility and the release of fluoride
ions<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. A previous study
involving restorations on the occlusal-proximal surface reports the susceptibility to
the loss of restoration material in proximal areas. Defects in this region resemble
carious lesions and plaque is thought to play an important role in this
process<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>.</p><p>Based on the present findings, both Papacarie<sup>TM</sup> and the traditional caries
removal method are effective on deciduous teeth. However, Papacarie<sup>TM</sup> offers
the advantages of preserving sound dental tissue, as the disorganized tissue is removed
with blunt manual instruments, thereby avoiding the use of a bur and local
anesthesia.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors would like to thank the volunteers for their participation. This study was
