While there are evidence-based guidelines for treating adult onset PTSD, treatments for adults with childhood trauma-related PTSD (Ch-PTSD) are varied and subject to ongoing debate. This study will test the effectiveness of two trauma-focused treatments, imagery rescripting (ImRs) and eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) in participants with Ch-PTSD. Both have been found effective in treatment of adult PTSD or mixed onset PTSD and previous research indicates they are well-tolerated treatments. However, we know less about their effectiveness for treating Ch-PTSD or their underlying working mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>IREM is an international multicentre randomised controlled trial involving seven sites across Australia, Germany and the Netherlands. We aim to recruit 142 participants (minimum of <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;20 per site), who will be randomly assigned to treatment condition. Assessments will be conducted before treatment until 1-year follow-up. Assessments before and after the waitlist will assess change in time only. The primary outcome measure is change in PTSD symptom severity from pre-treatment to 8-weeks post-treatment. Secondary outcome measures include change in severity of depression, anger, trauma-related cognitions, guilt, shame, dissociation and quality of life. Underlying mechanisms of treatment will be assessed on changes in vividness, valence and encapsulated belief of a worst trauma memory. Additional sub-studies will include qualitative investigation of treatment experiences from the participant and therapists&#x02019; perspective, changes in memory and the impact of treatment fidelity on outcome measures.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The primary aims of this study are to compare the effectiveness of EMDR and ImRs in treating Ch-PTSD and to investigate the underlying working mechanisms of the two treatments. The large-scale international design will make a significant contribution to our understanding of how these treatments address the needs of individuals with Ch-PTSD and therefore, potentially improve their effectiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anzctr.org.au/TrialSearch.aspx?searchTxt=ACTRN12614000750684&#x00026;isBasic=True">ACTRN12614000750684</ext-link>.

Compared to other treatment modalities such as pharmacotherapy, and to non-trauma-focused approaches, EMDR and Tf-CBT interventions have been identified as more effective at reducing PTSD symptom severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, the studies from which these treatment recommendations were based, predominantly used samples with adult-onset PTSD, resulting in an underrepresentation of participants with more complex presentations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The research on treatments for one such group, adults with childhood trauma-related PTSD (Ch-PTSD), has suggested that this population is difficult to treat due to the additional symptom complexity that can develop as a consequence of early trauma experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Three main approaches for treatment of Ch-PTSD were outlined by Ehring and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. One approach suggests that the aim of treatment should be on improving functioning through skill building, rather than focusing on trauma reprocessing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Secondly, there is the phase-based approach which incorporates skill building with trauma reprocessing techniques such as prolonged exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The third approach uses trauma-focused treatments without any modifications to protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Treatments are categorised as trauma-focused when they specifically target processing of trauma memories and their meaning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>A meta-analysis on psychological treatments for Ch-PTSD, identified individual trauma-focused treatments as being more efficacious than non-trauma-focused approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Individual trauma-focused treatments were found to be more effective in reducing PTSD symptom severity and additional symptoms associated with Ch-PTSD such as depression, anxiety and dissociation. Moreover, the findings also supported the view that increased levels of symptom complexity are probably not a contraindication for trauma-focused treatment. Nevertheless, there is reluctance by many therapists to engage in trauma-focused treatments as a first-line approach for individuals with Ch-PTSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>There is much debate regarding the appropriateness of trauma-focused interventions and some have argued that treatments which primarily focus on trauma reprocessing, are inappropriate for the Ch-PTSD population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The argument is mostly based on the perception that individuals with Ch-PTSD only have a limited capacity to cope with the distress of focusing on their trauma experiences during treatment, while remaining physically, psychologically and emotionally intact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Indeed, some studies have reported dropouts rates of up to 41% e.g. McDonagh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], which many attribute to the more complex symptom presentations often found in individuals with Ch-PTSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, these findings have predominantly been in studies that incorporated prolonged exposure as a component of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This suggests the need to explore alternative trauma-focused approaches for treatment of Ch-PTSD.</p><p>Other trauma-focused treatments such as EMDR and Imagery Rescripting (ImRs) have been proposed for Ch-PTSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. EMDR and ImRs share similarities with prolonged exposure techniques by activating imagery, emotions and cognitions related to the trauma memory and providing corrective information. The difference with these treatments is that they do not require intensive and prolonged reliving of traumatic experiences to enact symptomatic reductions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>EMDR asks individuals to recall their trauma experience in their mind while at the same time tracking the back and forth movement of the therapist&#x02019;s finger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This dual attention focus facilitates reconsolidation of the original trauma memory so that it is less vivid and less distressing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The precise mechanism by which EMDR appears to facilitate trauma processing is unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. There have been several theories proposed, however a more recent explanation for the underlying mechanisms of EMDR, which has received the most empirical support, is the working memory theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This theory postulates that eye movements tax the capacity of the working memory, thereby making the trauma memory less vivid and consequently, difficult for individuals to maintain the traumatic experience with the same degree of emotional distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>Given that EMDR is an evidenced based treatment for PTSD, surprisingly there are only a limited number of studies examining its effectiveness for treating Ch-PTSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In one study of adults who had been sexually abused as children, EMDR significantly reduced PTSD symptom severity at post-treatment and at 18-month follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Another study of traumatised young women found both the EMDR and active listening conditions resulted in significantly improved scores on measures of PTSD, depression, anxiety and self-concept. More interestingly, the EMDR group improved to within one standard deviation of the mean of the general population norms on all measures and the pre-post treatment effect sizes were almost double that of the active listening condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Thus, in the context of Ch-PTSD, EMDR could make a significant impact on individuals&#x02019; capacity to tolerate exposure to traumatic material and potentially improve treatment outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>ImRs involves the individual imagining a different ending to a trauma experience. Individuals are encouraged to recall a memory in the first person, present tense as their child self. The memory is then rescripted, by imagining a different course of events, which helps to satisfy the needs of the person [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. ImRs aims to facilitate a change in the meaning or reinterpretation of the trauma memory, leading to fundamental shifts in core belief systems and behaviours; and also provides an opportunity for individuals to identify and express responses that were inhibited at the time of the trauma experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. ImRs might be especially suitable for treating Ch-PTSD. For example, it is shown to be particularly efficacious for interpersonal traumas where trust was violated, and it has been shown as more effective than imaginal exposure in treating not just anxiety but other emotions such as guilt or shame, all of which are common in childhood trauma-related PTSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>ImRs research is still in its infancy and there is limited understanding for the underlying mechanisms of this treatment. The predominant explanation is that ImRs works by changing the meaning of trauma event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Arntz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] postulated that a process called unconditioned stimulus-revaluation might underlie ImRs. That is, after the trauma experience is consolidated in memory it is possible to reactivate the experience during ImRs. During the rescripting procedure the memory is re-evaluated so that its dysfunctional meaning changes to a less dysfunctional association, after which the representation is re-consolidated. This leads to less negative-emotional responses when the memory is activated in future. Dibbets and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] tested this hypothesis in a classical conditioning study and found evidence that ImRs reduced the return of fear, which usually occurs when an individual is retriggered with the context associated with the acquisition phase. The observed reduction in return of fear is an indication that the unconditioned stimulus-representation fundamentally changed as to its fear-evoking meaning thru the ImRs procedure. In contrast, a recent study by Slofstra, Nauta, Holmes and Bockting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] reported that a specific focus on manipulating the semantic meaning-relevant content of trauma memories, that is key cognitions or beliefs, was not necessary for ImRs to be effective. Instead, when rescripting focused on only perceptual aspects of trauma experiences, ImRs facilitated reconsolidation of memories and associated emotions.</p><p>Notwithstanding, the growing evidence suggests ImRs is an efficacious treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Recent research has also supported its effectiveness in treating complicated PTSD. In one such study ImRs was used to treat refugees and the treatment was found to lead to significant reductions in PTSD symptom severity and depression scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. More specifically, a recent study for adults with childhood abuse-related PTSD showed that ImRs decreased PTSD related symptoms, all of which were maintained or improved at follow-up assessment. In addition, the dropout was 20%, which could be considered low in comparison to other trauma-focused interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p>ImRs in the context of adverse childhood memories has been successfully applied to the treatment of disorders such as social anxiety, simple phobias, bulimia nervosa and depression, showing good treatment effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Taken together, the evidence supports ImRs as an efficacious treatment for PTSD and for addressing aversive childhood memories.</p><p>To date there has only been one study that has directly compared ImRs and EMDR. Alliger-Horn, Zimmermann and Mitte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] compared EMDR and imagery rescripting and reprocessing therapy, a variant of ImRs, in the treatment of soldiers with PTSD. This study reported significant improvements in post-traumatic and comorbid symptoms for both treatments with no significant differences between the two. However, the sample size was small (20 in each condition) and the participants treated had PTSD from adult trauma experiences.</p><p>There are theoretical reasons and some preliminary findings to suggest EMDR and ImRs are approaches worthy of further investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Furthermore, different working mechanisms having been proposed for the two treatments, the reduction of vividness of trauma memories as a primary mechanism in EMDR versus the change in (emotional) meaning of the trauma memory in ImRs. A direct comparison of the two treatments with repeated assessments of vividness, valence, and encapsulated beliefs of a trauma memory will enable a better understanding of underlying mechanisms of action and potential differences of change between the two approaches.</p><p>Nevertheless, research interest is growing. However, clinical trials investigating treatments for Ch-PTSD, more specifically trauma-focused approaches are scarce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Some have argued that the reluctance of therapists to directly target trauma experiences as a first-line intervention approach, has led to individuals being denied or delayed from receiving appropriate treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. These factors together highlight the need for investigating treatments, which effectively treat symptoms of Ch-PTSD and are acceptable to individuals and therapists.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>This study</title><p>This article describes the study design of IREM, an international, multi-centre randomised clinical trial (RCT) whose primary objectives are to compare the effectiveness of EMDR and ImRs in the treatment of Ch-PTSD and to test whether different mechanisms of change are involved.</p><p>A number of additional sub-studies will be performed which include the investigation of participant and therapists&#x02019; perspectives of treatment, assessing the effects of treatment integrity, prediction of drop out and changes in how trauma memories are stored following treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design</title><p>An international multicentre RCT will be conducted in Australia, Germany and the Netherlands, see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Appendix 1.

The duration of the session and the number of trauma memories that were addressed during each treatment session are recorded.</p><p>The EMDR and ImRs treatments have been operationalized into manuals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR)</title><p>EMDR treatment is based on the eight-phase protocol outlined by F Shapiro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Session one in the EMDR treatment condition will involve procedural preparation and affect tolerance training including a safe place exercise, which is practiced between sessions. The therapist and participant will set up for processing in session two by completing up to phase three of the EMDR protocol (target assessment), and within that only as far as identifying the negative and positive cognition.</p><p>Desensitisation will begin in session two where the participant will be asked to focus on the memory, their negative belief, feelings and somatic sensations while they follow the back and forth movement of the therapist&#x02019;s fingers. Sets continue until the reported distress is decreased to O or 1. In the installation phase, the participant is asked to focus on the preferred belief (positive cognition) and the trauma memory while simultaneously engaged in the eye-tracking task. As per the F Shapiro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] protocol, once the positive cognition is reported as 6 or 7, a body scan is conducted to ensure no unresolved traumatic material. Each session concludes with a debriefing of participants. At the start of each session, the therapist would check processing of the memory that was targeted during the previous session. If the distress reported is 2 or more, processing would continue on the memory. Alternatively the participant and therapist will select another target memory for processing. In session 12, the therapist would evaluate any current triggers or future oriented events that would need to be desensitised; this may be completed earlier if all trauma memories have been reprocessed in earlier sessions.</p><p>Some modifications have been made to the original EMDR protocol to take into account recent literature, e.g. no eye movements in the safe place protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In addition, a restriction has been placed on types of unblocking strategies particularly those using imagery during the interweave to prevent contamination of the treatment condition.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Imagery rescripting (ImRs)</title><p>The ImRs treatment is based on the protocol described by A Arntz and A Weertman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. During the rescripting participants are asked to describe the trauma memory in first person, present tense, from the point of view of the child, what is happening in the image, what they are thinking, feeling and most importantly, what they need. They are then guided to imagine a different course of events that is more acceptable for meeting their needs. The first half of ImRs treatment, up to session six, the therapist steps into the image and intervenes, protects and meets the needs of the child. In later phases, from session seven onwards, the participant&#x02019;s adult self steps into the image and then rescripts from the point of view of the adult self. Next the participant re-experiences the rescripting from the point of view of the child, with the adult intervening. The child is then invited to ask their adult self for additional actions if there is anything else they would like until all needs have been met.</p><p>After each rescripting, the therapist and participant debrief to ensure that all the needs were met. Trauma memories will be rescripted until the participant is satisfied. More than one trauma memory can be rescripted during a treatment session.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Further treatment</title><p>Evaluation of participants need for further treatment is conducted after the 8-week post-treatment assessment. The kind, intensity and frequency will be determined based on needs of the participant and the capacity of the site. Details of any further treatment will be documented and reported.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Therapists, training and supervision</title><p>The therapists in this study will be licensed psychologists (including clinical and health), psychotherapists, psychiatrists and a psychiatric nurse with advanced mental health qualifications. Dependent on the site, therapists will be trained in one or both treatment conditions. EMDR therapists must have completed EMDR training level 1 with an additional 2-day training for Ch-PTSD for the present study. Chris Lee an approved EMDR International Association trainer, provided training in the EMDR protocol across each site. ImRs therapists must have completed basic training in CBT and an additional 2-day training for Ch-PTSD for the present study. Arnoud Arntz provided ImRs training for each site. Before commencing treatment with study participants, therapists&#x02019; are required to demonstrate they are competent to apply the treatment with a minimum of two pilot cases that they video record and show to the peer supervision group and site coordinator. In addition, therapists are required to attend 5 h of peer supervision before starting with study participants and commit to having regular peer supervision throughout the course of the study. Where there is concern regarding therapists&#x02019; competence or issues relating to treatment protocol, expert supervision will be available from the aforementioned EMDR and ImRs trainers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Measures</title><sec id="Sec16"><title>Primary outcome measures</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>])</title><p>The CAPS-5 is a structured interview consisting of 30-items to assess PTSD symptoms over the previous month.

This RCT and the additional sub-studies will broaden our understanding of the effectiveness of these approaches in Ch-PTSD treatment and will help in furthering our understanding of their underlying mechanisms of change.</p><p>The study design has several strengths. Given the RCT is an international multi-site design, conclusions about any treatment effects will be generalisable to the method, rather than idiosyncratic ways a treatment might be delivered in a particular country or a particular site. In addition, this RCT has scientific validity as all the measures are standardised and assessments will be conducted by researchers who are blind to treatment condition. Another strength is that there are few exclusion criterion, thus enhancing the generalisability of the findings to real world settings. The overall size of the sample should provide sufficient power to enable meaningful conclusions about the data.</p><p>A limitation of the study is that there is no randomization between waitlist and active treatment. Instead, a naturalistic waitlist will be used to test whether treatment differs from natural course, assuming that whether or not patients have to wait until they can start treatment is nonbiased, as it is driven by the site&#x02019;s treatment capacity at the moment. To prevent bias, no patient will be given priority to start treatment. Another limitation is that there is no budget for intensive treatment supervision by experts. On the other hand, the study will document what the effectiveness is of the treatments based on a simple dissemination program. Relatedly, the therapist requirements differ between conditions: for EMDR therapists are required to complete a minimum level one training; whereas for ImRs only a basic CBT training is required. The authors feel that this adequately represents reality with EMDR perhaps being more complex to train than ImRs.</p><p>The evidence from this RCT will contribute to clinical decisions on whether to use trauma-focused approaches for the sequela associated with Ch-PTSD. While the primary aims of this study is to compare EMDR and ImRs treatments on PTSD symptom severity and to clarify whether or not different mechanisms of change are involved, secondary outcome measures will assess some disturbances associated with Ch-PTSD such as guilt, shame, anger and dissociation. EMDR and ImRs might more directly target change through cognitive and experiential mechanisms, thus having a greater impact on a wider range of symptoms than just PTSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].</p><p>This study will contribute to the growing evidence for the efficacy of trauma-focused treatment for Ch-PTSD. The documented lack of implementation of trauma-focused approaches has highlighted the need to explore treatments, which will be acceptable to both participants and therapists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A large part of the issue for treatment of Ch-PTSD is the perception that individuals would not be able to tolerate treatment. However, it is unclear if the reluctance to engage in trauma-focused treatment is a shared view as it is suggested that avoidance of the therapist is a much greater barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This RCT will be able to contribute to our knowledge of participants&#x02019; capacity to engage in treatment. The exploration into therapist and participants&#x02019; perspective will help to identify barriers and issues with the implementation of treatment.</p><p>Taken together, findings from this RCT will make a significant contribution towards developing best practice for treating PTSD caused by childhood experiences. Both EMDR and ImRs hold promise as being efficacious treatments for Ch-PTSD and the sequela of symptoms associated with this disorder.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec34"><title>Additional file</title><p>
