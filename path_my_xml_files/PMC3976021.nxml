supply to the brain. This can be due to ischemia caused by blockage or due to a
hemorrhage<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Post-stroke individuals
present an array of changes to the neuromuscular system functions, such as muscle weakness,
impaired proprioception, abnormal muscle activation patterns, and impaired postural
control<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Following a stroke, the
ability to maintain balance is often reduced, resulting in a greater risk of fall<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Obstacle crossing performance is a difficult task for many people following stroke<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Because difficulty in stepping over small
obstacles may contribute to the high fall rate following stroke, a more detailed
understanding of the underlying movement disorders is crucial<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Said et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>
found that 13 of 24 subjects with stroke failed to cross an obstacle on one or more
occasions: 8 subjects failed once, and 5 subjects failed more than once. Subjects with
stroke are unstable, during affected limb support compared with unimpaired subjects.</p><p>Aquatic exercise can refer to pool therapy, hydrotherapy, or balneotherapy<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Warm water can increase the blood flow,
helping to dissipate allogeneic chemicals and enhancing muscle relaxation. The hydrostatic
effect of water can alleviate pain by reducing peripheral edema and sympathetic nervous
system activity<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. When exercising in
water, buoyancy and the frictional resistance of water have specific mechanical effects on
the body. Fluid pressure is exerted equally on all surface areas of a stationary body
immersed at a given depth<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore,
exercise in water can provide special rehabilitation environments suitable for patients with
functional limitation, and assists balance through the resistance of water against the upper
limbs, the lower limbs, and the body<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Lee et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> divided 34 chronic stroke
patients into a water group (17 subjects) and a land group (17 subjects) and conducted the
same task-oriented training. The water training group showed significant increases in static
and dynamic balance compared to the land group. Noh et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> reported, that compared with a conventional therapy group, an
aquatic therapy group showed significant improvements in postural balance and muscle
strength. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of obstacle training in water
on the static balance of chronic stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 30 stroke patients who voluntarily agreed to participate in this study were
included. The selection criteria were: more than 6 months since the clinical diagnosis of
ischemic or hemorrhagic; ability to walk with or without walking aid for a minimum of 15 m;
a Mini-Mental State Examination score greater than 24/30<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>; vision and hearing adequate for completion of the study protocol,
as indicated by the ability to follow written and oral instructions during screening; and
the capacity to understand and follow instructions. Exclusion criteria were a history of
previous stroke or other neurological diseases or disorders; patients with pusher syndrome
(defined as leaning to the hemiparetic side and giving resistance to any attempt at passive
correction); terminal illness; or pain, limited motion, or weakness in the non-paretic lower
extremity that affected performance of daily living activities (by self-report). Each
participant signed an informed consent prior to participation. The subjects were randomly
divided into an aqua group (fifteen subjects) and a land group (fifteen subjects). Obstacle
training was performed in 40 minute sessions three times per week, over a period of 12
weeks.

The water temperature was kept at 33&#x02013;35&#x000b0;C for the
aquatic exercises. The pool step (Sprint&#x02019;s, US) is made of high-strength plastic, and its
top surface a nonslip foothold. Though this tool is made for water, it was also used on land
to keep the obstacle the same. In order to implement obstacles and stepping-stones in both
water and on land, the IGYM system (ISOPA, Korea) was used together with the pool step. The
IGYM system is composed of a round tower, bar and ring, made of plastic. The IGYM system
floats in water, so we added a weight to the round top to make it sink in the water. After
installing the round towers, they were connected by bars at the height of the holes to make
an obstacle. Exercise in a pool can provide various therapeutic benefits.</p><p>The obstacle training used in this study was applied after modifying and supplementing the
obstacle course used by Mean et al<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
obstacle training consisted of three subparts, stepping over the IGYM system, going up and
down stairs, and crossing over a step. The obstacle training was as follows. Warm-up
included upper extremity and lower extremity stretching and range of motion exercises for
flexibility (5 minutes). The main exercise included stepping over the IGYM (a height of
10&#x02005;cm), stepping over the IGYM (a height of 20&#x02005;cm), going up and down stairs (a height of
19&#x02005;cm), crossing over a step (a height of 14&#x02005;cm), and turning around a target and returning
along the obstacle course. The training was repeated for 30 minutes. Cool down included
upper extremity and lower extremity stretching and range of motion exercises for flexibility
(5 minutes).</p><p>Balance was measured using the Good balance system (Metitur Ltd, Jyv&#x000e4;skyl&#x000e4;, Finland, 1993).
This equipment is used for measuring the static and dynamic balance of the elderly, stroke
patients, and general subjects, and is widely used<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Static balance is measured by a force plate as the center of
pressure sway path of the body. The mean velocities of mediolateral and anteroposterior sway
are calculated, as well as the sway area. The measurements are conducted for 30 seconds with
the subjects&#x02019; eyes open and closed. In this study, static balance was assessed by measuring
the mean velocities of mediolateral (ML) and anteroposterior (AP) and sway area with
subjects&#x02019; eyes closed.</p><p>The SPSS statistical package, version 12.0, was used for all statistical analyses. The
dependent variable was static balance. General characteristics of the subjects and variables
followed a normal distribution. The paired t-test was used to determine whether there were
changes in static balance between before and after the training. The independent t-test was
used for analysis of changes in dependent variables between groups. Results were considered
significant at p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Differences in static balance after the interventions are shown in <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title> Comparison of static balance with groups and between groups (n=30)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" valign="top" colspan="4" rowspan="1">Values</td><td align="center" valign="top" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Change values</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle" colspan="7" rowspan="1"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="3" valign="middle" colspan="1">Parameters</td><td align="center" valign="top" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Aqua group (n=15)</td><td align="center" valign="top" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Land group (n=15)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Aqua group(n=15)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Land group(n=15)</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle" colspan="6" rowspan="1"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Before</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">After</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Before</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">After</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Before-after</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Before-after</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ML sway velocity (<sup>mm</sup>/s)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.4 (6.3)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.1 (6.1) **</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.9 (4.5)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.0 (4.0) **</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.2 (1.1) *</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.9 (0.4)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AP sway velocity (<sup>mm</sup>/s)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.1 (7.3)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.6 (6.1) **</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.7 (5.4)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14.1 (4.0) **</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.9 (1.6) *</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.4 (2.3)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">sway area (<sup>mm2</sup>/s)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">48.4 (16.1)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">41.8 (11.2) <sup>** *</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50.2 (17.6)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">46.8 (9.7) ***</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.0 (2.2) *</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.8 (1.5)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are means (SD).

include hydrostatic pressure, buoyancy, viscosity resistance and temperature. Though
hydrostatic pressure can be different in dependent on the depth of water, the equal power is
applied to every wet part. When initially starting balance and proprioceptive training,
water provides stable support and a comfortable environment, and hydrostatic pressure can
activate the peripheral nerves of the trunk and the four limbs, eventually having
significant effect, enhanceing of patients&#x02019; balance<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Owing to buoyancy, patients can participate in exercise as their
joints experience less pressure. Since it can be applied as resistance in accordance with
directions of water and body, and also as power that supports movement, the gravity for body
can be relieved to promote body support and condition of relaxation. Also weight-bearing and
the pressure on the joints can be reduced so that patients can have smoother movement in
water than on land<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Viscosity resistance is increased when movement in water gets
faster and stronger (resistance decreases when movement in water gets slower and smaller),
water exercise can be resistance exercise or active assistive exercise depending on the
speed of movement, which means that it is possible to adjust effective exercise intensity to
enhance patients&#x02019; balance<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Generally, a water temperature of between 33&#x000b0;C:34&#x000b0;C works
as an assistive element, increasing skin temperature, expanding blood vessels in the
peripheral skin, increasing blood supply, accelerating muscle relaxation, decreasing
sensitivity to pain or muscular spasm and enhancing balance function<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study examined the effect of obstacle training in water on the static balance of
chronic stroke patients. Lee et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>
divided 34 chronic stroke patients into a water group and a land group. The patients
received the same task-oriented training for 12 weeks and all subjects were evaluated for
static balance using the Good balance system. With eyes closed, both groups showed
significant change in ML velocity (water group from 10.1&#x02005;mm/s to 6.6&#x02005;mm/s, land group from
10.6&#x02005;mm/s to 7.4&#x02005;mm/s) and AP velocity (water group from 13.1&#x02005;mm/s to 9.2&#x02005;mm/s, land group
from 13.7&#x02005;mm/s to 10.4&#x02005;mm/s). In this study, static balance was assessed as the mean
velocies of ML, AP, and sway area with the eyes closed. Both groups showed a significant
change in ML velocity (aqua group from 10.39&#x02005;mm/s to 7.08&#x02005;mm/s, land group from 9.93&#x02005;mm/s to
7.99&#x02005;mm/s), AP velocity (aqua group from 16.08&#x02005;mm/s to 12.59&#x02005;mm/s, land group from
16.65&#x02005;mm/s to 14.10&#x02005;mm/s), and sway area (aqua group from 43.39 mm<sup>2</sup>/s to 41.79
mm<sup>2</sup>/s, land group from 50.23 mm<sup>2</sup>/s to 46.79 mm<sup>2</sup>/s). The
Static balance of the aqua group was significantly better than that of the land group, a
result that is in agreement with the findings of previous research. It is considered that
every muscle of both directions could have balanced development due to viscosity of water
after the balanced development of extensor muscle and flexor muscle when viscosity
resistance is caused in the opposite side of the movement by resistance of water in case of
up/down/left/right exercise without getting affected by gravity in water. Owing to the
dynamic help of water through hydrostatic pressure and buoyancy when exercising in water,
exercise was continued until subjects fell after passing the limit of stability, while the
exercise of the land group was performed under safe conditions to prevent subjects
falling.</p><p>Bassile et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that obstacle
training significantly improved the gait function of individuals with chronic stroke. Said
et al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that modified obstacle
crossing reduced the risk of a trip due to toe contact for stroke patients. The findings of
previous studies agree with the results of the present study that obstacle training both in
water and on land are significantly improves balance function and walking speed, which is
considered to support reliability and suitability of the intervention program. We consider
that future intervention programs for patients need to include training that can cope with
daily hazards and complex environments, such as passing obstacles while walking and walking
on stairs. Especially, training in water can be conducted for many patients as it can be
easily performed by patients with various illnesses of every age group, and impacts on
joints can be reduced by the buoyancy effect of water.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by a Daegu University Research Grant, 2011.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other"><person-group><name><surname>Sims</surname><given-names>NR</given-names></name><name><surname>Muyderman</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group>: Mitochondria, oxidative metabolism and cell death in stroke.
