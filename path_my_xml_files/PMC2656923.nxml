Zambia has one of the highest case notification rates of tuberculosis in the world (700 per 100&#x02009;000), and a high proportion (70%) of people with active tuberculosis are co-infected with HIV.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> Despite the availability of effective antituberculosis chemotherapy, mortality in HIV positive people with tuberculosis remains high. Increasing evidence indicates that this is probably due to bacterial sepsis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> Rates of bacterial pneumonia are several times higher among HIV positive adults than in the general community.</p><p>In 1999 a randomised placebo controlled clinical trial in HIV positive patients with sputum smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis in C&#x000f4;te d&#x02019;Ivoire found that co-trimoxazole prophylaxis significantly reduced mortality and morbidity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> A second study in adults with symptomatic HIV disease showed significantly lower morbidity in the co-trimoxazole arm.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> These data formed the basis of a provisional recommendation by the World Health Organization and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) in 2000 that co-trimoxazole should be given to all adults and children in Africa with symptomatic HIV-1 infection (WHO clinical stages 2, 3, and 4).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> However, several African countries took the view that it could not be assumed that such a benefit would necessarily be applicable throughout Africa. Subsequently, a small randomised clinical trial from Senegal was stopped early (because of the announcement of the WHO/UNAIDS recommendations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>); the authors concluded that chemoprophylaxis with low dose co-trimoxazole did not show a beneficial effect on survival or the occurrence of opportunistic or non-opportunistic infections.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> The levels of resistance of locally relevant pathogens to co-trimoxazole was low in the C&#x000f4;te d&#x02019;Ivoire studies, whereas much higher rates have been reported elsewhere.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> Zambia has no policy on co-trimoxazole prophylaxis in people with HIV infection.</p><p>After careful consideration of the available evidence, the Zambian Ministry of Health and the University of Zambia research and ethics committee agreed to three randomised placebo controlled clinical trials using co-trimoxazole prophylaxis: in children with HIV<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>; in postnatal women with HIV; and in adults with HIV and tuberculosis, which is reported here. Our aim was to assess the impact of prophylactic co-trimoxazole on reducing mortality in antiretroviral treatment naive adults with HIV receiving treatment for newly diagnosed active tuberculosis and in antiretroviral naive adults with HIV who had previously received antituberculosis treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study setting and population</title><p>The setting for the study was the main referral centre for tuberculosis in Lusaka, Zambia, the University Teaching Hospital (UTH) chest clinic. We enrolled two groups of HIV positive, antiretroviral naive Zambian adults aged 16-60 years and randomised them to receive daily co-trimoxazole or matching placebo for the duration of the trial. The two groups were newly diagnosed, previously untreated patients with smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis receiving antituberculosis treatment (after one year, patients receiving a retreatment regimen were also eligible) and clinically healthy people previously treated for tuberculosis but no longer receiving any treatment.</p><p>All participants had a permanent address, were not pregnant, and were willing to give informed consent. We excluded patients with WHO stage 4 HIV disease who were unlikely to survive more than two weeks as well as those with a history of sulphonamide allergy and those who needed treatment with or were already receiving co-trimoxazole for other indications.</p></sec><sec><title>Screening, informed consent, and randomisation</title><p>All newly diagnosed, previously untreated adult patients with smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis seen routinely in a diagnostic clinic and patients who had participated in an earlier trial of tuberculosis treatment were potentially eligible. Patients were referred to the tuberculosis chest clinic at the University Teaching Hospital for assessment of their eligibility. We informed them that joining the trial would require an HIV test, the results of which would remain confidential. All participants received pre-test and post-test counselling by trained counsellors. We explained the aims and nature of the study carefully to ensure that participants understood that, in addition to the standard treatment for tuberculosis, they would be given a drug that might or might not be beneficial in preventing other sickness often seen in patients with tuberculosis and HIV. We also assessed potentially eligible participants clinically to determine any contraindications to enrolment; those with a positive HIV test result who fulfilled the other criteria for admission were taken through the consent procedure and invited to join the trial.</p><p>We used computer generated balanced randomised blocks, prepared by the MRC Clinical Trials Unit (CTU), London, to determine the randomisation schedule. An independent member of the CTU staff pre-labelled the trial drug. We entered names of eligible participants on the next available line of one of two registers (one for newly diagnosed patients, one for previously treated patients) to determine their study number and the drug supply assigned to them. None of the staff working on the trial in Zambia was aware of the allocated treatment, and at no stage was it necessary to unblind them.</p><p>We issued participants with a container of study drug bearing their trial number, gave them instructions about taking the trial tablets and what to do in the event of possible adverse reactions, and gave them an appointment date four weeks later. We provided a study identity card bearing the name of the study and the participant&#x02019;s study number. We encouraged participants to attend whenever they were unwell and asked them to inform the clinic if they were moving either within or out of Lusaka.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions and treatment for tuberculosis and opportunistic infections</title><p>We randomised participants in a 1:1 ratio to receive a supply of pre-labelled trial drug (co-trimoxazole or matching placebo; two tablets to be taken daily). Each co-trimoxazole tablet contained 400 mg sulfamethoxazole and 80 mg trimethoprim.</p><p>We followed the national tuberculosis treatment guidelines of the Ministry of Health of the government of Zambia. Patients with active, previously untreated tuberculosis received the standard regimen of ethambutol, isoniazid, rifampicin, and pyrazinamide for two months followed by isoniazid and ethambutol for six months. Patients who needed re-treatment for relapse received one of the WHO recommended retreatment regimens.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></p><p>If participants developed any illnesses requiring the use of co-trimoxazole, we discontinued the study drug and administered open label co-trimoxazole at recommended therapeutic doses. The trial drug was resumed after treatment of an acute episode had been completed.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary end points were all cause mortality and adverse events leading to an interruption of trial drug.</p></sec><sec><title>Follow-up</title><p>We saw participants every four weeks up to 16 weeks and every eight weeks thereafter until the close of the trial. We gave them four-weekly supplies of 70 trial tablets up to and including the 12 week visit and two four-weekly supplies at each attendance thereafter. Patients returned unused supplies to the clinic when attending for assessment. At each visit we recorded information on the antituberculosis chemotherapy and trial drug received, together with information about visits to clinics or traditional healers or unscheduled visits to the study clinic for illness since the previous routine study attendance. We recorded details of possible adverse drug effects. When necessary, participants were admitted to hospital for investigation.</p><p>At each clinic visit, we asked participants how many doses of the trial drug they had missed and we counted pills. When participants failed to attend an outpatient appointment their names were carried forward to the next week of the diary; if they still failed to attend the home visitor team visited the home address. If they were absent from home or had moved to another address we made efforts to find them, by interviewing relatives and neighbours and visiting alternative addresses listed in the locator form. We collected clinical specimens for microbial analysis from participants who reported ill with symptoms and signs. When bacteria were cultured, we tested them for sensitivity to antibiotics.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>Assuming a death rate of 15 per 100 person years in the previously untreated participants (based on a death rate of 18/100 person years in a trial in a similar population of patients in Lusaka<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>), a total of 1408 person years of observation would be needed to show a 35% reduction in death rate in patients receiving co-trimoxazole, at the 5% level of significance with 80% power; a 40% reduction would require 1045 person years.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of data</title><p>We entered all data in duplicate locally and verified them by using Epi-Info software version 6.04d. Master databases were backed up at regular intervals and copies transmitted by electronic mail to the MRC Clinical Trials Unit in London on a monthly basis.</p><p>We set up trial management committees in London and Lusaka to review the progress of the trial on a regular basis and an independent data monitoring committee to monitor the progress of the trial and patient safety every six to eight months. We did no formal interim analyses.</p><p>We used the Kaplan-Meier method, the log rank test, and a Cox proportional hazard regression model to make comparisons of the groups for the primary end point by time to event analyses and tested heterogeneity of survival rates in subgroups by interaction tests within Cox models. We fitted a fractional polynomial model to assess the effect of randomised group over time,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> using a nearly linear pre-transformation to reduce the influence of outliers after a fixed time point.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref> We made all comparisons by intention to treat and used Stata version 8 for analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Participant flow</title><p>Figure 1<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"/> depicts the flow of participants during the study.

The trial was closed in September 2004, when funding for antiretroviral treatment became available for those participants who were eligible. Follow-up from the time of randomisation ranged from 0 to 46 months. A total of 1012.6 person years of data were accumulated from participants receiving treatment for tuberculosis at the time of randomisation (919.2 from newly diagnosed previously untreated patients and 93.4 from those being retreated for relapse) and 457.5 person years from those not on treatment.

Retrospective exploratory analyses in the newly diagnosed patients indicate a lack of benefit during the first six months, coinciding in part with the administration of rifampicin (which has a broad spectrum of activity against a variety of bacterial infections) in the initial two month intensive phase of their antituberculosis chemotherapy. After this came a period of about 12 months during which we saw a significant reduction in mortality of 45%, very similar to those reported in the Cote d&#x02019;Ivoire trial and the CHAP trial of HIV positive children in Zambia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> These results should be interpreted with caution, as they are based on unplanned subgroup analyses with relatively small numbers of person years.
