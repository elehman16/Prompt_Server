along with intrauterine insemination (IUI) is commonly
used to infertile couples with patent fallopian
tube. IUI is simple, non-invasive and cost-effective
technique (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). During IUI, pretreated semen
is concentrated in a small volume of 0.2-0.5 ml and
splashed by a catheter into the uterine cavity (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).
Different studies have been reported a pregnancy
rate per cycle of 15-20% (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The pregnancy rate
depends on artificial insemination technique, the
type of ovarian stimulation [Clomid or injectable
gonadotropins, with or without gonadotropin-releasing
hormone (GnRH)], the age of patients and
the cause of infertility (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>Fallopian tube sperm perfusion (FSP), an alternative
procedure, has been reported to improve
pregnancy rate in comparison with IUI (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The FSP was first described by Kahn et al. (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and
shown a pregnancy rate per cycle of 26.9% in
patients with unexplained infertility. In FSP
technique, sperm preparation is identical to that
used in IUI, but the main difference is the sperm
preparation volume of medium that is 4 ml in
FSP, indicating higher volume in comparison
with IUI (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Therefore, higher volume of insemination
in FSP technique causes sperms to
pass directly through the fallopian tubes and to
spread into the cul-de-sac (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Many studies
have shown the higher sperm densities in the
fallopian tubes present at the time of ovulation
as compared with IUI (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In a study by Ripps
et al. (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), they showed that the number of peritoneal
spermatozoa recovered at laparoscopy
after IUI was very less than their number after
uterotubal flushes. Mamas (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) proposed 10 ml
of contrast medium in hysterosalpingography is
sufficient to fill the uterine cavity and to pass
through fallopian tube in order to spread in
peritoneal cavity, suggesting the efficiency of
tuboperitoneal insemination (IUTPI) method.</p><p>There are different method to prevent semen reflux
in FSP technique, such as using Allis clamp on
cervix, transcervical inflated pediatric Folley catheter
balloon, the double nut bivalve (DNB) speculum
with modified tips to clamp the cervix, and
the fallopian sperm transfer (FAST) system(<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). In a study by Fanchin et al. (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), they
introduced the FAST system, an autoblocking device
for FSP. They reported significant difference
in pregnancy rate per cycle, 40% in the FSP Vs.
20% in the IUI group.</p><p>Since 1992, several randomized controlled studies
published have compared the efficacy between
FSP and standard IUI, but they have showed conflicting
results (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Since there was
no study about FSP using FAST system in North of
IRAN .We designed this prospective trial to evaluate
and to compare the pregnancy rate per cycle
between FSP using FAST system and IUI in patients
with unexplained infertility.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This prospective randomized study was conducted
at the IVF Unit, Department of Gynecology
and Obstetrics, Imam-Khomeini Hospital,
Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences,
Sari, North of Iran, from March 2011 to February
2012. After a basic infertility work up, patients
with unexplained infertility were included
in this study with the following indications:
normal ovulatory cycle, normal spermiogram,
normal hysterosalpingography, and normal
laparoscopy finding. Patients with abnormal
semen morphology and hormonal assay, abnormal
hysterosalpingography, age more than
35 years, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)
and endometriosis, body mass index (BMI)&#x0003e;28
kg/m<sup>2</sup>,duration of infertility&#x0003e;10 years, and history
of treatment with assisted reproductive
techniques(ART) were excluded. After obtaining
informed consent, all patients underwent
similar controlled ovarian stimulation protocol
using clomiphene citrate and human menopausal
gonadotropin (hMG) injection. The protocol
consisted of clomiphene citrate (tablet 50 mg,
Iran Hormone, Iran) 100 mg per day from day
3 to 7 of the menstrual cycle and a single intramuscular
injection of hMG (Merional, IBSA,
Switzerland) 75-150 IU daily (single dose) until
the follicle diameter reach to 18 mm. Cycles
were monitored from day 10 by transvaginal
ultrasound (Honda 2000, japan) to measure the
number and the diameter of the growing follicles
and endometrial thickness. The maturation
of two to three follicles was considered optimal.
A total of 10,000 IU human chorionic gonadotropin
(hCG, Amp 5000 IU/1 cc, Darupakhsh,
Iran) was administered when at least one follicle
had reached a diameter of 18 mm, and 34-
36 hours later, either standard IUI or FSP was
performed. According to the collected data, including
aged between&#x0003c;30 and 30-35 years old,
primary or secondary infertility, and duration of
infertility &#x0003c;5 or &#x0003e;5 years. On the day of hCG
administration, the patients were randomly, according
to a sealed envelope, divided into group
I (n=45) to undergo standard IUI or group II
(n=45) to undergo FSP using FAST system. The
study was approved by Ethical Committee of
the Institutional Review Board of Mazandaran
University of Medical Sciences.</p><p>For all patients, semen was prepared by the
standard swim-up technique. The final sperm suspension
was diluted in 0/5 ml and 4 ml of Ham&#x02019;s
F-10 medium for IUI and FSP groups, respectively.
In all cases, IUI and FSP were performed
by a clinician and a technician. Intrauterine insemination
was performed using the IUI catheter (Laboratoire C.C.D., Paris, France). The catheter
was passed into the upper part of the uterine cavity,
and 0.5 cc of sperm was slowly deposited. An
air bubble was left behind the sperm suspension to
provide complete delivery of the sperm suspension
into the uterus. Patients rested for 30 minutes after
insemination.</p><p>FSP was performed with FAST system&#x02019;s catheter
from the same company (Laboratoires C.C.D.,
Paris, France). This device is composed of a cervical
cup made of crystal-clear plastic with two
flexible tubings with a roller clamp on each, the
injection tubing and the vacuum tubing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>)
(<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Three different sizes of cervix adaptor were
selected (diameters of 25, 27, and 30 mm) according
to the size of the patient&#x02019;s cervix. The syringe
containing 4 cc processed semen was connected to
the injection tubing. A sterile 10-mL syringe was
connected to the vacuum tubing (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Cervix was
exposed by a bivalve speculum in lithotomy position,
and the cervix was exposed and cleaned with
physiological saline solution. According to the
factory instruction, the cervical cup was grasped
using a grasping forceps. Afterward, the adaptor
was inserted into the vagina until the tip of the injection
tubing entered into the cervix canal. Then,
the edge of the cup was gently pressed into the
cervix to make sure that it was in the right place.
Furthermore, a vacuum was immediately created
inside the adaptor by aspirating the syringe connected
to the vacuum tubing. The sperm suspension
was then slowly injected over 2 minutes (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).
To push all the sperm that were in the dead space
of the tubes into the uterus, the first syringe was
disconnected and replaced with another sterile
5-mL syringe filled with 1.5 mL of incubation medium.
FSP was completed by slowly injection of
the medium. Then the tubing was attached to the
inner thigh by means of a sticking plaster. After 2
hours, the device was easily removed with a gentle
pull after opening the roller clamp of the vacuum
tubing.</p><p>Patients received progesterone vaginal suppositories
400 mg per day (Cyclogest, Actavis,
Iceland) for luteal-phase support. Patients were
instructed to obtain a quantitative serum hCG 16-
18 days after insemination if no menses occurred.
A transvaginal ultrasonogram was performed at
6-7 weeks after the last menstrual period to detect
clinical pregnancy. A biochemical pregnancy was
detected by a transient elevation of serum hCG.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig 1</label><caption><p>FAST System for fallopian tube sperm injection (FSP).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="Int-J-Fertil-Steril-8-379-g01"/></fig><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences

population. We demonstrated no statistically significant
difference between both treatment group
in the pregnancy rate (17.8% in FSP vs. 20% in
IUI groups) (p&#x0003e;0.05).The pregnancy rate with FSP
is less than that reported by Kahn et al. (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), they
reported 26.9% pregnancy rate in the FSP group
versus9.8% in the IUI group (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>In Fanchin and colleagues&#x02019;study (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), FSP was
performed using an auto-blocking device (FAST
system) similar to our study. Fanchin reported
40% pregnancy rate per cycle in FSP group versus
20% in the IUI group (p&#x0003c;0.05), however, they
failed to determine the cause of infertility in their
patients (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Theoretically, the direct passage of
the sperm preparation through the fallopian tubes
would increase the density of capacitated spermatozoids
near the oocyte and the intra-peritoneal
cavity and by consequence increase the pregnancy
success rate (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).The pressure injection of inseminate
in FSP can remove partial obstruction of fallopian
tubes, created by thick mucus or tubal polyps
(<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Some authors reported pregnancy rates of
20-40 % in FSP technique (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). One metaanalysis
study by Trout and Kemman (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) demonstrated
a significant difference of superiority for
FSP concerning the unexplained infertility, 22% of
pregnancy rate in FSP versus 13% in IUI. They included
all the previous studies from 1992 to 1998,
but exempted Fanchin et al. (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) who didn&#x02019;t detail
their indications and results. Trout and Kemman&#x02019;s
meta-analysis showed a significant improvement
in pregnancy rates with FSP only in patients with
unexplained infertility who underwent controlled
ovarian stimulation with gonadotropin and insemination
protocols (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). We used clomiphene and
gonadotropin combination for induction of ovulation
to reduce the cost of treatment. Selecting the
different induction ovulation protocol may explain
the differences between their and our findings. In
El-Khayat and colleagues&#x02019; study, the pregnancy
rate was significantly higher in FSP group than in
IUI group (26.7 vs. 11.7%, respectively, p&#x0003c;0.04).
They achieved FSP via Foley catheter with 4 mL

rate of 9 or 14.5% in FSP technique (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,

a statistically significant superiority of the FSP
over the IUI method for all the indications of insemination
(<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Our results are similar to Nuojua-
Huttunen and colleagues&#x02019; study. They performed
a prospective randomized study using a Foley
catheter for FSP. They reported no advantage of
FSP in comparison with the conventional IUI technique
in women with unexplained infertility, minimal
to mild endometriosis, mild male factor, and
ovarian dysfunction. However, the Foley catheter
is cheaper, but sometimes, there is difficult to introduce
this tool into the cervical canal. It might
have an adverse effect on the endometrium caused
by pressure of the balloon and the substances that
may dissolved from the Foley catheter (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Only
truly randomized controlled studies comparing
FSP with IUI were included in this review. Eight
studies involving 595 couples were included in the
meta-analysis. Only one study reported the live
birth rate and there was no evidence of a difference
between FSP and IUI (OR 1.2, 95% CI: 0.39
to 3.5). There was no evidence of a difference between
FSP and IUI for clinical pregnancy per couple
(OR 1.2, 95% CI: 0.79-1.7). A subgroup analysis
including couples with unexplained subfertility
did not report any difference between FSP and IUI
(OR 1.6, 95% CI: 0.89-2.8) (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p><p>Since 1992, the following different protocols
for ovarian stimulation are applied: clomiphene,
alone or combined with FSH, and HMG. Different
protocol for induction ovulation is one of the
factors that could explain differences in results.
Another factor to explain the differences in result
is the type of catheter used to place sperm in the
fallopian tube. As mentioned in studies, the use of
the FAST system for FSP can be a little more expensive
than the IUI catheter, and sometimes, the
placement of the seal cup on the cervix is not perfect
and needs more experience and skill (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In
our clinic, we perform routinely FSP with Foley
catheter and FAST system, so skill of clinician
can&#x02019;t be considered as a factor for difference.</p><p>From this study we conclude that FSP using
FAST system offers no advantage over the standard
IUI in order to increase the pregnancy rate in
unexplained infertility. The FSP technique needs
more media volume for insemination, so the procedure could be more expensive. Maher Shams
evaluated the efficacy of double FSP versus single
FSP by Foley catheter in non-tubal infertility.
They showed higher pregnancy rate in double FSP
groups (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Doing double FSP in unexplained infertility
could be a topic for our future study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Future well-designed study in larger population
is needed to confirm benefits of FSP. We suggest
double FSP or tubo-peritoneal perfusion with 10
ml of inseminated before using other more expensive
and invasive assisted reproductive technique
in unexplained infertility patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to express our appreciation to Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences for supporting the grant of this residency proposal.
