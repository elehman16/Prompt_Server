We set out to develop and evaluate a high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) approach for the simultaneous analysis of multiple eicosanoid lipid mediators in equine synovial fluid (SF), and to illustrate its use for investigation of the <italic>in vivo </italic>effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Synovial fluid samples were obtained from normal joints of 6 adult horses at baseline (0 hr) and at 8, 24 and 168 hours after experimental induction of transient acute synovitis, with horses treated once daily with oral NSAID (meloxicam, 0.6 mg/kg) or placebo. Following solid-phase extraction, SF lipid mediator quantitation was based on liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) analysis, and results were compared between disease states using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) with multiple comparisons corrections.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of a total of 23 mediators targeted, 14 could be reliably identified and quantified in SF samples based on detection of characteristic fragment ions at retention times similar to those of commercial standards. LDA analysis of baseline, 8, 24 and 168 hour synovial fluid samples revealed a separation of these groups into discrete clusters, reflecting dynamic changes in eicosanoid release over the course of synovitis. Prostaglandin (PG) E<sub>2 </sub>was significantly lower in NSAID vs. placebo treated samples at all time points; PGE<sub>1</sub>, 11-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (11-HETE) and 13,14-dihydro-15keto PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; were reduced at 8 and 24 hours by NSAID treatment; while 15-HETE, 6-keto PGF<sub>1</sub>&#x003b1;, PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;, 13,14-dihydro-15keto PGE<sub>2 </sub>and thromboxane B<sub>2 </sub>(TXB<sub>2</sub>) were reduced at the 8 hour time point only.

Of these mediators, the E-series prostaglandins (most notably PGE<sub>2</sub>) are most noted in arthritis research for their pro-inflammatory and pro-nociceptive actions in synovial joints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>However, COX and LOX enzyme activity within the arachidonic acid cascade generates a range of eicosanoid mediators that have widely varying biological actions, including anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In recent years, more light has been shed on the specific actions of individual eicosanoids in arthritis, and several of these (including PGE<sub>2</sub>) have emerged as janus-faced mediators with pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory effects depending effects, depending on concentration and receptor subtype engagement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Reduction of PGE<sub>2 </sub>production is the classical mode of action of anti-inflammatory agents like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that are commonly used in medical management of (osteo)arthritis, and numerous studies have demonstrated a lower PGE<sub>2 </sub>concentration in synovial fluid (SF) following NSAID treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, by inhibition of COX activity, these drugs are likely not only to affect PGE<sub>2 </sub>production but also to interfere with the production of mediators with differential effects that are generated by the same enzymatic pathways. Indeed, in an early study, NSAID (naproxen) treatment tended to reduce not only PGE<sub>2 </sub>but also TXB<sub>2 </sub>and 6-keto PGF<sub>1</sub>&#x003b1; concentration in the SF of human patients with rheumatoid arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The investigation of the potential involvement of individual eicosanoids in disease states relies on sensitive and specific assays to measure these products in biological fluids. While antibody-based assays for individual eicosanoids are commonly employed, these suffer from cross-reactivity issues and may produce misleading results in complex biological samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Moreover, they can be used for analysis of only one metabolite at a time, restricting the amount of biological information obtained as SF sample volume tends to be a limiting factor.</p><p>In this report, we describe the application of recently developed high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) mediator lipidomics techniques to the study of eicosanoid release in equine synovial joints. To evaluate the relative abundance of these lipid mediator species in normal and inflamed joints and investigate the effects of COX inhibition on eicosanoid profiles, we performed a longitudinal study of SF lipid mediator composition in healthy horses over the course of experimentally induced transient synovitis with and without oral NSAID treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>5(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE), 8(S)-HETE, 11(S)-HETE, 12(S)-HETE, and 15(S)-HETE; leukotriene D<sub>4 </sub>(LTD<sub>4</sub>), LTE<sub>4</sub>; LTB<sub>4</sub>; 5(S)6(R)15(S)-lipoxin A<sub>4 </sub>(LXA<sub>4</sub>); prostaglandin E<sub>1 </sub>(PGE<sub>1</sub>), 6-keto prostaglandin F<sub>1</sub>&#x003b1; (6-keto PGF<sub>1</sub>&#x003b1;), prostaglandin D<sub>2 </sub>(PGD<sub>2</sub>), prostaglandin E<sub>2 </sub>(PGE<sub>2</sub>), prostaglandin F<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; (PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;), 11&#x003b2;-prostaglandin F<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; (11&#x003b2;-PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;), prostaglandin F<sub>2</sub>&#x003b2; (PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b2;), prostaglandin J<sub>2 </sub>(PGJ<sub>2</sub>), 15-deoxy-&#x00394;12,14-prostaglandin J<sub>2 </sub>(15-deoxy-&#x00394;12,14-PGJ<sub>2</sub>), thromboxane B<sub>2 </sub>(TXB<sub>2</sub>), 13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;, 13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGE<sub>2</sub>, 13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGD<sub>2</sub>, and 16,16-dimethyl PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; were purchased from Cayman Chemical Company (Ann Arbor, MI, USA).

All experimental procedures were preapproved by the Utrecht University institutional Ethics Committee on Animal Experimentation. In short, six healthy adult warmblood horses were subjected to two episodes of experimental synovitis, once in the right and once in the left middle carpal joint, with a 2-week washout period in between. During each experimental period, horses were randomly assigned to receive oral NSAID treatment (meloxicam, 0.6 mg/kg; Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica GmbH, Ingelheim am Rhein, Germany) or placebo treatment (the same oral suspension minus the active substance) starting at t = 2 hours after LPS and at 24-hour intervals thereafter (26, 50, 74, 98, 122, and 146 hours after LPS) for a total of seven treatments. In each experimental period, SF samples were aspirated at baseline (t = 0, just prior to LPS injection) and 8, 24, and 168 hours after LPS. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000<italic>g </italic>immediately after collection, and supernatants were aliquotted and transferred to -80&#x000b0;C within 30 minutes; samples were stored at -80&#x000b0;C awaiting extraction.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample preparation</title><p>SF aliquots (300 &#x003bc;L) were thawed on ice.

The corresponding loading plot (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) shows which fragments contributed most to the observed difference (that is, spatial separation) between samples belonging to different groups; those mediators that are furthest from the intercept of both axes (the 0 distance point) contribute most to this distinction (that is, PGE<sub>2</sub>, LTB<sub>4</sub>, 5-HETE, 11-HETE, 6-keto PGF<sub>1</sub>&#x003b1;, PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;, 13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;, and TXB<sub>2</sub>).

Furthermore, we illustrate the use of the developed LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis to investigate the effects of NSAID treatment in acute synovitis.</p><p>We identified and quantitated 14 individual eicosanoids in SF extracts by using MRM. The MRM transitions used to identify individual compounds in this study were confirmed by literature sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]; unfortunately, as previously outlined by Murphy and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], many eicosanoids have very similar or even identical (isomeric) chemical structures and therefore a single m/z transition may not be as specific to individual compounds as desired. Future experiments employing information-dependent acquisition in combination with enhanced product ion detection settings could be used to enhance analyte identification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Alternatively, the use of more than one m/z transition per compound (as was done in the present case for TXB<sub>2 </sub>and PGE<sub>2</sub>) could aid in definitive identification.</p><p>The recovery of analytes in this study was estimated by comparing peak areas of the IS in spiked and extracted SF samples with the corresponding standard solution analyzed without extraction. Although this provides an indication of analyte loss over the extraction procedure, it does not account for possible differences in recovery or degradation between individual analytes. While it is certainly not uncommon to use only one IS in studies of multiple analytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], it would be preferable to use stable isotope-labeled standards for each analyte under investigation or to use one such labeled standard per class of mediators targeted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, the 16,16-dimethyl PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; we employed does combine several advantages for use as an IS in the current application: It elutes at an RT close to that of many analytes of interest, it shows good stability at room temperature and at -20&#x000b0;C and -80&#x000b0;C (de Grauw, unpublished observations), and it is not normally found in SF and is not known to have a biological function in synovial joints.</p><p>In addition to rapid enzymatic conversion and degradation of lipid mediators <italic>in vivo</italic>, the reliable analysis of eicosanoids in body fluids may be hampered by <italic>ex vivo </italic>degradation of labile species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This was recently demonstrated for PGD<sub>2</sub>, which was shown to be far more susceptible to chemical decomposition at room temperature and at -20&#x000b0;C than PGE<sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Hence, relative quantities of these mediators in extracted samples may also reflect selective degradation of one over the other, and absolute levels should be interpreted with caution; the same might be true for other eicosanoids, the stability of which has not been exhaustively addressed. For instance, the current extraction procedure and HPLC solvent system are not optimized for quantitative detection of cysteinyl LTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>We positively identified 14 eicosanoids in SF extracts and found that the concentrations of many of these were significantly elevated in inflamed joints compared with normal (baseline) values (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). As LPS induces marked influx of leukocytes (predominantly neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]) into the joint space, eicosanoid species detected may partly reflect release by infiltrating cells rather than release from articular sources; however, articular cartilage and, especially, synovial fibroblasts are apt producers of a great number of these mediators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and therefore having the means to detect these will aid in future studies of spontaneous disease.</p><p>SF eicosanoid profiles changed dramatically upon synovitis induction, as illustrated by the LDA plots showing marked separation between samples taken at different time points. Release of individual prostanoids, HETEs, and LTB<sub>4 </sub>over the course of transient synovitis did not reveal marked temporal differences between these classes of mediators, although there was a trend toward early response of prostanoids versus a somewhat more protracted response of HETEs and LTB<sub>4</sub>. PGE<sub>1 </sub>and PGE<sub>2 </sub>as well as PGJ<sub>2 </sub>(which is an intermediate breakdown product of PGD<sub>2 </sub>and which is known to have anti-inflammatory properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]) showed a more prolonged elevation over the first 24 hours of synovitis than other prostanoids. Although our method quantitatively detected 15-deoxy-&#x00394;12,14-PGJ<sub>2 </sub>in stock standards and in spiked SF, this anti-inflammatory PG was not detected in SF extracts and hence we cannot comment on its temporal release pattern. The same was true for LXA<sub>4</sub>, another endogenous anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving mediator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Some of these species may have escaped detection because of rapid enzymatic conversion or chemical instability as noted above; thus, the precise release kinetics of pro- versus anti-inflammatory eicosanoid species in acute synovitis will need to be addressed in future studies that include even earlier sampling time points or alternative extraction steps or both.</p><p>The observed differences between NSAID- and placebo-treated samples clearly demonstrate that the effects of COX inhibitors on synovial eicosanoid release are not limited to PGE<sub>2 </sub>reduction. Concentrations of many other prostanoids, including PGE<sub>1</sub>, PGD<sub>2</sub>, PGJ<sub>2</sub>, PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;, 6-keto PGF<sub>1</sub>&#x003b1;, and TXB<sub>2</sub>, were also significantly lower in NSAID- versus placebo-treated SF samples, particularly in the acute phase of synovitis, and this agrees with and extends previous findings in SF of human subjects treated with naproxen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The observed reduction in PGE<sub>2 </sub>and 6-keto PGF<sub>1</sub>&#x003b1; (the stable main metabolite of prostacyclin) with NSAID treatment is likely to contribute to analgesic efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Inhibition of PGE<sub>2 </sub>and PGE<sub>1 </sub>production could limit the negative feedback of these two mediators on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) production by synovial fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]; however, as meloxicam itself inhibits synovial MMP activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], this will not have clinical implications. The consequences of TXB<sub>2</sub>, PGD<sub>2</sub>, and PGJ<sub>2 </sub>inhibition are harder to predict because their roles in arthritis have been less well studied.</p><p>Our results for LTB<sub>4 </sub>and 5-, 12-, and 15-HETE are interesting because these mediators are all products of the LOX pathway but proved to be differentially affected by NSAID treatment. Both LTB<sub>4 </sub>and 5-HETE are downstream products of 5-LOX, 12-HETE is produced through 12-LOX action, and 15-HETE is produced by 15-LOX (while both 11- and 15-HETE can also be produced by COX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]). As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, 12-HETE concentration did not change at all over the course of transient synovitis, whereas the concentration of 15-HETE was significantly elevated in the acute phase and reduced by NSAID treatment. Interestingly, the concentration of LTB<sub>4 </sub>was significantly higher at 8 hours in SF of NSAID-treated versus placebo-treated horses, and 5-HETE showed a similar trend. A transient increase in LTB<sub>4 </sub>release has also been found in cultured synovial membrane and cartilage explants treated with certain COX inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and has been suggested to be due to 'shunting' of arachidonic acid away from COX-mediated PG production toward LOX-mediated LT production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, our findings suggest that this is an oversimplification since such a general shunt would have resulted in elevated concentrations of all LOX-generated mediators rather than some of them. Perhaps more likely, different LOX isoforms or additional enzymes (or both) that are located within the arachidonic acid cascade and that act upon intermediate metabolites (for example, phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase) may be differentially affected by NSAID treatment. Interestingly, LTB<sub>4 </sub>elevation was no longer observed at later time points, and, at 168 hours, meloxicam actually reduced LTB<sub>4 </sub>concentration. The biological or clinical implications of this transient rise in LTB<sub>4 </sub>upon therapeutic COX inhibition remain to be established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and are likely to be complex; while LTB<sub>4 </sub>plays a crucial role in driving inflammatory arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], it may also act to rescue COX-generated mediator production important to resolution of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>Altogether, this study represents a first attempt at simultaneous quantification of more than 20 lipid mediators in SF samples. Despite the more complex data analysis and inherent difficulty in identification of multiple closely related analytes in complex biological samples, the ESI-LC-MS/MS method we employed shows obvious advantages over enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based techniques that require relatively large volumes of SF for detection of one selected mediator at a time, while unaccounted-for analyte loss during sample extraction and cross-reactivity between analytes may provide misleading results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The current approach allows high-throughput screening of SF samples by using an IS for estimation of extraction efficiency and requires only 300 &#x003bc;L of SF to analyze a much wider spectrum of eicosanoids, thus enabling the detection of mediators and treatment effects that otherwise would have escaped attention.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We report the application of a sensitive HPLC-MS/MS technique for the simultaneous detection of more than 20 eicosanoids in SF. Extraction efficiency was deemed adequate, and the method showed good linearity and sensitivity. The application of this method to SF samples from horses with experimentally induced synovitis treated with NSAID or placebo confirmed local release of many more eicosanoids than PGE<sub>2 </sub>alone over the course of transient synovitis and revealed differential effects of NSAID treatment on several of these mediators: PGE<sub>2 </sub>was significantly lower in NSAID- versus placebo-treated samples at all time points; PGE<sub>1</sub>, 11-HETE, and 13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; were reduced throughout the acute phase (8 and 24 hours) by NSAID treatment; whereas 15-HETE, 6-keto PGF<sub>1</sub>&#x003b1;, PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;, 13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGE<sub>2</sub>, and TXB<sub>2 </sub>were reduced at the earliest time point only. An interesting pattern was seen for LTB<sub>4</sub>, in which NSAID treatment caused an initial increase at 8 hours but a significant reduction at 168 hours.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BHT: butylated hydroxytoluene; ESI: electrospray ionization; HETE: hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid; HPLC: high-performance liquid chromatography; IS: internal standard; LC: liquid chromatography; LDA: linear discriminant analysis; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; LT: leukotriene; LX: lipoxin; MMP: matrix metalloproteinase; MRM: multiple reaction monitoring; MS: mass spectrometry; m/z: mass/charge; NSAID: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug; PG: prostaglandin; RT: retention time; SF: synovial fluid; TX: thromboxane.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JCdG carried out the sample collection and extractions, participated in method optimization, and drafted the manuscript.
