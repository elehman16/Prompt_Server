Twenty-five healthy subjects had the transient receptor vanilloid 1 agonist capsaicin and placebo creams topically applied to contralateral areas on the skin of the thigh for 48 hours. Subjects had shallow (1.2 millimeter) and deep (&#x0003e;3 millimeter) punch skin biopsies from each thigh on days 1 and 14. Biopsy wound healing was monitored photographically until closure. Intra-epidermal and sweat-gland nerve fiber densities were measured for each biopsy. Shallow wounds in capsaicin-treated sites healed more slowly than in placebo treated skin with biopsies taken on day 1 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) and day 14 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). Deep biopsies in the capsaicin and placebo areas healed at similar rates at both time points. Nerve fiber densities were reduced only in capsaicin treated regions (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01). In conclusion, topical application of capsaicin causes a small fiber neuropathy and is associated with a delay in healing of shallow, but not deep wounds. This novel human model may prove valuable in the study of wound healing in patients with neuropathy.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by National Institutes of Health National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) K23 NS050209 (CHG).

Damage to small sensory nerve fibers leads to reduced axon-reflex vasodilation (mediated by nociceptive C-fibers), which is a critical component to neurogenic inflammation <xref rid="pone.0054760-Hamdy1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0054760-Kramer1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. However, the mechanism by which dysfunction of small sensory nerve fibers contributes to reduced wound-healing capacity is not fully understood <xref rid="pone.0054760-Boyko1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>There are no studies in humans that specifically examine the effect of small fiber neuropathy on wound healing. Most studies of wound healing in animals are performed with other comorbid risk factors <xref rid="pone.0054760-Chan1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0054760-Laing1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. It is widely accepted that neuropathy increases the risk of ulcer development in humans but the specific effects of neuropathy on wound healing are less clear. A prior study investigating the healing of acute biopsy wounds did not find any difference in healing rates between healthy subjects and patients with diabetes <xref rid="pone.0054760-Krishnan1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, although other studies have demonstrated delayed vascular and neural repair in humans with diabetes <xref rid="pone.0054760-Ebenezer1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054760-Polydefkis1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Clinically, we have observed delayed healing of skin biopsies in some patients with neuropathy, but this has not been studied systematically.</p><p>In cutaneous tissue repair, re-epithelialization occurs through migration of keratinocytes from free wound edges <xref rid="pone.0054760-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In partial-thickness wounds, additional sources for keratinocytes are dermal adnexal structures, such as hair follicles and sweat glands, which remain in the wound bed. These adnexal structures can contribute to nearly half of the re-epithelialization process <xref rid="pone.0054760-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0054760-Schneider1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. This is in contrast to deeper (full-thickness) wounds where hair and other adnexal structures no longer remain and wound healing is therefore delayed <xref rid="pone.0054760-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0054760-Schneider1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The cutaneous adnexal structures in the dermal layer are innervated by small sensory and autonomic nerve fibers, and damage to these nerve fibers might attenuate the contribution of dermal structures to the wound healing process <xref rid="pone.0054760-Gibbons1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0054760-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>We hypothesized that an injury to small sensory and autonomic nerves in otherwise healthy individuals would delay healing of partial but not full-thickness wounds. We theorized that disruption of local axon-reflexes using a chemical axotomy model would prevent stimulation of keratinocytes from adnexal structures during tissue injury, thereby delaying wound healing. In order to test this hypothesis, we designed a novel human model of wound healing to study the effects of small fiber neuropathy, with and without cutaneous adnexal structure input, on the healing process. We topically applied the transient receptor vanilloid 1 agonist capsaicin to the skin of healthy subjects to cause degeneration of cutaneous nociceptive and autonomic nerve fibers <xref rid="pone.0054760-Polydefkis1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054760-Nolano1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054760-Gibbons3" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. We performed partial and full-thickness skin biopsies in the capsaicin and placebo regions at different time points to create cutaneous wounds, monitored by high-resolution photography, to determine the effects of a small fiber neuropathy on wound healing rates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects</title><p>Twenty-seven healthy subjects were recruited for the study.

We, and others, have previously shown that topical application of the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin causes both structural and functional changes to cutaneous sensory and autonomic nerve fibers <xref rid="pone.0054760-Polydefkis1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054760-Gibbons3" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In the current investigation, we demonstrate that topical application of capsaicin, resulting in a small fiber neuropathy, delays healing of partial-thickness wounds by more than 30% compared to wounds in normal skin. However, no delay in healing occurs in deeper wounds with adnexal structures removed.</p><p>After 48 hour occlusive capsaicin treatment, there was near-complete loss of intra-epidermal nerve fibers and reduction in sweat gland nerve fiber density with functional changes to quantitative sensory testing, quantitative sudomotor testing and axon-reflex vasodilation, consistent with several prior studies <xref rid="pone.0054760-Polydefkis1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054760-Gibbons3" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. We found that shallow wounds taken 1 day after capsaicin application heal at the same rate as full-thickness wounds that have all adnexal structures removed. Shallow biopsies taken 14 days after capsaicin treatment also healed more slowly than placebo biopsies, thus demonstrating that the delay in wound healing from day 1 biopsies is not solely a consequence of local neuropeptide depletion or a transient effect of capsaicin pre-treatment on local signaling or cellular migration <xref rid="pone.0054760-Lai1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Capsaicin pretreatment had no effect on full-thickness wound healing rates and results did not differ from placebo.</p><p>A number of possible mechanisms for the delayed wound healing seen in our capsaicin treated biopsies are suggested by animal studies. After cutaneous injury, recruited keratinocytes migrate from the wound edges into the wound bed while keratinocytes in adnexal structures contribute to nearly half of the re-epithelialization area in partial thickness wounds <xref rid="pone.0054760-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Animal studies have also shown a delay in wound healing when dermal structures are removed <xref rid="pone.0054760-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. A recent study in rats demonstrated that capsaicin denervation impairs hair follicle stem cell migration leading to delays in wound healing <xref rid="pone.0054760-MartinezMartinez1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. These results are consistent with our findings where full thickness biopsies heal more slowly than partial thickness biopsies from placebo treated skin that still contain adnexal structures in the wound bed.</p><p>A recent study of the effects of both chemical and excisional axotomy demonstrates that vascular regrowth after tissue injury precedes axonal regrowth <xref rid="pone.0054760-Ebenezer1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In addition, delayed vascular regrowth is seen in patients with diabetes. Our study compared placebo and capsaicin treated sites within the same individual to avoid confounding differences in baseline vascular density on wound healing. Our functional data (sweat, sensory and axon-reflex vasodilation) suggest that capsaicin denervation effectively disrupts the neurogenic axon reflex. However, we cannot distinguish the neurovascular effects on wound healing from the neural effects on other dermal appendages using the capsaicin model. Nonetheless, our data strongly suggest that neuropathy may predispose to delayed cutaneous tissue repair. Although we did not identify the mechanism of delayed healing in our study, a recent report using chemical axotomy in rats supports our theory that impaired stem cell migration from dermal adnexal structures may be secondary to disruption of local neural reflexes <xref rid="pone.0054760-MartinezMartinez1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p>There are several limitations to our study. Capsaicin acts widely across many cell types that possess TRPV1 receptors. Although capsaicin is not known to cause damage to endothelial progenitor cells, it is possible that the application of capsaicin does reduce progenitor cell migration, nerve signaling or other actions involved in wound healing. Capsaicin may also alter keratinocyte proliferation and this study is unable to distinguish acute capsaicin effects on healing from neuropathy specific effects, although we would expect deep biopsies from capsaicin treated regions to heal more slowly if there was a significant effect on keratinocyte proliferation or migration. However, shallow skin biopsies taken 2 weeks after capsaicin application still showed delayed wound healing, a finding that cannot be explained by transient effects of capsaicin. The evidence of neural regrowth on day 14, seen by increasing numbers of intra-epidermal nerve fibers, demonstrate that the acute effects of capsaicin have resolved. Another limitation is that topical capsaicin does not penetrate deeply into the dermal layer. Our prior studies involving topical capsaicin application suggest a partial reduction of sudomotor and vasomotor fibers, but not complete loss as seen with epidermal nerve fibers <xref rid="pone.0054760-Gibbons3" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. It is unclear if the partial loss of nerve fibers in deeper tissues is secondary to lower densities of TRPV1 channels on non-nociceptive nerve fibers or diminished penetration of capsaicin to deeper tissues. Most individuals with small fiber neuropathy are older while our study included primarily younger individuals. We intentionally chose a homogenous population to reduce the number of potential variables to consider in the wound healing process. Additional study of healing rates in an older population would provide valuable information about the effects of age on healing rates.</p><p>We report a unique method that may isolate the effects of a small nerve fiber injury on wound healing. The technique creates a standardized nerve injury that is reproducible, transient and can study both healthy subjects and patients with disease without any long-term consequences. Many animal models of wound healing are available, but often do not reflect the human condition because rodent models of cutaneous injury typically heal by contracture, while humans heal by re-epithelialization. In order to accelerate discovery of novel therapies for wound healing, and to translate them into clinical practice, it is imperative that effective human models exist.</p><p>Our study demonstrates that application of topical capsaicin, with an associated small fiber neuropathy, causes a delay in healing of shallow wounds by 30% or more, leading to healing rates similar to those of deep wounds. The effects of topical capsaicin on wound healing appear to last at least 2 weeks beyond the time of application. Our study suggests that small nerve fibers may be a relevant contributor in the pathogenesis of acute wound healing, but only when dermal structures remain intact - a scenario that reflects the majority of acute superficial wounds. Our protocol includes prolonged application of capsaicin in an occlusive dressing, a technique that increases the delivered dose of capsaicin beyond clinical guidelines. Our findings may not apply to the more widespread clinical use of capsaicin as clinical trials have not reported delayed wound healing as a complication <xref rid="pone.0054760-Low2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0054760-Simpson1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Nonetheless, we suggest that capsaicin, widely advocated for treatment of neuropathic pain, be used with caution in patients that are at risk for or already have wound healing impairment.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0054760-Krishnan1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
