The UK Lung Cancer Screening (UKLS) pilot trial compares a single low-dose CT (LDCT) scan with usual care.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> LDCT was introduced in the late 1990s and offers a major advance in imaging technology.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> It is more sensitive than chest X-ray and has enabled detection of small, asymptomatic lung tumours.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The US-based National Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NLST) showed that LDCT screening resulted in a 20% reduction in lung cancer-related mortality when compared with chest radiography.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Results from the on-going Dutch-Belgian lung cancer screening trial (NELSON), investigating whether LDCT screening reduces mortality compared with no screening at 10&#x02005;years follow-up, are yet to be published.</p><p>Compared with routine screening for other types of cancers, lung screening in the UKLS trial was only available to high-risk individuals as part of a two-stage population risk screening strategy. It has previously been shown that individuals from lower socioeconomic groups, smokers and younger individuals were less likely to take part at the first stage of recruitment to the UKLS trial.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> However, the factors affecting uptake of these initial recruits who were subsequently identified as being at high risk of developing lung cancer have not been examined.</p><p>Inequalities in participation present a significant challenge to the successful implementation of cancer screening programmes. Reduced uptake of participants for cancer screening has been consistently found among deprived populations and ethnic minority groups,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and previous studies have highlighted some of the barriers and facilitators to lung screening.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;12</xref> Van den Bergh <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> found that participants in the NELSON had a more positive attitude towards the benefits of lung cancer screening, as well as a higher affective risk perception, when compared with non-participants. Silvestri <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> found that smokers were less likely to participate in screening than non-smokers, due to lower perceived effectiveness of lung cancer early detection strategies. A qualitative study described four typological behaviours among those declining participation in a lung cancer screening programme: individuals who felt they were &#x02018;too old to benefit&#x02019;, &#x02018;avoiders&#x02019; who preferred not to know their lung cancer status, &#x02018;worriers&#x02019; who felt that participation would increase their anxieties, and &#x02018;fatalists&#x02019; who believed that if they were to develop lung cancer, this would occur regardless of being screened or not.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>The influence of affective risk perception on screening uptake is particularly relevant in the context of a targeted screening strategy to identify those at high risk of developing lung cancer. Affective risk perception refers to an individual's degree of concern or worry associated with personal risk, rather than a quantitative estimate of their risk.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> There is much debate about whether higher affective risk perception motivates or deters individuals from cancer screening. Studies including the NELSON have shown that individuals with a higher affective risk of lung cancer are more interested in taking part in screening.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> However, a body of evidence regarding uptake of other forms of cancer screening suggests that a moderate level of affective risk perception optimises screening uptake, with too little creating a lack of motivation and too much leading to avoidance of screening.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>The aim of the current study was to use a mixed methods approach to identify the barriers to uptake among high-risk individuals invited to participate in UKLS. We aimed to answer three questions: (1) What are the demographic and psychological characteristics of individuals declining participation at the second stage of the UKLS trial? (2) Among those declining and stating their reason, what are the reported barriers to participation? (3) Are there any associations between individual characteristics and self-reported barriers to participation? It was hypothesised that declining to take part in UKLS would be associated with lower socioeconomic group, smoking, and higher affective risk perception. Identifying barriers to participation among high-risk individuals in the UKLS trial will inform the implementation of a potential national lung cancer screening programme.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Procedures</title><p>UKLS is a multicentre randomised controlled pilot trial to compare the intervention of LDCT screening versus usual care for the early detection of lung cancer in high-risk individuals.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Individuals from six primary care trusts (PCTs) in Liverpool and Cambridge were approached with an invitation letter and a participation questionnaire.

Emotional barriers were also more likely to be reported by older individuals (OR=2.94, p=0.036). Associations between gender and self-reported barriers were not statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first to use a mixed methods approach to examine the barriers to participation among high-risk individuals in a lung cancer screening trial. A profile of potential risk factors for non-uptake of lung screening was revealed. High-risk individuals who were older, female, smokers, from a lower socioeconomic group, or with a higher affective risk perception were less willing to participate in the UKLS trial. Practical barriers reflecting difficulties with travelling to attend screening, comorbid illnesses and treatments, and carer responsibilities were the most common self-reported reasons for non-participation. Exploratory analysis revealed that travel was a more commonly reported barrier among individuals of higher socioeconomic group, and individuals with a higher affective risk perception more commonly reported barriers relating to comorbidities. Smokers were more likely to report emotional barriers as reasons for non-participation.</p><p>At the initial stage of recruitment from the general population into the UKLS trial, uptake generally increased with age, with the exception of individuals aged &#x02265;71&#x02005;years where uptake was the lowest.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In contrast, no difference in screening uptake was observed between younger and recently retired high-risk individuals in the current study, although older individuals were less likely to participate in screening. Reduced uptake among older individuals in both stages of the UKLS trial is important, since more than half of lung cancer cases occur in individuals aged over 70&#x02005;years.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>High-risk women were less likely than high-risk men to participate in the UKLS trial. Currently the only UK screening programme that recruits both genders is the colorectal screening programme. Although initial uptake of faecal occult blood testing is higher among women, they are less likely than men to take further testing involving sigmoidoscopy.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24&#x02013;26</xref> It can be argued that being recalled for flexible sigmoidoscopy infers high risk similar to that of being invited back to participate in the UKLS trial; both of these may provoke fear and concerns related to lung cancer. Previous studies have found cancer-related fears and concerns to be more prevalent among women than men.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>The association between smoking status and trial uptake is consistent with previous studies that revealed lower uptake in lung cancer screening among smokers.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Exploratory analyses found that smokers were more likely to report emotional than practical barriers when compared with ex-smokers, reflecting fear, anxiety and a wish to avoid lung cancer-related information. Similarly, Silvestri <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> found that when compared with never-smokers, current smokers reported more fatalistic attitudes and were less likely to believe that early detection and intervention would result in a good chance of survival.</p><p>In contrast to van den Bergh <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> who found that a higher affective risk perception was a motivator for lung screening in the NELSON, the current study found that high-risk individuals with a higher affective risk perception were less likely to participate in the UKLS trial. It is likely, therefore, that a high-risk status was inferred, which for some individuals induced avoidance of cancer-related information. This is consistent with previous studies which report that higher levels of concern or threat associated with personal cancer risk may act as a deterrent to screening through the mechanism of avoidance.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>The association between lower socioeconomic group and lower screening uptake among high-risk individuals echoes that of previous studies.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The effect of socioeconomic deprivation on screening uptake has been attributed in part to fearful and fatalistic beliefs among more deprived populations.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Such beliefs may partly stem from, and be reinforced by, greater exposure to lung cancer and other prevalent respiratory diseases in deprived communities as a consequence of socioeconomic differences in tobacco use.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p><p>Previous studies have found travel to be an important barrier to participation in cancer screening.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> In the current study, difficulties with travel were more commonly reported by higher, rather than lower, socioeconomic groups. However, we suggest that this counterintuitive finding is a confound of geographical area rather than a true effect, reflecting difficulty in travelling to Papworth Hospital&#x02014;located in rural and more affluent Cambridgeshire&#x02014;compared with Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p><p>The use of a mixed methods approach allowed for a richer exploration of the barriers to lung screening uptake than quantitative or qualitative analysis alone.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> In addition, the use of free-text comments in a questionnaire provided an opportunity for data to be gathered from a large sample of individuals, and from those who may not be willing or able to participate in interviews or focus groups.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>
<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> However, methodological issues associated with response bias are acknowledged. Younger individuals, those from lower socioeconomic groups, and smokers were less likely to complete the NPQ. As a result, there was an under-representation of self-reported barriers in these individuals. In addition, individuals may not be consciously aware of underlying motivations for their behaviour.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Some barriers might be perceived as more legitimate than others, and emotional barriers relating to avoidance, fear and anxiety may, therefore, have been under-reported. Further qualitative studies are needed to gain an in-depth understanding of barriers and facilitators to lung cancer screening in high-risk individuals.</p><p>Smoking status was computed from self-reported information; so there is potential for smokers to be under-represented, although previous studies have shown the validity of self-reported smoking status to be high.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>
<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Affective risk perception was assessed using one item from the revised Cancer Worry Scale.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The use of this single-item measure in predicting level of affective risk perception has not yet been validated.</p><p>Although randomised trials are the gold standard for evidence-based decision-making in medicine,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> an individual's decision about participating in a trial is different from deciding to participate in a national screening programme. As a result, there may be limitations regarding the generalisability of results to the general population when a national lung cancer screening programme is implemented in practice, and also a risk of amplifying the effects of sociodemographic variables on non-uptake, as observed in the current trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Strategies to improve equitable uptake are critical to the successful implementation of new cancer screening programmes. The current study highlighted important subgroups who were less likely to take part in UKLS trial and in whom lung cancer risk is known to be higher.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In the case of a national lung cancer screening programme, efforts to improve uptake should include strategies for engaging women and those most at risk, including adults over 70&#x02005;years, smokers, and those from deprived areas. Practical barriers relating to access should be addressed, with behavioural interventions designed to minimise emotional barriers, especially among current smokers.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> NA was responsible for coding of qualitative results, interpretation of the results, and drafting of the initial and final manuscript.
