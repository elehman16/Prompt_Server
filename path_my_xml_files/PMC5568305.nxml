Food insecurity can act as a real barrier to adherence to both of these factors. Many people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) treated with ART in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) are faced with nutritional challenges. A significant proportion are affected by under nutrition, which frequently leads to therapeutic failure. Some HIV care facilities recommend supplementation with <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> (M.O.) Lam. leaf powder to combat marginal and major nutritional deficiencies. This study aims to assess the impact of M.O. Lam. leaf powder supplementation compared to nutritional counseling on the nutritional and immune status of PLHIV treated with ART.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A single-blind randomized control trial was carried out from May to September 2013 at an outpatient clinic for HIV-infected patients in Kinshasa (DRC). Sixty adult patients who were at stable HIV/AIDS clinical staging 2, 3 or 4 according to the World Health Organization (WHO), and were undergoing ART were recruited.</p><p id="Par3">After random allocation, 30 patients in the <italic>Moringa</italic> intervention group (MG) received the M.O.

In recent years, the rate of new HIV infections, the risk of contracting comorbidities or AIDS-defining opportunistic illnesses, and the number of AIDS-related deaths have all fallen dramatically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and in many cases, virus replication can be sustainably controlled with antiretroviral therapy (ART) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Nevertheless, additional challenges have emerged, notably <italic>(i)</italic> the persistence of latent reservoirs of HIV-infected cells in the organs of patients treated with ART; and <italic>(ii)</italic> onerous, lifelong ART, with side effects constraining adherence to therapeutic regimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">The cascade of inflammatory reactions induced by HIV infection increases basal metabolism and general energy expenditure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This causes a vulnerability to malnutrition for people living with HIV (PLHIV), particularly for those who are experiencing a decrease of appetite or metabolic disorders, or for those affected by food scarcity in limited resources setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. With ART, the nutritional status often improves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] because of a good immunometabolic responsible to the effective ART outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. For that reason, it is necessary to administer ART to patients in adequate nutrition conditions. It&#x02019;s well known that at the untreated asymptomatic HIV clinical stage or symptomatic stage, an increase of the resting energy expenditure is observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Therefore, an additional energy compensation (of 10, 20 or 30%, depending on the clinical HIV/AIDS staging) is required to maintain a stable nutritional status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">In both HIV-positive and HIV-negative people, the normal total daily energy intake from proteins and fat is 10&#x02013;12% and 15&#x02013;30%, respectively. A healthy diet should be rich in essential amino acids, as well as unsaturated rather than saturated fats. A diet able to cover the recommended daily intake (RDI) of micronutrients has been recommended to improve and sustain the health and nutrition status of HIV patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), inadequate energy intake and specific micronutrients deficiencies are prevalent among the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Moreover, most PLHIV residing in the DRC present nutrient deficiency at ART inception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">Partners of the National Program for the Fight against AIDS (PNLS) in the DRC supply some malnourished HIV patients with industrial foods. Nevertheless, this supply is often limited in quantity and time. Some HIV care facilities in the DRC recommend the intake of <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> Lam. (M.O.) leaf powder to improve the nutritional status of patients. This plant, belonging to the Moringaceae family, is recommended for several reasons: <italic>(i)</italic> it is dense in nutrients including unsaturated fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], high-quality proteins (rich in essential amino acids), and micronutrients: minerals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and vitamins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] compatible with the recommended dietary allowances. The high antioxidant activity of M.O. Lam. leaf powder extracts has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], as well as its ability to complement the calories of staple food in a limited-resource area and effectiveness as a supplement for PLHIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]<italic>.

O Lam. leaf powder supplementation intervention was effective for improving the patients&#x02019; body mass index and serum albumin levels compared to patients who only received nutritional counseling. In addition, as a secondary outcome, the intervention was effective for improving the BMI of patients with professional activity among those who were supplemented with M.O. Lam. leaf powder compared with those who received nutritional counseling. This BMI and serum albumin improvement with M. O Lam. leaf powder intervention associated with ART is an important finding and demonstrates the potential to improve the outcomes and health of PLHIV undergoing ART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p id="Par63">The results presented in this study on the nutrient contents of M. O Lam. leaf powder Congolese ecotype expand on the current literature regarding the potential use of M. O Lam. leaf powder as a dietary supplement for patients, especially those living in a limited resource setting. Recommendations for the use of M.

In this study, we observed corroborative and consistent results about the amount of protein, the characteristics of the fat content, in which we listed unsaturated and saturated fatty acids, especially mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids, as well as the phytosterol and mineral or trace element content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].

Several studies have attested the essential role of protein intake in the functioning of the organism in terms of the maintenance of body cells, increase in body weight, and a decrease in the viral load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Our results indicated that M. O powder supplementation effect was more effective in the patients with professional activity (PA) than in those without PA. Beyond assets on psychological, economical even sociological on the patient wellness, the generated PA income, doubtless allowed patients in this study category to reach more easily the daily meals in which they mixed the powder of M.O. Houtzager review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] on nutrition and HIV underlined that better socioeconomic status of patient might generate conditions on the psychological support nd way to access food securely. In summary, we recommend that an effort be continued to improve socio economical conditions of patients in limited-resources settings for a better HIV care outcomes. Although the BMI or biochemical parameters of patients in the CG were not significantly improved compared with the MG, nutritional counseling seemed to increase the patients&#x02019; knowledge about nutrition or the quality of their diet. Through this study, many patients discovered cheap and healthy diets in their environment. Indeed, nutritional counseling would improve nutritional knowledge and thereby improve dietary quality intake and reduce food insecurity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec30"><title>Strengths and weaknesses of the study</title><p id="Par65">In a limited resource setting, dietary supplementation with M. O Lam leaf powder, a locally produced food of plant origin with high nutritional values and accessible to all, has positive outcomes for PLHIV undergoing ART which might allow its integration into a nutrition program. Patients included in this study were motivated to participate and expected positive health changes; moreover, their motivation was boosted during the allocated time for the monthly supply of M.O. Lam. leaf powder and dietary advice.</p><p id="Par66">However, some limitations have to be pointed out for this study: behavioral factors, important factors influencing weight, were difficult to measure in this type of study. The lack of quantification of the daily energy intake from meals (staple food) in which M. O Lam. leaf powder was mixed prevents us from drawing any conclusion about the real total daily energy intake of each patient. Despite the accessibility of M.O. to all, its use should remain under medical monitoring to ensure a safe level of consumption, notably due to the risk of high dietary protein intake in combination with antiretroviral drugs, which can aggravate pre-existing chronic renal insufficiencies and the racial predisposition for kidney damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]; renal function checkups must also be ensured. The absence or even a reduced effect of vegetable proteins on hemodynamics has been reported in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], which might explain the absence of a significant statistical difference between the proportions of patients with higher than normal creatinemia between the study groups.</p><p id="Par67">Other limitations of this study include a relatively small sample size and somewhat limited follow-up period. Finally, the compliance of M.O. Lam. leaf powder supplementation was checked monthly by the self-reporting of patients, by which most M. O use-related difficulties were recorded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Unanswered questions and future research</title><p id="Par68">An unanswered question remains concerning the specific doses of M. O Lam. leaf powder required to improve the health and antiretroviral care outcomes of PLHIV early on in their HIV infection trajectory. Future trials should firstly assess the patient&#x02019;s average daily energy intake before determining the quantity of M. O Lam. leaf powder to be consumed. Secondly, the comparison of the impact of supplementation might be observed through each subgroup of PLHIV in order to perceive the corresponding therapeutic doses.</p><p id="Par69">Other unanswered questions concern the impact of M. O Lam. leaf powder supplementation on the patients&#x02019; immune system. This intervention was not effective at improving the lymphocyte counts or reducing the viral load of PLHIV undergoing ART. In this study, blood samples were taken on inception and in the sixth month, whereas we would recommend that future trials carry out immunovirological monitoring monthly to assess fluctuations that might be imputed to the intervention in each subgroup. Further trials should also include a larger sample size and a longer duration of follow-up to shed light on these remaining unanswered questions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par70">The results of this study are encouraging, despite the limitations described above. They attest the positive role that nutritional support by M.O. Lam. leaf powder supplementation might have for PLHIV who are being treated with ART regimens in areas with limited resources. Supplementation with M.O. Lam. leaf powder can be used as an available local solution to not only ward off nutritional deficiencies but also boost and sustain a stable nutritional status of PLHIV on ART in limited resources settings. Nonetheless, this supplementation needs to be monitored by healthcare professionals, particularly in terms of the control of specific biological parameters, in order to obtain optimal results.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ACS/AMO CONGO</term><def><p id="Par8">Action Communautaire Sida et Avenir Meilleur pour les Orphelins en R&#x000e9;publique D&#x000e9;mocratique du Congo</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AIDS</term><def><p id="Par9">Acquired immune deficiency syndrome</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ART</term><def><p id="Par10">Antiretroviral therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p id="Par11">Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CD4</term><def><p id="Par12">Cluster de differentiation 4</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CG</term><def><p id="Par13">Control group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DRC</term><def><p id="Par14">Democratic Republic of the Congo</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FFQ</term><def><p id="Par15">Food Frequency Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GATHER</term><def><p id="Par16">Greet&#x02013;Ask&#x02013;Tell&#x02013;Help&#x02013;Explain&#x02013;Return</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HIV</term><def><p id="Par17">Human immunodeficiency virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>INRB</term><def><p id="Par18">Institut national de recherch&#x000e9; Biom&#x000e9;dicale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>M.O.</term><def><p id="Par19">
