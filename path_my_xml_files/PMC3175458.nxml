It mostly affects certain groups of high risk populations (health care workers, patients with frequent hospitalization) but the prevalence of latex sensitisation in general population is also far from negligible. Moreover, there has been a recent increasing number of cases of NRL-allergy in other occupations including hairdressers, housekeepers, construction workers, food handlers or security personnel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], probably due to widespread exposure to latex gloves. Therefore, NRL-allergy represented a recognised public health concern until corrective measures were adopted (mainly, the substitution of NRL by other materials or the use of powder-free gloves in healthcare institutions), resulting in a progressive decline in the incidence of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The avoidance of NRL is currently recommended to reduce the risk of allergic symptoms (including life-threatening reactions) in patients with established allergy. However, in the case of NRL this measure is clearly insufficient because it is quite difficult to keep away from the widespread presence of latex in many products. It is also complicated due to the cross-reactions of latex with various common fruits like avocado, banana or kiwi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], that is mainly due to Hevein (Hev b 6) sensitisation. Moreover, while long-term avoidance of natural rubber latex can resolve symptoms, detectable IgE indicating continued sensitization remains beyond 5 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Immunotherapy using a NRL extract could hypothetically protect these patients from an adverse episode after accidental contact to NRL. However, although it is a common sensitization, the availability of different commercial products with proven efficacy and safety is still limited. Only a few studies with the appropriate design (randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled) have been published regarding the efficacy and tolerance of specific immunotherapy. In fact, there is evidence that subcutaneous immunotherapy leads to a significant improvement in various efficacy parameters when compared to placebo, but with the drawback of a high rate of systemic reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Sublingual administration of NRL-immunotherapy has also been barely explored in adult patients. Patriarca et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] showed an improvement in skin and respiratory symptoms, and also in the conjunctival challenge test, but this was a non-controlled study. In another open-label and non-controlled study, Cistero [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] demonstrated a better tolerability of a rush sublingual immunotherapy than with the subcutaneous route, but only assessed the efficacy measuring a cutaneous response after 10 weeks. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of one-year sublingual immunotherapy was published by Nettis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], showing a significant improvement in symptoms and medication scores after 12 months of treatment. Finally, a very recent trial suggest that latex SLIT was more effective than placebo after one-year follow-up, but only 9 patient completed the study and hence, results must be taken with prudence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Bearing in mind that the sublingual application is better tolerated than the subcutaneous route, more studies on the long-term effect of this therapy are needed, especially when such therapy has been available for years. For this reason, we conducted this independent (sponsored by the investigators) randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to assess the efficacy and tolerability after 2 years follow-up of a commercially available NRL-sublingual immunotherapy in adult patients undergoing permanent NRL avoidance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design and ethics</title><p>This is an independent study which was sponsored by the investigators and partially funded by public institutions.</p><p>The study was designed in two phases: First, a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial was carried-out. At the end of the first year, follow-up (T1), blinding was discontinued and active-treated patients continued receiving treatment for another additional year (T2). Those patients who were included in the placebo group received active therapy for one year in an open-label manner.</p><p>The study was approved by the local Ethic's Committee/Independent Review Board as well as by the Spanish Medicines Agency.

The medication for the trial was supplied by the manufacturer directly to the Department of Pharmacy at the research centre. It was part of a commercial batch, but labelled for the trial as specified in the Annex XIII of Good Manufacturing Practice Guideline. SLIT-Latex<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>is a galenic formulation containing latex allergenic extract (<italic>Hevea brasiliensis</italic>), human albumin (except in vial 4), sodium chloride, phenol, glicerine and water. The extract is standardised in accordance with the protein content (SDS-PAGE) and with total protein content. The higher concentration is 500 mcg protein/mL. In addition, placebo was prepared by the same manufacturers and contained the same composition except the allergen extract. Both treatments had the same external appearance, taste and colour. Immunotherapy was administered according to manufacturer's schedule (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Patients were carefully instructed to held the drops under the tongue for 3 minutes before being swallowed. For safety reasons, according to EAACI, induction phase was administered at hospital setting under the surveillance of a trained allergologist and patient remained under observation for at least 30 minutes after each dose. Successive maintenance doses were self-administered at home. Patients attended the hospital every three months to collect new doses and to return the empty flasks, which were counted by investigators for the assessment of compliance.</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Treatment schedule of Sublingual Latex Immunotherapy: Concentration of vials and build-up dosing</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center">Day</th><th align="center">Flask</th><th align="center">Concentration (&#x003bc;g/ml)</th><th align="center"><bold>Nr</bold>.<break/>drops</th><th align="center">Dose administered<break/>(&#x003bc;g)</th><th align="center">Cumulative dose<break/>(&#x003bc;g)</th><th align="center">Total/day (&#x003bc;g)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><bold>1</bold></td><td align="center">(0)</td><td align="center">5.10<sup>-8</sup></td><td align="center">1<break/>10</td><td align="center">2.10<sup>-9</sup><break/>2.10<sup>-8</sup></td><td align="center">2.10<sup>-9</sup><break/>2.10<sup>-8</sup></td><td/></tr><tr><td/><td align="center">(1)</td><td align="center">5.10<sup>-5</sup></td><td align="center">1<break/>10</td><td align="center">2.10<sup>-6</sup><break/>2.10<sup>-5</sup></td><td align="center">2.10<sup>-6</sup><break/>2.10<sup>-5</sup></td><td align="center">2.10<sup>-5</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>2</bold></td><td align="center">(2)</td><td align="center">5.10<sup>-2</sup></td><td align="center">1<break/>10</td><td align="center">0.002<break/>0.02</td><td align="center">0.002<break/>0.022</td><td/></tr><tr><td/><td align="center">(3)</td><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">1<break/>10</td><td align="center">0.2<break/>2</td><td align="center">0.222<break/>2.222</td><td align="center">2.2</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>3</bold></td><td align="center">(4)</td><td align="center">500</td><td align="center">1<break/>2<break/>3<break/>4<break/>10</td><td align="center">20<break/>40<break/>60<break/>80<break/>200</td><td align="center">22.2<break/>62.2<break/>122.2<break/>202.2<break/>402.2</td><td align="center">400</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>4</bold></td><td align="center">(4)</td><td align="center">500</td><td align="center">25</td><td align="center">500</td><td align="center">902.2</td><td align="center">500</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td align="center">Maintenance</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>5</bold></td><td align="center">(4)</td><td align="center">500</td><td align="center">2/24 h.</td><td align="center">40</td><td/><td align="center">40</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title><italic>In vivo </italic>tests</title><p><bold>Skin prick tests </bold>to 4 latex concentrations (4, 20, 100 and 500 &#x003bc;g) were performed in duplicate in each study visit.

In addition, heart rate, arterial pressure and peak-flow measurement were measured before and after the administration of a dose. During the maintenance phase, patients were instructed to annotate any inconvenience on a diary card. Safety was monitored by the investigators each study visit, and in addition, the patient always had the opportunity to contact the allergologist or to attend the emergency room in case of severe adverse reactions.

A total of 9 mild adverse events were recorded during the induction phase, 5 in four patients from the Placebo group during the buid-up of the placebo treatment (1 conjunctivitis, 1 rhinorrhoea, 1 pruritus, 1 dyspnoea, 1 tongue pruritus) occurred in the first doses of the immunotherapy; and 4 reactions in 4 patients from the Active group, that appeared when high doses of an allergen extract of latex were reached (1 tongue pruritus, 3 rhinoconjunctivitis). The build-up schedule was modified only in one patient corresponding to the Placebo group.</p><p>During the maintenance phase, one patient was withdrawn after the first year of active treatment due to cutaneous pruritus over the previous months. Another patient who switched from placebo to active treatment in the second year of the study, suffered from an outbreak of acute dermatitis in the feet after one week of maintenance, and was then dropped from the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The increase in latex allergy incidence observed in the 80s was associated with the 25-fold increase in the use of latex gloves in order to prevent the transmission of increasing incidence of transmission viral diseases (mainly HIV, BHV and CHV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Although natural rubber latex exposure dramatically diminished in the sanitary environment, thanks to its functional properties, latex is the basis for manufacturing a large variety of products and there is even now a widespread distribution of latex-containing products in other professional (hairdressers, food-service workers, cleaning workers, police officers) or personnel settings, including sports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Therefore, due to the difficulties to completely avoid the allergen, it is recommended the specific desensitization of those patients, mainly with potential occupational exposure, because it would be expected that in the case of accidental exposure, the reaction would be less severe than in non-hyposensitized allergic patients.</p><p>Sublingual administration can be an advantageous alternative to the classical subcutaneous immunotherapy, its efficacy and safety should be distinctively demonstrated for each allergen. In this study, a commercially available sublingual immunotherapy with scarce evidence of efficacy and safety was evaluated through an appropriate randomized and blinded design. It must be highlighted that this was an independent clinical trial, founded only by public funds. Nevertheless, the study was carried out according with Good Clinical Practice guidelines, including appropriate monitorization by external investigators.</p><p>Randomized, controlled and blind clinical trials are the standard for the evaluation of new medicines. However, since the sublingual therapy was commercially available, a placebo-controlled trial over a 2 years period was considered not ethically appropriate. In consequence, a combined design was chosen, comprising a first year of double-blind placebo-controlled treatment followed by an additional year as open-label follow-up. This design allowed the assessment of both, the comparison of active and control groups during the first year as well as evaluation of the evolution of the active therapy during 2 years.</p><p>A common difficulty in clinical research is the enrollment of patients. In our study, all the latex allergic patients diagnosed at the research centre were directly contacted to requested their participation in the trial. The number of patients finally evaluated can be considered to be truly representative and it is noteworthy that more than 1/3 of the total population of NRL allergic patients registered in the Health Area finally participated in the study. However, the number of withdrawals in the switch from the double-blind to the open-label phase was higher than expected. This can be partly attributed to a subjective perception of the lack of efficacy and partly to the low frequency of symptoms and subjective feeling of not needing treatment. In spite of two patients who abandoned the study because they suffered an acute recurrence of skin symptoms (both had a history of former atopic dermatitis). The majority of the patients were occupationally exposed to latex before the diagnosis, and 60% of them were health-care professionals. The distribution of health-care workers between active and placebo groups was well-balanced. Demographic and clinical features and baseline characteristics were well matched, except in the number of patients who suffered from asthma, which were predominantly allocated to the active group. Also, there was a difference in the NRL specific IgE, which was also higher in the active group.</p><p>Regarding the allergenic distribution, all the patients had a uniform pattern of latex sensitization, and recognized predominantly Hev b 5 and Hev b 6 allergens that are considered major allergens in patients occupationally exposed to latex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Only 2 patients were sensitized to Hev b 1, an allergen linked to patients with spina bifida and repeated surgical procedures. The individual assessment of those cases showed that they had not a response to therapy, which could be partly attributed to the fact that Hev b 1 was not present in the composition of the extract used in the immunotherapy, according to manufacturer's information.</p><p>The study also suffered from one of the usual weakness in clinical trials in allergy comparing with other diseases, namely the lack of a single, objective, reliable and easily measurable variable to evaluate the efficacy of treatment. Therefore, in the case of immunotherapy studies, the analysis of efficacy usually relies on several clinical or analytical variables, self-questionnaires, measurements of quality of life, etc. Moreover, the particular case of latex immunotherapy has an additional difficulty comparing with clinical trials with other allergens since some of the commonly used variables (symptoms score, consumption of medication) were not useful because the patients avoid contact with the allergen and these parameters are thus not measurable. Although other authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] have used a clinical score to evaluate the efficacy of a latex extract, the use of such evaluation cannot be considered appropriate when no allergenic exposure is expected. However, in our study, this difficulty was overcome by the use of several <italic>in vivo </italic>(skin prick test, CCT, GUT) and <italic>in vitro </italic>tests (determination of specific IgE and BAT) to evaluate the therapeutic response to immunotherapy.</p><p>The main result of the study was the lack of significant differences in the majority of the variables studied, and in none of the different comparisons performed: comparison between groups (active <italic>versus </italic>placebo group after one year of treatment) and within groups after one or two years of active treatment.</p><p>The only variable with a statistically significant difference was a fall in the percentage of basophils activated in contact with NRL in BAT in the active group versus placebo. Other published studies showed a significant decreased percentage of basophils activated after 4 months of oral immunotherapy to peanut, analysing the result of one concentration (10 &#x003bc;g/ml) of the allergen used in the test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, the clinical significance of this finding remains unclear because no clear relationship exist with the remaining variables studied. In the future, more studies are needed that explore this finding.</p><p>The evolution of specific IgE showed an initial increase only seen when the patients received the active treatment, and a subsequent decrease in the second year of treatment in the active group, consistent with a transitory immunological effect of the immunotherapy.</p><p>Surprisingly, a previous not controlled study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] with the same extract and in a similar number of patients (26) shows an improvement in glove-use test and rubbing test after only 10 weeks of treatment (4-day build-up phase followed by 9 weeks of maintenance). However, likewise to our trial, no change was detected by the parallel line assay for prick test. Another similar clinical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] using the same extract in 35 patients found an improvement in symptom and medication scores in active group after12 months of treatment. The study was well-designed, but certain aspects require further clarification since no data were provided as to the occupation of the patients and the number of patients exposed to latex. Furthermore, the differences found in the study could be explained by the different exposure to NRL in both groups. In view of the low incidence of symptoms of NRL-allergic patients when they are diagnosed, we desisted from considering symptoms and medication scores as a variable. However, contrarily to our results, the authors did find a significant difference in the glove use test score between placebo and active group after 12 months of treatment.</p><p>A low frequency of adverse effects was recorded during the build-up phase of the treatment and all the patients reached the high dose. However, two patients had to drop out the study because of cutaneous symptoms that appeared during the maintenance phase. Those findings are awfully different to the reported in a very recent trial with 12 patients, in which 3 patients dropped out due to severe adverse events during induction phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Nevertheless, the explanation can rely in the fact that 2 of such patients had a history of anaphylactic events to chesnut and it is well known the association of latex sensitization with fruit allergy, including nuts.</p><p>Bearing in mind how well the treatment was tolerated, the lack of efficacy could be explained by the low dose used during the maintenance phase of the treatment. During the build-up phase, a dose of 500 mcg was reached by the fourth day, but from then on, a dose of only 40 mcg/d was administered during the rest of the treatment. It could thus be hypothesized that a greater dose should be used during the maintenance phase, especially when a long-term effect is desired. The low size of the sample, and the difference in the distribution of the patients that had suffered NRL-triggered asthma and the means of specific IgE to NRL between active and placebo group could also affect the absence of demonstrated efficacy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of the assayed NRL-sublingual immunotherapy. Specifically, use of a higher dose in the maintenance phase should be explored, since the maximum dose of the build-up phase has shown good tolerance. However, this present study raises some doubts as to the applicability of this immunotherapy to those patients who can avoid contact with latex.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>GG participated in the study design, patients' enrolment, statistical analysis and drafting of the manuscript.
