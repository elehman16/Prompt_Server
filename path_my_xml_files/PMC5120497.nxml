Current standards for approaches to data abstraction rest on a weak evidence base. We developed the Data Abstraction Assistant (DAA), a novel software application designed to facilitate the abstraction process by allowing users to (1) view study article PDFs juxtaposed to electronic data abstraction forms linked to a data abstraction system, (2) highlight (or &#x0201c;pin&#x0201d;) the location of the text in the PDF, and (3) copy relevant text from the PDF into the form. We describe the design of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that compares the relative effectiveness of (A) DAA-facilitated single abstraction plus verification by a second person, (B) traditional (non-DAA-facilitated) single abstraction plus verification by a second person, and (C) traditional independent dual abstraction plus adjudication to ascertain the accuracy and efficiency of abstraction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This is an online, randomized, three-arm, crossover trial. We will enroll 24 pairs of abstractors (i.e., sample size is 48 participants), each pair comprising one less and one more experienced abstractor. Pairs will be randomized to abstract data from six articles, two under each of the three approaches. Abstractors will complete pre-tested data abstraction forms using the Systematic Review Data Repository (SRDR), an online data abstraction system. The primary outcomes are (1) proportion of data items abstracted that constitute an error (compared with an answer key) and (2) total time taken to complete abstraction (by two abstractors in the pair, including verification and/or adjudication).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The DAA trial uses a practical design to test a novel software application as a tool to help improve the accuracy and efficiency of the data abstraction process during systematic reviews. Findings from the DAA trial will provide much-needed evidence to strengthen current recommendations for data abstraction approaches.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>The trial is registered at National Information Center on Health Services Research and Health Care Technology (NICHSR) under Registration # HSRP20152269: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wwwcf.nlm.nih.gov/hsr_project/view_hsrproj_record.cfm?NLMUNIQUE_ID=20152269&#x00026;SEARCH_FOR=Tianjing%20Li">https://wwwcf.nlm.nih.gov/hsr_project/view_hsrproj_record.cfm?NLMUNIQUE_ID=20152269&#x00026;SEARCH_FOR=Tianjing%20Li</ext-link>.

The steps in completing a review include formulating the research question, finding and collecting data from individual studies, and synthesizing the evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The validity of the review findings is contingent upon accurate and complete data collection from journal articles reporting results of relevant studies (&#x0201c;articles&#x0201d;), a process known as <italic>data abstraction</italic> (also known as <italic>data extraction</italic>).</p><p>As a predominantly manual process, data abstraction is inefficient, being both labor-intensive and error-prone. Errors during abstraction are common and have been well documented in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. One study estimated that the error rate, defined as &#x0201c;any small discrepancy from the reference standard,&#x0201d; was approximately 30% for single abstraction, regardless of the level of abstractor experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Our pilot data showed that less experienced abstractors made more errors across all types of research questions, and errors were highest for numerical results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Abstraction errors occur when abstractors either omit from the abstraction information that is present in the article or when information is abstracted incorrectly. When G&#x000f8;tzsche and colleagues examined 27 meta-analyses (i.e., statistical analyses of results from included studies in systematic reviews) published in 2004 across a range of topics, they found multiple errors in 37% of meta-analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In another study, Jones and colleagues documented abstraction errors in 20/42 reviews (48%); in all cases, the errors changed the summary meta-analytic results, although none changed the review conclusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Currently recommended approaches to reducing errors in data abstraction fall into two categories: (1) abstraction by one person followed by checking of the abstraction by a second person (&#x0201c;single abstraction plus verification&#x0201d;) and (2) independent abstraction by two persons followed by resolution of any discrepancies (&#x0201c;independent dual abstraction plus adjudication&#x0201d;). The former approach also sometimes concludes with adjudication between the two abstractors. Buscemi and colleagues showed that single abstraction plus verification results in approximately 20% more errors than independent dual abstraction plus adjudication, but the latter approach takes approximately 50% longer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Because only one study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] has examined the tradeoffs between single abstraction plus verification and independent dual abstraction plus adjudication and that study focused on a single review topic with only four abstractors, current standards for data abstraction rest on a weak evidence base. Major sponsors and producers of reviews (e.g., Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Evidence-based Practice Centers (AHRQ EPCs), Cochrane, Centre for Research and Dissemination (CRD)) and organizations that develop methodology standards for reviews (e.g., AHRQ, Cochrane, Institute of Medicine (IOM)) are inconsistent in their recommendations for approaches to reduce errors in abstraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Because &#x0201c;<italic>so little is known about how best to optimize accuracy and efficiency</italic>&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], the IOM Committee stopped short of recommending independent dual abstraction for all data elements. Instead, the IOM recommended: &#x0201c;<italic>at minimum, use two or more researchers, working independently, to extract quantitative and other critical data from each study</italic>&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]<italic>.</italic> Thus, although the IOM recommended independent dual abstraction for &#x0201c;critical data,&#x0201d; an important gap in our current methodological understanding of data abstraction remains. The recommendation for &#x0201c;critical data&#x0201d; could represent unnecessary work or, conversely, the IOM&#x02019;s implicit recommendation that a single person could abstract non-critical data could represent an opportunity for error.</p><p>Computer-aided abstraction could potentially make the abstraction process more efficient and more accurate by facilitating the location and storage of key information in articles. With funding from the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), we developed the Data Abstraction Assistant (DAA), a novel software application designed to facilitate tracking the location of abstracted information in articles and to reduce errors during abstraction. DAA facilitates abstraction by allowing users to (1) view article PDFs juxtaposed to electronic data abstraction forms in data abstraction systems, (2) highlight (or &#x0201c;pin&#x0201d;) the location of text in the PDF, and (3) copy text automatically from the PDF into the form.</p><p>We are conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare the relative effectiveness of (A) DAA-facilitated single abstraction plus verification, (B) traditional (non-DAA-facilitated) single abstraction plus verification, and (C) traditional independent dual abstraction plus adjudication on the accuracy and efficiency of abstraction. The objective of this manuscript is to describe the design of our RCT adhering to the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) evidence-based guideline for reporting protocols of RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Our searches of PubMed and <italic>The Cochrane Library</italic> up to August 26, 2016, did not identify any RCT or systematic review of RCTs that have compared the accuracy and efficiency of various data abstraction approaches.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>We have designed this study as a randomized, three-arm, crossover trial.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Recruitment</title><p>For this trial, we will use the Systematic Review Data Repository (SRDR) as the data abstraction system. SRDR, maintained by the Brown University EPC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://srdr.ahrq.gov/">http://srdr.ahrq.gov</ext-link>), is state-of-the-art, open-source, open-access, and available free of charge to anyone conducting a review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. We will utilize four strategies to identify and recruit potential abstractors: (1) emails to students who have registered for at least one course in systematic review methods through Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHBSPH) and Brown University; (2) emails to faculty and staff at Johns Hopkins and Brown EPCs; (3) advertising on the SRDR website; and (4) advertising through patient organizations such as Consumers United for Evidence-based Healthcare (CUE) and Cochrane Consumer Network (CCNet). CUE is a US-based coalition of health and patient advocacy organizations committed to empowering patients to make the best use of evidence-based healthcare (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://us.cochrane.org/CUE">http://us.cochrane.org/CUE</ext-link>). CCNet&#x02019;s primary role is to get patients around the world involved in the production of Cochrane reviews (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://consumers.cochrane.org/">http://consumers.cochrane.org</ext-link>). All potentially eligible abstractors are directed to the DAA Trial Data Abstractor Enrollment website (&#x0201c;Enrollment website&#x0201d;), the informational page for the trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://srdr.ahrq.gov/daa/info">http://srdr.ahrq.gov/daa/info</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Participant enrollment, training, and pairing</title><p>To mimic how individuals are often paired for data abstraction in real-world reviews, we will form pairs of abstractors consisting of one less experienced abstractor and one more experienced abstractor. The Enrollment website will ask participants to answer questions related to their eligibility and level of experience with abstraction for reviews. Based on the results of a pilot study (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>), we determined that the number of published reviews authored, dichotomized at fewer than 3 versus 3 or more, was best able to classify abstractors as &#x0201c;less&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;more&#x0201d; experienced with abstraction, respectively.</p><p>Once an abstractor is deemed to have met all eligibility criteria for the trial and has provided information regarding experience with abstraction, the Enrollment website will notify the abstractor that s/he is eligible for participation and, upon the click of a button, will direct the participant to the DAA Trial Informed Consent website (&#x0201c;Consent website&#x0201d;) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://srdr.ahrq.gov/daa/consent">http://srdr.ahrq.gov/daa/consent</ext-link>). The Consent website will automatically notify the Project Director regarding the names and email addresses of abstractors who have successfully provided informed consent.</p><p>Abstractors will be required to complete training in using SRDR and DAA before being paired and randomized. Once an abstractor has completed training, the Project Director pairs the abstractor with the next available abstractor, in chronological order, who has complementary abstraction experience (i.e., each pair will include one less experienced and one more experienced abstractor).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Randomization of pairs of abstractors</title><p>Abstractors will be randomized as pairs. Each pair will complete abstraction for six articles, two under each of the three approaches (A&#x02009;=&#x02009;DAA-facilitated single abstraction plus verification; B&#x02009;=&#x02009;traditional [non-DAA-facilitated] single abstraction plus verification; and C&#x02009;=&#x02009;traditional independent dual abstraction plus adjudication). This is to reduce possible contamination from the learning process and for ease of coordination. To maximize efficiency, we will use a crossover design such that each pair of abstractors will implement all three approaches being evaluated, with the intent of estimating differences within pairs. The six possible sequences are AABBCC, AACCBB, BBCCAA, BBAACC, CCAABB, and CCBBAA. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> lays out the assignment of 24 abstractor pairs to sequences (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6) and to reviews (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4). For further explanation of sample size calculation and review selection, see sections titled &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec23" ref-type="sec">Sample size and power calculation</xref>&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec15" ref-type="sec">Identification of studies and outcomes for abstraction during the trial</xref>&#x0201d;, respectively.

We have developed and pilot tested a separate data abstraction form compatible with SRDR for each of the four reviews (forms available upon request). We want the results of our trial to be broadly applicable across a wide range of review topics, and thus, the forms include recommended common data elements (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].

To determine errors for Approaches A and B, we will compare the verified data to data independently abstracted and adjudicated by two investigators with extensive abstraction experience (IJS and TL), which will be considered the &#x0201c;answer key&#x0201d;. In Approach C, both abstractors edit their own abstracted data during adjudication. To determine errors for Approach C, we will use the edited data from the more experienced abstractor. We will do this by using a computer program that automatically compares the selected/entered value of a given data item to the answer key value for that data item. An error is defined as any discrepancy or difference between an entry for a data item and the answer key value for that data item. We are interested in abstraction errors resulting from omission or incorrect abstraction. If participants abstract more data items than are in the answer key, the additional data items will not be considered as errors.</p><p>The total time taken to complete abstraction for a given article is defined as the sum of the time taken for initial abstraction(s) plus subsequent verification/adjudication. To measure time, we will use three strategies. First, the study data abstraction system (i.e., SRDR) will automatically record when each abstractor logs in and out of the system, including the time spent on each tab. It is possible that this time overestimates the true time spent on the tab if the abstractor steps away from the computer. Second, as part of the Design Tab of the abstraction form in SRDR, we will ask abstractors to record the self-timed duration (in minutes) that was spent abstracting data for the Design Tab. Third, we will ask each abstractor to record the time spent (in minutes) on each step of data abstraction for each article: initial abstraction, verification, and adjudication, recorded using an online survey tool (Qualtrics<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>). We will use the automatically recorded timestamps to calculate time whenever possible, but will corroborate these data with the latter two manual strategies to assess the accuracy of our assessment of time.</p><p>To explore the impact of errors on results of meta-analyses, we also will conduct an exploratory descriptive analysis of differences among the meta-analytic estimates and 95% confidence intervals based on data derived from Approaches A, B, and C compared with those using the answer keys.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Statistical methods</title><sec id="Sec19"><title>Statistical analysis&#x02014;overview</title><p>All analyses will be conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle. We will document any protocol deviations and violations. We will compute summary error rates and time statistics for each approach, abstractor pair, review, and article, by type of question (questions in the Design Tab, Baseline Tab, or the Outcomes and Results Tabs). We expect each of our primary outcomes (error rate and time) to vary by six factors; we have included these factors as covariates in the statistical model for analyzing each of the primary outcomes. These factors include question type (design, baseline, results), abstractor pair (1 to 24), abstraction sequence (1 to 6), abstraction approach (A, B, C), article (1 to 48), and review from which articles were obtained (1 to 4). We will define errors for each data item as a binary variable (correct/incorrect) and time as a continuous variable. We will analyze error rates using logistic regression and time using linear regression.

For determining necessary sample sizes, we make the simplifying assumption that the error rates and abstraction time per article will not depend on pair, sequence, or review. We consider this trial as having a crossover design in which each of the 48 articles is abstracted three times, once under each abstraction approach.</p><p>In our pilot study, we found that the proportion of items incorrectly abstracted by inexperienced abstractors was 24% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. If an experienced reviewer caught and corrected&#x000a0;half of these errors, the error rate would be reduced to 12%; this is what we used in sample size and power calculations for Approach B. We assume that DAA-facilitated single abstraction plus verification (Approach A) would reduce the error rate relative to traditional single abstraction plus verification (Approach B), but perhaps not relative to independent dual abstraction plus adjudication (Approach C). Given the expected error rate, we want to be able to estimate the difference in error rate to within 1 or 2% in order to be able to determine which approach is meaningfully more accurate. For example, with an error rate of 12% for Approach B, we will be able to detect a statistically significant difference between Approaches A and B if Approach A&#x02019;s error is less than 10%.</p><p>Using the error rate as the outcome for calculating sample size, we would expect a standard deviation for a 100-item form to be about 3% (exact if the proportion were 9%).

The standard error for the difference in a crossover trial when comparing two approaches with 24 units each receiving each approach in one of two sequences, given a standard deviation per unit of 3%, ranges from 0.125%, when <italic>&#x003c1;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0,&#x02009;to 0%, when <italic>&#x003c1;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1, decreasing linearly. Thus, even if measurements are uncorrelated (i.e., <italic>&#x003c1;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0), our design would be able to detect a very small difference between error rates.</p><p>Likewise, we might assume that Approach A would reduce the total time needed to abstract data relative to Approaches B and C, and we would want to estimate this within a few minutes in order to determine meaningful differences in efficiency. The same calculation shows that even with independent measurements, the standard error of the difference between the average times for two different approaches would be no more than <italic>&#x003c3;</italic>/24,&#x02009;which would be less than 2&#x000a0;min for <italic>&#x003c3;</italic> as large as 48&#x000a0;min (48&#x000a0;min is much longer than we would expect for the amount of data to be abstracted and the length of the articles).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Confidentiality</title><p>We will not share trial data until the trial is completed and primary analyses are done. There are no personally identifying markers for participants in the data we collect. A file linking participant names with the assigned abstraction sequence will be accessible only to the Project Director and saved on a password-protected server maintained by JHBSPH. The server is backed up daily. We will archive trial documentation and electronic data files at the end of the trial and will retain them for at least 10&#x000a0;years. Because data abstracted in SRDR are associated with the abstractor&#x02019;s name, we do not plan on allowing open access to the abstracted data in SRDR. However, upon request, we can make the exported de-identified abstracted data available after the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Publications and dissemination</title><p>All investigators will collaborate to disseminate trial results through manuscripts and presentations at scientific meetings. Authorship and roles in preparation of the manuscripts will be decided ahead of time and agreed by all concerned. PCORI, the funder of this trial, will convene an independent team to peer review the final report of the project and will post the finalized report on the PCORI website.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Discussion</title><p>Current approaches to data abstraction have resulted in a large resource burden on those conducting systematic reviews; however, efforts to reduce the burden may lead to errors in abstraction. These errors could lead to inaccurate conclusions derived in reviews and, consequently, healthcare decisions that are based on faulty evidence summaries. The very foundation of evidence-based healthcare is challenged when one of its three underlying tenets (<italic>best-available research evidence</italic>, clinician expertise, and patient values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]) is compromised.</p><sec id="Sec27"><title>Challenges in designing the trial</title><p>The first challenge in designing this trial was to identify four reviews from which we could meet our target of identifying 12 appropriate RCTs each. Many of the reviews we selected initially could not be used because the outcomes were poorly defined in the reviews and, in some instances, meta-analyses in the reviews combined data from RCTs inappropriately. Ultimately, after ruling out various topics, we identified four suitable topics and reviews.</p><p>The second challenge was deriving the answer keys for all 48 articles. Two experienced abstractors on our investigator team (IJS and TL) abstracted data from all 48 articles. However, to be able to truly evaluate abstraction &#x0201c;errors&#x0201d; by abstractors during the trial, we needed to develop instructions and unambiguous language to clearly articulate every question and every answer option on every abstraction form for use during the trial. Ambiguous articulation of these entities on our forms could have led to information bias in a primary outcome of the DAA trial if the abstraction errors resulted not from omission or incorrect abstraction, but rather an abstractor&#x02019;s misunderstanding of the abstraction requested.</p><p>To reduce the abstraction process learning curve, we are restricting the trial to individuals with at least some experience with data abstraction for systematic reviews. Another limitation is that, unlike many real-world reviews, we are not allowing resolution of abstraction discrepancies by a third abstractor.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Strengths of the trial design</title><p>This trial has many strengths. First, it tests a novel software application (DAA) designed to make the data abstraction process more accurate and efficient. In addition, used in conjunction with a data abstraction system such as SRDR, DAA would maintain an annotated version of the data abstracted for easy access when the same or another systematic review team updates the review at a later date. Second, using a rigorous and efficient crossover design with random allocation and allocation concealment, this trial tests the effectiveness of the software application vis-&#x000e0;-vis two currently recommended best practice approaches to abstraction. Third, we are collaborating with patient/consumer co-investigators as the trial moves forward, in designing the trial and identifying the review topics, study articles, and outcomes for use during abstraction. Finally, the generalizability of the trial is likely to be high because of the broad eligibility criteria for abstractors from multiple locations with various types of background and levels of experience with abstraction during reviews.</p><p>In summary, current standards for data abstraction, a key step during systematic reviews, rest on a weak evidence base. Our trial represents a potentially substantial step forward in the quest to reduce errors in data abstraction. The trial will rigorously evaluate whether a novel software application (DAA) could help the systematic review community efficiently use scarce research resources. Because systematic reviews are a key component of comparative effectiveness research, our results could help improve patient care by reducing errors in the synthesis of research evidence that informs that care.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec29"><title>Additional files</title><p>
