However, it remains unclear if the addition of IMT to a general exercise training programme leads to additional clinically relevant improvements in patients with COPD.

Patients in both groups will follow a 3&#x02005;month general exercise training programme, in combination with home-based IMT. IMT will be performed with a recently developed device (POWERbreathe KH1). This device applies an inspiratory load that is provided by an electronically controlled valve (variable flow resistive load). The intervention group (n=85) will undertake an IMT programme at a high intensity (&#x02265;50% of their P<sub>i,max</sub>), whereas the placebo group (n=85) will undertake IMT at a low training intensity (&#x02264;10% of P<sub>i,max</sub>). Total daily IMT time for both groups will be 21&#x02005;min (6 cycles of 30 breaths). Improvement in the 6&#x02005;min walking distance will be the primary outcome.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> COPD is characterised by persistent expiratory flow limitation which is usually progressive.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> Dyspnoea is the most prominent exercise-limiting symptom of the disease,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> which leads to chronic avoidance of physical activities. Consequently, low-physical activity levels contribute to skeletal muscle deconditioning and exercise capacity reduction, which impact negatively on health-related quality of life.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> Inspiratory muscle dysfunction is another extrapulmonary manifestation, which is often present in patients with COPD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> It contributes to hypoxaemia, hypercapnia, dyspnoea and decreased exercise tolerance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9 R10 R11">9&#x02013;11</xref> Pulmonary rehabilitation including exercise training, education, nutritional intervention and psychosocial support is a standard care for patients with COPD to counteract extrapulmonary disease manifestations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) has also been applied frequently and is extensively studied in recent years in patients with COPD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> From meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with COPD, it can been concluded that IMT as a stand-alone therapy improves inspiratory muscle function (strength and endurance), decreases symptoms of dyspnoea and improves exercise capacity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> The value of IMT as an add-on to a general exercise training programme is, however, still under debate.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16 R17 R18 R19">16&#x02013;19</xref> While IMT always results in significant improvements in inspiratory muscle function, its additional effects on more clinically relevant outcomes (eg, functional exercise capacity and quality of life) are insufficiently supported by scientific evidence so far.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> From subgroup analyses in the most recent meta-analysis, it was concluded that significant additional effects of IMT on more clinically relevant outcomes are more likely to be found in patients with inspiratory muscle weakness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> This was previously defined as a maximal inspiratory mouth pressure (P<sub>i,max</sub>) of less than 60&#x02005;cm&#x02005;H<sub>2</sub>O.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> It has therefore been recommended that future studies in patients with COPD should focus specifically on patients with more pronounced inspiratory muscle weakness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> It was recently shown that adjunctive IMT led to significantly greater functional improvements in a well-designed RCT in patients with chronic heart failure selected for inspiratory muscle weakness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> Comparable RCTs in patients with COPD are so far lacking.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> We are therefore carrying out a large, adequately powered, multicentre RCT on the effects of IMT as an adjunct therapy to a general exercise training programme in patients with COPD with inspiratory muscle weakness. Recommendations on the use of IMT as an adjunct to general exercise training in these patients in international guidelines are ambiguous.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> The outcome of this study will therefore have a direct impact on clinical practice, as the results will clarify whether adjunctive IMT leads to superior clinically relevant improvements for patients with COPD. Functional outcomes of relevance to patients (exercise capacity, quality of life, participation in daily physical activity and symptoms) were therefore chosen as the main outcomes.</p><p>One of the hypotheses that links enhanced inspiratory muscle function to improvements in exercise capacity is that IMT should allow the respiratory system of patients with COPD to work more comfortably at high lung volumes during exercise.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> In the present study, we will use a recently developed IMT device that applies a variable resistance provided by an electronically controlled valve (variable flow resistive load). In contrast to the traditionally applied threshold loading, this variable flow resistive load is specifically challenging the inspiratory muscles at higher lung volumes, and may lead to larger training effects in patients with COPD who develop dynamic hyperinflation during exercise. Besides these potentially beneficial characteristics of the applied load, another advantage of the device is the ability to store home-based training data for up to 40 sessions. Continuous registrations of pressure and flow at 500&#x02005;Hz provide data on the external work of breathing and enable the verification of quantity as well as quality of unsupervised training sessions. The latter is of particular importance since 85% of the training sessions during this RCT will be performed by patients at their homes without supervision.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Aims</title><p>This study will examine the effects of adding a well-controlled, high-intensity IMT programme to a 3-month general exercise training programme, using a large, multicentre, randomised controlled design, in patients with COPD and inspiratory muscle weakness. Outcomes will be exercise capacity (primary outcome), inspiratory muscle function, health-related quality of life (HRQL) and participation in daily physical activity.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Hypotheses</title><p>We hypothesise that the addition of IMT to a general exercise training programme in patients with COPD and inspiratory muscle weakness will result in superior improvements exercise capacity, inspiratory muscle function, HRQL and daily physical activity, compared with general exercise training alone.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients</title><p>All patients with spirometry-proven COPD who are referred for outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation will be screened for inclusion.

Exclusion criteria consist of (1) diagnosed psychiatric or cognitive disorders; (2) progressive neurological or neuromuscular disorders; (3) severe orthopaedic problems having a major impact on daily activities and (4) previous inclusion in rehabilitation programme (&#x0003c;1&#x02005;year).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study design</title><p>Patients will be informed about the study protocol prior to the start of the rehabilitation programme. Informed consent will be obtained at that time. Patients will be randomised into an intervention and a placebo group.

All tests will be performed by experienced investigators who are blinded to group allocation. To ensure consistency between the centres, all assessments will be performed according to the instructions agreed upon and described in a manual of procedures and an instructional video, even if they may differ slightly from usual local procedures. To further improve the consistency, the five centres will regularly receive a newsletter to update them on the progress of the study and to share eventual technical problems between centres. Staff from all participating centres will be able to contact the coordinating centre in Leuven by email or telephone in case they should have any questions concerning the study.</p><p>To detect a minimally clinically important difference between groups of 26&#x02005;m in the 6&#x02005;min walking distance (6MWD),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> assuming a SD of the within group differences in the 6MWD at the end of the intervention period of 60&#x02005;m in both groups with a degree of certainty (statistical power) of 80% and a risk for a type 1 error (&#x003b1;) &#x0003c;5%, a sample size for both groups of 85 patients is needed, given an anticipated dropout rate of 30%. This study will therefore be performed as a multicentre RCT to ensure the inclusion of 170 patients within a time frame of 2&#x02005;years. Besides the lead centre at the University Hospital in Leuven, Belgium, patients will also be recruited in the University Hospital Gent, Belgium; Sch&#x000f6;n Klinik Berchtesgadener Land, Germany; University Hospital Nijmegen, the Netherlands; and Laval University Quebec, Canada. Each of the five centres is expected to include between 30 and 40 patients within the 2-year inclusion period.</p><p>In accordance with the Belgian law relating to experiments on humans dated 7 May, 2004, KU/UZ Leuven shall assume, even without fault, the responsibility of any damages incurred by a subject which linked directly or indirectly to participation in the study, and shall therefore provide compensation through its insurance programme.

Patients will perform cycling, treadmill walking, stair climbing, arm ergometry and resistance training of arm as well as leg muscles.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> Training frequency will be three sessions per week, resulting in a total of 36 training sessions. Duration of the training session will increase from 40&#x02013;60&#x02005;min at the start of the programme to 60&#x02013;90&#x02005;min after 3&#x02005;months. Patients will perform endurance training or interval training at moderate to high intensity (initially 60&#x02013;70% of maximal workload). The overall training intensity will be increased gradually during the course of the programme using a CR10 Borg Scale rating of 4&#x02013;6 on dyspnoea sensation or leg effort as a means of maintaining training overload.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> Physiotherapists providing this intervention will be blinded to group allocation of patients.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Inspiratory muscle training programme</title><p>Patients will receive either high-intensity IMT (&#x02018;strength training&#x02019;=intervention group) or low-intensity placebo IMT (&#x02018;endurance training&#x02019;=placebo group). The training load in this study will be adjusted according to data from a previously performed pilot study about a home-based, high-intensity IMT programme in patients with COPD with inspiratory muscle weakness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> Total daily training time for both groups will be 21&#x02005;min, consisting of 6 cycles of 30 breaths (2 cycles, 3 times daily in the intervention group or 3 cycles, 2 times daily in the control group). There will be approximately 3.5&#x02005;min of resistive breathing during every cycle, each followed by 1&#x02005;min of resting. Patients will train 7&#x02005;days/week, for 12&#x02005;weeks using the Powerbreathe KH1 device (POWERbreatheKH1, HaB International Ltd, Southam, UK). This handheld device applies a variable resistance provided by an electronically controlled valve (variable flow resistive load). Loading is maintained at the same relative intensity throughout the breath, by reducing the absolute load to accommodate the pressure&#x02013;volume relationship of the inspiratory muscles. The application of a tapered load allows patients to get close to maximal inspiration, even at high-training intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2013003101F1">figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2013003101F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Comparison between constant threshold (threshold) and variable resistive inspiratory muscle training (POWERbreathe KH1).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2013003101f01"/></fig><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2013003101F1">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref> illustrates a comparison of a single breath (training at an intensity of 60% P<sub>i,max</sub>) using a conventional constant threshold loading device, with that of a variable flow resistive loading device (POWERbreathe KH1).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> It is apparent from this figure that, in contrast to the threshold loading, the variable flow resistive load overloads the inspiratory muscles at higher lung volumes. Since one of the hypotheses that links enhanced inspiratory muscle function to improvements in exercise capacity is that IMT may allow the respiratory system of patients with COPD to work more comfortably at high lung volumes during exercise,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> we hypothesise that this variable flow resistive IMT should be better suited to reduce inspiratory effort (P<sub>es</sub>/P<sub>i,max</sub>) during whole body exercise. Besides these hypothetically beneficial characteristics of the applied load, a further advantage of the electronic leading device is the ability to store parameters of up to 40 IMT sessions. Continuous registrations of pressure and flow at 500&#x02005;Hz provide data on the external work of breathing and enable us to control quantity as well as quality of unsupervised training sessions. This is of special importance since 85% of the training sessions during this RCT will be performed by patients at their homes without supervision. The device stores data on average mean pressure (cm&#x02005;H<sub>2</sub>O), average mean power per breath (watt), average peak flow per breath (L/s) and total work of breathing during one session of 30 breaths (joules). Patients will be instructed to perform fast and forceful inspirations and will be encouraged to achieve maximal inhalation and exhalation with every breath. This breathing pattern will be supported by acoustic signals from the loading device.</p><p>The intervention group will start training at 40% of their initial P<sub>i,max</sub>. Intermediate measurements of P<sub>i,max</sub> will be performed every week. These P<sub>i,max</sub> values will be used to calculate the training load to be implemented the following week. In other words, the training load in each week will be increased continuously over time by adjusting to at least 50% of the P<sub>i,max</sub> value recorded in the previous week. Rates of perceived inspiratory effort on a modified CR10 Borg Scale (4&#x02013;6 of 10) will also be used to support decisions on training load increments. The control group will train at an inspiratory load of 10% of their initial P<sub>i,max</sub>. This training intensity will not be changed during the study period. Each week, three training sessions will be performed under supervision at the outpatient clinic. During these supervised sessions, the results of unsupervised sessions will be evaluated and patients will receive instructions and feedback on their training efforts. Resting periods will be given as needed as long as the patients are able to complete the full volume of training prescribed.
