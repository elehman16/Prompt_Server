We found that ketamine, as compared to the control, significantly decreased cocaine self-administration by 67% relative to baseline at greater than 24 hours post-infusion, the most robust reduction observed to date in human cocaine users and the first to involve mechanisms other than stimulant or dopamine agonist effects.

It is now recognized that repeated drug consumption may evolve into problematic use by precipitating sustained neural adaptations.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> These adaptations are thought to originate in neuroplastic alterations in striatal and prefrontal glutamate neurotransmission,<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and have been hypothesized to be implicated in several functional alterations in individuals with substance use disorders, such as abnormal glutamate homeostasis in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), impaired prefrontal modulation of mesolimbic structures (e.g., amygdala and nucleus accumbens: NAcc), and disruptions in dopamine signaling in the NAcc.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Vulnerabilities associated with these alterations, and that may contribute to problematic use, include reduced sensitivity to non-drug rewards, heightened motivation for drug use (craving), compulsive drug-seeking to override diminished subjective drug effects, poor impulse control, delay discounting (diminishing the value of a reward if delayed), and heightened reactivity to cravings, drug cues, and stress.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p id="P3">Though these adaptations have been studied extensively with cocaine in laboratory animals, they have been resistant to pharmacotherapy in human research. Further, despite decades of research, there remain no consistently effective medications for cocaine use disorders. Modulation of the <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), the main glutamate receptor involved in neural plasticity, disrupts the reinforcing effects of cocaine in rodents,<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> but comparable modulators have proven ineffective in humans.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> In addition, preliminary data indicate that infusing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) into the medial prefrontal cortex of mice disrupts cocaine use, perhaps by promoting neuroplasticity to reverse drug-related adaptations.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> In preclinical human research, however, the only agents found to reduce cocaine self-administration, albeit modestly, are stimulants such as modafinil and amphetamine,<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> consistent with existing data (e.g., for opioids) concerning the effect of agonists on self-administration.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p id="P4">Recent clinical research with the NMDAR antagonist ketamine, a widely used dissociative anesthetic, indicates that a single sub-anesthetic intravenous (i.v.) infusion produces rapid relief for depressive and anxiety disorders, with the therapeutic response continuing to grow in magnitude after all metabolites have cleared and generally peaking at 24-72 hours.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> This unique effect has been attributed to the promotion of prefrontal neural plasticity via downstream mechanisms involving BDNF and other factors,<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> as well as sustained modulatory benefits such as improvement of ACC glutamate homeostasis and attenuation of functional network hyperconnectivity.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Preliminary data indicate that these mechanisms may also extend to addressing the adaptations associated with drug dependence, with a single sub-anesthetic ketamine infusion found to rapidly improve two dependence-related vulnerabilities by self-assessment: low motivation for non-drug rewards and high cue-induced craving.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In the absence of behavioral data, however, it is not possible to conclude whether these effects on motivation and craving represent new evidence that ketamine targets dependence-related deficits, or whether they constitute an extension of its recognized impact on comparable subjective states, such as anxiety or dysphoria.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p id="P5">To expand on these data, we modified an established laboratory model of drug self-administration to assess the effect of ketamine on cocaine use.

We predicted that ketamine, compared to an active control, would significantly decrease the number of cocaine choices, ranging from 0 to 5, ascertained at around 28 hours post-infusion, a time-point at which its psychiatric efficacy generally peaks and long after active metabolites and psychoactive effects have cleared.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Other aims pertained to the persistent effects of ketamine on reactivity, and on craving and drug use in the natural ecology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Overview</title><p id="P6">20 non-depressed, cocaine dependent individuals disinterested in treatment or abstinence completed this crossover trial approved by the New York State Psychiatric Institutional Review Board (NCT02596022). After understanding research risks and providing informed consent, participants were hospitalized up to 3 times in a controlled research unit for 6 days at a time, and each hospitalization was separated by two weeks to account for carry-over effects and to assess cocaine use in the natural ecology. Each 6-day hospitalization involved 1) an initial 2-day washout period; 2) a 28-minute &#x0201c;sample session&#x0201d; on Day 3 when 2 obligatory free-base cocaine doses (25 mg) were smoked to allow for assignment of value to the research cocaine and to intensify craving; 3) a 52-minute i.v. infusion on Day 4; 4) a 70-minute &#x0201c;choice session&#x0201d; of 5 choices (25 mg cocaine vs. $11) on Day 5; and 5) discharge on Day 6. During the first hospitalization, participants received an infusion of normal saline so as to identify, and exclude from research, individuals who do not robustly choose cocaine prior to the active infusions (&#x02264;2 choices). In the second and third hospitalizations, participants were randomized (1:1) to counter-balanced orderings of 52-minute sub-anesthetic infusions of ketamine (0.71 mg/kg) or of the active control midazolam (0.025 mg/kg) under double-blind conditions. The study was powered to detect a difference of at least 1 cocaine choice between active conditions by paired <italic>t</italic>-test. No psychotherapy or behavioral treatment was provided.</p></sec><sec id="S4" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p id="P7">We recruited participants by word of mouth, advertising, and referral.

Applicants were considered eligible if they were medically healthy, non-treatment seeking cocaine dependent individuals who met minimum use criteria (at least two occasions of free-base cocaine use a week, at greater than $40 each time), who were between the ages of 21 and 55, and who did not have a history of abuse of or adverse reaction to ketamine or benzodiazepines. Individuals with physiological dependence on certain other substances (opioids, alcohol, benzodiazepines), with a history of psychotic or dissociative symptoms, with current depressive or anxiety symptoms indicative of a DSM-IV disorder<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, with a first-degree family history of psychosis, with obesity (BMI &#x0003e; 35), or with cardiovascular or pulmonary disease were excluded.

A Pyrex tube fitted with a mesh filter served as the smoking implement, or &#x0201c;stem.&#x0201d; Stems were constructed to function as uniformly as possible, with only negligible differences in the density and tightness of the mesh. Self-administration procedures occurred in the same room and at around the same time of day. Efforts were taken to control other variables (e.g., amount of sleep; receipt of auxiliary medications; interactions with staff; food, cigarette, and caffeine consumption) that might impact on cocaine use and choice behavior.</p><p id="P11">Two cocaine doses (25mg) were administered starting at 1 pm on Day 3 of each hospitalization, following a 2-day washout period. This session was intended to allow participants to sample and assign value to the research cocaine, to prepare participants for the choice session, and to heighten cocaine craving. On Day 5, participants underwent a session of five choices (25 mg of free-base cocaine or $11), starting at about 2 pm (around 28 hours post-infusion). $11 at discharge has been determined in previous trials to be of comparable value to the 25 mg dose of cocaine<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>; earned money was provided at discharge from the inpatient laboratory on Day 6.</p><p id="P12">All cocaine administrations occurred fourteen minutes apart, and strict precautions were in place to ensure that participants were safe to receive initial and subsequent doses. The choice to use cocaine or receive money was ascertained at the beginning of the session and at seven minutes into the 14-minute interval between cocaine administrations. The design of the study made it unlikely that there were any drug-drug interactions between cocaine and ketamine or midazolam, the active metabolites of which have short half-lives (1, 3, and 6 hours, respectively) and short-lived effects. Various ratings occurred after each dose was administered. Levels of craving and arousal were also assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS) every four minutes between choices or drug administrations.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Infusion Procedures</title><p id="P13">In addition to the sham infusion in Inpatient Phase 1 (saline over 52 minutes), two counter-balanced active infusions were administered, each on Day 4 of Inpatient Phases 2 and 3. The sham infusion was provided initially so as to identify, and exclude from continuing in the study, participants who do not choose cocaine at least 3 times in the absence of the two study conditions. Choice behavior following the sham infusion also served as the baseline for determining the percent reduction in cocaine self-administration for the active conditions. So as to minimize risk, all infusions were given in a highly controlled inpatient setting. Blinded staff was involved with infusion administration and intravenous placement.</p><p id="P14">Patients were not exposed to cocaine in the 24 hours prior to the infusion and did not eat from the midnight before so as to reduce the risk of nausea, adverse interactions, and aspiration. Participants were informed throughout the study that they may possibly receive any of various substances at each infusion, including amantadine, buspirone, d-cycloserine, ketamine, lorazepam, memantine, methamphetamine, saline, or any combination of these. This blinding procedure is intended to disguise what drug is specifically given so as to minimize expectancy effects.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Similarly, it aimed to minimize the risk that participants would clearly identify the medications that were administered.</p><p id="P15">Active control (2-min saline bolus followed by midazolam 0.025 mg/kg in saline infused over 50 minutes) or ketamine hydrochloride (0.11 mg/kg 2-min bolus followed by 0.60 mg/kg in saline over 50 minutes) were prepared and packaged for slow-drip infusion by the NYSPI pharmacy, and administered at around 11 am on day 4. The dose of ketamine was selected on the basis of published reports suggesting that it was well tolerated.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> It was also the highest dose tolerated by participants in our preliminary studies.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Midazolam was chosen as the active control because it produces a mild change in consciousness, further obscuring the distinction between conditions so as to ensure blinding, and because of its short half-life, without any known persistent (&#x0003e; 8 hours) effect on cue reactivity or cocaine dependence.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Blood pressure, heart rate, and blood oxygen saturation were continuously monitored.

First, our participants were not simply cocaine users exceeding minimum use criteria; they also met DSM-IV criteria for cocaine dependence. Prior laboratory-based research has focused almost entirely on cocaine users who met minimum use criteria without necessarily meeting diagnostic criteria for dependence.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Alongside leading to a diagnostically heterogeneous population, these selection criteria might compromise the evaluation of medication effects because non-dependent participants may not exhibit the vulnerabilities that are being targeted. Second, unlike the majority of prior research, we introduced at the beginning of the trial a single-blind sham condition (distinct from the active control provided subsequently) to ascertain baseline cocaine self-administration, and to exclude from further participation individuals who do not robustly choose cocaine. This design decision, like the first, was intended to ensure that the study population demonstrated impairment.</p><p id="P31">Given the robustness of the disruption in cocaine use at 28 hours post-ketamine, it is possible that this effect would have been apparent more acutely, as has been observed with the anti-depressant response,<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> though this was not tested in favor of assessing relatively persistent benefits. These sustained reductions in drug use, observed after all ketamine metabolites were expected to be excreted, resembles the persistence of its effects on mood and anxiety,<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and suggests involvement of similar down-stream pro-plasticity and modulatory mechanisms.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> These similarities may be interpreted to support the emerging hypothesis that certain neural adaptations are shared by affective, stress-related and substance use disorders,<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> despite variability in their development and expression, and that pharmacotherapy aimed at addressing these common deficits, such as ketamine, may be effective for different disorders. Preclinical research with rodents provides preliminary evidence that the anti-depressant and anti-addiction effects of ketamine involve similar mechanisms; ketamine has been shown to mitigate distress related to amphetamine withdrawal by normalizing NAcc dopamine neurotransmission through down-stream activity,<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> and to disrupt alcohol consumption via a neuroplastic mechanism involving mammalian target of rapamycin,<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> which has also been identified as a critical pathway for the effect of ketamine on depression.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Research is needed to elucidate the differences in pathophysiology of drug- and stress-related adaptations so as to more effectively target their diverse psychiatric and behavioral manifestations, and to further clarify the mechanisms by which ketamine disrupts problematic drug use.</p><p id="P32">Though its rapid and apparently persistent effects suggest a role in initiating abstinence, it remains to be determined how ketamine might be feasibly integrated into the treatment of substance use disorders. Decades ago, intramuscular ketamine showed promise for alcohol and opioid problems in the context of a &#x0201c;psychedelic psychotherapy&#x0201d; aimed at utilizing its psychoactive effects therapeutically.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Ketamine has since demonstrated abuse liability given these hallucinogenic effects,<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> but this risk is substantially minimized by the slow-drip i.v. route and administration in medical contexts.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Safety may be further optimized by embedding the infusion into a framework aimed at managing its psychoactive properties,<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> or by developing comparable compounds associated with diminished abuse liability.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup></p><p id="P33">Sustaining efficacy represents another challenge. Serial infusions or maintenance medications extending the neurobiological activity of ketamine might be helpful.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> A behavioral treatment platform may also be important for further targeting dependence-related deficits and facilitating behavioral modification. Relapse prevention treatment, for example, emphasizes developing non-reactivity to drug cravings and impulses,<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> and may serve to leverage ketamine effects into persistent behavioral changes. Therefore, alongside proposing a novel medication strategy with unprecedented benefits for cocaine use disorders, these findings suggest new approaches for integrated medication-behavioral treatments, and provide promise for better addressing a disabling group of disorders often refractory to available interventions. Research is needed to replicate these findings, extend them to clinical settings, and elucidate the mechanisms by which ketamine ameliorates dependence-related vulnerabilities.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S17"><p>The authors thank NIDA for funding this study through grants DA035472 and DA031771 awarded to Dr. Dakwar.
