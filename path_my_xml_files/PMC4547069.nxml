strain for health services<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Specialized human resources and adjuvant
therapies are needed, which are frequently adopted for lengthy treatment. In addition,
this type of lesion often affects the patient's functional capacity, causing
multidimensional consequences - social, psychological, financial<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>.</p><p>Venous ulcers represent the most advanced stage of chronic venous insufficiency. The
global prevalence rate ranges between 0.5 and 2%, and surpasses 4% in individuals over
65 years of age. Incidence rates vary between two and five new cases per thousand people
per year<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>.</p><p>Studies developed in recent years have contributed to an important increase in the
availability of new wound healing products<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. Papain dressings have been studied in
different formulations and concentrations as an option in venous ulcer treatment<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>.</p><p>In a systematic review aimed at analyzing evidence on the use of papain in the wound
healing process, the results appointed the lack of a standard form and presentation to
use the product, besides the predominance of low-quality research according to the
international assessment scales, indicating the need to develop research with stricter
methods for the sake of a more precise assessment of the effectiveness of papain in the
tissue repair process<sup>11</sup>.</p><p>The study objective was to assess the effectiveness of 2% papain gel compared to 2%
carboxymethyl cellulose in the treatment of chronic venous ulcer patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial (RCCT) was developed at a specialized outpatient
clinic in wound treatment of a teaching hospital in the State of Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil.</p><p>The consecutive sample consisted of all male and female individuals who complied with
the inclusion criteria, which were: age &#x02265;18 years; presence of one or more venous leg
ulcers with a minimum length of six weeks; indication to use 2% papain gel and 2%
carboxymethyl cellulose gel; demonstrate understanding of the health team's orientations
to guarantee the continuity of the treatment at home or having a legal responsible to do
so; availability to visit the clinic once per week; being regularly registered at the
institution where the research was undertaken.</p><p>Patients were excluded in the following cases: infected ulcer, associated with
erysipelas, cellulitis or lymphangitis, ulcer with the presence of devitalized tissue
covering the entire wound bed; with circular lower-limb lesions, with non-palpable
distal pulse; without appropriate conditions to store the products at home; patients
with a background history of alcoholism or psychiatric diseases, individuals allergic to
any of the products used in the research and/or to latex; patients with liver and/or
kidney problems.</p><p>The criteria for discontinuity were: presence of wound infection during follow-up, use
of another product on the wound than that proposed in the research, occurrence of severe
adverse events and not participating in weekly outpatient appointments.</p><p>The patients were recruited between April and November 2013 and monitored between April
2013 and January 2014.</p><p>The initial research sample consisted of 21 randomized volunteers allocated to two
groups, 11 in the Trial Group and 10 in the Control Group. Three participants were lost
due to absence from the weekly outpatient consultations, resulting in a sample of 18
patients, 10 in the Trial Group and 8 in the Control Group.</p><p>The patients who agreed to participate in the study and signed the Informed Consent Form
were randomized and allocated to two groups: Trial Group (TG) and Control Group (CG). In
the Trial Group, the ulcer dressing was applied using 2% papain gel and, in the Control
Group, the product used was 2% carboxymethyl cellulose gel. For the sake of
randomization, a research collaborator used a table with random figures. The study
participants were only informed about which group the patient would be allocated to at
the moment of each volunteer's first consultation.</p><p>In those situations when the patient had more than one lesion, all injuries were treated
with the same product, according to the patient's allocation in the study.</p><p>The 2% papain gel was formulated using papain, EDTA, propylene glycol, carbopol 940,
preservatives and purified water. The formula of the 2% carboxymethyl cellulose gel
contained carboxymethyl cellulose, propylene glycol, preservatives and purified water.
The products used in the research were developed at the university pharmacy.</p><p>The primary research outcome was the reduction in the lesion area, assessed by means of
manual planimetrics to calculate the area in square centimeters. Digital photographic
records were used as a complementary technique to assess the injury. The secondary
outcomes were the reduction of the devitalized tissue in the wound bed and the reduction
of the amount of exudate.</p><p>To assess the wounds, the Assessment Protocol for Clients with Tissue Injuries was used,
an instrument used at the outpatient clinic which resulted from a research<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. According to the protocol, the type of tissue
was classified as granulation, epithelialization, slough and coagulation necrosis, and
the amount of each tissue was registered as: absent; between 1 and 25%; between 26 and
50%; between 51 and 75% and between 76 and 100% of the total lesion area. To assess the
effectiveness of the product to treat the lesions, the amount of each tissue was
compared in the first and final week of follow-up.</p><p>As regards the exudate, the amount was assessed as: absent, when the wound bed was dry;
little, when the wound bed was moist and involved drainage of at least 25% of the
dressing; moderate, when the wound bed was saturated and the drainage involved between
25 and 75% of the dressing; and great, when the wound bed was covered with fluid and the
drainage involved more than 75% of the dressing<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>.</p><p>The participants were assessed weekly and the planimetric records and photograph of the
lesion were taken every two weeks. During the first visit, the data were collected on
the patient's sociodemographic and health conditions. The researchers changed the
dressing once per week at the wound clinic and the patients changed it daily at home. To
apply the dressing at home, the patients received preliminary orientations, including
information leaflets, on the dressing, storage and transportation of the products. Two
nurse researchers performed the procedures for the two treatment groups.</p><p>The patients from the Trial and Control Groups received the material needed for the
daily dressing change, the "dressing kit". This kit included a tube with 2% papain gel
or 2% carboxymethyl cellulose gel, gauze, bandage, adhesive tape, 0.9% saline solution,
soothing solution for the skin surrounding the lesion and a recipient to transport the
product.</p><p>The length of the follow-up was 77 days/12 weeks, defined based on the mean number of
days of international clinical experimental trials involving chronic ulcer
patients<sup>15-16</sup>.</p><p>The blinding of the participants and researchers was compromised due to the product
characteristics, such as refrigeration of the papain gel at 4&#x000ba;C and maintenance of the
carboxymethyl cellulose gel at room temperature. The evaluators of the result, who
carried out the statistical analysis of the data, were blinded.</p><p>The chi-square test (c<sup>2)</sup> for binomial variables was applied. The Friedman
test was used for the association between an ordinal and a nominal variable for samples
with more than two measures. In case of association between one ordinal and another
dichotomous variable, the Mann-Whitney test was used for non-paired data and the
Wilcoxon test for paired data. Mean posts were used to calculate the lesion area and
multiple comparisons were made between the posts, considering different pairs of
treatment weeks. The lesion areas were compared between the treatment weeks.
Significance was set at 5%.</p><p>The research received approval from the Institutional Review Board at the Medical
School, Hospital Universit&#x000e1;rio Antonio Pedro, Faculdade Fluminense de Medicina under

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref> illustrates that the area was reduced in
62.5% of the lesions in the Trial Group, with two wounds (12.5%) that healed completely.
In 37.5% of the ulcer, the area increased at the end of the treatment. In the Control
Group, the area was reduced in 50% of the lesions, increased in 33.3% and 16.7%
maintained the same area that existed at the start of the treatment.</p><p>As regards the secondary outcomes, the slough tissue, unfavorable to healing, showed a
statistically significant reduction between the first and the 12<sup>th</sup> week of
treatment, in the Trial Group (p-value=0.001) as well as in the Control Group
(p-value=0.004). The granulation tissue, which can heal, showed a significant increase
between the first and twelfth week of treatment in the Trial Group (p-value=0.021) and
in the Control Group (p-value=0.031).</p><p>The epithelialized tissue, which represents the closing of the wound, showed a
significant increase in the Trial Group only (p-value=0.004), while the Control Group
showed a p-value of 0.063. It is highlighted that two ulcers (12.5%) in the Trial Group
had healed completely at the end of the treatment.</p><p>As regards the amount of exudate, most ulcers (68.8%) in the Trial Group showed a small
amount of exudate during the first visit to the clinic. During the last visit, 37.5% of
the lesions showed a small amount; 37.5%, moderate; 12.5%, large and 12.5% absence of
exudate, without significant difference at the end of the study (p-value=0.727). In the
Control Group, 50% of the lesions showed a small amount of secretion at the start of the
study; 25%, moderate and 25% large. At the end of the study, 58% of the lesions showed a
small amount of exudate=0.750).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The analysis of the sociodemographic data showed the prevalence of retired people, as
22.2% of the sample were disability retirees, due to the chronic ulcers, which can cause
the early distancing from work life, affect the quality of life and put a relevant
strain on the country's health and social security systems.</p><p>The low level of education, associated with the participants' precarious socioeconomic
condition, contributes to the reduced access to information on the prevention and care
in venous ulcer treatment. It should be highlighted that all study participants suffered
from chronic venous insufficiency: 61.1% suffered from systemic arterial hypertension
and 11.1% from diabetes mellitus. These factors reveal the need for a high-quality
public health service that offers treatment and monitoring to the patients, so that they
turn into active agents of their health condition<sup>17</sup>.</p><p>In the assessment of chronic venous ulcers, two items serve as significant predictors of
healing, the area and how long the lesion has existed. The area of the lesions in this
study is in accordance with the Brazilian standard, with 89.3% of the ulcers measuring
26cm<sup>2</sup> or less<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. International studies consider wounds as
large when measuring 10cm<sup>2</sup> or more<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>.
The Brazilian classification of wound areas is different though, with wounds measuring
less than 50cm<sup>2</sup> being considered small; between 50cm<sup>2</sup> and
150cm<sup>2</sup> medium; between 150cm<sup>2</sup> and 250cm<sup>2</sup> large, and
extensive when measuring more than 250cm<sup>2</sup>
<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>.</p><p>Other relevant information refers to how long the venous ulcers have existed. The
majority (53.6%) started more than ten years earlier. It should be highlighted that,
among the ulcers open for less than three years, all were relapsing wounds, which
evidences the chronic nature of this type of lesion and the need to implement prevention
measures in case of healing.</p><p>In a study developed in the USA that involved 165 venous ulcer patients and 12 weeks of
monitoring, it was verified that, in cases of large and lengthy ulcers, rapid healing is
impossible<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. Another study evidenced that a
good prognosis of venous ulcers depends directly on the size and evolution time of the
ulcer. A wound measuring less than 10cm<sup>2</sup> with an evolution time of less than
12 months has 71% chance of healing by the 24<sup>th</sup> week of treatment, while
wounds larger than 10cm<sup>2</sup> with an evolution time of more than 12 months have a
22% chance of cure<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>.</p><p>The results demonstrated that the venous ulcers treated with 2% papain gel showed a
significant reduction in the lesion area, especially between the 5<sup>th</sup> and
12<sup>th</sup> treatment week (adjusted p-value=0.032). Studies that examine the
effectiveness of papain have been positive, but the majority does not contain a
controlled comparison, or has involved the treatment of a wide range of wounds, instead
of leg ulcer treatment<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>.</p><p>The Control Group that used the 2% carboxymethyl cellulose gel on the venous ulcers did
not demonstrate a significant reduction in the lesion area (p-value=0.408) over the 12
weeks of treatment. In a review on the use of carboxymethyl cellulose dressings,
evidence was found that suggests that these dressings are more effective in the healing
of diabetic ulcers than other dressings, but this finding is doubtful due to the risk of
bias in the original studies<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>.</p><p>The reduction in the amount of devitalized tissue, the secondary outcome, was achieved
in the Trial Group (p-value=0.001) as well as in the Control Group (p-value=0.004). The
devitalized tissue extends the inflammation phase and favors the proliferation of
microorganisms and biofilms, retarding the entire healing process. Removing the
devitalized tissue is recommended in wound treatment, preparing the wound bed before the
dressing is applied. Papain is a chemical debriding agent due to its enzymatic action,
which provokes the dissociation of the protein molecules, dissolving the necrotic
tissue. Carboxymethyl cellulose gel, then, acts as an autolytic debriding agent, in
which the devitalized tissue is destroyed by the action of enzymes in the exudate that
is in contact with the ulcer<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>.</p><p>As regards the healthy tissue, the research data were favorable, with an increase in the
amount of granulation tissue in the Trial Group (p-value=0.021) as well as in the
Control Group (p-value=0.031). The increase in the granulation tissue was also observed
in an international study of wounds treated using a product that associates papain and
urea in comparison to wounds treated with collagenase<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>.</p><p>Only the Trial Group showed a significant increase (p-value=0.004) in the amount of
epithelialized tissue during the treatment. Therefore, 2% papain gel showed a superior
result to 2% CMC gel in this healing phase. The epithelialized tissue leads to the
contraction and, consequently, the closure of the wound. An increase in this tissue
indicates that the treatment used is favoring the tissue repair process<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>.</p><p>The amount of exudate in the two treatment groups varied between little and moderate in
most lesions, without any significant change between the first and last treatment week.
The lesser the amount of exudate, the better the healing conditions are, in view of the
PUSH score<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. An excessive quantity of exudate is
associated with the critical colonization of the wound surface, with a systemic
infection or persistent inflammation of the wound<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. In a Brazilian study, most patients (60.0%) showed a moderate to large
quantity of exudate<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, differing from the result
found in this research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>After assessing the effectiveness of 2% papain gel compared to 2% carboxymethyl
cellulose gel to treat chronic venous ulcers, it is concluded that the 2% papain gel was
more effective concerning the primary outcome of this research, with a significant
reduction in the lesion area in that group, particularly between the fifth and twelfth
week of treatment.</p><p>As regards the secondary outcome, the reduction of exudate, no significant change was
found between the groups, as the patients presented a little to moderate amount of
exudate between the onset and end of the treatment, which is a positive characteristic
of the group of patients attended at the Wound Clinic.</p><p>As regards the outcome reduction of devitalized tissue in the ulcer bed, the result was
significant in the two groups. It was observed that both the Papain and the
Carboxymethyl cellulose Groups showed favorable healing, with a reduction in the amount
of devitalized tissue and the growth of granulation tissue.</p><p>One of the research limitations was the presence of outliers, with wounds larger than
the pattern of the other wounds. Large and lengthy wounds are difficult to heal. These
characteristics are appointed as aggravating factors for the treatment. Information with
characteristics underlying the data can play a determinant role in the knowledge of the
population the study sample belongs to and can guide specific clinical
interventions.</p><p>In view of the importance of the theme, this study can contribute to the development of
research protocols for wound assessment. Multicenter studies are needed to deepen the
investigation of variables related to the effectiveness of papain gel.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn01" fn-type="other"><label>1</label><p> Paper extracted from master's thesis "Papain gel effectiveness in the treatment of
