Studies on the postprandial effects of enzymatic crosslinking of milk proteins are sparse. Our aim was to study the effect of transglutaminase (TG)-induced crosslinking of sodium caseinate on postprandial metabolic and appetite responses. Whey protein was included as reference protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Thirteen healthy individuals (23.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.1 y, BMI 21.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.4&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) participated in a single-blind crossover design experiment in which the subjects consumed three different isovolumic (500&#x02009;g) pourable beverages containing either sodium caseinate (Cas, 29&#x02009;g), TG-treated sodium caseinate (Cas-TG, 29&#x02009;g) or whey protein (Wh, 30&#x02009;g) in a randomized order. Blood samples were collected at baseline and for 4&#x02009;h postprandially for the determination of plasma glucose, insulin and amino acid (AA) concentrations. Gastric emptying (GE) was measured using the <sup>13</sup>&#x02009;C-breath test method. Appetite was assessed using visual analogue scales.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All examined postprandial responses were comparable with Cas and Cas-TG. The protein type used in the beverages was reflected as differences in plasma AA concentrations between Wh and Cas, but there were no differences in plasma glucose or insulin responses. A tendency for faster GE rate after Wh was detected. Appetite ratings or subsequent energy intake did not differ among the protein beverages.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results indicate that the metabolic responses of enzymatically crosslinked and native sodium caseinate in a liquid matrix are comparable, suggesting similar digestion and absorption rates and first pass metabolism despite the structural modification of Cas-TG.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Caseinate</kwd><kwd>Whey protein</kwd><kwd>Crosslinking</kwd><kwd>Postprandial</kwd><kwd>Glucose</kwd><kwd>Insulin</kwd><kwd>Amino acids</kwd><kwd>Appetite</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Food digestion is affected by the characteristics of macronutrients as well as by the micro- and macrostructure of the food, which may have pronounced effects on subsequent metabolic and appetitive responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Despite the progress in our understanding of the regulation of postprandial metabolism and energy homeostasis, attempts to influence physiological mechanisms and energy balance by altering the structural characteristics of foods have been modest.</p><p>Modification with crosslinking enzymes such as transglutaminase (TG) has been used extensively to change the functionality of proteins and thereby to improve the textural quality and stability of protein-based food products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In dairy products, TG-induced crosslinking can increase the firmness and water-holding capacity of acid-induced gels in products with low solids and fat content or to improve the stability of emulsions and foams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Despite the evidence on the benefits of TG-induced crosslinking in milk protein-based products, we are still a long way from fully understanding its effects on protein digestion in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Some <italic>in vitro</italic> digestion studies suggest that crosslinking with TG renders casein more resistant to proteolysis by pepsin and trypsin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], but the results have not been confirmed in humans. Since TG action results in crosslinks between glutamine and lysine residues in proteins, some concern has been raised over the bioavailability of lysine in TG-treated products. In animal studies (rats), however, the isopeptide bond formed by TG between glutamine and lysine residues appears to be cleaved by enzymes present in the GI tract or kidneys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Roos et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] reported that crosslinking of casein with TG does not inhibit proteolysis <italic>in vitro</italic> or digestibility in the intestinal tract of miniature pigs when fed as part of a mixed diet.</p><p>Whey protein has been described as a &#x0201c;fast&#x0201d; soluble protein after which gastric emptying (GE) is rapid and the postingestive amino acid (AA) response high, fast and transient. In contrast, the &#x0201c;slow&#x0201d; casein protein precipitates at the low pH prevailing in the stomach, resulting in a delayed GE rate and a lower, slower and prolonged AA response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, TG-crosslinking may change casein&#x02019;s clotting behaviour in the stomach. Flanangan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] showed that the solubility of TG-treated sodium caseinate in water is improved at pH-values between 2 and 6, which might result in a higher digestion and GE rate. On the other hand, crosslinking with TG results in stronger gels when a sodium caseinate solution is slowly acidified to pH 4.6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], which might delay digestion and GE. Also other factors than pH, such as meal dilution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and components either from the food or gastric juice need to be taken into account when considering the behaviour of proteins in the stomach. NaCl, for instance, is known to limit the solubility of TG-treated sodium caseinate to a great extent at pH 3.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>We recently found that TG-induced crosslinking of sodium caseinate modified both postprandial appetite and metabolic responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] after a test meal with a rather high protein concentration (13%), where the TG treatment changed the form of the test product from a high-viscous liquid to a strong gel. The altered responses might thus not only be the result of the crosslinking <italic>per se,</italic> but the difference in the form of the test products might also play an important role. Therefore, to better understand the postmeal effects of protein crosslinking, we investigated the effect of TG-induced crosslinking of sodium caseinate on postprandial metabolic and appetitive responses in healthy young individuals using test products with less pronounced differences in rheological properties. By lowering the protein content to 6%, pourable model beverages could be prepared both with and without TG treatment. Non-crosslinked whey protein was included as reference protein. We hypothesized that crosslinking of sodium caseinate could alter its clotting behaviour in the stomach and thereby affect the rates of digestion and gastric emptying, which could result in changes in subsequent postprandial responses of plasma glucose, insulin and amino acids as well as appetite ratings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>A total of 13 healthy normal-weight individuals (11 female, 2 male) were recruited via an intranet announcement to participate in a study at the Department of Clinical Nutrition at the University of Eastern Finland (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p><bold>Participant characteristics</bold><sup><bold>*</bold></sup></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left"><bold>Characteristic</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Value</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>SEM</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Age (years)<hr/></td><td align="char" valign="bottom" char=".">23.3<hr/></td><td align="char" valign="bottom" char=".">1.1<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Weight (kg)<hr/></td><td align="char" valign="bottom" char=".">62.8<hr/></td><td align="char" valign="bottom" char=".">2.3<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Height (m)<hr/></td><td align="char" valign="bottom" char=".">1.70<hr/></td><td align="char" valign="bottom" char=".">0.02<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Body mass index (kg/m<sup>2</sup>)<hr/></td><td align="char" valign="bottom" char=".">21.7<hr/></td><td align="char" valign="bottom" char=".">0.4<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Systolic blood pressure (mm Hg)<hr/></td><td align="char" valign="bottom" char=".">116.0<hr/></td><td align="char" valign="bottom" char=".">2.9<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)<hr/></td><td align="char" valign="bottom" char=".">72.2<hr/></td><td align="char" valign="bottom" char=".">1.9<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Oral-glucose-tolerance<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Plasma glucose, 0&#x02009;min (mmol/l)<hr/></td><td align="char" valign="bottom" char=".">5.3<hr/></td><td align="char" valign="bottom" char=".">0.1<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Plasma glucose, 120&#x02009;min (mmol/l)<hr/></td><td align="char" valign="bottom" char=".">5.2<hr/></td><td align="char" valign="bottom" char=".">0.3<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">- cognitive restraint of eating (factor 1)<hr/></td><td align="char" valign="bottom" char=".">8.9<hr/></td><td align="char" valign="bottom" char=".">1.2<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">- disinhibition (factor 2)<hr/></td><td align="char" valign="bottom" char=".">4.8<hr/></td><td align="char" valign="bottom" char=".">0.6<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">- hunger (factor 3)</td><td align="char" char=".">4.1</td><td align="char" char=".">0.6</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>*</sup>Mean values with their standard errors, <italic>n</italic> 13 (11 female, 2 male).</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>During the screening phase volunteers were interviewed about their medical history, dietary habits and physical activity.

Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of sodium caseinate powders for test products</title><p>A batch of TG-treated sodium caseinate powder was prepared for the study. A non-enzyme-treated reference material was prepared as well. Sodium caseinate (EM7) from DMW International (The Netherlands), composed of 90% protein, 5% moisture, 4% ash, 0.8% fat and 0.2% lactose, was used as the casein source. TG powder (Activa MP) from Ajinomoto Foods Europe SAS (France), consisting of 94% maltodextrin&#x02009;+&#x02009;lactose, 5% moisture and 1% protein, was used as the crosslinking enzyme. The TG activity of the powder was determined using 0.03&#x02009;M&#x02009;N-carbobenzoxy-L-glutaminyl-glycine (Sigma) as the substrate at pH 6.0 according to Folk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. For the TG powder an activity of 2600 nkat/g was measured. A single nanokatal (nkat) is defined as the amount of enzyme activity that converts 1&#x02009;nmol/s of the substrate used in the assay conditions.</p><p>Powders were prepared by mixing 1169&#x02009;g sodium caseinate with 9000&#x02009;g cold tap water in a Diosna spiral mixer (SP 24&#x02009;F/E, Dierks &#x00026; S&#x000f6;hne GmbH, Germany). After initial mixing, 8000&#x02009;g of water heated to 90&#x02009;&#x000b0;C was added, and mixing continued until a homogeneous solution was obtained. The protein content of the solution was approximately 5.5% at this point. The sodium caseinate solution was poured into a 40 litre fermenter (IF 40, New Brunswick Scientific, USA) and warmed up to 40&#x02009;&#x000b0;C under gentle stirring (50&#x02009;rpm). A 10% suspension of TG in water was prepared and 754&#x02009;g of the suspension was added to the sodium caseinate solution, which corresponds to 200 nkat TG per g sodium caseinate. The sodium caseinate content of the mixture was adjusted to 5% by adding the required amount of water. The mixture was incubated for 2&#x02009;h at 40&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for the transglutaminase reaction and then heated at 90&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 15&#x02009;min to inactivate the enzyme, cooled, frozen at &#x02212;20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and freeze-dried. The non-enzyme-treated reference powder was prepared according to the same protocol, but the TG suspension was heated for 5&#x02009;min in a boiling water bath (to inactivate the enzyme) prior to adding it to the sodium caseinate solution. The microbiological quality of the test powders fulfilled the regulatory requirements set for milk powders.</p></sec><sec><title>Test products</title><p>A total of three isoenergetic and isovolumic dairy protein based beverages containing a) untreated sodium caseinate (Cas), b) transglutaminase-treated sodium caseinate (Cas-TG) and c) untreated whey protein (Wh), were served as test products.

The subjects were instructed to maintain their habitual diet and exercise routines as constant as possible, refrain from heavy exercise on the day before the study visit and avoid alcohol consumption for 2 d before the test day. Subjects were requested to arrive to each laboratory visit the same way (e.g. walking, cycling, car or bus) and to avoid extra physical stress before the beginning of the visit. At the beginning of each experiment the participants were weighed and their alcohol consumption and the amount of exercise during the previous day were checked by an interview.</p><p>All the study visits began in the morning after a 10&#x02013;12&#x02009;h fast.

This was in contrast to our hypothesis that enzymatic crosslinking of caseinate with TG would slow the GE rate with subsequent alterations in the postprandial responses of AA, glucose and insulin. In line with earlier observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], we found that Cas and Wh have protein-specific effects on postprandial AA concentrations. Unlike some previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], the different AA profiles were not reflected in differences in postprandial responses related to insulin and glucose metabolism or appetite responses. This might partly be explained by the lower protein dosage, concentration and/or the carbohydrate source used in our study. In our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], caseinate protein was modified by intensive TG treatment, which induced gel formation due to the high protein content (13%) of the test product. Consequently both the molecular structure and the physical form of the test product were changed. The effects of this protein modification were reflected in the postprandial appetite and metabolic responses so that after the TG-treated solid caseinate test product fullness was increased and glucose, insulin, glucagon-like peptide 1 and cholecystokinin responses were attenuated when compared to liquid untreated caseinate and/or whey protein test products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In other studies the modification of the form of the test foods has also been reflected in postprandial metabolic and appetite responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], also with foods containing only protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>In this study, the protein content of the test products was lowered to 6%, which resulted in a less pronounced change in rheological properties of the test product upon crosslinking as compared to our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The crosslinking-induced changes in the structure and viscosity of the test product were not marked enough to induce significant differences in the postprandial responses. In other studies with various model foods, differences in postprandial responses have been observed among the test products in which the modification process has been directed exclusively to the molecular level of the food components without remarkable changes in the physical form of the test food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. These inconsistent results emphasize the importance of better understanding the critical physiology- and food-related aspects that modify postprandial GI functions, such as the rate and extent of GE, digestion and absorption processes.</p><p>Hypothetically, TG-induced crosslinking of casein could influence the digestive process in the upper GI tract through changes in its functional characteristics, such as aggregation or gelation behaviour at the low pH-values prevailing in the stomach, which may then affect GE rate and subsequent postprandial glucose, insulin and amino acid responses. Furthermore, altered physicochemical characteristic of the test products could also be reflected in gastric function and appetite sensations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. However, in the present study the TG-treatment induced no significant effect on postingestive glucose, insulin, AA or appetite responses. This may be because of a low degree of crosslinking and/or low protein concentration in the test beverage, which nonetheless was close to the protein concentration found in regular milk. Fox et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] used a comparable approach investigating the effect of dephosphorylation of casein on gastric emptying. Dephosphorylation was found to reduce the size of aggregates formed under acid conditions and also to increase the rate and extent of pepsin digestion of casein <italic>in vitro</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Such effects would be expected to increase the rate of gastric emptying, but gastric emptying tended to be faster for the unmodified than for the dephosphorylated protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>We included whey protein also in the study protocol to verify the differences between the two main milk protein types, casein and whey protein. The most apparent differences were detected in postprandial concentrations of some plasma AAs, whereas glucose, insulin and appetite responses and subsequent energy intake were similar after these protein types. Several previous studies indicate that casein and whey protein differ in their postprandial responses, especially in terms of GE rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], insulin secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], AA concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], and appetite responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. However, there are also earlier data supporting the results of the present study showing that insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and appetite responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] may not be affected by the different milk protein types with protein-specific AA content. Surprisingly, the results of a recent study by Acheson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] showed that casein is more satiating than whey and GE is faster after casein compared with whey protein, results that partly challenge the findings of previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. These inconsistencies in the results on casein and whey proteins in the short-term studies point out the importance of the modulating effects of test product -related factors, e.g. the dosage, concentration and type of single protein used and presence or absence and source of other macronutrients used in the test products.</p><p>Comparable insulin profiles among our test products were observed, despite the more pronounced postprandial branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) concentrations after Wh, which have been show to stimulate insulin secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. We used glucose also in our test products which certainly affected our insulin profiles to a higher extent than the BCAA. In studies where either lactose or no additional carbohydrate was used in the test meals different insulin responses between whey protein and casein were detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], but not always [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Furthermore, Acheson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] who used dextrose in their test products observed a more pronounced postprandial insulin response after whey protein compared to casein. However, unlike in our study the protein/carbohydrate ratio in their study emphasized the protein content which may have also affected the results. Therefore, the additional glucose and the protein/glucose ratio in our study resulted in pronounced postprandial insulinemia, which masked the insulin-stimulating effects of insulinotropic AAs. The total plasma AA concentration is also important for the insulin response as suggested by Nilsson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] who showed that beverages that caused the highest total postprandial AA increments caused also the highest insulin responses. The total postprandial AA response in our study was comparable among test products as was the insulin response. Furthermore, the form of test product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] is adding to the complexity of the metabolic system controlling overall homeostasis.</p><p>The trend for a faster GE after Wh than after Cas and the differences in certain AA concentrations, especially in the BCAA concentrations between Wh and Cas have been demonstrated previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Our results indicate that the milk proteins specifically modulate the GE function. In addition to the potential effects of GE rate on AA response, the differences in AA compositions between the whey protein isolate and casein protein may explain the differences in the postprandial plasma AA responses, since milk protein-specific AA composition appears to be reflected in the postprandial AA concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Furthermore, the type of casein (micellar casein, sodium/calcium caseinate) is likely to add variation to the overall postprandial AA response profile due to their potentially different postingestive behaviour in the GI tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study indicates that crosslinking with TG does not alter postprandial metabolism and appetitive responses of sodium caseinate when consumed in the form of a pourable test products, even if crosslinking causes changes in protein molecular structure and a slight increase in the viscosity of the beverage. The changes brought about by crosslinking were probably not extensive enough to result in changes in postprandial gastric functions or protein digestibility.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AA, Amino acid; Cas-TG, Caseinate crosslinked by transglutaminase; Cas, Caseinate; GE, Gastric emptying; GI, Gastrointestinal; TG, Transglutaminase; VAS, Visual analogue scale; Wh, Whey protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KRJ, LJK, ML, KHH, DL, LN, HM and KSP designed the research.
