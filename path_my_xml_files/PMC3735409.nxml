Antiseptic Silver Alloy-Coated Silicone Urinary Catheters seems to be a promising intervention to reduce UTIs; however, actual evidence cannot be extrapolated to spinal cord injured patients. The aim of this trial is to make a comparison between the use of antiseptic silver alloy-coated silicone urinary catheters and the use of standard urinary catheters in spinal cord injured patients to prevent UTIs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The study will consist in an open, randomized, multicentre, and parallel clinical trial with blinded assessment. The study will include 742 spinal cord injured patients who require at least seven days of urethral catheterization as a method of bladder voiding. Participants will be online centrally randomized and allocated to one of the two study arms (silver alloy-coated or standard catheters). Catheters will be used for a maximum period of 30&#x000a0;days or removed earlier if the clinician considers it necessary. The main outcome will be the incidence of UTIs by the time of catheter removal or at day 30 after catheterization, the event that occurs first. Intention-to-treat analysis will be performed, as well as a primary analysis of all patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The aim of this study is to assess whether silver alloy-coated silicone urinary catheters improve ITUs in spinal cord injured patients.

Almost all patients with indwelling urinary catheters develop bacteriuria and in consequence urinary tract infections (UTI) occur frequently. Frequent UTI are bothersome for the patients, implies frequent antibiotic use and increase of resistant strains, may cause septicemia and are therefore related to a decreased health-related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Several trials have evaluated the effectiveness of different types of indwelling urinary catheters to prevent urinary infections in hospitalized adults requiring short-term catheterization. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials revealed that silver-alloy but not silver-oxide coated catheters, were associated with a significant reduction in bacteriuria in comparison to standard catheters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Another recent systematic review aimed to determine which type of indwelling urinary catheter is best to use for long-term bladder drainage in adults found that all trials were small and with methodological weaknesses. The evidence from this systematic review was not sufficient as a reliable basis for practical conclusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>A large randomized clinical trial assessing three different catheters (silver-alloy-coated, nitrofural-impregnated and a PTFE-coated catheters) in hospitalized adults with acute pathologies requiring short urinary catheterization has been recently published. No clinically relevant difference was noted between the three groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Few randomized clinical trial have evaluated the effectiveness of different catheters in SCI population, most of them assessing the use of intermittent catheterization, but none using antiseptic-impregnated catheters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>We propose a clinical trial in SCI patients needing an indwelling urethral catheter to assess the effectiveness of urinary catheters with antiseptic, silver-alloy coating. The study hypothesis is that the use of these urinary catheters reduces the risk of UTI compared to the use of conventional urinary catheters.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This study is an open, randomized, multicentre, and parallel clinical trial.

Bactiguard&#x000ae; Infection Protection coating consists of noble metals such as gold, palladium and silver and its mechanism of action is to avoid the adhesion of bacteria to the inner catheter surface. All are made of full silicone.</p><p>The control arm receive standard urinary catheters commonly used in each hospital, most of them made of silicone or silicone-latex.</p><p>Trained health staff performs urethral catheterization procedure and select the most adequate catheter size. To ensure aseptic conditions they are asked to strictly follow the current protocol in their respective centres. Indwelling urethral catheters are periodically replaced about 30&#x000a0;days of use; to not interfere with current clinical practice, the policy of each centre (or the investigator criteria) for catheter replacement and removal is considered valid for this study.</p><sec><title>Blinding</title><p>This study is not blinded and the patient and health staff will know whether the patient is allocated to intervention or control arms.

A total sample size of 742, 371 in each group (allowing for 5% attrition) have a minimum of 80% power to detect these differences between intervention groups.</p><p>There is very limited information on the overall incidence of UTI in SCI patients using indwelling catheters, most coming from observational studies that included patients using different voiding methods, with a variety of risk factors, using heterogeneous definitions of UTI. In addition follow-up periods and incidence measures used varied broadly. We thus considered, conservatively, that almost one quarter of participants will suffer from an UTI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study is a randomized controlled trial to assess the incidence of symptomatic UTI in patients with SCI and needing an indwelling urinary catheter. The trial is designed to provide an adequate answer whether patients requiring long periods of catheterization might benefit from antiseptic-impregnated catheters (silver and other noble metals coating). Patients will be assessed during 30&#x000a0;days or until catheter removal. Signs and symptoms suggestive of UTI and urine cultures will be collected for the definition of a clinically relevant primary outcome. Other outcomes such as bacteremic UTI, adverse events and costs will be also accounted.</p><p>Coating urinary catheters with silver alloy and other noble metals as well as with antibiotics seem to be a promising intervention to reduce hospital-acquired infections, as described in a systematic review of randomized clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This review included studies using short-term catheterization and pooled the results of a surrogate outcome such as bacteriuria. One recent clinical trial did not show clinically relevant differences between antiseptic-impregnated catheters (silver alloy or antimicrobial) to standard ones in 7102 adults with acute pathologies requiring a short-term urinary catheterization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This large and pragmatic clinical trial defined catheter-associated UTI as the presence of participant-reported suggestive symptoms and clinician prescription of antibiotic for a UTI at any time up to 6&#x000a0;weeks after randomization. Even though this unusual definition, in patients carrying a catheter for an average of two days the results did not support the routine use of antiseptic-impregnated catheters. However, these evidences are not directly applicable to SCI patients.</p><p>Our study has several methodological strengths such as an accurate method of randomization, concealment allocation and a data adjudication committee blinded to the intervention. It also needs to be emphasized that the primary objective of our study has not been previously evaluated in SCI population and is based in a sound primary outcome which is critical for decision-making. In addition, the study is designed to find a clinically meaningful reduction in the relative incidence of UTI of 35%. This figure is translated to an absolute reduction of 84 fewer UTI per 1000 patients using indwelling catheters. Conversely, if the study does not rule out irrelevant or no benefit from the use of silver-alloy coating urinary catheters, most SCI patients requiring indwelling urethral catheterization would use the standard catheters which cost is 10 times less as compared to silver-alloy ones.</p><p>There are also several potential limitations of the trial. The most important one is its blinded nature. Patients and health staff will know the allocated intervention, thus they might become more prone to report sign, symptoms as well as to ask for urine or blood tests if they know that a standard catheter is used. This source of bias would be mitigated with the data adjudication committee blinded to the intervention. Another limitation is the UTI definition. Even though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] recognizes that subjects with at least one of the following signs or symptoms (fever (&#x0003e;38&#x000b0;C), suprapubic tenderness, or costovertebral angle pain or tenderness) and a positive culture suffer from a symptomatic UTI, the sensitivity and specificity of urinary symptoms in SCI patients is very poor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The diagnosis of UTI in SCI patients is based on the combination of symptoms and signs, which are often non-specific. The signs and symptoms criteria for UTI in this study are adapted from the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Consensus Statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], which together with other clinical and laboratory data will be the basis for data adjudication committee to decide if a patient suffered from an UTI.</p><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We present the protocol of an open label, randomized controlled clinical trial to determine the effectiveness of urinary catheters with antiseptic silver alloy coating on the reduction of symptomatic UTI in SCI patients with indwelling urethral catheter. The urinary catheters with antiseptic silver alloy coating are compared to standard urinary catheters (with no antiseptic coating) during a period up to 30&#x000a0;days. This study will provide clear information about the clinical effectiveness of silver-alloy catheters to guide its use in a population requiring long-term catheterization.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ASIA: American spinal injury association; UTI: Urinary tract infection; ANOVA: Analysis of variance; SCI: Spinal cord injury; ASB: Asymptomatic bacteriuria.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Manuel Bea-Mu&#x000f1;oz received funding from <italic>Coloplast</italic> and <italic>Hollister</italic> for his participation in conferences and courses.
