However, as we found that some in-center patients had characteristics similar to those of satellite patients, and as we had difficulties with recruitment, we expanded our recruitment criteria and the number of sites (different from published protocol). To fully reflect the contributions of all the centers across Ontario that developed the HIPPO-ST, the study title was also altered.

The panel established 3 components to evaluating the entry site for healing: (i) stability of the catheter ingrowth, (ii) appearance of the catheter entry site, and (iii) integrity of the seal.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref></p><p>Stability of the catheter was quantified by measuring the distance from the hub of the catheter to the entry site with a small disposable paper ruler before and after the patient took a deep breath. The catheter is generally inserted into the internal jugular vein, and protrudes from the chest just below the collar bone. If the catheter is not endothelialized <italic>in situ,</italic> the catheter may move as the patient takes a deep breath due to the muscles in the chest wall contracting. The measurement was taken during the catheter dressing change routinely conducted once weekly by the nurses. A difference between full exhalation and full inspiration of &#x0003e;0.23 cm indicated a failed test. The appearance of the catheter entry site was measured using a visual assessment of the skin around the point of catheter entry into the chest for signs of irritation and infection (e.g., redness, discharge, or swelling) by the HD nurse with the assistance of the study coordinator. The presence of any 2 of the following present constituted a failure of this test: redness, discharge, or swelling. The integrity of the skin seal was measured using a visual assessment of how tightly the skin is sealed around the catheter tube by the HD nurses with the assistance of the study coordinator. The integrity of the skin seal around the catheter is rated in the test as good, fair, or poor, and a rating of poor constituted a failure of this test. If two-thirds or more of the above catheter entry site healing tests were failed, standard care was applied and dressings changed once per week on dialysis as per protocol, and the catheter entry site&#x02013;healing tests were repeated once weekly until two-thirds of the tests were passed, and the patient could proceed to randomization, or the study ended. As with other criteria, such as for exit site infection, the above tests have not been validated; however it was an attempt to standardize and objectively determine entry site healing, rather than have no criteria aside from the current subjective evaluation by nurses.</p><p>Upon passing two-thirds of the catheter entry site healing tests, participants were randomized via a 24-hour, telephone-accessed independent central randomization facility. Randomization involved a computer-generated randomization sequence using random block sizes with stratification by study site. Allocation of participants to the intervention was concealed to the randomization desk; however, participants and the study coordinator could not be blinded to allocation status due to the nature of the intervention. As participants were stratified by site, the number of patients from each site allocated to each arm was balanced, and potential differences in outcomes owing to site-specific practices (e.g., brand of dressings, polysporin triple ointment use) should consequently also be balanced. We therefore did not control for use of prior regimens in the analysis (regimens are determined by individual site policies).</p></sec><sec id="sec1.8"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Feasibility objectives and their corresponding outcome measures are listed in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>. The primary clinical objective (exploratory) was to compare the rate of CRB in patients with healed catheter entry sites using HIPPO-ST in addition to standard care versus standard catheter care alone over 6 months (hypothesized to be non-inferior).

The results from this pilot study&#x02019;s exploratory analysis of the primary clinical outcome (CRB rate) indicated similar CRB rates between the intervention and control arms, suggesting that a noninferiority design for the full study would be appropriate. The percentage of patients with a CRB was similar in the HIPPO-ST group (12%) compared to the control arm (11%); the rate of CRB was slightly higher in the HIPPO-ST Group (0.88/1000 catheter days) compared to the control arm (0.68/1000 catheter days), although both were under the threshold of an excellent CRB rate (1.0/1000 catheter days).<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr"><sup>50</sup></xref> In&#x000a0;addition, analysis of a secondary clinical outcome, SF-VAQ score, showed an improvement within the HIPPO-ST group in terms of their satisfaction with their catheter care relating to problems when bathing or showering; however, satisfaction was not a relatively greater improvement than the control group condition. We found that compliance with the catheter care protocol was high, and contamination of patients in the control arm (i.e., using aspects of the HIPPO-ST) was not detected. The results of the HIPPO-ST pilot study indicate that on HIPPO-ST, patients are satisfied and compliant with the HIPPO-ST, which was designed specifically to meet their needs and minimize infection risk.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref></p><p>Our findings are consistent with other studies of HD catheter care with a shower component.<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> Both of these previous studies used a &#x0201c;no-dressing&#x0201d; shower technique in which the patients shower freely and do not have a dressing placed over the catheter entry site as part of their catheter care.<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> However, the HIPPO-ST in the current study differs in that patients were trained, using the HIPPO-ST tools, on how to correctly cleanse the entry site and apply a dressing following a shower up to 3 times per week. Although these studies are not directly comparable, the investigators have consistently found that a patient showering with an&#x000a0;HD catheter <italic>in situ</italic> did not demonstrate an increase&#x000a0;in infection risk, and patients&#x02019; quality of life was&#x000a0;improved by not restricting their ability to shower.<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></p><p>Another unique difference is that both prior studies did not test catheter entry site healing before introducing a shower component into catheter care, but instead used various time thresholds from the time of catheter insertion to determine shower technique eligibility.<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> The use of the catheter entry site healing tests prior to randomization are a critical feature of the HIPPO-ST design. For unhealed catheter&#x000a0;entry sites, there may be a potential increased risk of infection using any shower technique, including HIPPO-ST, by extraluminal exposure to microorganisms compared with standard catheter care due to the higher number of risk exposures from showering with or without dressing changes conducted by patients. As 4 patients failed to meet entry site healing randomization criteria despite using a catheter for &#x0003e;6 weeks, our results suggest that duration of catheter use itself is not a reliable factor to ensure entry site healing.</p><p>A prior study in HD patients dialyzing via catheters demonstrated that patients were 3.8 times more likely to be compliant with their catheter care protocol (i.e., not to shower with a catheter <italic>in situ</italic>) if they recalled a health care provider educating them not to, compared with having no such recollection (95% CI&#x000a0;= 1.2&#x02212;4.5).<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> This is consistent with the high compliance with the catheter care protocol found in our study after patient education and regular reinforcement of proper catheter dressing care and infection prevention.</p><p>From both clinical and research perspectives, it is critical to understand the infection rates and patient satisfaction associated with the HIPPO-ST in HD patients with healed catheter entry sites as a prophylactic strategy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines state that the optimal method of catheter infection prophylaxis in patients with healed entry sites is an unresolved issue.<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr"><sup>54</sup></xref> This is reflected in a Canadian survey of 68 dialysis centers across Canada in which practice was found to be very inconsistent surrounding the recommendations made to patients for personal hygiene: 75% of centers recommended that patients clean themselves by bathing (nonsubmerged) or sponge bath, 38% recommended showering, and 5% made no recommendation at all (categories non&#x02212;mutually exclusive).<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr"><sup>55</sup></xref> Therefore, HD patients across Canada receive conflicting, inconsistent, or no recommendations about personal hygiene care techniques and whether or not they should preserve the dryness of their dressings to prevent catheter-related infection.</p><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Lessons Learned About How to Design the Main&#x000a0;Trial</title><p>Given the burden of catheter-related infection and the reduced quality of life of patients from restricting their ability to shower, the study question of whether the CRB rate for HD using HIPPO-ST is noninferior to that of patients using standard catheter care remains a&#x000a0;pressing issue that the full HIPPO-ST trial will ultimately address. Although the outcome of the CRB rate addresses the morbidity and mortality associated with the intervention being studied, we submit that equally important is patients&#x02019; satisfaction with their vascular access and its care. Thus, the full potential benefit of the HIPPO-ST is best captured by including the SF-VAQ. This insight will be helpful in designing the full HIPPO-ST study, in which both hard and surrogate, clinical and patient-focused outcomes will be crucial to fully understanding the impact of the HIPPO-ST.<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref> When designing the full HIPPO-ST trial we will not aim to show a large difference in a single outcome; rather, we will be evaluating several dimensions of the patient experience to incrementally improve care. In addition, we originally planned to conduct the pilot study only in satellite units due to the perception that the satellite population may be more eligible (i.e., tend to be younger and have fewer co-morbidities) than in-center patients. However, this was not so, and recruitment rates were similar in both&#x000a0;satellite and in-center units. Therefore, in the full trial, in-center units should be considered for inclusion.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><title>Study Limitations</title><p>There are several limitations to this study. First, this study was a pilot study, and any examination of clinical outcomes is only exploratory. The full HIPPO-ST trial is needed to answer these clinical questions. In addition, there are no fully validated vascular access&#x02212;specific questionnaires, including the SF-VAQ; however the full HIPPO-ST may provide an opportunity for construct validation of this measure.<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> Moreover this study may be limited by selection bias, as many eligible patients declined to participate. Although we collected data on their reasons for declining to participate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>), constraints placed by the study REB prohibited collection of any additional sociodemographics or clinical data on these patients. Therefore we cannot examine whether these patients were systematically different from those who decided to participate. It is possible that patients at highest risk for infection, for example, were self-selecting out of participating in the trial. Recruitment is challenging when conducting any clinical research study but is particularly difficult in RCTs. Indeed, we failed to meet our feasibility criteria on recruitment, despite using multiple strategies to facilitate recruitment, including identification of a nurse leader (such as a vascular access coordinator at each center), extensive in-servicing with all unit nurses, and expanding recruitment into some in-center units (as we originally planned to recruit only in satellites). However, the availability of the pilot study data to patients may help alleviate patient concerns, and facilitate recruitment in the future full HIPPO-ST study.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Overall, we found that the full HIPPO-ST study is feasible to conduct, with a high level of compliance with the HIPPO-ST, and low levels of contamination in the control arm. The conduct of the full HIPPO-ST study will address the current paucity of evidence surrounding showering aspects of catheter care allowing patients, HD personnel, and nephrologists to make informed choices about HD catheter care.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Disclosure</title><p>All the authors declared no competing interests.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lopes</surname><given-names>A.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Bragg-Gresham</surname><given-names>J.L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Goodkin</surname><given-names>D.A.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Factors associated with health-related quality of life among hemodialysis patients in the DOPPS</article-title><source>Qual Life Res</source><volume>16</volume><year>2007</year><fpage>545</fpage><lpage>557</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17286199</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bradbury</surname><given-names>B.D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Fissell</surname><given-names>R.B.</given-names></name><name><surname>Albert</surname><given-names>J.M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Predictors of early mortality among incident US hemodialysis patients in the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS)</article-title><source>Clin J Am Soc Nephrol</source><volume>2</volume><year>2007</year><fpage>89</fpage><lpage>99</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17699392</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref3"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Tonnessen</surname><given-names>B.H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Money</surname><given-names>S.R.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Embracing the fistula first national vascular access improvement initiative</article-title><source>J Vasc Surg</source><volume>42</volume><year>2005</year><fpage>585</fpage><lpage>586</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16171614</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other" id="sref4">USRDS.
