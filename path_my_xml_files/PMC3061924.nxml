Physical activity and adequate self-management capacity are important risk reduction strategies in the management of CHF. The Home-Heart-Walk is a self-monitoring intervention. This model of intervention has adapted the 6-minute walk test as a home-based activity that is self-administered and can be used for monitoring physical functional capacity in people with CHF. The aim of the Home-Heart-Walk program is to promote adherence to physical activity recommendations and improving self-management in people with CHF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A randomised controlled trial is being conducted in English speaking people with CHF in four hospitals in Sydney, Australia. Individuals diagnosed with CHF, in New York Heart Association Functional Class II or III, with a previous admission to hospital for CHF are eligible to participate. Based on a previous CHF study and a loss to follow-up of 10%, 166 participants are required to be able to detect a 12-point difference in the study primary endpoint (SF-36 physical function domain).</p><p>All enrolled participant receive an information session with a cardiovascular nurse. This information session covers key self-management components of CHF: daily weight; diet (salt reduction); medication adherence; and physical activity. Participants are randomised to either intervention or control group through the study randomisation centre after baseline questionnaires and assessment are completed. For people in the intervention group, the research nurse also explains the weekly Home-Heart-Walk protocol. All participants receive monthly phone calls from a research coordinator for six months, and outcome measures are conducted at one, three and six months. The primary outcome of the trial is the physical functioning domain of quality of life, measured by the physical functioning subscale of the Medical Outcome Study Short Form -36. Secondary outcomes include physical functional capacity measured by the standard six minute walk test, self-management capacity, health related quality of life measured by Medical Outcome Study Short Form -36 and Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire, self-efficacy and self-care behaviour.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>A self-monitoring intervention that can improve individual's exercise self-efficacy, self-management capacity could have potential significance in improving the management of people with chronic heart failure in community settings.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry 12609000437268</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a prevalent and debilitating condition and is most common in the elderly population. Apart from the symptoms that individuals suffer and the burden on their families, this condition poses a substantial economic burden for the wider society[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It is estimated that CHF costs Australia AUD$1 billion annually, with the bulk of these costs related to hospitalization[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Studies have shown that at least 40% of readmissions to hospital for CHF are due to non-compliance with treatment recommendations and inadequate patient information[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Although physical activity is important and beneficial in the management of CHF, many individuals consider that adhering to physical activity recommendations is harder compared to implementing strategies related to medications, dietary modifications or fluid restriction[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The theoretical concept underpinning adherence to physical activity is self-efficacy, which is the central concept of self-management[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Individuals' exercise self-efficacy determines, in part, an individual's ability to initiate and sustain an exercise program[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Because the benefits of physical activity are often not immediately felt, this can be a barrier to sustainable behavior change. Without prompted monitoring of progress, the importance and usefulness of physical activity is likely to be overlooked. In addition, while many people with CHF are managing in the community, monitoring of physical functional capacity is most often undertaken in a clinical environment where it requires well-trained staff and equipment. Hospitalisation for CHF can occur when individuals fail to recognise the signs and symptoms of deteriorating physical function. Without adequate knowledge and support, signs and symptoms such as shortness of breath, weight gain or increasing fatigue can be disregarded[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Self-monitoring is one important but often under-utilised self-management behaviors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>With the aim of assisting individuals and clinicians to monitor and promote physical activity, we developed the Home-Heart-Walk (HHW). The HHW has been developed based on the principle of self-efficacy and the mechanistic elements of the 6MWT[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The HHW is a self-administered, modified 6MWT. We chose to base the HHW protocol on the 6MWT over other exercise tests because of its simple, safe and inexpensive characteristics and the ability to consider data sharing in the future. The HHW program is a structured, self-monitoring exercise program, which incorporates regular HHW and telephone follow-up. After developing the HHW prototype, we have assessed the correlation of the HHW distance and the 6MWT distance in a group of 13 healthy adult (age 23 to 59) and the reliability and feasibility in a group of 29 cardiac rehabilitation participants[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The correlation between the two tests distances was r = 0.81[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The intra-class correlation coefficient of the test distance over a 7 day period was 0.98 and the inter-rater correlation was almost perfect (r = 0.99)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Given the impact that regular monitoring of the HHW could have on the management of CHF, a randomized controlled trial to assess the ability of the HHW to promote self-management and exercise self-efficacy was devised.</p><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>Based on a 6MWT literature review, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] our research team has modified the 6MWT to a home-based, self-administered monitoring tool for functional capacity. According to American Thoracic Society 6MWT guideline, a 30 meter long walking track is required. However, a 30 meter long walking track is rarely feasible in a home environment. In the HHW, walking is performed alongside a 5-meter length of rope (marked in 1-meter gradations) on a flat hard surface free of obstacles. The purpose of the HHW is to cover as much distance as possible in 6 minutes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In parallel with the 6MWT, stopping and resting were allowed during the HHW test. However, standard encouragement using the American Thoracic Society guideline is not used during the HHW protocol. As a self-administered tool, a lap counter was used to assist the individual to count the number of full laps walked during the test. A timer with a countdown function was used to time the six minutes. Investigators calculate the distance covered during the HHW test after the study is completed (Laps walked &#x000d7; distance (in meters) per lap <bold>+ </bold>partial lap).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Illustration of the walking track</bold>.

Low adherence to health recommendations suggest the need to explore ways of better promoting adherence to clinical advice and develop innovative interventions for monitoring and managing people with CHF in community settings. If evaluated as being successful, the HHW protocol can be readily incorporated into the community based management of CHF. In particular it has the potential to reach the subgroup of CHF population who have limited physical functional capacity and are not appropriate for higher intensity physical activity. At the same time, this self-monitoring intervention if shown to be beneficial would also assist in managing people living in areas where clinical based, supervised programs are not easily accessible.</p><p>The use of self-reported instruments could be a potential limitation of this study, because the risk of over reporting or under reporting from the participants and is likely to be evenly distributed between the randomized groups. However, this is inevitable with any kind of study using self-reporting instruments. The study instruments and scoring will be discussed when reporting study findings. Enrolment of the 166 participants will continue through 2010. After recruitment of the 166 participants, the baseline characteristics of the participants will be analysed. Outcome assessment is projected to be completed by mid 2011.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CHF: Chronic heart failure; SF-36: Medical Outcome Study Short Form-36; MLWHF: Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire; HHW: Home-Heart-Walk; 6MWT: 6-minute walk test; HRQoL: Health related quality of life; NYHA-FC: New York Heart Association-Functional Class; EHFScBS: European Heart Failure Self-care Behaviour Scale</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>PMD conceived the study, HD, PJN, RZ, BE, ARD, YS, DC, PM, PMD participated in the design of the study, writing of the study protocol and the manuscript.
