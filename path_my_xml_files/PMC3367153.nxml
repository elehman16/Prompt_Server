At the primary evaluation, the clinician has to rely on the clinical examination when initiating treatment and further diagnostic work up. Beside the history taking and clinical examination, the initial diagnostics usually consist of blood samples, an ECG and a conventional chest x-ray (CXR).</p><p>Several studies have questioned the diagnostic accuracy of the clinical examination.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6 b7">1&#x02013;7</xref> The conventional CXR also has its drawbacks and often a supine CXR is the only possible solution in the most critically ill patients. In addition, the diagnostic accuracy of the CXR in the diagnosis of acute respiratory diseases such as pulmonary oedema, pneumonia, pleural effusion and pneumothorax has been debated.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8 b9 b10 b11">8&#x02013;11</xref></p><p>The limitations of the initial investigations of acute admitted patients with respiratory symptoms may cause a significant proportion of the patients to receive a wrong diagnosis and thereby inappropriate treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> An incorrect diagnosis and initiation of an inappropriate treatment is associated with a higher mortality and an increased length of the hospital stay in elderly patients admitted with acute respiratory failure in an emergency department (ED).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> Most of the patients misdiagnosed in the ED have very common diseases, such as heart failure, pulmonary oedema, community-acquired pneumonia, pulmonary embolism and obstructive pulmonary diseases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> A major challenge for the emergency physician is to achieve an as accurate presumptive diagnosis as possible and to differentiate between the most common causes for acute respiratory failure.</p><p>One method showing itself promising in improving the initial diagnostics is the use of focused sonography, as most of the diseases, commonly seen and misdiagnosed in patients with acute respiratory symptoms, can be diagnosed with sonography.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13 b14 b15 b16 b17 b18 b19 b20 b21 b22">13&#x02013;22</xref> Although the sonographic findings are normal in patients with obstructive pulmonary disease, sonography seems to be useful in ruling out many coexisting diseases in these patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> The cause of acute respiratory failure most often originate from the heart, lungs and deep veins of the legs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> of which all three can be directly visualised using this approach. A combination of focused sonography of the heart, lungs and deep veins would therefore, theoretically, lead to a better differentiation between many of the causes of acute respiratory failure and thus must likely increase the diagnostic accuracy.</p><p>Patients admitted and triaged to the medical section of our ED with respiratory symptoms should have a presumptive diagnosis within 4&#x02005;h of admission. The current standard is that the presumptive diagnosis is based on an evaluation performed by an ED physician in combination with initial diagnostics such as blood samples, ECG and CXR. We therefore aim to investigate whether the supplemental use of focused sonography of the heart, lungs and deep veins as a standard diagnostic tool increases the proportion of acute admitted patients with respiratory symptoms that are correctly diagnosed within 4&#x02005;h of admission compared with our current initial investigations (eg, blood samples, ECG, CXR and an evaluation performed by an emergency physician).</p></sec><sec><title>Study purpose</title><p>The main purpose of the study is to evaluate whether the use of sonographic examination of the heart, lungs and deep veins of the legs can improve the total number of patients correctly diagnosed within the first 4&#x02005;h of admission, in an unselected population of patients with respiratory symptoms who are acute admitted to the medical section in an ED compared with the conventional diagnostics without focused sonography (control group) using blinded audit as the gold standard.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial design and methods</title><p>The study will be conducted as a blinded, prospective randomised controlled trial. The trial will use a parallel group design with a 1:1 allocation ratio. The framework chosen for the trial is a pragmatic and superiority design.</p><p>The trial aims to assess the diagnostic impact of the implementation of focused sonography of the heart, lungs and deep veins as a diagnostic modality in acute admitted patients with respiratory symptoms. The primary outcome of the study is the number of patients with a correct presumptive diagnosis within 4&#x02005;h of admission to the ED. As secondary outcomes, the impact of sonography on inhospital and 30&#x02005;day mortality, length of hospital stay and number of patients receiving appropriate treatment within 4&#x02005;h of admission in the ED will be assessed.</p><p>The study will take place at the ED at Odense University Hospital, Denmark. In 2010, the ED had 8300 medical admissions. Due to organisational changes, this number is expected to rise significantly during the study period. All patients with respiratory symptoms as the primary complaint are admitted to the medical section of the ED. Patients suspected of having a heart disease (eg, acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary oedema, arrhythmia) are, however, admitted directly to our cardiology department.</p><p>The results of the study will be reported according to the CONSORT guidelines for pragmatic trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> An overview of the patient flow in the clinical trial is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Patient flow in the clinical trial.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001369fig1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>We will recruit 320 acutely admitted patients with respiratory symptoms through the ED at Odense University Hospital, Denmark. Patients will only be recruited if they are triaged to the medical section of our ED. Using the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the patients triaged to the medical section will be screened for participation in the study. The screening is performed by the primary investigator. Patients triaged to other sections of the ED (eg, trauma, abdominal surgery, obstetrics, gynaecology) will not be screened for participation in the project.</p><p>Immediate after screening patients receive oral and written information about the study, the information is given by the primary investigator. The written information used has been approved by the regional scientific ethical committee. If the patient is willing to participate in the study, written and oral informed consent will be obtained by the primary investigator.</p><p>Patient enrolment is carried out during all 24&#x02005;h of the day.</p><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>All five of the following must be present:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Patient is triaged to the medical section of the ED.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The sonographic examination can be performed before or within 1&#x02005;h after the primary evaluation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patient age &#x02265;18&#x02005;years.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Informed consent is available.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The presence of one or more of the following symptoms or clinical findings at admission to the ED.</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>&#x02013;Respiratory rate &#x0003e;20 breaths per minute.</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02013;Saturation &#x0003c;95%.</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02013;Oxygen therapy initiated.</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02013;The patient has a principal complaint of dyspnoea.</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02013;The patient has a principal complaint of coughing.</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02013;The patient has a principal complaint of chest pain.</p></list-item></list></list-item></list></p></sec><sec><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>One of the following:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The sonographic examination cannot be performed before or within 1&#x02005;h after the primary evaluation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patient age &#x0003c;18&#x02005;years.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Informed consent is not available.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec><title>Randomisation</title><p>By the use of a random number generator, the randomisation lists will be established before initiating the study. The unique identification number and group assignment will be printed on a label and then fixed to a folded paper card. The card will be placed in a coloured envelope. This makes it impossible to see the group that the patient is assigned to through the sealed envelope.</p><p>Once the patient has been included in the study, the randomisation will be performed. An investigator will open the randomisation envelope containing the patient's unique identification number that also decides whether the patient is randomised to the sonography group or the control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Blinding</title><p>In order to blind to the physicians performing the final diagnosis audit, the results of the randomisation and the results of the sonographic examinations are kept in a sealed envelope in the patient's paper journal. The physicians performing the audit have access to the patients' electronic journal. However, they are blinded to the paper journal and thereby the results of the randomisation and sonographic examinations. The emergency physicians are instructed not to record the results of the randomisation or the sonographic examinations in the electronic journal.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>The patient is randomised to either an intervention or a control group. In the intervention group, the usual initial diagnostic work up (eg, evaluation by an ED physician, blood samples, ECG and CXR) is supplemented by focused sonographic examination of the heart, lungs and deep veins of the legs. In the control group, usual diagnostic work up is performed. In both groups, the patient is clinically assessed by the ED physician leading to registration of presumptive diagnosis, treatment initiated and any supplemental diagnostics ordered. The last performed evaluation within the first 4&#x02005;h is used as the final &#x02018;4-h&#x02019; presumptive diagnosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Sonography group</title><p>For patients randomised to the intervention group, sonographic examination of the heart, lungs and deep veins will be performed before or within 1&#x02005;h after the primary evaluation. The emergency physicians in our department do not have the competencies to perform focused sonography. Instead the sonographic examinations will be performed by a physician qualified for focused sonography (first author CBL). The results of the sonographic examinations are registered in a report sheet and delivered to the ED physician who is in charge of the patient's treatment and further investigations. Then the ED physician re-evaluates the suspected diagnosis along with treatment initiated and further diagnostics ordered. Furthermore, the ED physician grades the clinical information of the sonographic examination. The information is graded into one of the five following categories:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Inadequate information.</p></list-item><list-item><p>No new information.</p></list-item><list-item><p>No new information but presumptive diagnosis confirmed by sonography.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Added new information (but no change in treatment/further investigations).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Added decisive information (changes made in treatment/further investigations).</p></list-item></list></p><p>The diagnostic criteria for the sonographic examinations are listed in online appendix I.

The methods used for the audit are described in online appendix II.</p><p>In our ED, the primary evaluation should have been performed and all primary diagnostic examinations (eg, blood samples, ECG, CXR) should be available within 4&#x02005;h after patient admission.

A clinically significant improvement in the presumptive diagnosis by the use of sonography would be an absolute improvement of at least 10%. Based on the preliminary results, the sonographic examination approximately increases the proportion of patients with a correct presumptive diagnosis to 80%. If 65% of the patients in the control group achieve a correct presumptive diagnosis and 80% in the intervention (sonography) group achieve a correct diagnosis, then a power of 80% at the 5% level is obtained with a sample size of 150 patients in each group.

The principal investigator will perform patient screening, enrolment and sonography in the intervention group. The principal investigator manages data collection and flow, while one of the associate investigators (FR) monitors data collection, flow and integrity throughout the process.</p><p>Focused sonography carries no risk for the patient since its pain and radiation free; hence, a Data Monitoring Committee has not been appointed for the trial.</p><p>The patient allocations are concealed from the physicians performing the blinded audit (DPH, PHM and JRD). The auditors will only have access to the participant's electronic patient journal for the audit, but any information about allocation or result of the sonographic examinations is blinded for the auditors. No interim analysis or endpoint adjustments are planned.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial will be the first study to compare the overall diagnostic performance between the conventional approach to evaluate and diagnose acute admitted patients with respiratory symptoms, admitted to an ED, with a new approach that combines the conventional method with focused sonography of the heart, lungs and the deep veins in the legs. The results of the study may help to determine whether sonography should be included as a fully integrated part of the primary evaluation in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical considerations and dissemination</title><p>Sonography is a non-invasive pain and radiation-free diagnostic imaging modality. The sonographic examinations performed in the study do not pose an additional risk for the patients in the intervention group.
