However, whether PAI-related increases can be maintained postoperatively has not been examined. This study compared PA changes across pre- (baseline, post-intervention) and postoperative (6-month follow-up) periods in participants randomized to 6 weeks of preoperative PAI or standard care control (SC). Of 75 participants initially randomized, 36 (PAI n=22; SC n=14) underwent BS. Changes in daily bout-related (&#x02265;10-minute bouts) moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and steps were assessed via the SenseWear Armband monitor. PAI received weekly counseling to increase walking exercise. Retention (86%) at postoperative follow-up was similar between groups. Intent-to-treat analyses showed that PAI vs. SC had greater increases across time (baseline, post-intervention, follow-up) in bout-related MVPA minutes/day (4.3&#x000b1;5.1, 26.3&#x000b1;21.3, 28.7&#x000b1;26.3 versus 10.4&#x000b1;22.9, 11.4&#x000b1;16.0, 18.5&#x000b1;28.2; <italic>p</italic>=.013) and steps/day (5163&#x000b1;2901, 7950&#x000b1;3286, 7870&#x000b1;3936 versus 5163&#x000b1;2901, 5601&#x000b1;3368, 5087&#x000b1;2603; <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;.001).

We recently reported findings from the Bari-Active trial<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, which tested a 6-week PAI versus standard pre-surgical care control (SC) on objectively-measured pre- to post-intervention changes in bout-related MVPA. At post-intervention, PAI (n=40) on average achieved a near five-fold increase in bout-related MVPA (4.4 to 21.0 minutes/day), whereas SC (n=35) showed no change (7.9 to 7.6 minutes/day; PAI versus SC, <italic>p</italic>=.001). Similarly, daily steps increased by an average of 2028 (4908 to 6935) in PAI compared to only 203 (4629 to 4832) in SC.

Individuals were ineligible if scheduled for BS &#x0003c;10 weeks during screening, participating in another PA/weight loss program, intending to relocate geographically, or had issues (e.g., relocation, substance abuse/severe psychiatric condition, language barriers) that could interfere with protocol adherence.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Design/Procedures</title><p id="P6">BS-seeking individuals were referred by surgical clinics in Rhode Island, USA between April 2010 and January 2014. During a clinic visit, patients received a study flyer. Those who expressed desire to participate and received surgeon approval to perform walking exercise underwent telephone screening. Eligible patients were invited to an orientation/baseline session where they provided informed consent, had height and weight measured, and were given a SenseWear armband (SWA) monitor to wear for the next 7 days. Participants were then randomly assigned 1:1 to 6 weeks of PAI or SC using a computer-generated random-permuted blocking procedure. Participants wore the activity monitor again at post-intervention and postoperative follow-up. Participants received $100 for completing all assessments. The Miriam Hospital IRB approved study procedures (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> registration NCT00962325).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Interventions</title><sec id="S6"><title>PAI</title><p id="P7">Beginning 1 week after baseline and completion of 7 days of activity monitoring, participants received 6 consecutive weekly individual face-to-face counseling sessions, weekly PA monitoring/planning logs, and a pedometer to increase bout-related, moderate-intensity walking by 30 minutes/day and steps by 5,000/day. Participants recorded bout-related walking minutes and steps at the end of each day. During week 1, participants maintained usual PA patterns to determine baseline values and tailored weekly goal progression. For week 2, 10 additional bout-related walking minutes/day and 1,000 steps/day above baseline were prescribed. For each subsequent week, 5 daily bout-related walking minutes and 1,000 daily steps were added to the previous week&#x02019;s prescription.</p><p id="P8">Counseling sessions were conducted by the primary author and focused on: reviewing self-monitoring records and progress towards goals; and problem-solving barriers, teaching behavior change strategies, and developing action plans to achieve goals (see Bond et al.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> for a detailed description).

The SenseWear Professional Software (Version 7.0) calculated wear time. Metabolic equivalent (MET) values determined daily minutes spent in bout-related MVPA (&#x02265;3 METs). Allowance of &#x02265;1 minute &#x0003c;3 METs was employed in calculating bout-related MVPA (i.e. accumulated in bouts &#x02265;10-min). Monitor wear time of &#x02265;6 hours/day on &#x02265;4 days for all assessments was required for inclusion in analysis.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> We have previously shown that this criterion maximizes sample size/data inclusion while providing estimates of bout-related MVPA that are similar to those when more stringent wear time criteria are employed.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Other measures</title><p id="P11">Demographics information (i.e. age, sex, race/ethnicity, education) was collected via questionnaire at baseline.

PAI achieved significantly greater increases in preoperative bout-related MVPA and steps from baseline to post-intervention versus SC, which were maintained at 6-month postoperative follow-up. These findings correspond with observational research showing positive correlations between pre- and postoperative PA<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and provide support for behavioral strategies aimed at increasing preoperative PA.</p><p id="P18">Interestingly, SC increased bout-related MVPA but not overall ambulatory movement (i.e. steps) from post-intervention to postoperative follow-up, whereas PAI maintained post-intervention levels of both types of activity. Consequently, the effect size for the group difference decreased from large to medium for bout-related MVPA and remained large for steps. This suggests that SC increased time spent exercising postoperatively but compensated with less overall movement, whereas PAI maintained a high exercise level and also moved more versus SC.</p><p id="P19">While PAI were successful in maintaining levels of bout-related MVPA (~200 minutes/week) that were markedly higher than baseline (~30 minutes/week), similar to post-intervention (~184 minutes/week), and above public health guidelines (&#x02265;150 bout-related MVPA minutes/week<sup>2</sup>), even greater amounts may be necessary to enhance weight loss and limit subsequent weight regain after BS.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Thus, prescription of higher PA goals may be required.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Nonetheless, recent data suggest that the volume of bout-related MVPA performed by PAI can yield clinically-relevant improvements in metabolic health parameters postoperatively.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p id="P20">This study has limitations. Less than half (48%) of participants initially randomized underwent BS, limiting sample size. However, investigators had no influence over participants&#x02019; BS decision-making process. Interestingly, 55% of PAI vs. 40% of SC had BS: while not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>=.107), this difference warrants additional research to determine whether preoperative interventions contribute to higher BS frequency, possibly through enhanced sense of preparation, motivation, and confidence in ability to adhere to postoperative behavioral recommendations. The small sample, variability in surgical procedures, and differences in number of participants between groups limited ability to test differences in weight loss between conditions. It is unclear whether intervention-related preoperative PA increases can be maintained or enhanced beyond 6-months postoperatively.</p><p id="P21">In summary, this study shows that BS patients can not only achieve marked increases in PA preoperatively with behavioral intervention, but can sustain these higher PA levels postoperatively. Preoperative PA intervention studies designed and sufficiently powered to test efficacy for enhancing and maintaining BS-related weight, metabolic, and quality of life outcomes are needed.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="FN1"><p id="P22"><bold>CONFLICT OF INTEREST</bold></p><p id="P23">The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></fn><fn
