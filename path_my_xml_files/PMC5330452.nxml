Extreme renal vasoconstriction characterizes hepatorenal syndrome, a functional and potentially reversible form of acute kidney injury in patients with advanced cirrhosis, but current therapy with systemic vasoconstrictors is ineffective in a substantial proportion of patients and is limited by ischemic adverse events. Serelaxin (recombinant human relaxin-2) is a peptide molecule with anti-fibrotic and vasoprotective properties that binds to relaxin family peptide receptor-1 (RXFP1) and has been shown to increase renal perfusion in healthy human volunteers. We hypothesized that serelaxin could ameliorate renal vasoconstriction and renal dysfunction in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and findings</title><p>To establish preclinical proof of concept, we developed two independent rat models of cirrhosis that were characterized by progressive reduction in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate and showed evidence of renal endothelial dysfunction. We then set out to further explore and validate our hypothesis in a phase 2 randomized open-label parallel-group study in male and female patients with alcohol-related cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Forty patients were randomized 1:1 to treatment with serelaxin intravenous (i.v.) infusion (for 60 min at 80 &#x003bc;g/kg/d and then 60 min at 30 &#x003bc;g/kg/d) or terlipressin (single 2-mg i.v. bolus), and the regional hemodynamic effects were quantified by phase contrast magnetic resonance angiography at baseline and after 120 min. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in total renal artery blood flow.</p><p>Therapeutic targeting of renal vasoconstriction with serelaxin in the rat models increased kidney perfusion, oxygenation, and function through reduction in renal vascular resistance, reversal of endothelial dysfunction, and increased activation of the AKT/eNOS/NO signaling pathway in the kidney. In the randomized clinical study, infusion of serelaxin for 120 min increased total renal arterial blood flow by 65% (95% CI 40%, 95%; <italic>p &#x0003c;</italic> 0.001) from baseline. Administration of serelaxin was safe and well tolerated, with no detrimental effect on systemic blood pressure or hepatic perfusion. The clinical study&#x02019;s main limitations were the relatively small sample size and stable, well-compensated population.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our mechanistic findings in rat models and exploratory study in human cirrhosis suggest the therapeutic potential of selective renal vasodilation using serelaxin as a new treatment for renal dysfunction in cirrhosis, although further validation in patients with more advanced cirrhosis and renal dysfunction is required.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01640964">NCT01640964</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>In a Research Article, Jonathan Fallowfield and colleagues study serelaxin as a possible treatment for renal vasoconstriction in liver cirrhosis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><sec id="sec005"><title>Why was this study done?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Hepatorenal syndrome type 1 is a rapidly progressive, but potentially reversible, form of acute kidney injury occurring in patients with liver cirrhosis, characterized by severe renal vasoconstriction and a very poor prognosis.

It occurs in response to portal hypertension (PHT) and the associated splanchnic arterial vasodilatation and impairment of cardiac function that lead to a reduction in effective circulating volume, with compensatory activation of neurohormonal systems and an intrarenal imbalance between vasoconstrictor and vasodilator systems causing increased renal vascular resistance (RVR) [<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Pooling of blood in the splanchnic circulation also alters gut permeability and enhances bacterial translocation, with the release of endotoxin and increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines leading to amplification of circulatory dysfunction [<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Imaging studies have shown a significant (~40%) reduction in renal blood flow (RBF) and redistribution of intrarenal blood flow in patients with compensated cirrhosis compared to healthy volunteers [<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. As cirrhosis advances, systemic hemodynamics are increasingly disturbed, RBF becomes progressively compromised, and patients are susceptible to episodes of AKI (including HRS) in response to precipitating factors, particularly bacterial infections [<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The median survival time for patients with the acute form of HRS (&#x0201c;type 1&#x0201d;) is only 4 wk, highlighting the need for an effective pharmacological treatment [<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Evidence also suggests that even relatively mild cases of AKI, insufficient to make a diagnosis of HRS, have a negative impact on patient survival, indicating that prompt and successful treatment of these episodes could lead to improved clinical outcomes [<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The most effective pharmacological treatment for HRS type 1 is terlipressin (a splanchnic and systemic vasoconstrictor). However, in a recent large randomized placebo-controlled trial, confirmed HRS reversal occurred in only 19.6% of patients receiving terlipressin, and the drug was permanently discontinued in 20.4% due to adverse (mainly ischemic) events [<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. An ideal treatment for HRS would consist of a drug with selective vasodilator activity in the renal circulation but without significant vasodilator effects in other vascular beds, particularly the splanchnic circulation.</p><p>The endogenous peptide hormone relaxin (RLX) regulates maternal hemodynamic adaptations in early pregnancy through direct actions on the renal and systemic vasculature, including reduced RVR, increased RBF, and increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) [<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Serelaxin (recombinant human relaxin-2) binds with high affinity to the G-protein-coupled receptor RXFP1, which is differentially expressed in the renal and systemic vasculature [<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and mediates vasoactive effects through a number of mechanisms including enhanced nitric oxide (NO) signaling and antagonism of the vasoconstrictive effects of angiotensin-II and endothelin [<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, in contrast to vasodilators such as nitroglycerin, which primarily act via direct venodilation, the vasorelaxatory action of serelaxin in rats is thought to predominantly affect arteries [<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We recently showed that administration of serelaxin in cirrhotic rats decreased PHT through augmentation of hepatic NO signaling and a reduction in intrahepatic vascular resistance [<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

To test our hypothesis, we first evaluated the effects of serelaxin in two independent experimental rat models of cirrhosis that were characterized by a progressive reduction in RBF and GFR and showed evidence of renal endothelial dysfunction. We then determined the translational relevance of these findings in an exploratory phase 2 clinical trial in patients with compensated cirrhosis and PHT who were randomized to treatment with serelaxin or terlipressin, followed by noninvasive hemodynamic assessments using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec010" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Experimental design</title><p>Our main objective was to use experimental and human models to establish proof of concept for serelaxin in modulating renal vasoconstriction and thereby its potential as a novel clinical therapy for renal dysfunction in cirrhosis.</p><p>Animal experiments were designed and implemented according to NC3Rs ARRIVE guidelines.

The main purpose of this study was to investigate the hemodynamic effects of serelaxin infusion on the renal and hepatic circulation, measured by phase contrast magnetic resonance angiography (PC-MRA), in patients with compensated alcohol-related cirrhosis and PHT. Terlipressin, a well-characterized drug licensed in many countries for treatment of variceal bleeding and HRS, was used as a positive control to validate the sensitivity and dynamic range of the PC-MRA methodology in this population. The study was not sized based on the power to detect a difference between the serelaxin and terlipressin groups. Instead, a sample size of 20 patients per group was calculated to be sufficient to create a 90% confidence interval (CI) on the mean change from baseline for all blood flow parameters that would exclude zero if a 25% change was observed.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Procedures involving animals were conducted with approval from the University of Edinburgh Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body and UK Home Office, and in compliance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.

Harvested vessels (extrarenal and intrarenal renal arteries) were placed in 4&#x000b0;C physiological salt solution (PSS) (119 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.17 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 25 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.18 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.026 mM K<sub>2</sub>EDTA, and 5.5 mM D-glucose). Extrarenal, segmental, and interlobar renal arteries were dissected and cleaned of connective tissue. Rings of 2 mm were mounted from each vessel segment onto 40-mm stainless steel wires, one end of which was attached to a force transducer, and the other to a micrometer. The vessel ring was bathed in PSS at 37&#x000b0;C and bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and stepwise radial stretching was performed to determine the lumen diameter necessary for optimal force generation. Vessel rings were then stretched to achieve 90% of the diameter expected if they had been fully relaxed and exposed to a transmural pressure of 13.3 kPa (100 mm Hg). The vessel ring was allowed to equilibrate for 30 min before viability was assessed using three stimulations with KPSS (125 mM K, equimolar substitution of NaCl with KCl in PSS), then activation for 2 min with each solution, followed by a 5-min washout period in PSS to allow full relaxation. Measurement of viability was performed in these vessels to confirm that isolation and mounting of the vessel did not damage the arterial wall. The ability of the vessel to respond to contractile and dilator agents was investigated by producing concentration&#x02013;response curves (CRCs). CRCs were obtained for phenylephrine (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup> to 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> M; Sigma-Aldrich), and a concentration that produced 80% maximum contraction (EC<sub>80</sub>) was chosen for each individual rat vessel ring.

For the flow measurements, the lumen of each vessel was carefully evaluated at the peak systolic phase image, and the area of the lumen was used as the region of interest for the flow and velocity quantification program (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002248.s014">S11 Fig</xref>), yielding values that represent average volumetric flow rate and peak systolic velocity within the vessel [<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The same magnetic resonance angiography scans were submitted to an imaging clinical research organization (Bioclinica) for archiving and for performing an additional exploratory analysis to compare the performance of another software platform that utilizes a fully automated image analysis algorithm. The RBF values and change from baseline data were highly correlated for both the serelaxin and terlipressin arms in comparison to the semi-automated approach. The use of an automated approach reduces reader bias and provides a platform to scale to evaluation of multicenter imaging data.</p></sec><sec id="sec035"><title>Biomarkers</title><p>All biomarker samples from the same patient were analyzed in the same batch by laboratory personnel at the central laboratory (Quintiles, UK) using commercially available assay kits.

Crucially, we went on to demonstrate the translational relevance of these findings by showing in patients with cirrhosis and PHT that serelaxin reduced RVR and caused a substantial increase in RBF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002248.g007">Fig 7</xref>).</p><p>In two pathologically distinct rat models, advancement of cirrhosis was associated with a progressive reduction in RBF and GFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002248.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The beneficial effects of serelaxin on RBF and GFR were dependent on an increase in renal NO signaling (as the effect was abrogated by co-treatment with L-NAME; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002248.g004">Fig 4</xref>) and were associated with downregulation of vasoconstrictor receptor expression in cirrhotic rat kidney (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002248.s013">S10 Fig</xref>). In contrast, administration of a nonselective nitrovasodilator induced hypotension and reduced RBF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002248.s012">S9 Fig</xref>), consistent with previous observations in human cirrhosis [<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Both acute (i.v. bolus; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002248.g005">Fig 5</xref>) and sustained (72-h s.c. infusion; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002248.g003">Fig 3</xref>) serelaxin treatment induced a significant increase in RBF in cirrhotic rats. However, the relative effect of serelaxin on GFR was even greater (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002248.g003">Fig 3</xref>). In both models the GFR was restored to near-normal levels and the FF increased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002248.s008">S5 Fig</xref>), suggesting a differential effect on afferent and efferent renal arteriolar tone. This is a significant observation because an increase in RBF by other renal vasodilators, such as dopamine, is not necessarily accompanied by an increase in GFR [<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Additionally, serelaxin may augment renal function by modifying other nonvasomotor factors, such as inflammation, that also contribute to renal dysfunction in cirrhosis [<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Indeed, previous studies have demonstrated that serelaxin is a vasoprotective molecule under conditions of acute inflammation/oxidative stress (reviewed in [<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]). In our preclinical cirrhosis models, serelaxin decreased the (elevated) serum levels of TNF&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002248.s013">S10 Fig</xref>), a pro-inflammatory cytokine heavily implicated in endothelial dysfunction. Moreover, co-incubation of TNF&#x003b1;-exposed aortic rings with serelaxin was shown to increase eNOS activity, attenuate arginase-II expression, and improve vasorelaxation [<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Both large and small renal arteries isolated from CCl<sub>4</sub> and BDL cirrhotic rats exhibited marked impairment in endothelium-dependent vasodilation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002248.g002">Fig 2</xref>), consistent with a study in human cirrhosis linking endothelial dysfunction with the development of renal vasoconstriction and renal failure [<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, 72-h serelaxin infusion restored renovascular function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002248.g003">Fig 3</xref>) and decreased RVR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002248.s008">S5 Fig</xref>). Taken together, our findings indicate that serelaxin, through a number of mechanisms, modulated renal arterial endothelial responsiveness in cirrhosis in favor of vasodilatation.</p><p>Notably, serelaxin treatment also decreased transcription of the vasoconstriction-related genes <italic>Ednra</italic> and <italic>Uts2r</italic> in cirrhotic rat kidneys (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002248.s013">S10 Fig</xref>). Endothelin receptor A is a smooth muscle receptor that mediates increased vascular tone after stimulation by endothelin-I whereas urotensin-II is a potent vasoconstrictor of large conductive vessels but, paradoxically, relaxes mesenteric vessels. Circulating levels of urotensin-II are elevated in human cirrhosis, and a urotensin-II receptor antagonist reduced PP and increased RBF in BDL rats [<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>The levels of transcripts for the cognate receptor for human relaxin-2 (<italic>Rxfp1</italic>) were increased in whole kidney and renal artery extracts in cirrhotic rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002248.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Furthermore, RXFP1 protein localized to renal vessels (endothelium and smooth muscle) and perivascular adventitial cells in both rat and human kidney (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002248.s007">S4 Fig</xref>). Investigation of differential expression of RXFP1 and relative dilator sensitivity to serelaxin in the afferent and efferent renal arterioles (e.g., by videomicroscopy) is an interesting topic for future study. Moreover, the factors that regulate renal parenchymal and arterial expression of RXFP1 in animal models and human disease are unknown, although a recent study showed that &#x003b1;1- and &#x003b2;1-adrenoceptors regulated cardiac expression of RXFP1 in mice [<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Encouraged by preclinical studies, we undertook an exploratory trial in patients with compensated cirrhosis and PHT. The hemodynamic changes induced by terlipressin were consistent with its known activity as a potent splanchnic and systemic vasoconstrictor and validated the use of PC-MRA in this population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002248.g007">Fig 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002248.s015">S1 Table</xref>). Infusion of serelaxin for 120 min achieved similar steady-state serum concentrations to those observed in our 72-h rat cirrhosis models and in human heart failure following 48-h i.v. infusion [<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Baseline RBF levels in our cirrhosis population were lower than that reported in a large series of healthy volunteers (0.838 &#x000b1; 0.244 l/min), measured using PC-MRA [<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Serelaxin treatment elicited a selective, highly significant, and clinically relevant increase in total RBF that was associated with a substantial reduction in RVR but only a small increase in superior aortic flow, as a surrogate of increased CO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002248.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Effects on key secondary outcomes included a nonsignificant decrease in portal venous flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002248.g007">Fig 7</xref>), but, importantly, total hepatic blood flow was preserved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002248.s015">S1 Table</xref>)&#x02014;in contrast to splanchnic vasoconstrictors such as terlipressin that further compromise hepatic perfusion in cirrhosis and may impair organ function. Additionally, there was no increase in SMA flow or azygos flow and, critically, no detrimental effects on blood pressure or increase in circulating NO levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002248.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Interestingly, our demonstration of differential visceral blood flow responses in cirrhotic patients using MRI are consistent with the preclinical literature, which has revealed that serelaxin preferentially dilates constricted vessels and exerts quite heterogeneous responses across distinct regions of the vasculature [<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>There are limitations to our study that merit discussion. It should be acknowledged that there is no ideal animal model of renal dysfunction in cirrhosis (especially HRS), and therefore one must be cautious regarding the generalizability of preclinical observations. However, our findings in CCl<sub>4</sub> and BDL rats corroborate clinical data showing that advancement of hepatic fibrosis is associated with progressive renal vasoconstriction and functional impairment&#x02014;seen at its most extreme in HRS [<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Moreover, BDL is considered a suitable model of human HRS [<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and was recently shown to share innate immune defects and clinical characteristics with acutely decompensated cirrhosis in patients [<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Although we and others [<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] observed features of ATN in rat BDL kidneys, emerging histological and biomarker studies indicate that tubular injuries are frequently present in cirrhotic patients with renal dysfunction [<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The primary objectives of our clinical study were to define the hemodynamic effects and safety profile of serelaxin in patients with cirrhosis and PHT. Although this exploratory trial was (necessarily) open-label, we ensured that outcome assessors were blinded to treatment allocation to avoid potential bias. Additionally, MRA scans were reanalyzed by an independent clinical research organization using a fully automated approach to completely eliminate possible reader bias; automated and semi-automated data were highly correlated. It should also be noted that the study population consisted of patients with well-compensated cirrhosis and PHT, but without significant impairment of renal function. Further studies are now required in patients with more advanced cirrhosis and renal dysfunction to link the substantial increase in RBF we observed with serelaxin to improvements in renal function and patient outcomes. Recent clinical data provide encouragement in this regard. First, the pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of serelaxin were not affected in patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment [<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Second, serelaxin had a beneficial effect on renal biomarkers (creatinine and cystatin C) and survival in patients with acute heart failure [<xref rid="pmed.1002248.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>In summary, our mechanistic findings in rat models and exploratory study in human cirrhosis suggest a potential therapeutic role for serelaxin in the treatment of renal dysfunction in cirrhosis and possibly other human conditions where RBF or endothelial function is compromised.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec054"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002248.s001"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>Graphical raw data.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002248.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002248.s002"><label>S2 Appendix</label><caption><title>Blot raw data.</title><p>(ZIP)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002248.s002.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002248.s003"><label>S3 Appendix</label><caption><title>Image raw data.</title><p>(ZIP)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002248.s003.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002248.s004"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Characterization of rat cirrhosis models.</title><p>(A) Representative rat liver stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E) and picrosirius red (PSR) (scale bar 200 &#x003bc;m) in 8- and 16-wk olive oil (OO)-treated and CCl<sub>4</sub>-treated rats (<italic>n =</italic> 6&#x02013;12) showing necroinflammation (arrowheads) and accumulation of fibrillar collagen (arrows).
