Subjects with allergic rhinitis with or without mild/moderate asthma sensitized to <italic>A alternata </italic>and who also had a positive skin prick test to Alt a1 were randomized to treatment with placebo (n = 18) or purified natural Alt a1 (n = 22) subcutaneously for 12 months. Bronchial responsiveness to adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) and methacholine, exhaled nitric oxide (ENO), exhaled breath condensate (EBC) pH, and serum Alt a1-specific IgG<sub>4 </sub>antibodies were measured at baseline and after 6 and 12 months of treatment.

Clinically and for research purposes, airway responsiveness is measured by bronchial challenge, usually with methacholine or histamine[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]; however, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) has been introduced as a bronchoconstrictive stimulus more recently. Whereas histamine and methacholine act by a direct effect on the relevant receptors on airway smooth muscle stimulating airway muscle contraction directly, AMP-induced bronchoconstriction occurs predominantly indirectly, causing "primed" mast cells degranulation and the release of histamine and other mediators with subsequent smooth muscle contraction[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. It has been suggested that the bronchial responsiveness to inhaled AMP may reflect changes in airway inflammation induced by allergen exposure[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] or by allergen immunotherapy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] with greater precision and sensitivity than the response to direct bronchoconstrictor agents.</p><p>Increased concentrations of exhaled nitric oxide (ENO)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and acidification of exhaled breath condensate (EBC)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] have been demonstrated in asthma. In addition, both ENO and EBC pH are correlated with the number of eosinophils in the lower respiratory tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Therefore, these parameters have been proposed as markers of airway inflammation and disease severity in asthma[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p><italic>Alternaria alternata </italic>is considered one of the most important aeroallergens in the United States[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and in Europe[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Moreover, sensitization to <italic>A alternata </italic>has been associated with severe cases of asthma and respiratory arrest[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. One of the major difficulties for allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT) with fungal extracts arises from the variability and complexity of fungal organism, with the subsequent difference in composition and allergenic potency of commercial extracts[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Although <italic>A alternata </italic>contains several different allergens, Alt a1 represents by far the most important with greater than 90% of sensitized individuals having IgE antibody against this allergen[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Therefore, immunotherapy with Alt a1 alone may well suffice to improve manifestations of sensitization to the entire allergen composition of <italic>A alternata</italic>. The mechanism of action of SIT is not definitively established, but it might be consequence of treatment-induced changes on the underlying immunological mechanisms with the subsequent beneficial effect on allergen-induced airway inflammation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Thus, the identification of the effect of SIT on airway responsiveness and inflammation might represent a relevant support to the efficacy of treatment in clinical studies. The effect of SIT on airway responsiveness to direct bronchoconstrictor agents has been determined in a limited number of controlled studies, and the results of these investigations have been inconsistent[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, however, only two studies have determined the effect of SIT on airway responsiveness to indirect bronchoconstrictor agents such as cold dry air[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and inhaled AMP[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Additionally, little is known about the effect of SIT on ENO[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and no information is available about the effect of SIT on EBC pH.</p><p>The aims of this pilot study were to determine the safety of SIT with purified natural Alt a1 and to evaluate its effects on airway responsiveness and inflammatory markers in exhaled air and EBC in subjects with respiratory allergy (allergic rhinitis with or without asthma) sensitized to this allergen. The primary outcomes were the airway responsiveness to AMP, ENO values and side effects. Secondary outcomes included lung function, airway responsiveness to methacholine, and EBC pH.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Male and nonpregnant female subjects 9 - 60 yrs of age with allergic rhinitis, with or without mild/moderate asthma, and skin sensitization to both <italic>A alternata </italic>and Alt a1 (3 &#x003bc;g/mL, Diater Laboratories, Madrid, Spain) were recruited from the allergy clinic of our institution. Sensitization was confirmed by skin prick test (weal &#x02265;3 mm) with both <italic>A alternata </italic>extract and purified natural Alt a1 (Diater Laboratories S A, Madrid, Spain). Asthma was identified by the presence of symptoms of wheeze, breathlessness and cough plus methacholine airway hyperresponsiveness with a PC<sub>20 </sub>(provocative concentration required to produce a 20% fall in FEV<sub>1</sub>) of less than 8 mg/ml if the FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC was 70% or greater or an improvement of the FEV<sub>1 </sub>from predicted of 15% or greater after 200 &#x003bc;g of inhaled salbutamol if the FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC was less than 70%. Subjects with allergic rhinitis were defined as those individuals with a characteristic history of rhinitis (rhinorrhea, sneezing, obstruction, and pruritus). All asthmatic subjects were well-controlled for at least 3 months by treatment with inhaled &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>agonists on demand or with a daily dose of beclomethasone dipropionate &#x02264;1000 &#x003bc;g or equivalent. In the 3 months before the study, patients had asthma symptoms no more than twice a week, did not wake at night because of asthma and did not suffer asthma exacerbation. They had no changes in their dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in the last 3 months, and FEV<sub>1 </sub>al baseline had to be &#x0003e;70% of predicted. All patients were nonsmokers, and none had history of chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or respiratory tract infections during the 4 weeks before the study. Current smokers and patients with significant renal, hepatic, or cardiovascular disease were specifically excluded. The study protocol (DIA-ALE-2004-01) was approved by the ethics committee of the Hospital Universitario Dr Peset and the health authorities. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient or their parents before participation.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This was a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Upon entry of patients into the study, a detailed history was taken and physical examination, spirometry, ENO, and bronchial challenges with methacholine and AMP were carried out; EBC and blood samples were also obtained. Methacholine and AMP challenges were conducted on separate days with the order of challenge randomized. Patients were then randomized to receive either active treatment consisting of increasing doses of purified natural Alt a1 adsorbed in aluminium hydroxide (Diater SA, Madrid, Spain) given subcutaneously, followed by monthly maintenance treatment or placebo (aluminium hydroxide gel). A maintenance dose of 0.2 &#x003bc;g was achieved in all participants. Extracts for immunotherapy were reconstituted on the day of administration and single-dose vials were used. Patients returned to the laboratory after 6 and 12 months of treatment. In each period, the same determinations performed at baseline were repeated.</p><p>The dose of intranasal or ICS (if used) was maintained unchanged during the study. Salbutamol metered-dose inhaler, oral antihistamines and intranasal antihistamines were used on an "as-needed" basis to control pulmonary or nasal symptoms, respectively. No other medications were allowed to be used during the study. Subjects were asked not to take ICS for 12 hours, salbutamol for at least 6 hours, oral antihistamines for at least 72 hours and intranasal antihistamines for at least 24 hours before each study visit.</p></sec><sec><title>Study outcome variables</title><sec><title>Inhalation challenge tests</title><p>Lung function was measured using a calibrated pneumotachograph (Jaeger MasterScope; Erich Jaeger GmbH; W&#x000fc;rzburg, Germany) according to standardized guidelines[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].

However, the treatment was not associated with significant reductions in methacholine and AMP responsiveness or with significant modifications of ENO and EBC pH values. These findings suggest that SIT-induced changes in allergen-specific IgG<sub>4 </sub>concentrations are not necessarily associated with improvements in airway responsiveness, ENO or EBC pH values.</p><p>At the time of writing, there has been only one published study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] on the effect of SIT on airway responsiveness to AMP. In a group of non-asthmatic subjects with allergic rhinitis monosensitized to <italic>Parietaria judaica</italic>, Polosa et al[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] reported that SIT with Parietaria pollen extract for two years was associated with a significant protection against the seasonal deterioration of airway responsiveness to AMP, whereas no significant effect was observed on bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine. By contrast, our results demonstrated that AMP responsiveness changed in response to treatment with SIT to a similar extent than did methacholine responsiveness. Differences in patient characteristics, study design, allergen administrated for SIT, duration of treatment and challenge methods between the study by Polosa et al[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and the present study preclude a proper comparison. However, from our results it is evident that SIT with Alt a1 does not induce significant changes in AMP responsiveness.</p><p>On the other hand, SIT appears to have no effect on airway responsiveness to methacholine. This confirms the results of other controlled trials investigating the effect of SIT administered by subcutaneous injection on methacholine responsiveness in subjects with respiratory allergy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. By contrast, other investigations identified a significant improvement in methacholine responsiveness after SIT with house dust mites[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] or pollen allergens[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Reasons to such discrepancies are not evident, but might be related to differences in patients' characteristics, to diversity in the disease activity in the subjects studied, to differences in the characteristics of the allergenic extract administered, or to important differences in the statistical analysis.</p><p>It has been hypothesized that SIT results in a deviation in the T lymphocyte response and a modified T<sub>H2 </sub>response. An increase in T-regulatory cells contributes to this process, and their production of IL-10 and TGF-&#x003b2; favors the suppression of IgE production and the increase in IgG<sub>4 </sub>antibodies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Additionally, it has been suggested that allergen-specific IgG<sub>4 </sub>antibodies have the potential to reduce early responses to allergen by blocking Fc&#x003b5;-dependent mast cell activation and release of performed mediators[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The results of our study clearly demonstrate that SIT with purified natural Alt a1 is associated with a highly significant increase in allergen-specific IgG<sub>4 </sub>level. However, the increase in serum concentrations of allergen-specific IgG<sub>4 </sub>antibodies in our patients was not associated with a decrease in the response to AMP, an indirect bronchoconstrictor that induces obstruction by stimulation of A<sub>2</sub>-purinoceptors on mast cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, no significant correlation was detected between SIT-induced modifications in allergen-specific IgG<sub>4 </sub>antibodies and AMP responsiveness. These results suggest that allergen-specific IgG<sub>4 </sub>has no potential to downregulate non IgE-dependent mast cell responses.</p><p>In our subjects with respiratory allergy, we did not detect an affect of SIT on ENO levels. These data are consistent with those of two previous studies performed in children[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. However, this is the first study (to our knowledge) to examine the question of an effect of SIT on EBC pH. In the group of subjects treated with SIT, there was a significant decrease in EBC pH, compared with values at baseline, after 6 months of treatment. However, a decrease in EBC pH was also detected in the placebo group, although it did not reach statistical significance. Furthermore, differences in modifications of EBC pH between the two groups were no significant. Therefore, we believe that the decrease in EBC pH might be consequence of unidentified technical or nontechnical factors and that SIT with Alt a1 does not affect EBC pH values, either positively or negatively. Because ENO and EBC pH have been proposed as procedures for the evaluation of airway inflammation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], our results might be interpreted as an additional argument for the absence of effect of SIT on airway inflammation. However, the correlation between ENO and direct measures of airway inflammation have been of relatively small magnitude[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and therefore the precise mechanism(s) that link(s) nitric oxide with eosinophilic airway inflammation, and whether elevated ENO concentrations are caused by enhanced activity of eosinophils or by enhanced diffusion through the airway wall due to structural damage, remain to be elucidated. In addition, it must be acknowledged that the interpretation of EBC pH is controversial due to technical factors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], and there is a debate as to whether orally collected EBC pH assays reflect acidification of the lower airways[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p><p>There were some methodological problems and limitations to this study, which are important to consider. First, a significant proportion of our patients were taking inhaled corticosteroids. Given the beneficial effect of inhaled corticosteroids on pulmonary function, airway responsiveness, ENO and EBC pH, it could be argued that the effects of SIT with Alt a1 might be different in subjects not treated concomitantly with ICS. Therefore, it would be of interest to repeat this type of study in steroid-na&#x000ef;ve subjects. Second, natural allergen exposure during each study period was not controlled and we cannot discard that the lack of effect of SIT with Alt a1 on airway responsiveness or airway inflammation might be consequence of a low level of natural allergen exposure. Therefore, the resuls of this study might be different in subjects sensitized to <italic>A alternata </italic>tested during a period of high ambiental allergen exposure. Third, our patients had mild airway responsiveness. Therefore, the lack of effect of SIT on methacholine and AMP responsiveness might be consequence of the low degree of airway responsiveness in our population. Finally, it is worth noting that most of our patients with <italic>A alternata </italic>allergy were also sensitized to other perennial or seasonal allergens. This situation closely emulates what might happen in the normal clinical setting in which monosensitization to <italic>A alternata </italic>is exceptionally detected. However, we acknowledge that the results of this study might not be applicable to subjects monosensitized to <italic>A alternata</italic>.</p><p>A favourable safety profile was demonstrated. The majority of the reactions involved erythema and swelling in the vicinity of the injection sites consistent with local allergic reactions or mild trauma caused by the aluminum hydroxide suspension. Systemic reactions were infrequent and mild and occurred with similar prevalence in the two groups. Additionally, the fact that all subjects continued therapy with either the same or higher doses without further problems indicates that the preparation is generally well tolerated. By contrast, although a recent study stated that, in subjects monosensitized to <italic>A alternata</italic>, SIT with a standardized extract was well tolerated[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], it has been reported that SIT with a standardized whole extract of <italic>Alternaria </italic>induces systemic reactions in 19% to 40% of patients[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] and in 2% of injections[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Therefore, it appears that the safety profile of SIT with Alt a1 is superior to that detected with a conventional standardized extract of <italic>Alternaria</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Although SIT with Alt a1 is well tolerated and induces an allergen-specific IgG<sub>4 </sub>response, treatment-induced changes in airway responsiveness to direct and indirect bronchoconstrictor agents, ENO and EBC pH values are no significant. These findings should no necessarily be interpreted as demonstrative of the lack of clinical efficacy, because immunotherapy-induced changes in airway responsiveness or in inflammatory markers have correlated poorly with clinical responses to treatment[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>L Prieto has served as consultant to GSK, Novartis and Stallergenes, and has received grant founding from GSK and Novartis; R Palacios and D Aldana are employees of Diater Laboratorios SA; A Ferrer, C Perez-Frances and R Rojas have no conflict of interest to disclose.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LP and RP devised the idea of the study and designed the methods; DA performed laboratory methods; LP wrote manuscript drafts, was responsible for data management and statistical analyses, and is the guarantor; AF, CPF, VL, RR and LP were responsible for implementing the study.
