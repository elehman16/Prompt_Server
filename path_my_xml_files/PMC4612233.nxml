<bold>Background:</bold> The guidewire biliary cannulation (GWC) technique may increase the cannulation rate and decrease the risk for post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis. The aim of our multicenter prospective randomized controlled trial was to determine if the use of an atraumatic loop-tip guidewire reduces the rate of post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP) compared with the standard contrast-assisted cannulation (CC) technique. </p><p>
<bold>Methods:</bold> From June 2012 to December 2013, a total of 320 patients who had a na&#x000ef;ve papilla and were referred for ERCP were randomly assigned to the GWC group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;160) or the CC group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;160). GWC or CC was randomly used. In cases of failed cannulation in both arms after crossover, biliary access was attempted with alternative techniques (e.&#x0200a;g., dual-wire technique, pancreatic duct stenting, precut). </p><p>
<bold>Results:</bold> The biliary cannulation rates were 81&#x0200a;% in the GWC group and 73&#x0200a;% in the CC group (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;n.&#x0200a;s.). Following crossover, cannulation was successful in 8&#x0200a;% and 11&#x0200a;% of patients in the GWC and CC groups, respectively. With use of an alternative technique, the cannulation rates were 98&#x0200a;% in the GWC group and 96&#x0200a;% in the CC group, respectively. The rates of PEP were 5&#x0200a;% in the GWC group and 12&#x0200a;% in the CC group (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.027). The post-interventional complication rates did not differ between the two groups. </p><p>
<bold>Conclusion:</bold> GWC with the new wire guide is associated with a lower rate of PEP in comparison with the CC technique.</p><p>Clinical trial reference number: NCT01771419</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acute pancreatitis remains the most frequent and dreaded complication after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), with rates ranging from 2&#x0200a;% to 40&#x0200a;% in published series <xref rid="JR261-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>

<xref rid="JR261-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Although in most cases post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP) manifests as a mild, uneventful disease requiring 2 to 3 days of additional hospitalization with an expected full recovery, severe pancreatitis is a devastating occurrence fraught with a significant mortality rate. Several risk factors for ERCP-related complications have been clearly identified, and various strategies have been proposed aimed at reducing the risk for PEP <xref rid="JR261-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="JR261-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</p><p>Repeated attempts at cannulation and increased pressure within the pancreatic duct (PD) due to contrast injection into the main PD result in trauma to the papilla and are major risk factors for PEP <xref rid="JR261-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Other factors shown to increase the risk for PEP include female sex, younger age, and sphincter of Oddi dysfunction.</p><p>Various pharmacological agents, including corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, somatostatin analogues, and protease inhibitors, have been investigated; however, the benefit and advisability of their routine use remain uncertain <xref rid="JR261-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="JR261-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. As well, various procedural techniques, such as the insertion of pancreatic stents or the use of pure cut electrocautery for sphincterotomy, have been suggested to minimize the development of PEP, but most studies have produced nonconfirmatory data. </p><p>Most nonrandomized and randomized studies have compared the effectiveness of guidewire-assisted cannulation (GWC) with that of contrast-assisted cannulation (CC) for the prevention of PEP but are restricted to low risk patients, and the results so far are conflicting <xref rid="JR261-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>

However, this cannulation technique carries a risk for false passage, intramural dissection, perforation, and PD injury <xref rid="JR261-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>.</p><p>Recently, a new wire guide with an atraumatic loop tip has been marketed (Fusion LoopTip Wire Guide; Cook Medical, Bloomington, Indiana, USA). The design of the device may reduce injury to the pancreatic and bile ducts during cannulation attempts.</p><p>The aim of this study was to assess if this atraumatic loop-tip guidewire reduces the occurrence of PEP (the primary end point). As a secondary end point, we evaluated whether the use of a loop-tip guidewire increases the rate of CBD cannulation in patients at higher risk for developing PEP in comparison with the CC technique.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>Between June 2012 to December 2013, a prospective study was carried out at eight Italian tertiary referral endoscopy centers. The study protocol was conducted in accordance with the principles of good clinical practice and the Declaration of Helsinki (clinical trials reference number NCT01771419), and the institutional review boards of the hospitals approved the study protocol. All patients provided written informed consent to take part in the study. Eleven endoscopists with experience of more than 150 ERCPs per year conducted the procedures (E.M., B.M., C.L., E.L., P.C., G.M., P.V., F.R., A.M., C.V., and P.A.T.). All of the endoscopists used both methods (GWC and CC) to cannulate the CBD.</p><sec><title>Fusion loop-tip guidewire</title><p>The loop-tip wire was developed to assist in cannulating the bile and pancreatic ducts and in bridging difficult strictures during ERCP. The wire has a closed distal loop that causes less trauma to the pancreaticobiliary ductal system during access. The coil is radiopaque with optimal fluoroscopic visibility. Like other types of wire, the loop-tip guidewire has spiral markings extending to the distal end, which provide an endoscopic view of its movement during cannulation. The core of the guidewire is made of nitinol for kink resistance and shape retention.</p></sec><sec><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>All consecutive patients 18 years of age or older were considered for inclusion if they met the following criteria: were able to comply with the study procedures and provide written informed consent; had received a diagnosis of a pancreaticobiliary disease and been referred for ERCP; had an intact papilla and one or more risk factors for the development of PEP (CBD diameter &#x0003c;&#x0200a;10&#x0200a;mm, previous episode of acute pancreatitis or recurrent acute pancreatitis, sphincter of Oddi dysfunction type 1, female sex). The diagnosis of a pancreaticobiliary disorder was based on clinical and laboratory data and findings on computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and/or endoscopic ultrasound.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were the following: age younger than 18 years; previous sphincterotomy; previous endoscopic papillary balloon dilation; plastic or metal biliary stent placement; esophageal or gastroduodenal stenting; pancreatic or ampullary carcinoma; prior Billroth II gastrectomy; intradiverticular papilla; duodenal stenosis; contraindications to endoscopy; acute illness (hypotension [blood pressure &#x0003c;&#x0200a;90&#x0200a;mmHg], hypoxemia [SaO<sub>2</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;95&#x0200a;%], hemodynamic instability); coagulopathy (platelet count &#x0003c;&#x0200a;50&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;10<sup>9</sup>/L, international normalized ratio &#x0003e;&#x0200a;1.5); inability or refusal to give written informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>Before ERCP, enrolled patients were randomly allocated to one of two groups (GWC group or CC group) on the basis of a sealed envelope method used by a physician who was not involved in performing ERCP or in the critical care of the patients.

<bold>Guidewire cannulation group:</bold> In the GWC group, the sphincterotome was preloaded with a 0.035-in loop-tip guidewire (<xref rid="FI261-1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x0200a;1</xref>). The sphincterotome was oriented from the 11- to the 12-o&#x02019;clock position on the papilla and bent to align it correctly with the bile duct axis. After a minimal insertion (2&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;3&#x0200a;mm) of the sphincterotome across the ampulla, the guidewire was carefully advanced through the CBD under fluoroscopy until it was seen entering the bile duct (<xref rid="FI261-2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x0200a;2</xref>). In cases of PD cannulation, the guidewire was withdrawn, and attempts were made to redirect it toward the CBD. Such attempts were continued for no longer than 5 minutes or up to five unintentional cannulations of the PD. If biliary cannulation was achieved through guidewire insertion, contrast medium was injected, whereas in a case of failure, the patient was crossed over to the CC technique for a time limit of 5 minutes or for a maximum of three repeated, unintentional contrast injections or cannulations of the main PD. </p><fig id="FI261-1"><label>Fig.&#x0200a;1</label><caption><p>

<bold>Contrast-assisted cannulation group:</bold> In the CC group, the sphincterotome was used to cannulate the CBD directly, with its position adjusted to the correct axis for bile duct cannulation (<xref rid="FI261-3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x0200a;3</xref>). If direct cannulation was not achieved, contrast opacifications were performed to visualize the CBD, and the sphincterotome was deeply reinserted under cholangiographic guidance. Such attempts were continued for 5 minutes or for a maximum of three unintentional PD opacifications or cannulations. If the procedure did not succeed with the CC method at the first attempt, patients were crossed over to the GWC technique with the loop-tip guidewire, and the endoscopist attempted to cannulate for no longer than 5 minutes or five accidental main PD cannulations.</p><fig id="FI261-3"><label>Fig.&#x0200a;3</label><caption><p>

<xref rid="JR261-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, the incidence of PEP was significantly lower with the GWC technique than with the CC technique. The overall rate of PEP was 8.4&#x0200a;% (27/320 patients), slightly higher than that in previously published data (mean rate of 5.5&#x0200a;%) <xref rid="JR261-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>

<xref rid="JR261-22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. A possible explanation is that our study included only patients at high risk for PEP. We allowed five chances of main PD cannulation for the GWC group and three chances for the CC group only for the study protocol. However, despite our having selected only high risk patients, the rate of PEP in the GWC group was 5&#x0200a;%, similar to that previously reported in the literature (mean rate of 4.7&#x0200a;%) <xref rid="JR261-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>

The loop-shaped tip may facilitate passage through the epithelial folds of the intraduodenal biliary segments, reducing possible trauma, whereas standard guidewire tips may become stuck in the epithelial folds or cause flexion of the intraduodenal biliary segments, increasing the risk for papillary trauma during attempts at CBD cannulation.</p><p>Trauma to the papilla resulting from repeated attempts at cannulation and/or increased pressure within the PD due to contrast injection are major risk factors for PEP; however, other factors have also been shown to increase the risk for PEP, include female sex, younger age, sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, and pancreatic interventions, such as pancreatic sphincterotomy <xref rid="JR261-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="JR261-23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>.</p><p>Several mechanisms have been postulated to explain how PEP is prevented with the GWC technique. They include facilitated selective biliary cannulation, limited papillary trauma, and minimized inadvertent injection of contrast into the PD or the papilla itself, which reduce potential mechanical, chemical, and hydrostatic injury to the pancreas in comparison with the CC technique. However, inadvertent guidewire insertion into the PD may result in injury to the papilla or the PD, increasing the likelihood of PEP. </p><p>This finding was evident in our study; however, multivariate analysis identified only the number of pancreatic cannulations at the primary attempt as an independent risk factor for PEP in the GWC group.&#x0200a;Parameters inducing trauma to the papilla, such as the number of attempts at CBD cannulation, number of attempts at biliary cannulation at crossover and precut, and number of pancreatic opacifications with use of the CC technique at crossover, were identified as risk factors for PEP only on univariate analysis in the GWC group.</p><p>In the CC group, in accordance with the findings of previous studies <xref rid="JR261-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="JR261-23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, on multivariate analysis only pancreatic sphincterotomy and the placement of a nasobiliary drain were found to be independent risks factors for PEP.</p><p>As in the study of Nambu et al. <xref rid="JR261-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, in our series the GWC technique showed no significant advantage over the CC technique with regard to the success rate of biliary cannulation. This finding might be related to the fact that only experienced endoscopists with similar skill levels for both GWC and CC were involved in the study. Risks associated with the GWC technique include perforation of the bile duct, PD, and duodenum by the guidewire.</p><p>The studies comparing CC with standard GWC of the common bile duct are summarized in <xref rid="TB261-3" ref-type="table">Table&#x0200a;3</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="TB261-3"><label><bold>Table&#x0200a;3</bold></label><caption><title>Summary of studies comparing contrast cannulation (CC) with standard guidewire cannulation (GWC) of the common bile duct, reported in the discussion.</title></caption><table rules="all"><col width="24*"/><col width="12*"/><col width="18*"/><col width="20*"/><col width="18*"/><col width="16*"/><thead><tr><td/><td>Patients</td><td>Post-ERCP pancreatitis, %</td><td>Primary cannulation, %</td><td>Precut, %</td><td>Complications, %</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Non-crossover trials</td><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">&#x02003;Lella et al. <xref rid="JR261-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
