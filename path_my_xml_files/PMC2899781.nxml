objectives</title><p>Cancer-related pain affects approximately 9 million people worldwide. As cancer progresses, an increasing fraction of patients require treatment with potent opioids, which may be administered via several routes. Opioid medication is frequently used for the pain suffered by palliative care patients with malignancies. However, morphine and related opioids are associated with various side effects: constipation, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, urinary retention, and so forth.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ce-4-247">1</xref> Constipation is the most commonly occurring adverse effect of chronic opioid therapy in patients with advanced cancer.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ce-4-247">2</xref> It is an almost inevitable consequence of opioid use in cancer and nonmalignant disease states. Schug and colleagues showed that in patients with cancer, constipation and vomiting were the most common adverse effects associated with opioid therapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ce-4-247">3</xref> Unlike other adverse effects of opioid therapy, constipation is one of the side effects of opioids to which tolerance rarely develops.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ce-4-247">4</xref> In most cases this problem is managed with stool softeners and laxatives. Presently, with the introduction of methylnaltrexone, it seems possible that a novel peripherally acting opioid antagonist can provide causal treatment for opioid-induced constipation (OIC), yet not interfere with the analgesic effect.</p><p>This review seeks to assess the scientific rationale for using methylnaltrexone to treat opioid-induced constipation and to discuss the current evidence for its therapeutic use.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a literature search on April 30, 2009 with OVID&#x02019;s <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ovid.com">http://www.ovid.com</ext-link> interface of the following databases: MEDLINE (including Medline in Process and other nonindexed citations) 1950 to April 30, 2009, the multifile database EBM Reviews (including Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database) 1st quarter 2009, and BIOSIS Previews 1969 to 2009 Week 30.

Current pharmacotherapy is based on the World Health Organization (WHO) concept of an analgesic ladder.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ce-4-247">5</xref> The ladder suggests that clinicians should start with a non-opioid and, if pain is not controlled, progress to a weak opioid and then to a strong opioid. For patients with moderate to severe pain, oral morphine is conventionally the opioid of choice.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ce-4-247">6</xref> The WHO analgesic ladder has been extensively validated and guidelines for the use of oral morphine have been presented.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ce-4-247">7</xref> This framework of principles allows for flexibility in the choice of analgesics. It is one part of a comprehensive strategy for managing cancer pain. Some types of pain, such as neuropathic pain, may be less responsive to opioids than other types of pain, such as nociceptive, soft tissue pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ce-4-247">8</xref> Morphine still is the drug of choice for managing moderate to severe cancer pain. No drug has been shown to have greater analgesic efficacy. Morphine is also the most cost effective analgesic. Consequently, in 2005 opioids were prescribed about 365 million times worldwide.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ce-4-247">9</xref></p><p>Successful opioid-therapy requires that the benefits of analgesia clearly outweigh treatment-related adverse effects. This implies that a detailed understanding of adverse opioid effects and the strategies used to prevent and manage them are essential skills for all involved in cancer pain management. Constipation and nausea are the most incriminating side effects of opioid treatment. There is striking variability in individual sensitivity to the adverse effects from morphine and other opioid drugs. Genetic variability clearly affects the sensitivity to opioid analgesia, particularly with regard to codeine, dihydrocodeine and possibly, oxycodone. And it is reasonable to assume that genetic backgrounds play a similarly important role in the predisposition to adverse effects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ce-4-247">10</xref> These side effects should be kept in mind when patients are being treated with strong analgesics such as opioids and the treatment guidelines mentioned above should be followed.</p><p>Opioid-induced bowel dysfunction is increasingly recognized as a significant clinical problem and pathophysiological principles have been elucidated. Opioids inhibit propulsive gastrointestinal motility.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ce-4-247">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ce-4-247">12</xref> Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that opiods have immunomodulatory effects,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ce-4-247">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ce-4-247">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ce-4-247">14</xref> eg, the extended phase of postoperative ileus is caused by an enteric inflammatory response and recruitment of leucocytes to the muscularis of the bowel wall. Leucocytes produce the main inhibitory neurotransmitter of the gastrointestinal tract, nitric oxide, through the activity of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ce-4-247">15</xref> Opioids potentate iNOS induction and nitric oxide release from phagocytes;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ce-4-247">16</xref> therefore, blockage of this opioid-mediated response might be of specific use in reversing postoperative ileus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ce-4-247">11</xref> Opioid-induced bowel dysfunction can lead to various gastrointestinal complications ranging from mild discomfort to fecal impaction, pseudo-obstruction, and bowel perforation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ce-4-247">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ce-4-247">18</xref> A recent survey suggests that severe opioid bowel dysfunction reduces the value of pain relief by more than 30%. In fact, many patients expressed a preference for uncontrolled pain over well-controlled pain with severe gastrointestinal adverse effects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ce-4-247">17</xref></p><p>Opioid-induced constipation can be exacerbated by metabolic alterations (diabetes, hypercalcemia, hypokalemia, uremia, hypothyreoidism), dehydratation, advanced age, reduced physical activity or immobility, low-fluid and/or low-fiber intake, difficulty reaching the bathroom, mechanical obstruction, neurological disorders, autonomic failure, drugs with anticholinergic action such as odansetron, diuretics, anticonvulsants, iron, vinca alkaloids, benzodiazepines and some antihypertensive drugs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ce-4-247">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ce-4-247">19</xref> The adverse effects of the other medications may be synergistic or cumulative to those associated with opioid medications and be due to an alteration in opioid absorption, metabolism or clearance of the opioid analgesics.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ce-4-247">20</xref> Pharmacological interactions have to be considered. A change in medication may help in some cases. During the course of the disease, the physician has to distinguish between the adverse effects of morphine and the effects of co-morbidity or drug interactions.</p></sec><sec><title>Current therapy options</title><p>Gastrointestinal effects are the most common side effects of opioids. Opioid-induced bowel dysfunction affects the whole gut. It is often a greater problem for patients than pain. Nausea and emesis are common but usually resolve within days; prophylactic anti-emetics can help. Gastric stasis, satiety, flatulence, and constipation persist in most of the cases. A prokinetic drug, such as metoclopramide, may also be employed to reduce gastric stasis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ce-4-247">2</xref> Constipation is predictable and occurs in at least 90% of the patients. It is characterized by accumulation of gas and secretions and by retention of bowel content, leading to hard stools, incomplete evacuation, bloating, pain, nausea, and vomiting. Opioid-induced bowel dysfunction can occur immediately after the first dose and persist for the duration of therapy. It demonstrates a very weak dose relationship, so dose reduction is often ineffective.</p><p>Most guidelines on the management of opioid-related constipation recommend co-prescribing both softening and stimulating laxatives containing opioids. Stimulating laxatives should be used with caution in patients at risk of bowel obstruction. Furthermore, the long-term effectiveness and safety of such a regimen is unclear. There are no studies to indicate the superiority of one laxative over another in the management of opioid-induced constipation. Among the agents that have been suggested are docusate, senna, bisacodyl, phenolphthalein, and lactulose. Prospective data have demonstrated the efficacy of senna,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ce-4-247">21</xref> sodium picosulfate,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ce-4-247">22</xref> polyethylene glycol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ce-4-247">23</xref> and oral naloxone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ce-4-247">24</xref> However, naloxone may reverse the analgesia. Titration to determine the best balance between the reduction of adverse effects and a satisfactory analgesia is challenging. In one small series, opioid rotation of morphine to methadone resulted in a reduction in constipation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ce-4-247">25</xref> Reduction of constipation was not reported in one observational study on changing the route of morphine administration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ce-4-247">26</xref> Recent crossover studies have demonstrated a reduced tendency to constipation among patients treated with transdermal fentanyl in place of oral morphine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-ce-4-247">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ce-4-247">31</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Unmet needs</title><p>Bowel dysfunction is one of the most distressing adverse effects associated with opioid administration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ce-4-247">18</xref> Opioid-induced bowel dysfunction encompasses a range of different gastrointestinal symptoms, including straining, hard stools, incomplete evacuation, abdominal distension, bloating, increased gastroesophageal reflux, and constipation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-ce-4-247">32</xref> Uncontrolled symptoms of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction can have a profound impact on the patient&#x02019;s quality of life. While constipation is well recognized as a common and unrelentingly adverse drug reaction to opioids, the importance of the impact of opioid-induced constipation on a patient&#x02019;s quality of life is generally not appreciated by healthcare professionals. Poor management of bowel dysfunction has a negative impact on a patient&#x02019;s quality of life.</p><p>Multiple approaches have been described to address the problem of opioid-induced constipation demonstrating the lack of a superior approach.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-ce-4-247">33</xref> Frequently, nonopioid pharmacological strategies are used for treating constipation: bulking agents and laxatives. The main effect of laxatives is limited to the emptying of the colon. Laxatives rarely provide adequate relief for all the complaints of the patient and frequently induce nausea, bloating, flatulence, distension, abdominal discomfort, and cramping abdominal pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-ce-4-247">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-ce-4-247">36</xref> Furthermore, their efficacy in opioid-induced constipation has not been established.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-ce-4-247">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-ce-4-247">38</xref> Centrally acting opioid antagonists often reverse the analgesic effects of opioid agonists in postoperative patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-ce-4-247">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-ce-4-247">41</xref> and produce withdrawal effects in patients on long-term opioid therapy, even in small doses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ce-4-247">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-ce-4-247">42</xref> They are unsuitable for acute postoperative patients and chronic opioid users.</p><p>Therefore, there is an urgent need for more effective, better tolerated, and safe treatments that normalize bowel function in patients with impaired bowel function due to opioid therapy. The clinical challenge of selecting the best option is enhanced by the lack of definitive, evidence-based comparative data.</p><p>The search for opioid antagonists that act locally in the gut and do not reverse analgesia has involved the reformulation, or oral administration of existing antagonists, such as naloxone, and the development of new compounds. Peripheral opioid antagonists offer 2 distinct advantages for the prevention of opioid side effects: first, they do not reverse centrally mediated analgesia and secondly, a single drug may be used to prevent multiple adverse side effects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-ce-4-247">43</xref> Therefore, these drugs represent a potential advance in medical therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical evidence</title><p>A number of phase I and II studies have established the pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, therapeutic, and safety profile of methylnaltrexone. In healthy volunteers, both the parenteral and oral formulations, as well as single and repeated dosage regimens, were found to be effective in preventing the morphine-induced prolongation of gastric emptying and orocecal transit time without significantly attenuating morphine-induced analgesia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ce-4-247">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-ce-4-247">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50-ce-4-247">50</xref></p><p>The first pilot, single-blind study in 4 patients with long-term methadone-induced constipation revealed immediate laxation and a dramatic reduction in orocecal transit time after intravenous (iv) application of methylnaltrexone (0.05 to 0.45 mg/kg iv).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47-ce-4-247">47</xref> However, 1 of the 2 subjects given 0.45 mg/kg twice daily had to stop the therapy due to abdominal cramping and was removed from the study. The other 2 patients received escalating doses starting with 0.05 mg/kg over 10 minutes for 4 days. This dose was increased after 10 minutes to 0.1 mg/kg over 15 min, which caused an immediate laxation response in both patients. Doses of 0.05 to 0.15 mg/kg were equally effective for laxation and shortening of the orocecal transit time. Orocecal transit time was assessed by a lactulose breath test. The time between ingestion and the earliest detectable and sustained rise in pulmonary hydrogen excretion indicates that lactulose had reached the cecum and was recorded as the orocecal transit time. Stool frequency increased from 1 to 2 occurrences per week to 1.5 occurrences per day in the three patients evaluated and the orocecal transit time decreased from 150 minutes after placebo to 60 to 90 minutes following methylnaltrexone treatment.</p><p>In a larger randomized controlled trial, the same group confirmed these findings without any signs of opioid withdrawal.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51-ce-4-247">51</xref> Twenty-two long-term methadone users were randomized to placebo or methylnaltrexone.

Ten out of the 11 patients treated with methylnaltrexone had immediate laxation responses during the day 1 afternoon session at a mean methylnaltrexone dose of 0.09 mg/kg, and all 11 subjects had immediate laxation during the day 2 morning session (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 vs placebo). No laxation response was observed in the 11 patients receiving placebo. During and immediately after each drug injection study, all subjects reported mild to moderate abdominal cramping, which they described as being similar to a defecation sensation, without discomfort. No opioid withdrawal symptoms were observed in any of these subjects during the study. No significant adverse effects were reported by the subjects.

The efficacy and dose-response relationship of methylnaltrexone in relieving opioid-induced constipation was first evaluated in a multicenter, randomized and parallel-group phase II trial involving 33 adult patients with advanced illness (defined as terminal or end-stage diseases such as metastatic cancer and AIDS) who were receiving chronic opioid therapy for pain on a daily basis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52-ce-4-247">52</xref> Patients were eligible for the study if they had a stable opioid drug dosage and no bowel movements for 2 days, reporting ongoing constipation even if they received conventional laxative therapy. The schedule of repeated methylnaltrexone treatment included a double-blind phase for 1 week, followed by an open-label phase for a maximum of 3 weeks. In the first week, study medication was administered on days 1, 3, and 5 whereas open label therapy could be administered as often as every other day. The initial dose range of 1 mg, 5 mg, or 12.5 mg was extended by adding a 20 mg group during the study while still maintaining the double blind. Only one of 10 patients (10%) who received the 1 mg dose experienced laxation within 4 hours of dosing. The median time to laxation was &#x0003e;48 hours for the 1 mg dose group, compared to 1.26 hours for all patients receiving &#x02265;5 mg (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0003).

Eligible patients had a life expectancy of less than 6 months and opioid-induced constipation (less than 3 laxations in the prior week or no laxation in 48 hours); were receiving stable doses of laxatives and opioids; and were enrolled in hospice, nursing home, or palliative care programs. Patients were permitted to double the initial volume of the blinded study drug in week 2 if they had fewer than 3 rescue-free laxations (defined as laxation without the use of a rescue laxative, such as an enema or a suppository, after receipt of the study drug) in the first week. The double-blinded phase was followed by an open-label extension trial, during which patients received subcutaneous methylnaltrexone as needed up to every 24 hours for up to 3 months. The first open-label extension dose was administered more than 14 days after the first double-blind dose and more than 24 hours after the last double-blind dose. Subsequent doses could be increased to 0.30 mg/kg if no laxation occurred within 4 hours. The analysis of efficacy included 133 patients (62 in the methylnaltrexone group). Forty-eight percent of the patients given methylnaltrexone had a rescue-free laxation after receiving the first dose of the study drug compared with 15% in the placebo group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Significantly more patients in the methylnaltrexone group (52%) had rescue-free laxation within 4 hours after 2 or more of the first 4 doses, as compared with the placebo group (8%; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). This high rate of response to therapy was maintained throughout the 2-week double blind period and the 3-months extension period. The median time to laxation was approximately 30 minutes after administration of methylnaltrexone. Of the adverse events occurring in 5% or more of patients in either study group, abdominal pain, flatulence, nausea, increased body temperature, and dizziness occurred more frequently in the methylnaltrexone group with an increase in incidence of 3 percentage points or more over that in the placebo group. Adverse events that occurred more frequently in the placebo group than in the methylnaltrexone group included falls and hypotension. The pattern of adverse events in patients who had a dose escalation to 0.3 mg/kg during the second week showed no meaningful differences between groups. The key goal of this randomized controlled study was to demonstrate that methylnaltrexone could safely and reliably produce laxation, without reversing analgesia or inducing opioid withdrawal symptoms, as it has been shown earlier in individuals using methadone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55-ce-4-247">55</xref></p><p>A second study enrolled 154 patients with advanced illness and opioid-induced constipation in a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial, with an optional open-label phase (up to 4 months) in hospice and palliative care centers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54-ce-4-247">54</xref> Participants received a single subcutaneous injection of methylnaltrexone (0.15 mg/kg or 0.3 mg/kg body weight) or a placebo.

Side effects, such as constipation, nausea, and vomiting, may be disabling to such a degree that opioid treatment needs to be reduced or even abandoned. The traditional approach to ameliorate opioid-induced constipation is laxative co-medication which, however, can be both ineffective and distasteful to the patient. The majority of the currently available treatments are relatively ineffective in this context and have not been tested in well-controlled modern trials. A major limitation of chronic treatment with laxatives, however, is that although they increase stool frequency, they do not relieve all the constipation-associated symptoms such as bloating, abdominal discomfort, and pain, resulting in poor compliance. They also may induce troublesome adverse events including flatulence, bloating, and abdominal cramping pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69-ce-4-247">69</xref></p><p>The spectrum of adverse opioid actions on the gut reflects the ability of these analgesic drugs to directly interact with the pathways of the enteric nervous system which regulates gastrointestinal motility and secretion. In addition, there is evidence that opioid receptors in the brain can cause gastrointestinal effects. However, experimental and clinical studies with opioid-receptor antagonists that are unable to enter the brain have shown that the adverse gastrointestinal effect profile of opioid receptor antagonists is essentially of a peripheral origin. Methylnaltrexone is a member of a new class of peripherally acting &#x003bc;-receptor opioid antagonist drugs. The addition of a methyl group to the naltrexone molecule makes methylnaltrexone positively charged and hydrophilic, thereby preventing transport across the blood&#x02013;brain barrier. Hence it neither reverses central nervous system opioid analgesia nor causes withdrawal in opioid-tolerant patients. Methylnaltrexone, administered subcutaneously, has recently been approved by the FDA, as well as by Health Canada and the European Medicines Agency. In the United States, it is indicated for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in patients with advanced illness (eg, cancer, AIDS) who are receiving palliative care, when response to laxative therapy has not been sufficient.</p><p>Methylnaltrexone is well tolerated and remained effective in randomized controlled trials of up to 16 weeks. The heterogeneity of dosage regimens and routes of administration make it difficult to suggest an optimal approach. The effects on stool frequency, constipation-associated symptoms as well as adverse effects are dose related. There was no further improvement in efficacy above a dose of 0.3 mg/kg. The percentages of responders to 0.15 and 0.3 mg/kg appear to be similar, the latter being combined with a higher rate of adverse events. A single daily dose appears appropriate, being followed by subsequent doses every other day. Only if there is no response to therapy would daily application be suggested. The response rate in patients with advanced illness is supposed to be between 50% and 60%,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53-ce-4-247">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54-ce-4-247">54</xref> half of the patients responding within 30 minutes after drug administration.</p><p>At therapeutic doses (0.3 to 0.45 mg/kg iv and up to 19.2 mg/kg orally) methylnaltrexone is well tolerated, an outcome that is also true when methylnaltrexone is repeatedly administered at 0.3 mg/kg iv every 6 hours.

This effect may be of particular importance in patients undergoing general anesthesia. Because the esophageal sphincter is relaxed and the patients are in a supine position, protective airway reflexes are absent. Furthermore, methylnaltrexone may increase that drug&#x02019;s rate of absorption and peak concentration by increasing the rate at which an orally administered drug passes into the proximal small bowel and by decreasing gastric residuals. In the same way methylnaltrexone may support the effort for enteral readings to be administered to patients who are taking large doses of opioids &#x02013; an effect that may be of great importance for patients in the intensive care unit who are taking large doses of opioids. No controlled studies of the effects of methylnaltrexone on enteral nutrition have been conducted. However, one case report describes the successful use of methylnaltrexone to initiate feedings in a patient with a 30% burn.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71-ce-4-247">71</xref> Peripheral opioid antagonists also may be useful for treating and avoiding nausea and vomiting, other well-known adverse effects of opioids that may have both peripheral and central components. In one small study, methylnaltrexone markedly attenuated the nausea associated with parenteral morphine administration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49-ce-4-247">49</xref> In another small study, patients who received methylnaltrexone for reversal of opioid urinary effects had a decrease in vomiting compared with those who received placebo.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59-ce-4-247">59</xref> This decrease in vomiting may have resulted from an action at the chemoreceptor trigger zone receptors or a modulation of afferent impulses from the enteric nervous system to the brain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72-ce-4-247">72</xref> However, another study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58-ce-4-247">58</xref> did not show an effect on the prevention of postoperative nausea.</p><p>In conclusion, methylnaltrexone has been proven to be effective for treatment of opioid-induced constipation. Eventually it may prove useful for managing cases of opioid-induced nausea and vomiting, post-operative ileus, enteral feeding, pruritus, and urinary retention. However, on the latter indications data are very preliminary and require further evidence.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosures</bold></p><p>The authors declare no conflicts of
