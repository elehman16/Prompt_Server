In developed countries, more than 85% of women survive for 5 years or longer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As a result, many women live with the consequences of the disease and its treatment. Most patients with breast cancer experience side effects of treatment, including fatigue and impaired quality of life (QoL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that exercise has beneficial effects on fatigue and QoL in patients with breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Positive effects of physical activity on survival and recurrence have been found in observational research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. On the contrary, more sedentary behaviour is associated with higher fatigue levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], especially in patients with breast cancer with lower levels of physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Reported exercise effects on fatigue and QoL are often small and this might be partly explained by shortcomings of the RCT design in evaluating exercise interventions that cannot be blinded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The possible disadvantage of not blinding is contamination between study groups, high drop-out after randomization to the control group and difficult accrual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">The cohort multiple randomized controlled trial (cmRCT) design has been proposed as an alternative to conventional (pragmatic) RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In a cmRCT, the intervention study is performed within a large observational cohort with regular outcome measurements. At cohort entry, two-stage consent is requested for participation in the cohort study and to be randomized for future intervention studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. After randomization, patients who are allocated to the intervention group will be offered the intervention. The control group will not be informed about their role as control in the exercise trial. Outcomes of the intervention group are compared to the outcomes of the control group, using the regular cohort measurements.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Relative merits of the cmRCT design</title><p id="Par23">The cmRCT design has the potential to overcome some challenges faced in (pragmatic) RCTs studying effects of exercise interventions in patients with cancer. First, in exercise-oncology research, blinding is impossible. As a result, participants allocated to the control group will often also increase their physical activity after randomization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Substantial cross-over of control participants has occurred in over 35% of exercise-oncology RCTs, which might have led to dilution of the intervention effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Patients with cancer in particular are often motivated to change their lifestyle after diagnosis and, therefore, already intend to increase physical activity levels or attend an exercise programme in the near future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. For example, in the Physical Activity during Cancer Treatment (PACT) study, about 50% of the patients with breast cancer randomized to the control group adopted the behaviour of the intervention group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A high level of contamination due to cross-over of controls who adopt the behaviour of the intervention group may decrease the statistical power to detect an intervention effect. Since the control group will not be informed in the cmRCT design about their role as control in the exercise trial, the risk of contamination will be reduced as a result of study participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Any increase of physical activity levels in the control group now reflects real life and is not caused by participation in an exercise RCT. Furthermore, drop-out in the control group due to disappointment in their allocation will not occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">Previous research has shown that patients with breast cancer who refuse participation in an exercise intervention study are on average older, more fatigued and had more comorbidities than trial participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Hence, the study population is in general a selective group of younger or less fatigued patients with breast cancer or patients who had less comorbidity after treatment. In addition, higher-educated patients are more willing to participate in health behavior-change interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Reasons for the selection may be that trial participation is (unconsciously) not offered to specific subgroups (although fitting the eligibility criteria), that these patients are not willing to participate in an RCT with a 50% chance to be randomized to control or that patients do not want to exercise. Consequently, the generalizability of results will be reduced. Since in a cmRCT design the intervention is offered to eligible patients after randomization and no decisions on being randomized need to be made, participation might be less selective and reflect the real world. As a result, generalizability will increase. However, a prerequisite is that the cohort is representative for the study domain.</p><p id="Par25">Also, long-term effects of physical activity on QoL and fatigue are not clear yet. The cmRCT design is a useful design to study effects in the long term because regular measurements in the prospective cohort will be continued after completion of the exercise intervention trial.</p><p id="Par26">Finally, we expect that recruitment of participants will be easier and faster because patients will be recruited from the cohort. Data obtained by routine measurements can be used to identify eligible patients for the specific trial. Since patients have already signed informed consent to be randomized for future intervention studies, eligible patients allocated to the intervention group can directly be invited by the researchers. Hence, it is not necessary to set up trial recruitment logistics and to recruit a new group of patients with breast cancer.</p><p id="Par27">In addition to the potential benefits, we also expect some challenges. In the cmRCT design, the intervention group is invited for participation after randomization and subsequently do not have to decide about participation in a randomized study. They only need to decide whether they accept or refuse the invitation of an exercise intervention. It might be that due to this approach less motivated patients may also participate, which might result in more drop-out in the intervention group than in the (non-informed) control group. Moreover, more patients with comorbidities might participate in the study compared to conventional RCTs, which also increases the risk of drop-out. Dependent on the amount of drop-out, this will impact the effect estimates from the intention-to-treat analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">In the UMBRELLA Fit study, the effect of a 12-week supervised exercise intervention on the QoL of patients with breast cancer in the short term and long term will be studied, using the cmRCT design.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Aim of this study</title><p id="Par29">The UMBRELLA Fit study follows the cmRCT design (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Here, patients with breast cancer who participate in the UMBRELLA breast cancer cohort (Utrecht cohort for Multiple BReast cancer intErvention studies and Long-term&#x000a0;evaLuAtion) will be randomly selected for a 12-week supervised exercise intervention, 12 or 18 months after enrollment (i.e. postoperatively, prior to consultation of the radiation oncologist) in the UMBRELLA cohort. The purpose of the UMBRELLA Fit study is twofold. The first aim is to assess the feasibility and therefore, we will (1) assess the participation rate and intervention compliance in the intervention group and drop-out rates in the intervention and control group; (2) compare the (change in) physical activity levels in the intervention and control group during the intervention period; and (3) assess whether a more diverse generalizable study population will be included by comparing characteristics of the included study population with characteristics of patients participating in previous breast cancer exercise trials with a conventional RCT design. Our second goal is to examine the effectiveness of the exercise intervention on the QoL of patients with breast cancer in the short term (6 months) and long term (24 months).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Patients</title><p id="Par30">We will make use of the UMBRELLA&#x000a0;cohort, which aims to generate short-term and long-term data on clinical and patient-reported outcomes during and after breast cancer treatment and to provide infrastructure for multiple randomized evaluations of the intervention in patients with breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Recruitment started in September 2013 at the University Medical Centre (UMC) Utrecht and all patients with breast cancer who are referred to the department of radiation oncology of the UMC Utrecht for radiation treatment are asked to participate in the UMBRELLA (see Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].

Here, we determine a clinically relevant difference as a difference of 10 points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. A difference of 10 points is realistic because in a previous exercise trial in patients with cancer, QoL in the intervention group improved by 15.1 points (SD 17.7) and in the control group by 6.1 points (SD 17.1) using the EORTC-QLQ-30 after the 12-week intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Therefore, using the control group data from the previous trial and the 10-point difference, we assume a 6-point increase in QoL in the control group and a 16-point increase in the intervention group, among patients who accept the intervention in this cmRCT. We expect an attendance rate of 70% in the intervention group and assume that the improvement in non-attenders randomized to the intervention group (30%) is equal to the improvement in the control group (i.e. 6 points). Furthermore, we assume that non-attendance does not impact the standard deviation. As a result, we estimate a mean improvement of 13 points in the intervention group ((70*16&#x02009;+&#x02009;30*6)/100&#x02009;=&#x02009;13) instead of 16 points and a mean improvement of 6 points in the control group. Using these numbers, standard deviations of 17.7 and 17.1, power of 80% and alpha of 0.05, we calculated that 98 patients are needed in each group.</p><p id="Par55">As we will use linear regression analyses adjusted for baseline, the correlation between baseline and follow up needs to be taken into account in the sample size calculation. Therefore, the calculated number of subjects should be multiplied by (1-<italic>&#x003c1;</italic>

As recommended by Candlish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], we will update the sample-size calculation before the end of the trial when the actual acceptance rate of the intervention deviates from the estimated rate and adapt the sample size accordingly.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Methodological outcomes</title><p id="Par56">To assess contrasts in physical activity levels between the intervention and control group, we will compare changes in physical activity levels within the control group to changes in the intervention group using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) or mixed linear regression models adjusted for baseline for the analyses of repeated outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p id="Par57">Participation rate, intervention compliance, retention and drop-out will be compared to findings in previous conventional exercise-oncology RCTs.

Besides comparison between patients in the intervention group and patients in the control group, we will investigate whether intervention effects change if we compare patients in the intervention group with all patients within UMBRELLA who are eligible for the UMBRELLA Fit study. Also, the timing of the regular measurements relative to the start and end of the intervention may vary between patients in the intervention group. Therefore, we will also assess QoL immediately at the start and end of the intervention. We will compare these outcome measures with the outcome measures from the regular UMBRELLA measurements completed before the start of the intervention and 6 months later (different and longer measurement intervals).</p><p id="Par61">Patients may refuse the intervention after randomization and thus receive standard care.

In addition, we will estimate the effectiveness of an exercise intervention on the QoL of inactive patients with breast cancer. Previous RCTs in the field of exercise-oncology have shown beneficial effects of physical activity on treatment-related side-effects, for example QoL. However, conventional RCTs in the field of exercise-oncology have several limitations, i.e. contamination, high drop-out in the control group, reduced generalizability, difficult accrual and insight only into the short-term effects. We hypothesized that the cmRCT design might overcome these shortcomings.</p><p id="Par63">We acknowledge that the cmRCT design poses some challenges. A higher rate of drop-out after randomization is expected in the intervention group compared to conventional RCTs. Using intention-to-treat analysis, including all patients regardless of non-compliance and drop-out, might considerably dilute the actual treatment effect. Consequently, important clinical intervention effects might be missed. The estimated intervention effect depends on the proportion of non-compliance and becomes more diluted as non-compliance increases. Since compliance with the regular cohort measurements in the control group is expected to approximate 100% because they will not be informed about the study, the proportion of non-compliance in the control group will be lower when using the cmRCT design compared to a RCT. The lower non-compliance in the control group compensates the higher non-compliance in the intervention group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par64">The instrumental variable method will be used to estimate the intervention effect, taking drop-out/non-compliance after randomization into account. This method uses the random treatment assignment as an instrumental variable to control for non-compliance. However, disadvantage of this method in the cmRCT design is that we only know who will accept and complete the exercise programme in the intervention group, but this information is lacking from the control group. Patients who accept and complete the exercise programme might differ from those who do not. To deal with this lack of information, we will develop a prognostic model to estimate which patients would have been compliant in the control group by using the information on non-compliance of the intervention group.</p><p id="Par65">Another challenge is the dependence on information collected within the cohort for the assessment of eligibility and for the outcome. If the available information is insufficient, there is a possibility that selected participants will not meet the inclusion criteria, e.g. due to severe comorbidity not yet registered in the cohort. However, since randomization has already been executed, these patients stay in the intention-to-treat analyses. In addition, another limitation of dependency on routine measurement outcomes is that the potential cmRCT outcomes are limited to outcome measures already collected in the observational cohort study. There is no opportunity to obtain additional information from the control group by additional measurements or at additional time points.</p><p id="Par66">Patients are enrolled at 12 or 18 months after inclusion in UMBRELLA because at this time most of these patients have finished their primary treatment. In this period, the impact of diagnosis and treatment on normal daily living (e.g. complaints of fatigue, impaired quality of life) become more prominent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Because previous research has shown that exercise has a beneficial effect on the QoL of patients with breast cancer in this period, the UMBRELLA Fit study gives the opportunity to assess the feasibility of the cmRCT design in the field of exercise-oncology by comparing the results of this trial with previous exercise trials in patients with breast cancer.</p><p id="Par67">In summary, the UMBRELLA Fit study examines the effects of exercise on the QoL of patients with breast cancer, using the cmRCT design. The purpose of this study is twofold. The first goal is to determine the feasibility of the cmRCT design in the field of exercise-oncology and compare this with conventional RCTs in this field. The second goal is to examine the effectiveness of the exercise intervention on the QoL of patients with breast cancer in the short term (6 months) and long term (24 months).</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par68">Recruitment of participants is ongoing.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec23"><p>
