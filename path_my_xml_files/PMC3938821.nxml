The primary aim of this randomised controlled trial is to assess in obese pregnant women, whether a complex behavioural intervention, based on changing diet (to foods with a lower glycemic index) and physical activity, will reduce the risk of gestational diabetes (GDM) and delivery of a large for gestational age (LGA) infant. A secondary aim is to determine whether the intervention lowers the long term risk of obesity in the offspring.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>Multicentre randomised controlled trial comparing a behavioural intervention designed to improve glycemic control with standard antenatal care in obese pregnant women.</p><p>Inclusion criteria; women with a BMI &#x02265;30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and a singleton pregnancy between 15<sup>+0</sup>&#x000a0;weeks and 18<sup>+6</sup>&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; gestation. Exclusion criteria; pre-defined, pre-existing diseases and multiple pregnancy. Randomisation is on-line by a computer generated programme and is minimised by BMI category, maternal age, ethnicity, parity and centre. Intervention; this is delivered by a health trainer over 8 sessions. Based on control theory, with elements of social cognitive theory, the intervention is designed to improve maternal glycemic control. Women randomised to the control arm receive standard antenatal care until delivery according to local guidelines.

In 2008, the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimated there were 1.5 billion individuals with a body mass index (BMI)&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;25&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> including nearly 300 million obese women (BMI&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The United Kingdom (UK) has seen a sharp increase in the proportion of obese women; as reported in a recent survey, approximately one in five women aged between 16 and 44 are obese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The UK Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health identified that overweight and obesity, was either directly or indirectly the cause of over half of maternal mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The adverse effects of obesity on reproductive health and childbearing are manifold. Obesity reduces fertility, and in pregnancy is associated with a heightened risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy including pre-eclampsia, and failure to progress in labour. Caesarean section rates are high, and infants of obese mothers are at greater risk of congenital malformation, large for gestational age at delivery (LGA) (&#x0003e;90<sup>th</sup> centile), macrosomia, shoulder dystocia and stillbirth. Following delivery, obese women are more likely to suffer a postpartum haemorrhage, and have longer hospital stays than women with a normal BMI (18.5-24.9&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The effects of obesity may extend beyond health in pregnancy; increasing evidence suggests that the children of obese women or of those whose gestational weight gain (GWG) was excessive, may be at greater risk of obesity because of antenatal exposure to adverse metabolic influences <italic>in utero</italic>, or in the early postnatal period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>In the UK, in contrast to the United States (US), women are no longer routinely weighed in pregnancy, except at their first antenatal appointment. The US Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines for weight gain during pregnancy provide recommendations for women according to their pre-pregnancy BMI, recommending that obese women should gain less weight in pregnancy (11-20&#x000a0;lb; 5-9&#x000a0;kg) than those with a lower pre-pregnancy BMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This advice is based on observational studies suggesting improved outcomes with lower weight gain. The UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines on weight management in pregnancy concluded that more evidence of improved outcomes from interventional studies is required before the US or similar guidelines for limitation of GWG are adopted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Whilst review of the literature suggests that intervention studies designed to limit GWG may sometimes be effective in achieving a reduction in GWG, there is at present, no evidence for improvement of pregnancy outcome amongst obese women. However most studies, including those in overweight and obese pregnant women, have been small, not powered for clinical outcomes and have had limitations in the design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><sec><title>The role of insulin resistance in obese pregnancies</title><p>An alternative approach to restricting GWG is to focus on the adverse clinical outcomes associated with obesity, and to develop interventions which are directly associated with known underlying mechanisms. A pre-pregnancy BMI &#x02265;30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> irrespective of the amount of weight gained during pregnancy, is the most important independent determinant of the risk of caesarean section, delivery of a LGA infant and postpartum weight retention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Also, the evidence linking GWG with GDM, in contrast to the strong association with pre-pregnancy BMI, is relatively weak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This is, at least in part, likely to be a reflection of the strong association between maternal fat mass and insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. There is a physiological increase in insulin resistance during normal pregnancy and the obese pregnant woman is at greater risk of developing GDM. Maternal hyperglycemia and, more recently, maternal hypertriglyceridemia are strongly implicated in the development of fetal macrosomia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Using the method of continuous blood glucose monitoring, Harmon <italic>et al.</italic> have shown, as might be anticipated, that obese pregnant women have an exaggerated <italic>post prandial</italic> glucose response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. As the magnitude of the <italic>post prandial</italic> response was directly implicated in increasing fetal adiposity and birth weight through fetal hyperinsulinemia, a dietary intervention focusing on reducing <italic>post prandial</italic> hyperglycemia by lowering the dietary glycemic load could improve maternal glucose control, reduce the incidence of GDM and lower the incidence of LGA infants. Similarly, pre-eclampsia is associated with maternal insulin resistance, and improved glucose homeostasis might lower the risk of pre-eclampsia in obese women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Improving glycemic control in pregnancy</title><p>Specific dietary advice and increased physical activity could contribute to improved maternal glucose homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In a study of 50 obese Danish women designed to limit GWG, Wolff <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] found that an intense dietary regime (10 one-hour sessions with a dietician) focusing on healthy eating, resulted in a reduction of plasma insulin compared to women in the control arm of the study. Another study reported that a diet and exercise regime led to a reduction in GWG and a decrease in the incidence of GDM in 126 overweight and obese Australian women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], but no difference in birth weight (3.5&#x000a0;kg versus 3.4&#x000a0;kg). In non-obese women with mild GDM, in whom improved glucose homeostasis is achieved through a strict regime of dietary intervention and insulin treatment when required, a reduction in the risk of adverse pregnancy outcome is achievable, as shown in two randomised controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Higher levels of physical activity in normoglycemic pregnant women and those with GDM have also been shown to improve insulin sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], but limited data of adequate power is available for the obese pregnant population. A recent meta-analysis of eight prenatal physical activity intervention studies however, showed that there was a lack of consistent evidence regarding the benefits of exercise combined or not combined with dietary advice for improving glucose tolerance in obese pregnant women, which was interpreted to reflect the limited power of current evidence and poor intervention compliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Systematic review of the literature</title><p>Louie <italic>et al.</italic> conducted a systematic review of the influence of lowering dietary glycemic index (GI) in pregnancies across all BMI categories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Of the eight studies included, two suggested that a low GI diet can reduce the risk of LGA infants in healthy pregnancies, but one reported an increase in small for gestational age (SGA) infants. In the three studies in which pregnancies were complicated by GDM the evidence supported the overall advantages of a low GI diet. This review recommended that until larger scale intervention trials are completed, a low GI diet should not replace the current dietary recommendations from government and health agencies, and that further research regarding the optimal time to start a low GI diet for maximum protection against adverse pregnancy outcomes is warranted.</p><p>In a systematic review of nine randomised trials including 743 overweight and obese pregnant women, Dodd <italic>et al.</italic> reported that there was no significant effect of interventions designed to limit GWG on weight gain or on delivery of a LGA infant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In a later systematic review of thirteen randomised clinical trials of lifestyle interventions in overweight and obese pregnant women (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1228) we concluded that there was a modest influence on GWG (-2.21&#x000a0;kg; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.86&#x000a0;kg to -1.59&#x000a0;kg), but no significant effect on any relevant clinical outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. We have also reviewed dietary and physical activity interventions in normal BMI and obese pregnant women (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1656 women) for the purpose of limiting GWG; in a systematic review we assessed 12 trials. Overall, diet and physical activity change was effective in reducing GWG, but there was considerable heterogeneity in outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The analysis highlighted differences in sample characteristics and aspects of intervention design, content, delivery and evaluation which might explain variation in effectiveness. Furthermore, failure to evaluate changes in behaviour or its psychological determinants could have obscured identification of the processes by which weight change is effective, and limited the ability to discern active intervention ingredients. We concluded that interventions should be more systematically designed and built on insights from behavioural science.</p><p>More recently, Thangaratinam <italic>et al</italic>., in a meta-analysis evaluated 44 clinical trials using lifestyle or dietary interventions or a combination of both during pregnancy across all BMI ranges, found a reduction in GWG (1.42&#x000a0;kg reduction) with any intervention in comparison to the control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Physical activity alone, was associated with a reduction in birth weight (mean difference -60&#x000a0;g, 95% CI -120&#x000a0;g to -10&#x000a0;g). Interventions based on diet were the most effective, being associated with reductions in maternal GWG (3.84&#x000a0;kg, 95% CI 2.45 to 5.22&#x000a0;kg) and a modest improvement of obstetric outcomes. However, the combination of intervention methods did not result in a reduction in the incidence of LGA between the groups (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.09). Amongst obese women, there was no evidence for an improvement of any clinical outcome. In an editorial, to this review, we highlighted that there remains a paucity of information regarding intensity, duration and compliance of the interventions, all of which could account for the lack of efficacy, as well minimal evidence for any effect of the intervention on the targeted behaviours. If the intervention does not achieve a change of behaviour in the anticipated direction, it follows that there will be no influence on clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>The protocol presented here describes a complex behavioural intervention comprising dietary and physical activity changes which we have developed with the aim of improving glycemic control in obese pregnant women. The intervention is based on established control theory with elements of social cognitive theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The primary hypothesis being tested is that an antenatal intervention package of low glycemic dietary advice combined with advice on increased physical activity will reduce the incidence of maternal GDM and LGA infants. A secondary hypothesis is that the intervention will reduce the risk of obesity in the child. Prior to undertaking a trial adequately powered to investigate clinical outcomes, we completed a pilot study (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;183 women) to determine whether the intervention changed dietary and physical behaviours as anticipated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. This pilot study showed that diet but not physical activity (as objectively measured) changed with the intervention and that all aspects of the protocol were feasible. A process evaluation led to optimisation of intervention delivery. The trial steering committee recommended continuation with recruitment for the randomised controlled trial (RCT), and it was decided that the physical activity aspect of the intervention should remain, as this follows standard guidelines for pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>Multicentre RCT.

In the UK, health trainers help people to change their behaviour to achieve personal choices and goals, and generally do not have pre-specified health professional qualifications, but relevant experience. All health trainers in this trial receive study-specific training in all aspects of the intervention and ongoing support throughout the trial. Women in the intervention group receive a participant handbook, a DVD of an exercise regime safe for pregnancy, a pedometer and a logbook for recording weekly SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time specific) goals, and steps as assessed by pedometer. They are invited to attend 8 sessions with the health trainer on a weekly basis, each lasting 1 to 1.5&#x000a0;hours. Women are encouraged to attend all sessions, but are strongly recommended to attend a minimum of five. For the sessions not attended in person, the health trainer covers the session material by phone or email. Attendance and coverage of session material are documented in the study database. Following a review of the dietary and physical intervention, each session is designed to focus on different approaches in achieving the goals set. These include SMART goals, self monitoring, and provision of feedback regarding goal attainment, identification and problem solving of barriers, enlisting social support and providing opportunities for social comparison. At each session, review of the previous weeks&#x02019; goals is undertaken.</p><p>The dietary intervention aims to promote a healthier pattern of eating, similar to that used in diabetes prevention studies, but does not aim to restrict energy intake. In order to decrease the glycemic load, dietary advice includes exchanging starchy foods with a medium/high GI for those with a lower dietary GI, and restricting the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (including fruit juice) but not fruit. Participants are also given dietary advice to reduce saturated fatty acid intake.</p><p>Advice regarding physical activity focuses on increasing the daily step count incrementally, and being more active in daily life. Pedometers are used for monitoring and motivation. The emphasis is on walking at a moderate intensity with additional options included, especially for those who are already engaging in some physical activity. This degree of activity accords with that recommended by the UK Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Standard care</title><p>Women randomised to the standard care group attend routine antenatal care according to local health care provision.

Maternal demographic data, health since pregnancy and smoking history is obtained. Maternal anthropometric measures are taken. EPDS, Three Factor Eating Questionnaire R18 (TEFQ-18) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and &#x02018;binge eating&#x02019; questionnaires are completed. To address safety and the influence of the intervention on the long term health of the child, details regarding the child&#x02019;s health from birth are obtained. If cord blood was not taken, and if the parents provide consent, a buccal cell sample is taken from the child&#x02019;s mouth for DNA extraction (Oragene&#x02122;). To address the potential influence of the intervention on infant adiposity at 6&#x000a0;months and obtain information on known determinants of childhood obesity, infant length and other anthropometric measures are taken. The mother provides information for an infant feeding and growth questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and a validated questionnaire addressing appetite (Baby Eating and Behaviour Questionnaire (BEBQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].
