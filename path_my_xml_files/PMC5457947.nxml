The current study was designed to evaluate the effects of a single perineural administration of dexmedetomidine without local anesthetics on narcotic consumption and pain intensity in patients with femoral shaft fractures undergoing surgery. This prospective randomized single-blind clinical trial was conducted in patients undergoing femoral fracture shaft surgery. Based on block permuted randomization, the patients were randomly divided into intervention and control groups. The intervention group received 100&#x000b5;g dexmedetomidine, for a femoral nerve block without any local anesthetics. Total intraoperative opioid consumption, postoperative opioid consumption, visual analogue score (VAS) for pain, and hemodynamic parameters were recorded and compared. Finally the data from 60 patients with a mean age of 30.4&#x000b1;12.3 were analyzed (90% male). There were no significant differences between the baseline characteristics of the two groups (p&#x0003e;0.05). The mean total consumption of narcotics was reduced during induction and maintenance of anesthesia in the intervention group (p&#x0003c;0.05). The amount of postoperative narcotics required showed a significant difference in the intervention group compared with the control group (p&#x0003c;0.05). It is likely that perineural administration of dexmedetomidine significantly not only reduced intra and postoperative narcotic requirement but also decreased postoperative pain intensity in patients undergoing femoral shaft surgery. Femoral blockade by dexmedetomidine can provide excellent analgesia while minimizing the side-effects of opioids.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Dexmedetomidine</kwd><kwd>Nerve block</kwd><kwd>Propofol</kwd><kwd>Narcotics</kwd><kwd>Pain management</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Femoral nerve blocks are commonly used as a simple and conventional peripheral anesthetic method to perform procedures such as knee arthroscopy, anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and femoral shaft fractures.<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In order to decrease postoperative pain and opioid requirements, single-shot peripheral nerve blocks (PNB) are routinely performed as an alternative to general anesthesia that are also associated with shorter hospital stays.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Minimizing analgesic-related side effects and maximizing pain relief are vital to patient recovery after surgery.

Participants</title><p>The studied population included 18-65 year-old patients, with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I&#x02013;II, undergoing elective femoral shaft fracture surgery. The exclusion criteria were known allergies to &#x003b1;2-adrenergic agonists or any of the drugs used during the procedure (atracurium, propofol, morphine, midazolam, dexmedetomidine, lidocaine and fentanyl); renal or hepatic failure; planned intraoperative use of regional analgesia; addicted patients; consumption of psychotropic medication or an opioid agonist or antagonist in the 24 hours before surgery; history of recent treatment with &#x003b1;2-adrenergic agonist or antagonist; patients weighing less than 40 kg or more than 100 kg; and surgery durations of more than 3 hours.</p></sec><sec><title>2. Intervention</title><p>The patients were randomly divided into intervention and control groups, using block permuted randomization. the intervention group included those who received the femoral block and control group involved those who did not. On arrival at the operating room, all patients were undergoing routine monitoring including mean arterial blood pressure (BP), baseline measurements of heart rate heart rate (HR), peripheral oxygen saturation (Spo2), and bispectral (BIS) index. To create a desirable BIS index, patients received a standardized anesthetic regimen that included premedication of IV midazolam 0.03-0.05 mg/kg and fentanyl 2-4 &#x000b5;g/kg. An IV administration of propofol titrate 1-2 mg/kg was started until the target level of 60-80 on the BIS index was obtained. In the intervention group, the femoral nerve was identified at a depth of 5 cm using a linear ultrasound (US) probe (Esaote, 10-18 MHz, Florence, Italy) or 5- to 12-Hz ultrasound probe (Toshiba&#x02122;, Tokyo, Japan). A 20-21 gauge, 70-100 mm-long Stimuplex needle (B-Braun&#x02122;, Melsungen, Germany) was used to perform the block and was connected to a neurostimulator (Stimuplex&#x02122;; B-Braun) at a 2-Hz frequency and 0.5-mA intensity. A motor response was acquired to confirm the neural target and an anesthetic solution containing 100 &#x000b5;g dexmedetomidine in 20 ml distilled water was injected surrounding the nerve.</p><p>After performing the femoral blockade, the IV infusion of propofol, 100-200 &#x000b5;g/kg/min, was continued till 40-60 on the BIS index was achieved and endotracheal intubation was facilitated with atracurium 0.5 mg/kg and lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg. It used a dual proportional-integral-derivative algorithm for the IV administration of propofol. The input variable is the BIS value, whereby the system titrates propofol infusion to maintain a BIS between 40 and 60. The BIS was checked every 5 minutes and 20% of anesthetic infusion was reduced when BIS&#x0003c;40, while it was increased by 20% when BIS&#x0003e;60. If any patient was involved with tachycardia or hypertension more than 20% of its baseline for hemodynamic control, fentanyl was administrated with 1 &#x000b5;g/kg and repeated on failure of response after 10 min. At the end of surgery propofol was stopped and all patients underwent IV infusion analgesia.</p><p>Opioid consumption was recorded every one hour. Narcotic consumption was recorded in the recovery room and 12 and 24 hours after surgery. Blood pressures were recorded before, and at 0, 5, 10, 15, 30 minutes, then at 1, 2 and 3 hours after the start of the propofol infusion. Patients were then given a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) delivery system provided by a 100 mL solution in the PCA reservoir bag containing 10 mg of morphine sulfate, 2 ml/hours, in normal saline. Pain was recorded using a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain) at hours 6, 12 and 24 after surgery. When a VAS score exceeded 3, rescue therapy was administered by providing 5 mg of IV morphine sulphate, followed as necessary by 2.5 mg boluses at 5-minute intervals. Adverse events were defined as bradycardia (heart rate &#x0003c;50 beats per minute), hypotension (a 30% decrease in systolic blood pressure in relation to the baseline value), and nausea or vomiting.</p><p>Finally, total intraoperative opioid consumption, postoperative opioid consumption, VAS and blood pressures were recorded and compared. Each patient was asked to grade satisfaction (Likert scale 1 to 5, in which grade 1 were completely satisfy; grade 2: relatively satisfy; grade 3: a little satisfy; grade 4: partly unsatisfied; grade 5: completely unsatisfied) with pain relief at the end of the PCA use.</p></sec><sec><title>3. Statistical analysis</title><p>Data analyses were done using the SPSS-22 software package. All data was expressed as mean&#x000b1;standard deviation. After testing for normality of pairwise differences with Shapiro-Wilk normality test, the effect of dexmedetomidine on propofol and opioid consumption and hemodynamic values were compared between groups using independent t tests. Hemodynamic data, BP means, are presented in a descriptive manner. A value of p&#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Intra-group hemodynamic parameters were analyzed by using repeated measure ANOVA.</p></sec><sec><title>4.

Propofol is a suitable intravenous anesthetic agent for induction and maintenance of anesthesia during surgery that has some advantages including providing good control of anesthetic depth and rapid onset and recovery.<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Alfa-agonist drugs have been demonstrated as anesthetic adjuvant or sedative agents.<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Interest in dexmedetomidine as a potentially powerful adjunct to human anesthesia was generated by the report from Segal et al. (1988) that showed that dexmedetomidine produced more than a 90% reduction in halothane anesthetic requirements in rats through a postsynaptic alpha2-adrenergic receptor with little change in arterial blood gases and BP.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> It has been also reported that administration of dexmedetomidine significantly reduces the requirement for propofol.<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> While, most of the previous studies have reported positive effects of dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant to the propofol requirement, the effects of the femoral blockade, by administering it alone, on the required amounts of propofol in maintaining the adequate depth of anesthesia was investigated in this study for the first time.<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The results from our study also showed that intraoperative and total narcotic requirements were lower in patients with the femoral blockade than in the group without the femoral blockade. Acute postoperative pain has various components such as inflammatory, nociceptive, and neuropathic issues because of direct nerve injury. These components are possible targets for postoperative analgesic strategies.<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The precise mechanism of action of perineural dexmedetomidine is not clear, but studies using other &#x003b1;2-adrenoceptor such as clonidine reported that &#x003b1;2-adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstrictive effects may somehow explain the inflammatory responses, centrally mediated analgesia, and activities on the peripheral nerves. Also, it is well demonstrated that postoperative analgesia of clonidine or dexmedetomidine is based on activity-dependent inhibition of inwardly modifying potassium currents.<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The analgesic effect of dexmedetomidine was not reversed by an alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist.<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In addition, dexmedetomidine induced perineural vasoconstriction with concomitant slower absorption of itself.<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Inhibiting potassium channel-mediated discharge of nociceptive C-fibres, attenuating the release of inflammatory mediators, and reducing ectopic neuronal discharge may justify how perineural dexmedetomidine alone can prolong the duration of analgesia. Prolonging the duration of postoperative analgesia by clonidine and dexmedetomidine, as a local anesthetic adjuvant, has been also demonstrated for brachial plexus blocks and infra-clavicular brachial plexus blocks, respectively.<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Here we suggest that dexmedetomidine alone without any local anesthetics prolongs the duration of sensory blocks when administered perineurally to patients undergoing femoral anesthesia. It has generally been believed that the &#x003b1;2 agonists can reduce pain and opioid requirements after surgery, thus decreasing the incidence of opioid-related adverse effects.<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> However, intravenous administration of dexmedetomidine exhibits synergy with regional that neuraxial analgesia effects of dexmedetomidine on narcotic consumption and controling pain in patients undergoing femoral surgery. We showed that perineural administration of dexmedetomidine significantly reduce intra and postoperative analgesic consumption. Furthermore, the lower mean VAS score in the intervention group indicated that perineural dexmedetomidine alone was associated with significantly lowering pain intensity postoperatively in comparison with control group. The recent systematic review and meta-analysis has indicated that dexmedetomidine as a neuraxial adjuvant was associated with a reduction in postoperative pain intensity within 24 hours.<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Brummett et al. conducted several animal studies to test the effects of additional dexmedetomidine to local anesthetics and showed that the duration of complete sensory and motor blockades were lengthened in the dexmedetomidine group.<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> They also showed that perineural dexmedetomidine administration provided an increased duration of analgesia to a thermal stimulus when compared with a systemic control in a rat sciatic nerve block.<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Human studies have subsequently demonstrated that increased duration of a sensory blockade can be achieved by adding dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant to bupivacaine and levobupivacaine, in greater palatine and axillary brachial plexus nerve blocks, respectively.<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Unlike previous studies, we demonstrated that perineural dexmedetomidine alone resulted in patient's qualitatively &#x02018;better&#x02019; analgesia or lower pain scores than without. In the present study, significantly higher patient satisfaction scores were reported by patients in the perineural dexmedetomidine group. There were not any undesired effects from perineural dexmedetomidine administration in the current study. However, one of our cases had severe bradycardia after perineural injection of dexmedetomidine, who underwent accidental puncture of femoral artery before perineural block. Abdel-Aleem et al. reported that intrathecal administration of dexmedetomidine with morphine significantly decreased postoperative nausea and vomiting and improved overall patient satisfaction after cesarean delivery.<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Well-designed multi-central research is still need to generalize the results of this study. Considering some other baseline characteristics such as history of drug abuse could also challenge the results.</p><p>It is likely that perineural administration of dexmedetomidine not only significantly reduced intra and postoperative narcotic requirement but also decreased postoperative pain intensity in the patients undergoing femoral shaft surgery. Femoral blockade by dexmedetomidine can provides excellent analgesia, minimizing the side-effects of opioids.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The authors would like to
