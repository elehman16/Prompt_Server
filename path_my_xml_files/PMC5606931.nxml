Participants considered plaintiff and defense expert scientific testimony that varied in argument strength. All participants heard a cross-examination of the experts focusing on peripheral information (e.g., credentials) about the expert, but half were randomly assigned to also hear central information highlighting flaws in the expert&#x02019;s message (e.g., quality of the research presented by the expert). Participants rendered pre- and post-group-deliberation verdicts, which were considered &#x0201c;scientifically accurate&#x0201d; if the verdicts reflected the strong (versus weak) expert message, and &#x0201c;scientifically inaccurate&#x0201d; if they reflected the weak (versus strong) expert message. For individual participants, we replicated studies testing classic persuasion theories: Factors promoting reliance on central information (i.e., central cross-examination, high NFC) improved verdict accuracy because they sensitized individual participants to the quality discrepancy between the experts&#x02019; messages. Interestingly, however, at the group level, the more that scientifically accurate mock jurors discussed peripheral (versus central) information about the experts, the more likely their group was to reach the scientifically accurate verdict. When participants were arguing for the scientifically accurate verdict consistent with the strong expert message, peripheral comments increased their persuasiveness, which made the group more likely to reach the more scientifically accurate verdict.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006406</institution-id><institution>American Psychology-Law Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N/A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7394-6444</contrib-id><name><surname>Salerno</surname><given-names>Jessica M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005290</institution-id><institution>Psi Chi</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N/A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7394-6444</contrib-id><name><surname>Salerno</surname><given-names>Jessica M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This project was funded by the American Psychology-Law Society (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.apadivisions.org/division-41">www.apadivisions.org/division-41</ext-link>) and Psi Chi (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.psichi.org/">https://www.psichi.org/</ext-link>).

Influential dual-process models of persuasive communication (Elaboration Likelihood Model [ELM], [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]; Heuristic-Systematic Model [HSM], [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]) assert that focusing on the substantive <italic>content</italic> of a message (i.e., central processing focused on the strength of the message itself) helps individuals evaluate argument strength more accurately than heuristics about the message <italic>source</italic> (i.e., peripheral processing focused on irrelevant or tangential information about the source of the message). Although much work has examined how individuals evaluate conflicting persuasive appeals, tests of such dual-process persuasion models in a group context are rare. Given that American society leaves important decisions to groups, from juries to Congress, it is crucial to examine the process by which <italic>groups</italic> evaluate the strength of conflicting persuasive appeals.</p><p>In the context of a legal trial, jurors often must evaluate two opposing expert witnesses delivering conflicting testimony that varies in message strength. We used this context to investigate how mock jurors&#x02019; reliance on central and peripheral information about the experts influences their ability to reach accurate decisions about which of two opposing experts to trust. We examined this at both the individual (juror) and group (jury) level. Specifically, at the individual level, we hypothesized that encouraging mock jurors to focus on the central information delivered by expert witnesses would help them evaluate the strength of the witnesses&#x02019; messages. Yet at the group level, we had reason to make the novel prediction that complementing central information about the quality of experts&#x02019; scientific evidence (i.e., message) during group deliberation with peripheral information about the experts&#x02019; credentials (i.e., source) would make jurors favoring the stronger expert more persuasive to their co-jurors, thereby helping the jury reach a consensus decision in line with the more scientifically valid argument; a hypothesis we justify theoretically below.</p><sec id="sec002"><title>Dual process models and individuals</title><p>The current investigation is informed by two seminal dual-process models theorizing that people can process persuasive messages through two different routes. The first route is a deliberative, effortful route (i.e., &#x0201c;centrally&#x0201d; according to the ELM, [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], or &#x0201c;systematically&#x0201d; according to the HSM, [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]). The second route is quicker and more efficient (i.e., &#x0201c;peripherally&#x0201d; according to the ELM, or &#x0201c;heuristically&#x0201d; according to the HSM). This tenet is shared conceptually with other dual-process models (System-1/System-2 reasoning, [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]). The two routes to persuasion are characterized by one&#x02019;s reliance on two different types of information. The central (or systematic) route is characterized by reliance on scrutinizing the substantive merit of the actual <italic>message</italic> (e.g., the scientific merit of an expert witness&#x02019; testimony) whereas the peripheral (or heuristic) route is characterized by heuristic reliance on contextual or peripheral cues about the <italic>source</italic> of the message (e.g., an expert witness&#x02019; credentials) [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>The ELM posits that people engage in one <italic>or</italic> the other, while the HSM allows for <italic>simultaneous</italic> systematic and heuristic processing&#x02014;but both models account for the two routes to persuasion and specify factors that encourage reliance on one route versus the other. Factors that increase motivation and/or ability to focus on central, rather than peripheral, information help people assess argument strength more accurately. One such factor is an individual difference factor called need for cognition (NFC, [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]). High NFC people, who are generally inclined to think deeply, are more likely to rely on central information than peripheral information [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and in turn, discriminate better between strong and weak messages (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]). In contrast, low NFC people, who are less inclined to process a message deeply, are more affected by heuristic (i.e., peripheral) information (e.g., source expertise level, [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]; how much an expert is paid to testify,[<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]), which can interfere with accurate assessments of a message&#x02019;s substantive strength [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>In court trials, both central and peripheral information about expert testimony can be relevant to jurors&#x02019; decisions. For example, when judging expert witnesses&#x02019; credibility, jurors are actually instructed to consider some peripheral information, such as the quality of the experts&#x02019; credentials [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Yet, although peripheral information might be <italic>relevant</italic> to jurors&#x02019; assessment of the expert&#x02019;s overall credibility, prior research suggests that peripheral information can interfere with one&#x02019;s ability to evaluate whether an expert is presenting a strong or weak message (e.g., when an expert witness bases his or her testimony on a scientifically valid versus invalid study). Specifically, studies have shown that peripheral information can, in fact, distract mock jurors from assessing the quality of the expert&#x02019;s central message&#x02014;particularly mock jurors who are prone to rely on peripheral information. For example, manipulations of the validity of scientific procedures presented by an expert witness (i.e., central information) affect judgments made by mock jurors with high, but not low, need for cognition [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Conversely, manipulations of source credibility (i.e., peripheral information) affect judgments made by participants with low, but not high, NFC [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Contextual factors also influence jurors&#x02019; routes to persuasion. For example, when mock jurors hear expert testimony delivered in complex, hard-to-process language versus simple language, they are less likely to recognize flaws in scientific evidence (i.e., central information) and more likely to rely on peripheral information about the experts&#x02019; credentials, such as their payment for and frequency of testimony [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183580.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Thus, we predicted that factors that promote reliance on central information about expert testimony would help individual mock jurors correctly assess the quality of expert testimony. More specifically, we predicted that being (a) intrinsically motivated to rely on central information (i.e., being higher in NFC) and (b) extrinsically prompted to rely on central information about the experts, would both lead to scientifically accurate verdicts in line with the strong expert. We manipulated extrinsic motivation to rely on central information by randomly assigning half of our mock jurors to hear a cross-examination of the weak expert that highlighted flaws in the expert&#x02019;s message (i.e., the validity of his research).</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Dual-process models and groups</title><p>Despite ample research testing dual-process models of persuasion at the individual level, current knowledge falls short when considering group decision making. How do groups use central and peripheral information about dueling experts during deliberation, and how do these arguments shape the quality of a final group decision? The only study we know of that includes prolonged, live group discussion and a unanimity requirement for the final group decision (as juries usually do) found that mock jurors with higher NFC (i.e., who are more inclined to focus on central information) talked more and were perceived as more persuasive than their lower NFC counterparts [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This study did not, however, investigate mock jurors&#x02019; evaluation of message strength or opinion change (i.e., persuasion).</p><p>In other group-decision-making studies, McKimmie and colleagues specifically manipulated central and peripheral information about a persuasion source (in the context of jury decisions, [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; and in the context of organizational decision making, [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]). These authors conclude that their work demonstrates the potential for group deliberation to promote reliance on both central and peripheral information&#x02014;for example, mock jurors were affected by the gender of an expert only after they deliberated as a group [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We note, however, that Rijnbout &#x00026; McKimmie [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] operationalized their central factor as the strength of a job applicant&#x02019;s Curriculum Vitae (CV). It is difficult to apply this specific central factor manipulation to the context of expert witnesses because&#x02014;although the strength of an applicant&#x02019;s CV might be central to the argument being made in that context (i.e., that an applicant is the best candidate for a job)&#x02014;the strength of an expert&#x02019;s CV would be peripheral to their in-court message (i.e., testimony that is relevant to the case). In other words, in the context of expert testimony, CV strength would be communicating information about an expert&#x02019;s credentials, which would be peripheral in this context because credentials (like witness gender) have no bearing specifically on the strength of the central, substantive content of the expert&#x02019;s testimony. This is true even though credentials might be relevant in considering the expert&#x02019;s overall credibility. Further, although we learn a lot about group decision making from these studies, the generalizability of these results to trial decision making is somewhat limited because two of the studies included computer simulation of a scripted interaction with confederates rather than actual groups interacting, and the other allowed only 5 minutes of discussion and did not require a unanimous group-level decision.</p><sec id="sec004"><title>Will group deliberation help or hinder evaluation of message strength?</title><p>Group discussion can shift individuals&#x02019; opinions to the degree that it provides them with persuasive arguments [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], which could help or hinder group evaluation of message strength. On the one hand, deliberation might provide an opportunity for individuals who rely on the central information conveyed by a persuasive message (such as the quality of an expert witness&#x02019;s scientific evidence) to educate and persuade those who do not naturally do so. This would help the group reach a consensus decision that is in line with a strong (rather than weak) message. On the other hand, if group discussion is dominated by group members who are heavily focused on peripheral information (such as how much money an expert was paid to testify in court), and group members are seduced by those weak arguments, deliberation might lead the group decision astray. Thus, whether deliberation will help or hinder accuracy might depend on how much discussion is focused on central, rather than peripheral, information about experts. Work on each of these situations is detailed next.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>The value of central information in groups&#x02019; evaluation of message strength</title><p>The potential benefit of discussing central information during group decision making is clear: The more group members discuss central information within an expert&#x02019;s message (e.g., the scientific evidence underlying their testimony), the more likely the group members are to evaluate the message strength accurately. Consequently, if there are dueling experts on opposite sides of an issue, and one expert&#x02019;s message is stronger than the other&#x02019;s, the more group members discuss the substance of the experts&#x02019; messages specifically, the more likely they are to recognize that one expert has a stronger message than the other. Group members who had the motivation and ability to have noticed the message quality discrepancy might be able to help simplify the information for those who were either unwilling or unable to do so on their own. Ultimately, this could lead to their group reaching the more &#x0201c;accurate&#x0201d; consensus verdict. For the purpose of the current study, we are defining accuracy solely as a verdict in line with scientifically strong, rather than weak, expert testimony, while acknowledging that the legal system theoretically defines a jury&#x02019;s verdict as definitive and therefore <italic>legally</italic> accurate regardless.</p><p>The importance of discussing task-relevant information during group decision making in reaching accurate decisions has been established by several seminal studies of realistic group deliberations. For example, Kaplan and Miller&#x02019;s work [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] demonstrates that shifts in group decisions are driven by group members sharing task-relevant information (see also [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]), particularly when the group is required to reach unanimity [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Yet these studies did not distinguish between task-relevant information focused on central versus peripheral information. Our study extends this work by testing whether sharing information helps groups reach better decisions when focused on central, rather than peripheral, information.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>The value of peripheral information in groups&#x02019; evaluation of message strength</title><p>Much prior research at the individual level suggests that reliance on peripheral information during group discussion might distract groups from assessing central message strength. Yet we argue that peripheral information might actually help groups reach a unanimous decision in favor of a strong message <italic>when that peripheral information is in the &#x0201c;right&#x0201d; hands</italic>&#x02014;that is, when the peripheral information is used by group members who are themselves already persuaded by the stronger message, to convince the others who are not. Group decision making involves a key component that individual decision making does not: intragroup persuasion. Dual-process models predict that <italic>individuals</italic> who process centrally (versus peripherally) are more likely to reach the correct decision on average. But for a group to reach consensus, this is only the first step. The next important step is for group members who are arguing for the substantively strong message to persuade other group members who are arguing for the weak message (that is, group members who probably did not individually rely on central information initially).</p><p>Of course, we expected that reiterating strong, central information would be effective in persuading like-minded people (i.e., other group members already prone to favor the strong message), but to reach consensus, all group members must be persuaded&#x02014;including those who are either unable or unmotivated to rely on central information. In that case, the more accurate group members might need to generate arguments that are persuasive to both people who are convinced by central information <italic>and</italic> people who are convinced by peripheral information. Fabrigar and Petty [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] provide indirect support by demonstrating that group members sometimes need to match their appeal to what group members find appealing. In trials, what is appealing might not be what is scientifically sound. That is, arguments ideal for persuasion are clear and convincing but not necessarily well reasoned or strong [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Peripheral heuristics are easy to understand, persuasive, and even more convincing to group members who are not naturally inclined to assess the strength of the central information themselves. Thus, we reasoned that peripheral information might serve an important function in <italic>group</italic> accuracy: The more that group members who are already arguing for the strong message augment their central information with peripheral information (strategically or not), the more persuasive they might be to a group with diverse cognitive styles, ultimately facilitating group consensus on the better decision. Our study is the first test of this theory at the group level, but it is supported by HSM&#x02019;s contention that systematic and heuristic processing can occur simultaneously to facilitate attitude change at the individual level (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183580.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Study overview and hypotheses</title><p>We conducted a study in two phases. In the first phase we assessed participants&#x02019; NFC in a large departmental mass-testing session. Based on these scores, we recruited low and high NFC participants for an ostensibly unrelated mock trial experiment several weeks later, wherein participants considered opposing plaintiff and defense expert testimony varying in argument strength. All participants heard a cross-examination of the experts focusing on peripheral information (e.g., credentials) about the experts, but half were randomly assigned to also hear central information highlighting flaws in the weaker expert&#x02019;s message (e.g., quality of the research presented by the expert). We assessed the scientific accuracy of individual judgments before and after deliberation and group-level accuracy after deliberation. As discussed previously, although there is typically no ground truth to determine whether a jury&#x02019;s verdict is legally &#x0201c;accurate&#x0201d; in real trials, carefully controlled experimental design enabled us to operationalize &#x0201c;accuracy&#x0201d; (for the purpose of this study) as the verdict consistent with testimony given by the expert who presented strong, rather than weak, scientific evidence (i.e., experiments with scientific integrity).</p><p>This is the first study, to our knowledge, to test the effects of NFC and central cross-examination in a realistic group setting requiring a unanimous decision, and the first to analyze the central and peripheral content of mock juror deliberation comments (but see [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] research addressing similar issues involving real jurors). The mock jury paradigm provides a realistic, engaging context for individuals to assess argument strength and reach consensus, and it has produced seminal group decision-making findings (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183580.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]). It also increases the practical importance of our study, providing a theoretical foundation for identifying interventions to improve jurors&#x02019; accuracy in assessing the validity of scientific evidence in court.</p><sec id="sec008"><title>Individual-level hypotheses</title><p>Based on dual-process models, we predicted that the helpfulness of group deliberation would depend on whether participants were induced to focus on central information about the expert testimony via cross-examination (i.e., flaws in the weak expert&#x02019;s message). We predicted a three-way interaction between cross-examination type, juror NFC, and deliberation: When participants are induced to focus on only <italic>peripheral information</italic> about an expert via cross-examination, we predicted that deliberation would make low NFC participants (who are already prone to rely on peripheral information) less accurate. In contrast, high NFC participants (who already tend to focus on central information) would be buffered against this accuracy decline during deliberation because they will naturally focus on central information even when not induced to do so via cross-examination.</p><p>In contrast, when participants are induced to focus on <italic>central information</italic> about an expert (in addition to peripheral information) via cross-examination, their accuracy would increase after deliberation regardless of NFC. We predicted this simple main effect in this condition because we expected that specifically highlighting flaws in the weak expert&#x02019;s central message would help both high NFC participants (who are already focused on central information) and low NFC participants (who are not naturally inclined or able to rely on central information, but whom we expected to do so when prompted by cross-examination).</p><p>We also tested our theoretical explanation for this effect, predicting that when participants focus on central information about the experts&#x02019; message, deliberation would sensitize participants to the quality discrepancy between the experts&#x02019; messages, which would increase verdict accuracy.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Group-level hypotheses</title><p>Our group-level hypotheses were more exploratory. After coding all deliberation comments about the experts&#x02019; testimony, we calculated two proportions that represented the percentage of deliberation comments about experts that were focused on peripheral as opposed to central information (e.g., 45% would mean that 45% of a jury&#x02019;s comments about the experts were peripheral and 55% were central)&#x02014;we calculated a proportion at the individual-juror and jury level. We tested two competing group-level hypotheses. The first prediction was that there would be a <italic>negative</italic> relation between the proportion of peripheral deliberation comments and verdict accuracy, such that the more the mock jury discussed peripheral (in proportion to central) information about the expert testimony, the less likely the jury would reach more scientifically accurate verdict by siding with the expert who presented strong (versus weak) research (i.e., message strength).</p><p>The competing hypothesis is consistent with the theory outlined earlier that the most persuasive arguments need not be well reasoned, but rather must match what appeals to the listener [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Specifically, we predicted that there would be a <italic>positive</italic> relation between the proportion of peripheral deliberation comments and verdict accuracy: The more the mock jury augmented central comments with peripheral comments, the more likely the jury would agree on the scientifically accurate verdict. But, this prediction included a moderator&#x02014;the scientific accuracy of the participants themselves. Specifically, we predicted that the positive relation between peripheral information discussion and a more accurate verdict would hold only when peripheral information is used by more &#x0201c;scientifically accurate&#x0201d; participants&#x02014;those who already favored the expert presenting the strong message. That is, peripheral deliberation comments could make scientifically accurate participants more persuasive to their group (by appealing to what non-scientifically leaning participants like to hear), and in turn, increase the likelihood that their groups would reach consensus on the more accurate verdict. This was not predicted for scientifically inaccurate participants, because making them more persuasive would lead the group toward the <italic>less</italic> scientifically accurate verdict.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec010"><title>Method</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were undergraduate students at a large Midwestern university.

Participants were given a trial character sheet with the names of and facts about each of the expert witnesses and a copy of the actual Illinois pattern jury instructions appropriate for the case. Trial lawyers and an expert on jury instructions reviewed all materials to ensure their ecological validity.</p><p>The trial described a plaintiff who alleged that his colon cancer was the result of workplace exposure to chemicals called polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The plaintiff&#x02019;s expert witness presented a study demonstrating a link between PCBs and cancer in rats; the defense&#x02019;s expert witness presented a study finding no such link. The testimony focused on this scientific evidence rather than whether the company exposed the plaintiff to the PCBs (which was made unequivocally clear in the trial summary) to ensure that verdict decisions were a pure reflection of how participants assessed the experts&#x02019; scientific testimony.</p><p>To assess participants&#x02019; evaluation of expert message strength, the transcript described two experts offering contradictory conclusions about whether PCBs are related to cancer. One expert presented a strong message; that is, testimony based on the description of a scientifically high-quality study that used valid and reliable methodology. The other expert presented a weak message; that is, testimony based on the description of a scientifically low-quality study using flawed research methodology). This allowed us to investigate how &#x0201c;scientifically accurate&#x0201d; our mock jurors and their verdicts were, by operationalizing the decisions as more accurate when they were in line with the strong (rather than weak) expert&#x02019;s message. The strong study had a control group, an ecologically valid method of dosing the study rats with PCBs, and was peer reviewed and published. In contrast, the weak study did not have a control group, had a less ecologically valid method of dosing the rats with PCBs, and had not been peer reviewed or published. The complexity of the two experts&#x02019; testimonies were similar according to (a) the original study [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], (b) a Microsoft Word difficulty assessment (both testimonies = 8th grade reading level), and (c) a Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count analysis ([<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]; the percentage of &#x0201c;big words&#x0201d; were similar: 18.63% of the defense testimony, 19.41% of the plaintiff testimony).</p><p>Precautions were taken to ensure that no peripheral information about the experts (e.g., their credentials, testimony record, manner of speaking, etc.) was systematically related (i.e., confounded) with their message strength. First, all peripheral information about the experts was held as constant as possible: They had similar credentials, were paid similar amounts for testifying, and testified previously in trials for their current side in this case (i.e., plaintiff vs. defense) with roughly the same frequency. Second, the audiotapes were counterbalanced, such that half of the participants heard (a) the plaintiff expert present the strong message and the defense expert present the weak message while the other half heard the reverse, and (b) Actor A as the plaintiff expert and Actor B as the defense expert while the other half heard the reverse. Therefore, peripheral information about the experts in this study was unrelated to which expert was presenting the strong versus weak message.

This portion of the cross-examination was held constant across all conditions&#x02014;both experts were always attacked via peripheral information during cross-examination.

The model included the following predictors: (a) the effects of pre-deliberation versus post-deliberation judgments, within individuals (Level 1), (b) participants&#x02019; continuous NFC scores, between individuals (Level 2), (c) cross-examination type, between groups (Level 3), and (d) all possible interactions on individual verdict accuracy (controlling for the counterbalanced witness-quality version).</p><table-wrap id="pone.0183580.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0183580.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0183580.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0183580.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Overall</th><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Central + Peripheral<break/>Cross-Examination</th><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Peripheral Cross-Examination</th></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre-Deliberation</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post-Deliberation</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre-Deliberation</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post-Deliberation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Individual verdict accuracy</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.39</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.28</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17.51</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.27</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.52</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(7.03)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(6.54)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(6.87)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(7.12)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(7.43)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Credibility of strong expert</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.83</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.52</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.07</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.64</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.76</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(0.98)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(1.59)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(0.98)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(0.98)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(0.96)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Credibility of weak expert</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.37</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.45</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.52</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.88</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.36</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(1.25)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(1.64)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(1.25)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(1.06)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(1.20)</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="t001fn001"><p>Means (SDs) for Case Judgments as a Function of Cross-Examination Type and Deliberation</p></fn><fn id="t001fn002"><p><italic>Notes</italic>.

Because the analyses described above revealed that deliberation helped (i.e., made individual participants more accurate) only when they had been focused on central information about the weak expert during cross-examination, we limited the mediation analysis to this condition.

Deliberation made participants rate the expert presenting the strong message as more credible, which in turn made them more confident in the scientifically accurate verdict. Deliberation also made participants rate the expert presenting the weak message as less credible, which in turn also made them more confident in the scientifically accurate verdict. Thus, as predicted&#x02014;and consistent with dual-process models (i.e., ELM, HSM)&#x02014;when individuals were focused on central information about the weak expert, group discussion sensitized them to differences in the experts&#x02019; message strength, which in turn made them more confident in the scientifically accurate verdict&#x02014;without making them skeptical of both experts.</p><p>In summary, factors promoting reliance on central information (i.e., NFC, cross-examination based on central information) about the weak expert made individuals within groups more confident in the verdict that was consistent with the stronger expert. Specifically, highlighting flaws in the weak message made mock jurors more confident in the scientifically accurate verdict, overall. Hearing a cross-examination that focused mock jurors on flaws in the expert&#x02019;s central message also made deliberation more helpful by sensitizing them to the quality discrepancy between the two experts. Deliberation was not helpful, however, when the cross-examination focused exclusively on peripheral information about the experts. In this condition, low NFC participants (who were naturally inclined to process peripherally) became even less accurate, while high NFC jurors were buffered against this decline in accuracy during deliberation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec031"><title>Group accuracy results</title><p>The 32 juries were coded as 0 for failing to reach consensus on the scientifically accurate verdict (i.e., unanimously agreeing on the verdict consistent with the weak expert or failing to reach consensus, <italic>n</italic> = 19, 60%) or as 1 for reaching consensus on the scientifically accurate verdict (<italic>n</italic> = 13; 40%).

represent the extent to which mock jurors and juries relied on peripheral, rather than central, information during deliberation. Because rejection-of-peripheral deliberation comments were so rare (3%) and more conceptually similar to central comments, we combined them with central deliberation comments. To compute the &#x0201c;proportion of peripheral deliberation comments&#x0201d; for each jury, we divided the number of peripheral deliberation comments by the number of all classifiable comments about the experts. That is, mathematically: peripheral deliberation comments / (peripheral + central + reject-peripheral deliberation comments) for each jury. We also calculated this proportion for each individual participant. For example, if Participant A made 10 peripheral comments, 55 central deliberation arguments, and 5 reject-peripheral deliberation arguments, her proportion of peripheral comments would be 14%. This would be interpreted to mean that this mock juror relied on peripheral information 14% of the time (and, conversely, she relied on central or rejection-of-peripheral information 86% of the time). If Participant B had a higher proportion of peripheral comments (e.g., 20%), he spent more time discussing peripheral, rather than central, information relative to Participant A.</p><sec id="sec032"><title>Do mock juries&#x02019; peripheral deliberation comments make them more or less likely to reach the scientifically accurate verdict?</title><p>Next, we tested competing hypotheses regarding whether discussing more peripheral information about the conflicting expert messages would make mock juries more or less likely to side with the strong, rather than weak, expert message. Our logistic regression with jury-level proportion of peripheral (versus central) deliberation comments predicting jury-level verdict accuracy revealed that the more a jury discussed <italic>peripheral information</italic> about the expert, the more likely it was to reach the scientifically accurate verdict (i.e., the verdict in line with the strong expert message), <italic>B</italic> = 6.19, Wald = 3.91, <italic>p</italic> = .048, 95% <italic>CI</italic>s = [-.22, 12.61], 90% <italic>CI</italic>s = [.86, 11.53]. It is again important to note that this is in the context of a high baseline of central deliberation comments (80%). Thus, our results do not suggest that peripheral information on its own improves decision quality. Rather, it is the use of central information, augmented by the use of some peripheral information, that led mock juries to reach consensus on the scientifically accurate verdict.</p></sec><sec id="sec033"><title>Do scientifically accurate (but not scientifically inaccurate) participants&#x02019; peripheral deliberation comments increase group accuracy because they are more persuasive?</title><p>Our next analyses tested our explanation for this effect: Peripheral deliberation comments would make scientifically accurate participants more persuasive and thereby more likely to convince their mock jury of the more accurate decision. This was not predicted for scientifically inaccurate participants, because making them more persuasive would lead people toward the <italic>less</italic> accurate verdict.</p><p>We conducted a multilevel logistic regression with pre- and post-deliberation judgments nested within individual participants, and participants nested within juries. The following predictors were included: (a) individual- participant-level proportion of peripheral (rather than central) deliberation comments and a dummy code reflecting whether the participant preferred the scientifically accurate (0) or scientifically inaccurate (1) verdict before deliberation (Level 1), (b) cross-examination type (Level 2), and (c) all interactions predicting whether their jury reached the more accurate verdict.</p><p>A significant three-way interaction, OR = 5.49, <italic>t</italic>(114) = 3.42, <italic>p</italic> = .001, 95% <italic>CI</italic>s = [.72, 2.68], indicated that when cross-examination focused participants on <italic>central information</italic>, the effectiveness of peripheral deliberation comments depended on whether they were &#x0201c;in the right hands&#x0201d;; that is, whether they were used to augment the comments of participants who were arguing for the scientifically accurate or scientifically inaccurate verdict. To probe the interaction, we assessed the simple interactions between peripheral deliberation comments and whether the participant was arguing for the scientifically accurate verdict separately for each cross-examination-type condition.

Even so, one might wonder (as an anonymous reviewer did), whether juries who deliberated longer (i.e., made more comments) were more likely to agree on the more scientifically accurate verdict. To address this question, we ran a post-hoc and exploratory logistic regression with the raw number of comments that each jury made predicting whether the group reached the more scientifically accurate verdict. Not only did increasing the number of comments not significantly increase the group&#x02019;s likelihood of reaching the correct verdict, we found an unexpected effect in the reverse direction: The more comments that the group made, the less likely the group was to reach the correct verdict, <italic>B</italic> = -.01, Wald = 4.85, <italic>p</italic> = .033, 95% <italic>CI</italic> = [-.04, -.004].

Thus, the juries&#x02019; accuracy was driven not by the raw number of comments that were made, but instead specifically by the proportion of those comments that were peripheral comments about the experts.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec036"><title>Discussion</title><p>Despite the pervasiveness of group-based persuasion in everyday life, studies directly testing dual-process predictions for group-level persuasion where the group&#x02019;s members have to deliberate together to reach consensus are rare. We examined the mechanisms and outcomes of persuasive communication at the individual and group-level simultaneously by employing a carefully controlled experimental design and advanced methodological and statistical tools. This enabled a novel test of dual-process models (ELM, HSM) in the context of group decision making, where most prior work focused on individual-level decision making. Our work, using mock trial methodology, makes contributions to the social psychological literature on decision making but also to the field of psychology and law, where jury decision making is of great theoretical and applied interest.</p><p>Consistent with dual-process models, <italic>individuals</italic> evaluated argument strength more accurately when intrinsically (determined by their level of need for cognition) and/or extrinsically (determined by cross-examination focus) motivated to focus on central or substantive information within the testimony of an expert witness. Specifically, when cross-examination focused individuals on an expert&#x02019;s central message (i.e., the scientific quality of the studies he presented to support his conclusions), group discussion during deliberation sensitized them to a substantive credibility discrepancy between experts. In turn, individuals were more confident in the strong expert&#x02019;s argument, and led them to favor a more scientifically accurate verdict. In contrast, when cross-examination focused individuals on peripheral heuristics about experts (e.g., credentials, payment for testifying), group deliberation made some individuals favor a verdict that was not consistent with the scientific evidence presented. Specifically, low NFC individuals (who naturally find peripheral information persuasive) were less accurate after deliberation, but high NFC individuals (who are not predisposed to being persuaded by peripheral information) were buffered against this decline in accuracy during deliberation.</p><p>At the level of group discussion, we discovered that participants were most persuasive to other mock jurors during deliberation when they supplemented central information with peripheral information. This group process has not before been described in the scientific literature. Detailed coding of deliberation comments revealed that the more groups discussed peripheral information about the experts that was completely <italic>unrelated</italic> to message quality (how much he was paid, etc.), the more likely they were to reach the accurate decision in line with the strong expert who presented a high-quality study. But this occurred only when the peripheral information was used to bolster arguments being made by the participants who were already favoring the scientifically accurate verdict. Therein lies the value of peripheral information: It makes the participants who are arguing for the more accurate decision more persuasive to people who might have been either unable or unmotivated to rely on central information about the expert.</p><p>Although it would not be particularly surprising that peripheral information is persuasive in general, this study demonstrates that peripheral information can help groups make decisions that reflect more accurate assessments of central argument strength&#x02014;even when the peripheral information is intentionally unrelated to argument strength. Our study is unique given the complexity of the methodological precautions used to ensure that peripheral information was unrelated to expert argument strength, which enabled us to demonstrate that unrelated peripheral information can help groups, specifically, reach better assessments of message strength. This finding suggests that the process through which individuals reach accurate assessments of argument strength in the aggregate gets more complicated at the group level given the diversity of thinking styles and opinions in a group whose members must reach consensus. The value of peripheral information about experts in our study is that it made participants who are prone to recognize flaws in a central comments more persuasive to others who either cannot grasp the implication of central information or simply do not find it compelling, which ultimately led to their group being more likely to agree on the more accurate decision in line with the strong expert.</p><p>One interesting question raised by our data is whether this is a conscious strategy to convince others. Do scientifically accurate participants, who were convinced to side with the strong expert because of central information, attempt to use only central information, but when they realize they are getting nowhere with that strategy, do they switch to peripheral information (that they might not have themselves found compelling) just to convince others? Do they intuitively &#x0201c;know their audience&#x0201d;&#x02014;do they sense that some people are more likely to be convinced by less central details, by heuristic processing? This is a fascinating question that we believe would be very fruitful for future research, but given that our study was not designed to test it, we remain agnostic at this point. Our data speak only to the argument that the more scientifically accurate participants happen to make peripheral comments about the experts&#x02014;strategically or by chance&#x02014;the more likely they are to get their group to agree on the verdict in line with the strong expert. We hope this finding will inspire future researchers to investigate more deeply the mechanism for this effect; for example, whether it is due to people matching peripheral information to people who find it compelling when central information fails [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], due to peripheral information bolstering the source credibility of a message participants already found persuasive [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]&#x02014;potentially in a post hoc rationalization process, or due to other ways in which peripheral information made scientifically accurate participants more persuasive to the group.</p><sec id="sec037"><title>The value of combining central and peripheral information during group discussion</title><p>What advice would we give group members trying to bring their group to the accurate decision? Should they use central or peripheral information? Groups are diverse and will surely be composed of those who find central information compelling, but also those who find peripheral information compelling. Our results suggest that <italic>both</italic> types of information are necessary for several reasons. First, the baseline use of central information during deliberation was very high: On average, groups discussed central information about the experts&#x02019; testimony 80% of the time. Thus, our results should not be erroneously interpreted as an argument in favor of using peripheral information <italic>instead</italic> of central information; rather, we suggest that using at least some peripheral information above and beyond a large base of central information will appeal to groups of diverse opinions and might be more likely to bring a group to the more accurate decision than would focusing exclusively on central information.</p><p>Second, we found that peripheral information helped scientifically accurate participants convince their co-jurors of the more accurate decision only when deliberation followed exposure to a version of cross-examination that included central information about the expert&#x02019;s message quality. Thus, for scientifically accurate participants to sway others with peripheral information, they (a) must themselves be certain that their opinion is correct, perhaps via cross-examination that clearly highlighted the flaws in the weak expert&#x02019;s study, and (b) need an arsenal of central information in conjunction with the persuasive peripheral information. Without the central cross-examination focusing on central information against the weak expert, there might not have been a critical mass of participants who had confidently reached the scientifically accurate verdict before deliberation in the first place, and those who <italic>had</italic> might not have had enough of a foundation of central information upon which the peripheral information could be successfully added to build a more persuasive message.</p></sec><sec id="sec038"><title>Theoretical implications</title><p>The current work has important theoretical implications. It has been argued that group processes can differ quantitatively from individual processes by reproducing, amplifying, or attenuating individual processes [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], suggesting that processes are similar for individuals and groups but differ in degree. Although differences between individual and group outcomes can often be explained by similar processes, there are some exceptions [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. For example, Wright, Luus, and Christie [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] found that groups were sensitive to consensus information but individuals were not, which suggests a different process. Our data tentatively suggest another way that group processes might differ qualitatively from individual processes. Although peripheral information can be detrimental to individuals&#x02019; assessment of argument strength, peripheral information about a message source (even if irrelevant to the source&#x02019;s argument strength by design) can play a helpful role in during group discussion. Peripheral heuristics about a source can be beneficial to <italic>groups</italic> assessing argument strength not because they are actually diagnostic of argument strength, but because they help jurors arguing for the more accurate assessment of argument strength be more persuasive, which is required for the group to reach consensus. Thus, dual-process theories need to account for the cognitive diversity of people who need be convinced to achieve consensus&#x02014;including those who are either unable or unwilling to rely on strong central information.</p><p>The fact that peripheral information helped groups evaluate argument strength when used in combination with central information is consistent with the Heuristic-Systematic Model&#x02019;s contention that heuristic and systematic processing can occur simultaneously to affect judgments when they are congruent [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183580.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This finding is inconsistent, however, with the ELM and other findings demonstrating that heuristic/peripheral information has no effect when systematic/central processing occurs (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183580.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183580.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. It might be the case that this facet of the ELM does not apply to groups comprising a set of individuals with diverse cognitive styles. That is, group processing that requires individuals who rely on both central and peripheral information to agree might need concurrent peripheral and central information to do so successfully.</p></sec><sec id="sec039"><title>Practical implications</title><p>Our study also has important implications for the legal system. Of course, in an actual trial, there is no definitive ground truth to classify what is an &#x0201c;accurate&#x0201d; verdict&#x02014;what a jury decides is considered accurate by the legal system, unless the decision is appealed and vacated. By conducting a tightly controlled experiment, however, we were able to define a &#x0201c;scientifically accurate&#x0201d; verdict: a verdict in line with expert testimony based on a high-quality scientific study. This has relevance for actual trials. That is, the legal system is built on the assumption that verdicts follow the best evidence presented in a case, both case facts and scientific evidence that informs the interpretation of case facts. We demonstrated that mock jurors&#x02019; sensitivity to scientific evidence quality can be improved through cross-examination that highlights flaws in low-quality scientific evidence, which is consistent with some prior experiments [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], but contradicts others (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]). We discovered that cross-examination that highlighted flaws in the weak expert&#x02019;s message was helpful, in part, because it made deliberation more productive. This suggests a potential explanation for why previous studies omitting deliberation found cross-examination ineffective in this regard [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Importantly, the cross-examination that included central information about the experts sensitized the mock jurors to the quality discrepancy between the two experts, which led them to more scientifically accurate verdicts without making them skeptical of both experts, which has been a concern in cases with dueling experts (e.g.,[<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]). Attorneys are often advised to avoid addressing flaws in the expert&#x02019;s science unless they are as knowledgeable about how the expert&#x02019;s work hurts their case as the expert is (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]). Further, attorneys have difficulty distinguishing between low and high quality science and effectively bringing this out in cross-examination [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Given these findings, along with previous studies (that did not include deliberation) that argue cross-examination is not an effective way to sensitize jurors to expert quality, it is important to inform attorneys that their cross-examination efforts can actually be effective.</p><p>Further, the coding of all comments about expert witnesses demonstrated that mock jurors spent almost half of the time discussing the expert testimony (41%). Among those comments about experts, mock juries spent the majority of their time focusing on central (rather than peripheral) information about expert testimony (80%) (see [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], for information about what actual jurors think about experts). These data support Diamond and others&#x02019; challenges to critics of the jury who argue that jurors are incompetent and irresponsible, lazily relying on heuristics rather than attempting to evaluating experts&#x02019; testimony centrally (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183580.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. This conclusion might be weakened if our college sample was overall more motivated than a typical community venire to process information, reflected in higher overall NFC scores. Yet this intuition is not well supported, with some studies finding that students&#x02019; NFC scores to be higher than community members&#x02019; (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]), but others finding the opposite [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p><p>Finally, we provided empirical support for the argument that mock jury versus juror decision-making processes might differ qualitatively [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183580.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Thus, we have provided an important justification for including deliberation in mock jury studies testing behavior that may be modified through group discussion, given that many argue that deliberation does not have an important impact on verdicts and therefore is not worth the massive time and cost involved.</p><p>Although some vilify jurors&#x02019; reliance on peripheral heuristics to judge experts&#x02019; credibility, jury instructions give jurors free rein to rely on credentials in judging the credibility of experts [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In fact, our study revealed that peripheral heuristics can even be helpful to groups who are assessing message strength, because heuristics help jurors who accurately assessed the message quality be more persuasive to a more diverse group&#x02014;while also demonstrating no danger of helping inaccurate jurors convince juries of the less accurate verdict.</p><p>Finally, although applications of our study to legal decision making are most obvious, the work is also applicable to groups reaching consensus on many other issues such as public policy, foreign relations, hiring, etc.</p></sec><sec id="sec040"><title>Strengths, caveats, and future directions</title><p>We took great care to set up a complex judgment problem that included both individual and group decision making that could be scored for &#x0201c;accuracy,&#x0201d; and in which we could investigate both measured and manipulated likelihood of relying on central and peripheral information. To ensure internal validity, we specifically controlled not only our cross-examination manipulation, but also the NFC composition of the groups and complexity of the two experts&#x02019; testimony, and we counterbalanced several factors to rule out alternative explanations (e.g., whether the plaintiff or defense presented the strong research, which actor played which expert). This enabled us to contribute to the basic social psychological literature regarding dual-process models (e.g., ELM, HSM) in individuals versus groups. Although mock jury studies are never completely representative of the real jury deliberation process, we also took great care to design our study in a manner that would make generalizations to the legal arena possible.</p><p>It is very difficult to study actual jurors and juries (but see [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]; The Arizona Jury Project, e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]), especially when investigating issues that require strict experimental control as did our particular research question. To ensure external validity, we used realistic testimony and legal charges, actual state pattern jury instructions that would be used in such a case, and had lawyers review our materials for realism. We also made sure our participants were jury eligible, and even though they were students, recent work finds negligible differences between student and non-student samples in most mock jury studies [<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183580.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Nonetheless, replicating the work with older community members would be useful. We also went beyond many other jury simulations by including audio (rather than written) testimony and jury deliberation (rather than relying on individuals&#x02019; judgments), which is rare given the effort they require. This advanced methodology enabled us to contribute to the psychology and law literature regarding mock jurors&#x02019; ability to evaluate science in the courtroom, as well as potential interventions to improve this ability.</p><p>Replication is always important, and there are many interesting variations of the current study that were beyond the scope of this already complex methodology, but which would make excellent future studies. For example, it could be argued that one should assess whether participants&#x02019; comments were (a) favorable or unfavorable to the expert, (b) about the strong or weak expert, or (c) expressing agreement or disagreement with other mock jurors&#x02014;and surely many others. We did not do so because these added layers would make an already very complex analysis even more complicated, and would result in coding categories containing too few comments on which to conduct meaningful analyses&#x02014;but also because it was not necessary to test the theory we set out to test. The extent to which jurors focus on central versus peripheral information about experts should predict their accuracy regardless of the expert on which they are focusing. For example, if jurors are focusing on central information about the experts, that process should lead them to better assess testimony quality&#x02014;and that theory should hold regardless of whether they are talking about how strong the strong expert&#x02019;s study was, about how weak the weak expert&#x02019;s study was, or incorrectly stating that the strong expert&#x02019;s study is weak and then being corrected, etc.</p><p>It might also be argued that it would be informative to manipulate the NFC composition of the juries to include all high NFC participants versus all low NFC participants. We did not do so for external validity purposes and because this comparison was not necessary to test our theory. Further, we arranged mock juries as we did to test our theory that jurors who were arguing for a more scientifically accurate verdict would be more persuasive to cognitively diverse groups (i.e., half high NFC, half low NFC) when they augmented their central information with peripheral information.</p><p>Ours was a first step in demonstrating that scientifically accurate participants are more persuasive to their jury when using peripheral information, which makes the group more accurate. Important next steps could be to investigate <italic>why</italic> peripheral information was more persuasive when made by jurors arguing for the more scientifically accurate verdict, or to compare a cross-examination condition that included only central information against the weak expert to the two cross-examination conditions in the present study.
