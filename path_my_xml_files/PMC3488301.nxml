There were no differences in FVIII consumption or adverse event rates between prophylaxis regimens. No subject developed FVIII inhibitors. <italic>Conclusions:</italic> The present study demonstrates comparable safety and effectiveness for two prophylaxis regimens and that prophylaxis significantly reduces bleeding compared with on-demand treatment.

Patients with severe disease (FVIII levels &#x0003c; 1% of normal) are at risk of spontaneous bleeding into joints, muscles and internal organs, as well as trauma-induced bleeding after injury and surgery. Repeated bleeding into joints, which may occur as frequently as 20&#x02013;30 times per year, is a major cause of morbidity and leads to clinically significant hemophilic arthropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>].</p><p>Prophylactic therapy with FVIII is considered to be the optimal treatment for patients without inhibitors and is aimed at reducing the number of hemorrhages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>]. While much of the evidence supporting prophylaxis is observational, previous studies have confirmed the efficacy of prophylaxis in children in preventing or delaying arthropathy by focusing on joint outcomes and spontaneous hemarthroses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>]. In addition, the early initiation of prophylaxis may have a protective effect against inhibitor development, the most serious complication associated with FVIII treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>]. In adults who have already developed hemophilic arthropathy, prophylaxis is aimed at slowing progression of joint deterioration and improving mobility, and thus, quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>].</p><p>As part of a comprehensive clinical program for ADVATE Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin Free Method (rAHF-PFM), this clinical study compares the effectiveness of two prophylactic treatment regimens, as well as between on-demand and prophylaxis treatments, in preventing bleeding in hemophilia A patients. As earlier observations indicated that patients with FVIII levels between 1% and 5% have less frequent bleeding than those with levels &#x0003c; 1% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>], both prophylaxis regimens were intended to maintain FVIII levels at or above 1%. One regimen (standard prophylaxis) was based on common practice with every other day dosing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>] and the other (PK-tailored prophylaxis) was customized for each individual based on pharmacokinetics (PK) with every third day dosing. As bleeding prevention has been well described in young children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>], the present study focused on older patients with existing joint disease in whom prophylaxis was not recently practiced. This is the first study designed to generate prospective data for stringent comparisons of bleeding rates.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical study methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>The present study was conducted in compliance with international Good Clinical Practice, and national and local regulatory requirements, and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00243386). The protocol was approved by the ethics committees of participating institutions, and written consent was obtained from patients before enrollment.</p><p>The main inclusion criteria were an age &#x0003e; 7 and under 65 years, a clinical diagnosis of moderately severe to severe hemophilia A (baseline FVIII level &#x02264; 2% of normal), on-demand treatment for at least 12 months with at least 150 exposure days to FVIII concentrates, at least eight joint hemorrhages before enrollment and a negative HIV status, or if positive, with a stable CD4 count &#x02265; 400 cells mm<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>. The main exclusion criteria were a history of FVIII inhibitor (titer &#x02265; 0.6 BU [Bethesda unit]), detectable FVIII inhibitors at screening (titer &#x02265; 0.4 BU), chronic liver disease, immunodeficiency, another hemostatic defect and the need for major surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This was an open-label, multicenter study with two comparisons. The first was a randomized, two-arm, parallel comparison of two prophylaxis regimens, and the second was a longitudinal, non-randomized, cross-over comparison of on-demand and prophylaxis treatments. The primary endpoint was differences in annualized bleeding rates (ABRs) between the two prophylaxis regimens. Secondary endpoints included differences in ABRs between subjects first treated on-demand and then on prophylaxis, differences in weight-adjusted rAHF-PFM annual consumption, efficacy of rAHF-PFM for the control of bleeding, differences in health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and the continued assessment of rAHF-PFM immunogenicity, safety and toxicity.</p><p>The study design is displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>. Upon enrollment and after at least a 72-h washout period, subjects received 50 &#x000b1;5 IU kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of rAHF-PFM by intravenous (i.v.) bolus at a maximum infusion rate of 10 mL min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for a PK evaluation (Recommendations of the ISTH FVIII/IX Scientific Standardization Committee for Evaluation of New or Investigational Clotting Factor Concentrates and CPMP guidelines.). Next, subjects received 6 months of on-demand treatment with dosing dependent on the severity and type of bleeding episode (as described in the Supporting Information). After completing the on-demand treatment period, subjects were randomized to receive 12 months of either standard or PK-tailored prophylaxis treatment. The randomization sequence was created using <sc>sas</sc> version 8.2 (Cary, NC, USA), stratified by 0, 1&#x02013;2 or &#x02265; 3 target joints (defined as a joint in which &#x02265; 4 hemorrhages occurred within a period of 6 months, or &#x0003e; 20 lifetime hemarthroses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>]) with a 1:1 allocation to treatment regimens using a random block size of 2, and provided to the investigator via an automated assignment system as the subject neared completion of on-demand treatment.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Fig 1</label><caption><p>Study design.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jth0010-0359-f1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Treatments</title><p>Standard prophylaxis dosing was between 20&#x02013;40 IU kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> every 48 &#x000b1;6 h by i.v. bolus with the particular dosage determined by the investigator. PK-tailored prophylaxis dosing was 20&#x02013;80 IU kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> every 72 &#x000b1;6 h by i.v. bolus with the dosage determined at the PK evaluation for each subject based on the following formula: <italic>D = (</italic>2<sup>72/<italic>t</italic></sup><italic>)</italic>/<italic>r</italic>; where <italic>D</italic> was dose (IU kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), 72 was the infusion interval (h), <italic>t</italic> was the estimated terminal half-life and <italic>r</italic> was the incremental recovery. Dose adjustments were permitted for standard prophylaxis within the allowable range according to clinical circumstances, and for PK-tailored prophylaxis if a subject experienced &#x02265; 2 bleeding episodes during their last 3-month study period, exhibited FVIII trough levels &#x0003c; 1% at the 3-month visit and was FVIII-inhibitor free.</p><p>Throughout the study, bleeding was treated according to routine clinical practice. For bleeding episodes occurring during the prophylaxis period, subjects resumed their regimen on the next scheduled day after the last infusion for treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetic, clinical and quality-of-life assessments</title><p>The PK evaluation included 10 sampling time points up to 48 h postinfusion. FVIII activity had to have decreased monotonically from 1 h postinfusion until pre-infusion values were approached. Terminal half-life, incremental recovery (using the maximal concentration) and clearance were determined as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>]. Once the prophylaxis period began, FVIII trough levels were assessed every 3 months.</p><p>Descriptions of bleeding episodes (including etiology, severity and anatomical site[s]) were recorded in subject diaries and verified by the investigator. Each bleeding episode may have included more than one anatomical site and the episode was categorized as a joint type if any bleeding site(s) occurred in a joint; otherwise (if no bleeding sites were in joints), the event was categorized as a non-joint type. Hemostatic efficacy was assessed by the number of infusions used to treat each episode and the subject&#x02019;s rating based on a four-point ordinal scale (excellent, good, fair or none; full descriptions are provided in the Supporting Information) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>].</p><p>FVIII inhibitor assessments were performed every 3 months after a minimum 48-h washout period, using the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>]. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded in subject diaries and verified by the investigator. Complete blood count and clinical chemistry tests were performed every 3 months, and clinically significant events were reported as AEs.</p><p>Subjects &#x02265; 14 years of age completed a HRQoL questionnaire (SF-36v1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>]) at screening and after each treatment period.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The sample size assumed an ABR variance of at least that observed for compliant subjects in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>], and thus, 30 subjects per prophylaxis regimen (60 in total) would detect a difference of 2.5 bleeding episodes per year between the two prophylaxis regimens. To account for approximately 10% attrition, at least 66 subjects were planned for enrollment.</p><p>Efficacy analyzes were performed with two analysis sets: (i) intention-to-treat (ITT) which included subjects who completed at least one study visit and (ii) per-protocol (PP) which included subjects who had &#x0003e; 90% of the predicted number of infusions and no major protocol deviations. For the two prophylaxis regimens, a square root transformation of the ABRs (<italic>X</italic>&#x02032; = &#x0221a;[<italic>X</italic> + 0.5]) allowed a comparison using a parameteric, paired <italic>t</italic>-test (primary endpoint). Median differences of ABRs and percentage reductions of ABRs between treatment regimens were evaluated using the non-parametric Wilcoxon&#x02019;s signed-rank test with each test performed at a 5% alpha level and adjusted for multiple testing (0.05 &#x000f7; number of tests), with no <italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003e; 0.01 considered statistically significant. The comparisons between on-demand and prophylaxis were paired as each subject was first treated on-demand and then on prophylaxis. To further assess differences in ABRs between on-demand and prophylaxis treatments, a negative binomial mixed model was used to evaluate the number of bleeding episodes as the dependent variable with the logarithm of time as the offset variable and regimen as the independent variable. A repeated effect over time was included because each subject contributed multiple observations during each treatment period.</p><p>HRQoL health domain scores, physical component scores (PCS) and mental component scores (MCS) were compared between the two prophylaxis regimens and between on-demand and prophylaxis treatments using 10 two-sided, paired Wilcoxon&#x02019;s signed-rank tests with all performed at an alpha level of 5% and adjusted for multiple comparisons. The minimal important difference (MID) for the SF-36 instrument has been estimated at three points. Therefore, differences of three points or more were used to interpret whether statistically significant differences measured using SF-36 were clinically meaningful.</p><p>Annualized FVIII consumption and rates of treatment-related AEs for each prophylaxis period were compared using a Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Of 82 enrolled subjects at nine US and 21 European sites between January 2006 and June 2010, 73 received at least one dose of rAHF-PFM.

Both regimens were targeted to maintain FVIII levels at or above 1% with standard prophylaxis given every second day and PK-tailored prophylaxis given every third day. The utility of prophylaxis dose tailoring with individual PK has focused on optimizing treatment efficacy and FVIII usage with an increased infusion frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>]. The results from the present study suggest that the PK-tailored prophylaxis regimen, which used similar amounts of rFVIII and fewer infusions (one less infusion per week), is a viable treatment alternative to standard prophylaxis. The availability of this option could increase treatment adherence, particularly in children and adolescents, for whom compliance with long-term medical regimens is especially challenging.</p><p>Because prophylaxis is time consuming and requires direct venipuncture or a central venous catheter, the frequency of infusions has hitherto posed a challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>]; however, optimal treatment outcomes may be negatively influenced by poor treatment adherence. In a <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis, subjects considered &#x02018;adherent&#x02019; with treatment had lower ABRs than those considered &#x02018;not adherent&#x02019;. Although numbers of &#x02018;non-adherent&#x02019; subjects in the present study were small, the result is consistent with previously published findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>].</p><p>As each subject was first treated on-demand for 6 months and then on prophylaxis for 12 months, statistical comparisons between these regimens were paired. Treatment with either prophylaxis regimen significantly (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) reduced ABRs for bleeding of all etiologies and types, including hemarthroses, compared with on-demand treatment. These data clearly demonstrate that all bleeding, including hemarthroses, is reduced with prophylaxis compared with on-demand treatment.</p><p>After only 12 months of prophylactic treatment, subjects previously treated on-demand (i.e. for at least 12 months before and 6 months during the study) had statistically and clinically significant improvements in physical HRQoL (as measured by the bodily pain domain and PCS) compared with during the on-demand treatment period. These results are probably explained by the significant reduction in ABRs observed while subjects were on prophylaxis and are consistent with the aim of switching adolescents and adults from on-demand treatment to prophylaxis to slow joint deterioration and improve quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>].</p><p>The efficacy of treating bleeding episodes (i.e. the number of infusions used and the efficacy ratings) was similar among regimens, which is consistent with results observed previously with rAHF-PFM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>]. Examination of AEs, laboratory parameters, vital signs and immunogenicity demonstrated that rAHF-PFM was safe and well-tolerated for prophylactic use. Rates of AEs were low considering the long study duration (4.5 years) and subject participation of approximately 1.5 years, and were similar between the two prophylaxis regimens. None of the subjects developed a confirmed FVIII inhibitor.</p><p>In conclusion, the demonstrated comparability of standard and PK-tailored prophylaxis regimens in terms of safety and bleeding prevention in hemophilia A patients, indicates that PK-tailored prophylaxis is an effective alternative to the standard regimen with similar amounts of FVIII and one less infusion per week. Compared with on-demand treatment, both prophylaxis regimens significantly reduced bleeding, including spontaneous and traumatic hemarthroses, and improved the quality of life for adolescent and adult patients. The present study further confirms and extends the safety and effectiveness of rAHF-PFM for controlling and preventing bleeding in the management of hemophilia A.</p></sec><sec><title>Addendum</title><p>W.
