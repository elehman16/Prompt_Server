It usually occurs in winter and early spring season.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] It is more common in males as compared to females and males are 1.25 times more likely to be admitted than females.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection causes bronchiolitis in 50&#x02013;90% of cases.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Other less common pathogens include para-influenza virus, adenovirus, influenza A and B, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus and <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Acute bronchiolitis usually occurs following exposure to a patient with minor respiratory symptoms within the previous week. Infant first develops a mild upper respiratory tract infection with sneezing and rhinorrhea. This is followed by decreased appetite and moderate grade fever. After a few days respiratory distress ensues. The infant is often tachypneic, which may interfere with feeding. The physical examination is characterized most prominently by wheezing, prolonged expiration, fine rales and ronchi. The work of breathing increases characterized by nasal flaring, intercostal and subcostal retractions, hyperexpansion of chest, restlessness and peripheral cyanosis.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Most of the infants show improvement within 3&#x02013;4 days after the onset of the disease.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>The diagnosis is usually a clinical one and investigations are not generally needed to confirm it. However, confirmation of RSV infection can be made by enzyme-linked immunofluorescence assay and fluorescent antibody techniques for detection of the viral antigen, amplification of the virus using the shell vial method and amplification of viral genome by polymerase chain reaction or viral culture.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] A rapid test using monoclonal antibodies against RSV on nasopharyngeal aspirates can identify RSV by the bedside.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Management of bronchiolitis is often frustrating for physicians and care-givers because &#x0201c;nothing seems to work&#x0201d; in most cases.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] There is lack of robust evidence for almost all the interventions that are usually tried including inhaled epinephrine, bronchodilators, steroids, anticholinergics, antibiotics, surfactant and chest physiotherapy. Some experts have questioned whether bronchiolitis can be treated at all and current research data is far from adequate to draw definite conclusions. It has been suggested that hypertonic saline (HS) nebulization may be useful in making secretions less viscous and promoting their excretion, thereby resulting in clinical improvement. Despite the lack of sufficient data, many physicians use this, though sometimes more for psychological than clinical benefit. Against such a background, it is relevant to ask the clinical question, &#x0201c;in infants with bronchiolitis (population), does HS nebulization (intervention) result in better clinical response (outcome) compared to no intervention or nebulization with normal saline (comparison).&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] A few studies have been done to see the effectiveness of 3% HS nebulization in acute bronchiolitis. A recent Cochrane review suggested that HS nebulization resulted in shorter duration of hospitalization among admitted infants and better clinical severity score among nonadmitted infants, although it failed to reduce the rate of hospitalization among them. No adverse effects were reported.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Most of the data on this topic originated from Israel, Canada, and UAE. Hence, we carried out this study with the objective to find out the effectiveness of 3% HS nebulization in acute bronchiolitis among Indian children. We hypothesized that 3% HS nebulization would lead to early recovery of admitted infants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This prospective study was conducted on one hundred children admitted in the Pediatrics Department of GGS Medical College and Hospital, Faridkot with the diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis between the months of October to February for 2 consecutive years, the typical bronchiolitis season in this part of the country.

This might also have reduced an opportunity for secondary bacterial overgrowth and hereby may contribute to the favorable effect of decreasing post inhalation therapy clinical severity scores.</p><p>In our study, the mean duration of hospital stay was 3.4 &#x000b1; 1.7, 3.7 &#x000b1; 1.9 and 4.9 &#x000b1; 1.4 days in 3% HS, 0.9% saline and salbutamol groups respectively. Length of hospital stay was found to be statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001). <italic>Post-hoc</italic> analysis showed that length of stay was significantly reduced in 3% HS and 0.9% saline groups. In fact, the length of stay was reduced by as much as 30.6% in 3% HS Group and 24.9% in 0.9% saline group as compared to salbutamol group.</p><p>A similar reduction in the length of hospital stay has been observed by various other authors.</p><p>Mandelberg <italic>et al</italic>. observed a mean duration of hospital stay of 3 &#x000b1; 1.2 and 4 &#x000b1; 1.9 days in 3% HS (with epinephrine) and 0.9% saline (with epinephrine) groups respectively.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Tal <italic>et al</italic>. observed a mean duration of hospital stay of 2.6 &#x000b1; 1.4 and 3.5 &#x000b1; 1.7 days in 3% HS (with epinephrine) and 0.9% saline (with epinephrine) groups respectively.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Luo <italic>et al</italic>. observed a mean duration of hospital stay of 6 &#x000b1; 1.2 and 7.4 &#x000b1; 1.5 days in 3% HS (with salbutamol) and 0.9% saline (with salbutamol) groups respectively.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>In our study protocol, we did not encourage the use of bronchodilators along with the study solution. However, the attending physician felt the need to introduce them in only 4 patients in the 3% HS group and 6 patients in the 0.9% saline group. No side effects viz. tremors, severe bronchospasm, tachycardia were noted in the study in all the three groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The present study concludes that 3% HS nebulization (without additional bronchodilators) is an effective and safe treatment for nonasthmatic, moderately ill patients of acute bronchiolitis. It significantly reduces the CS scores and length of hospital stay as compared to 0.9% saline and salbutamol in 0.9% saline nebulization. The economic benefit of this comparably priced modality of treatment can be enormous in terms of hospital costs with parents returning to work sooner.</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Financial support and
