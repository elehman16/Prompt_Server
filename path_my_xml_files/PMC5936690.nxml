In DSM-IV and in DSM-5, ASD is described on a behavioral level only. In DSM- IV <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, the core symptoms are qualitative impairments in social interaction, qualitative impairments in communication and restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior. In DSM-5 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, the core symptoms are persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. The social disability is multifaceted with deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, in social non-verbal communication, and in developing, understanding and maintaining relationships.</p><p id="p0015">Both clinical practice and epidemiological research show that more than 70% of individuals with ASD have concurrent and impairing medical, developmental or psychiatric conditions (like anxiety disorders, mood disorders and personality disorders) <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. As people with ASD become more aware of their limitations, the risk of developing these comorbidities increases. The prevalence of these disorders is significantly higher in high functioning people with ASD than in neurotypical adults <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In a study of Lugneg&#x000e5;rd, Hallerb&#x000e4;ck, and Gillberg <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, approximately 50% of adults with ASD fulfilled criteria for a personality disorder. Four studies <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> found low scores on the character dimensions &#x02018;self-directedness&#x02019; and &#x02018;cooperativeness&#x02019;, indicating personality pathology <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity and the negative impact of comorbidity on outcome and general functioning in society make treatment necessary <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p id="p0020">The field of treatment research for adults with ASD is still in its infancy, and in the literature autism and psychotherapy are rarely combined, but it does not seem an impossible combination <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The focus of therapy must be the specific need of the patient with ASD whereby ASD can be seen as a basic persistent and pervasive disorder on which comorbid psychiatric disorders secondarily arise. Few treatment options are available so far and the effectiveness of existing treatment interventions for adults with ASD with and without comorbid disorders, such as cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBT) and pharmacological therapies, remains very limited and has yet to be demonstrated, with scant though promising results <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p id="p0025">We have therefore developed a specific schema therapy program for adult patients with ASD and comorbid PD(s). We settled on schema therapy for several reasons. First, there is more and more evidence-based support for this therapy as a valuable treatment for PDs <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Second, the therapeutic relationship is active, consistent, supportive and directive with regard to both content and process, which we consider helpful for people with ASD who are characterized by low self-directedness <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Third, schema therapy is a structured and focused psychotherapy, which we consider to be suitable for people with ASD who benefit from structure and focus. The program consists of both cognitive-behavioral and experiential interventions. Cognitive-behavioral interventions are focused, structured, and goal-directed, and thus suitable with a view to the nature of the disorders in ASD and the associated need for clarity and structure. We apply the same approach to our experiential interventions: step by step, focused on a theme, structured by explanation and psycho-education, and goal-directed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>The present study</title><p id="p0030">The aim of the study is to investigate whether schema therapy with cognitive-behavioral and experiential interventions will be effective for adult patients with ASD and at least one personality disorder (PD). The research question is: <italic>&#x02018;Can patients with comorbid ASD</italic>-<italic>PD benefit from schema therapy</italic>, <italic>more specifically its cognitive</italic>-<italic>behavioral and experiential interventions?</italic></p><p id="p0035">The first objective is to study in detail the effects of the major technique groups of schema therapy &#x02013; that is, the cognitive-behavioral techniques and experiential techniques -- on belief strength of negative core beliefs in comorbid ASD-PD patients. We hypothesize that schema therapy leads to less belief strength of negative core beliefs. Furthermore, the short-term effects of both groups of techniques will be compared.</p><p id="p0040">A secondary objective is to reduce the occurrence of dysfunctional schema modes (i.e. personality pathology in schema therapy terms). We hypothesize that schema therapy leads to a reduction in dysfunctional schema modes and an increase in functional modes.</p><p id="p0045">A third objective is to reduce the occurrence of diagnostic criteria of personality disorders. We hypothesize that schema therapy leads to a reduced occurrence of personality disorder traits.</p><p id="p0050">A fourth objective is a change in the severity of psychopathological symptoms, related to syndromic disorders like depression and anxiety disorders. We hypothesize that psychopathological symptoms will be diminished by the given treatment.</p><p id="p0055">Lastly, we hypothesize that schema therapy will lead to an improvement in social interaction and communication. Our hypothesis is that more insight into one's own functioning through the given treatment will lead to an improvement in social interaction and communication.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec3.1"><label>3.1</label><title>Study design and procedure</title><p id="p0060">This study is a concurrent multiple baseline design with a baseline varying in length from 4 to 9 weeks. In this study, there are two treatment conditions (cognitive-behavioral and experiential techniques) and two control conditions (baseline and exploration) in a within-subject design, without a control group. This treatment design precludes the randomization to groups and blinding of treatment. We randomize the baseline phase across participants to increase the internal validity of the case series design by varying the baseline duration from 4 to 9 weeks over participants. We also randomize the order of starting with either cognitive-behavioral or experiential interventions. The variation in baseline length and order makes it possible to differentiate between time effects and cognitive-behavioral and experiential intervention effects. During the baseline phase, the &#x02018;treatment as usual&#x02019;(TAU) is continued until 6 supportive sessions start in week 5 for participants 1 and 2; 5 supportive sessions start in week 6 for participants 3 and 4; 4 supportive sessions start for participants 5 and 6 in week 7; 3 supportive sessions start for participants 7 and 8 in week 8; 2 supportive sessions start for participants 9 and 10 in week 9; and one supportive session is given in week 10 for participants 11 and 12. In this way we can check whether meeting the therapist and attending sessions have an influence. <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref> shows the 10-week period with 4&#x02013;9 weeks TAU-baseline and 6 to 1 weeks with weekly supportive sessions by study therapist.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Baseline and supportive sessions phase &#x02013; 10-week period with 4&#x02013;9 weeks TAU-baseline and 6 to 1 weeks with weekly supportive sessions by study therapist.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0010">Table&#x000a0;1</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Participant</th><th>Wk1</th><th>Wk2</th><th>Wk3</th><th>Wk4</th><th>Wk5</th><th>Wk6</th><th>Wk7</th><th>Wk8</th><th>Wk9</th><th>Wk10</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td>TAU</td><td><bold>SUP</bold></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>TAU: treatment as usual; SUP: supportive session.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p id="p0065">After baseline and supportive sessions, which for each patient covers a 10 week period in total, a 5-week exploration phase follows with weekly sessions during which current and past functioning, psychological symptoms, and schema modes are explored, negative core beliefs are identified and explored, and information about the treatment is provided.

All participants are assessed by the SCID-II during screening (i.e. before baseline), at 5-month follow-up, and at 10-month follow-up.</p><p id="p0140">Another secondary outcome is severity of psychological symptoms on Symptom Check List (SCL-90; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>). The SCL-90 is a 90-item self-report questionnaire assessing psychological symptoms during the last week. Each item consists of five statements, rated on a 1&#x02013;4 point scale for severity, resulting in a total score of 90&#x02013;450. The Dutch version of the SCL-90 will be used. All participants complete the SCL-90 during screening procedure (i.e. before baseline), after supportive sessions phase, after exploration phase, after cognitive-behavioral intervention phase, after experiential phase, at 5-month follow-up, and at 10-months follow-up.</p><p id="p0145">The last secondary outcome is an improvement of social responsiveness on the Social Responsiveness Scale &#x02013; Adult version (SRS-A; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>). The SRS-A is a 64-item self-report questionnaire measuring various dimensions of interpersonal behavior, communication and rigid, repetitive behavior and interests, characteristic for adults with ASD. The items correspond to 4 treatment scales i.e. Social consciousness, Social communication, Social motivation, and Rigidity and repetitiveness. Each item has four statements, rated on a 1&#x02013;4 point scale. The Dutch version of the SRS-A will be used to assess improvement in social responsiveness by analyzing total scores and scores on the 4 treatment scales. All participants complete the SRS-A during screening procedure (i.e. before baseline), after supportive sessions phase, after exploration phase, after cognitive-behavioral intervention phase, after experiential phase, at 5-month follow-up, and at 10-month follow-up.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3.7"><label>3.7</label><title>Study parameters</title><sec id="sec3.7.1"><label>3.7.1</label><title>Primary study parameter</title><p id="p0150">To test the first hypothesis, the following variable will be used: Belief Strength by VAS (negative core beliefs).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3.8"><label>3.8</label><title>Secondary study parameters</title><p id="p0155">To test the second hypothesis -- i.e. to assess whether schema therapy leads to dysfunctional schema modes occurring less frequently, and functional modes occurring more frequently -- the manifestations of schema modes will be assessed with the SMI.

The concurrent multiple baseline design is practical, because it requires fewer patients. The loss of power is compensated by the fact that participants serve as their own controls and by the large number of assessments of the primary outcome. We are not aware of a systematic way to perform power analysis for the concurrent multiple baseline design. As an indication, the study would have 80% power to detect a change of Cohen's <italic>d</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1 or higher at alpha&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05, two-tailed, if the paired <italic>t</italic>-test of the pre to post change were used to evaluate the treatment effect. A mixed regression analysis will be used for time, condition and time-within-treatment, which has been applied successfully in previous cases series studies. Mixed regression analysis will be used to assess the differences between the exploration, treatment (cognitive-behavior and experiential) and follow-up phases compared to the baseline phase. As an indication, we refer to the article of Arntz, Sofi and Van Breukelen <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><p id="p0165">The effect of time will be tested by the linear time trend over the whole study period, with first baseline assessment as zero time point. Condition will be tested by 5 levels: baseline and supportive sessions phase, exploration phase, cognitive-behavioral intervention phase, experiential intervention phase, and follow-up phase. Time-within-treatment will be tested by centered linear time effects within each of the conditions. For the analysis of core belief strength, we will follow a similar strategy as in Arntz, Sofi and Van Breukelen <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> and Videler, Van Alphen, Van Royen, Van der Feltz-Cornelis, Rossi &#x00026; Arntz <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. First, a full model with time, condition (with baseline as reference), and time within each condition will be run, with for the repeated part an AR1 or ARMA structure, and if possible random intercepts and slopes for participant. If the linear time effect becomes N.S., it will be eliminated from the model. Next, N.S. time-within-condition effects will be eliminated step by step. We expect that both active treatment conditions will differ significantly from baseline, as follow-up will do. We expect time-within-condition to be significant, reflecting gradual reductions in belief strength during the two active conditions, with a N.S. difference between the two active conditions. The other variables (except the PD-criterion scores) will also be analyzed with mixed regression, now with a simpler model as no weekly assessments are available. The reduction in number of symptoms for the initially diagnosed PD using the SCID-II between first (during screening procedure), second (at 5-month follow-up) and last (at 10-month follow-up) measurement will be tested using Wilcoxon's Signed Rank test.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0170">To the best of the authors' knowledge so far no study has been published on the application of schema mode focused interventions in adult patients with ASD and comorbid PD(s). The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of schema therapy for PD-psychopathology in patients with both ASD and PD. Our study investigates whether these patients can benefit from both cognitive-behavioral and experiential interventions. We use cognitive-behavioral interventions to target dysfunctional cognitions and beliefs, and to work on developing (social) skills. We use experiential interventions to alter the meaning of the childhood experiences and of present and future situations that have caused or contributed to the negative core beliefs and schema modes (see Ref.&#x000a0;<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>). In non-ASD patients with PDs, both sets of techniques have been found effective <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Clinicians often doubt whether experiential techniques can be used in ASD patients. As experiential techniques have a central place in schema therapy for PDs, it is important to test this.</p><p id="p0175">The study is powered on the basis of paired <italic>t</italic>-test so that with 80% power a large pre-post effect size (Cohen's d&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1) can be detected at a significance level of 0.05. This effect size is based on previous studies into schema therapy for personality disorders. In ASD patients the effects might show to be weaker, but this can only be determined afterwards. On the other hand, the planned statistical analysis (mixed regression) and the many assessments of the primary outcome will lead to a higher power than a simple paired <italic>t</italic>-test of a twice assessed outcome.</p><p id="p0180">A limitation of this study is that we did not consider using baseline length as a stratification factor when designing the study. As we already started the study, this cannot be revised. However, because we independently randomized TAU-baseline length and order, the combinations are random and we therefore don't expect substantial correlations between the two.</p><p id="p0185">This study offers the first systematic test of administering schema therapy to adults with ASD. The results of this study will provide initial evidence for the effectiveness of schema therapy in treating adults with both ASD and PD(s). The study intends to provide valuable information for the future development and implementation of therapeutic interventions for adults with both ASD and PD(s).</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Trial status</title><p id="p0190">The trial started in April 2016 and data collection is expected to continue until April 2018.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Competing interests</title><p id="p0195">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Authors' contributions</title><p id="p0200">RV and AA designed the study.
