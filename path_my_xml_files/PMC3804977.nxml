training (VFT) in the sitting position on sitting balance ability and visual perception of
chronic stroke patients. [Subjects] Twenty-two hospitalized subjects who had experienced a
stroke more than six months earlier were included in this study. [Methods] Subjects in
both the experimental group (n=12) and the control group (n=10) participated in a
conventional rehabilitation program involving a 60-minute session five days per week for a
period of four weeks. Subjects in the experimental group additionally practiced VFT
30-minute sessions, five days per week, for a period of four weeks. [Results] After the
intervention, the experimental group showed significantly improved static sitting balance
ability (left&#x02219;right, anterior&#x02219;posterior moment, and velocity moment), and dynamic sitting
balance ability (anterior&#x02219;lateral moment). In visual perception tests, motor free visual
perception test (MVPT) scores showed a significant increase of approximately 17% in the
experimental group after the intervention. [Conclusion] The results of this study
demonstrate the effectiveness of VFT in enhancing body function, as evidenced by improved
sitting balance and visual perception of chronic stroke patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Visual feedback</kwd><kwd>Sitting balance</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke is a serious health problem worldwide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, and is accompanied by motor function deficits and decline in
sensory function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stroke patients support
their body weight on the affected side; therefore, they tend to experience difficulty in
achieving balance when standing or sitting<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, these balance
difficulties are worsened by increase of postural sway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, after stroke, balance exercise with postural control is
considered an important means of restoring patients&#x02019; motor function during rehabilitation.
Decline in balance causes postural sway, asymmetric weight distribution, and reduction in
the ability to shift weight and stand normally<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, it increases the risk of
falls, creates social problems, and is associated with considerable cost<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
particular, a decline in sitting balance affects standing balance, reduces transfer and
walking abilities, limits activities of daily living, creates fear and increases the risk of
falls. A decline in sitting balance also causes mental problems, a major cause of decline in
quality of life<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Maintenance of physical balance requires proper control of the center of gravity and
movement, and involves the processing of complex sensory and motor inputs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Several interventions have been devised to improve balance, such as balance training in a
sitting position, task oriented training<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, training in a standing position<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, training using a gym ball, a balance ball or, a balance board<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, and treadmill training<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, some methods have been
devised to increase sitting balance, such as trunk performance training<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, task oriented training<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, and dual task training using a ball<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>VFT using a force plate allows patients to check in real time their positions and the
location of the center of gravity during postural changes, which enables patients to
perceive postural information and use it to control and maintain their posture<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, VFT has been reported to
improve asymmetric standing balance of stroke patients effectively facilitating their
posture control<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A VFT program was recently devised based on a computer game, and it has been reported to
increase patient&#x02019;s practice volume and attention span during training, and reduce the number
of falls by patients with a balance problem after cerebellar surgery<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Si Hyung et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref><sup>)</sup>, who conducted VFT for acute stroke patients attempting to improve
their motor function and visual perception function, reported significantly improved motor
function and visual perception. In addition, VFT for peripheral neuropathy or stroke
patients with accompanying balance problems effectively improved activity levels, transfer
ability, motor recovery, and balance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. Many recent studies conducted VFT for
chronic stroke patients in the standing position<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Pilot studies have also been conducted with patients with spinal
cord or traumatic brain injuries<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref><sup>)</sup>, but,
as yet, the effect of VFT in the sitting position has not been clarified for these patient
groups. In addition, the effects of VFT in the sitting position on static balance and visual
perception have not been determined.</p><p>Therefore, in the current study, we investigated the effect of VFT in the sitting position
on sitting balance and visual perception of chronic stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study subjects were chronic stroke inpatients at the S Medical Center (Seoul) more than
six months after stroke. Subjects who could sit independently for at least 30 minutes, who
had a Korean Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE-K) score of &#x0003e; 21 points, who had not
participated in any balance training program during the previous six months, who had no
orthopedic problems, such as a fracture, deformity, or severe osteoarthritis, and who were
not taking any drugs for balance maintenance were included. Written informed consent, after
providing an explanation of the study purpose, as well as the experimental method and
processes, was obtained from all patients.</p><p>Of the 30 patients initially considered, four were excluded because of a visual disability
(one patient) and orthopedic conditions (three patients). The remaining 26 patients were
randomly assigned to either the experimental group (n = 13) or the control group (n = 13).
Random allocation software was used to randomly allocate the subjects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Subjects in both the experimental group and the control group participated in a general
physical therapy program, consisting of 60-minute sessions, five days per week for a period
of four weeks. Subjects in the experimental group additionally participated in the VFT
program, consisting of 30-minute sessions, five days per week for a period of four
weeks.</p><p>During the study period, one patient in the experimental group and three patients in the
control group withdrew from the study due to discharge. Therefore, 12 patients in the
experimental group and 10 patients in the control group were included in the final
analysis.</p><p>In order to prevent loss of concentration due to external interference, VFT was performed
individually in a dedicated room containing the required equipment. The VFT program was
conducted by a researcher and three assistants who were trained in use of the equipment and
performance of evaluation measurements. In order to eliminate experimenter bias, the
assistants did not have knowledge of the purpose of the study or its effects. VFT was
performed using BIORescue (RM INGENIERIE, Rodez, France) equipment, which consists of a
computer, a monitor, and a force plate. This force plate detects the posture and movements
made by subjects and this information is transferred to the computer, and processed for
display on the monitor. This system encourages adoption of the correct posture by providing
visual feedback and allows for design of customized exercise programs based on pre-test
data. The system also allows different exercise times and intensities for selected games,
and within-session variable rest times. In the study, the participants sat 1&#x02013;1.5 m away from
the monitor on a pressure platform. Patients performed the given task by moving their bodies
as required by the program. Patients received instructions about the program and safety
beforehand. The training sessions were composed of four exercises of 6 minutes 30 seconds
each with a one-minute rest period between exercises. Four types of exercise were performed
during each session. The first exercise was training for stability and weight shift by
balancing the amount of water in a flask. The second was training for stability and weight
shift by driving a vehicle. The third exercise was skiing, which involved shifting the body
in the anterior, posterior, left, and right directions in three-dimensional space; and the
fourth exercise used a memory recall program, during which the patient had to remember four
pictures and to match the picture. Five exercise levels were incorporated, which allowed for
variation of speed, number of obstacles, number of picture cards, weight maintenance, and
weight shift sensitivities. An appropriate level was initially chosen by the examiner and
this was subsequently increased.</p><p>General exercises were performed for 60 minutes, five times per week for a period of four
weeks. A physical therapist conducted range of motion exercises for 10 minutes,
strengthening exercises for 10 minutes, and posture control and walking exercises for 10
minutes, and an occupational therapist focused on the functional activities required for
daily living for 30 minutes.</p><p>Static sitting balance, dynamic sitting balance, and visual perception were tested before
and after the interventions. A Good Balance System (Metitur Ltd, Finland, 2008) was used to
measure static balance. This equipment measures the balance of senile and stroke patients,
and is widely available<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. Using the
test-retest method, the intrater reliability of the Good Balance System was reported as
having intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from r=0.51&#x02013;0.74 (anterior posterior
speed), and r=0.63&#x02013;0.83 (right/left speed)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref><sup>)</sup>. Static balance was measured with the patients sitting on the force
plate with their feet approximately shoulder width apart and their eyes open. Patients were
asked to look at a red point of 10 cm in diameter 1 m in front of them for 30 seconds while
their balance was measured; the test was repeated three times. The same procedure was
followed three times with patients&#x02019; eyes closed for 30 seconds. The average values of both
measurement conditions were recorded.</p><p>Dynamic balance in the sitting position was measured using a modified version of the
Functional Reach Test. The inter-rater reliability of this modified functional reach test
was reported as r=0.97, indicating excellent reliability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. A standard scale that measures the distance was set at patients&#x02019;
acromion height and fixed on the wall, while patients sat comfortably on a stool. The
patient&#x02019;s hip joints and knee joints were flexed at 90&#x000b0;, the chair and popliteal area were 5
cm apart, and the feet were in contact with the ground. For anterior measurements, the
shoulder joint was flexed at 90&#x000b0; with the elbow joint in maximum extension, so that the arm
was in line with the hand. The patient moved his/her upper extremity and trunk forward as
much as possible, and the distance from the starting position to the ending position of the
middle finger tip was measured on the standard scale. For lateral measurements of the
unaffected sides, the shoulder joint was abducted at 90&#x000b0; with the elbow joint extended
maximally so that the arm was straight. The patient moved his/her upper extremity and trunk
toward the unaffected side as much as possible, and the distance from the starting position
to the ending position of the middle finger tip was measured on the standard scale. All
evaluations were performed three times and average values were recorded.</p><p>Visual perception was measured using the motor free visual perception test (MVPT). MVPT is
a standard tool used for diagnosis and research purposes and evaluates overall visual
perception performance among children and adults with high test-retest reliability (r=0.77:
0.91) and validity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>MVPT consists of 36 multiple-choice items that involve the use of two-dimensional
configurations. It evaluates five types of visual perception skills, including visual
discrimination, figure-ground discrimination, spatial relationships, visual closure, and
visual memory. Each item is scored as correct or incorrect, and a point is given for each
correct item. The total score ranges from 0 to 36 points. Higher scores reflect fewer
deficits in general visual perceptual function. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test
variables for normality, and the independent t test was used for comparison of static and
dynamic sitting balance, and visual perception between the experimental and control groups.
Comparisons between pre- and post-treatment data within each group were analyzed using the
paired t test. SPSS 18.0 for Windows version was used to perform all the analyses, and p
values of &#x0003c; 0.05 were regarded as significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> Subject characteristics</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experimental</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control </td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (male/female)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12 (4/8)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 (2/8)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> 60. 6&#x000b1;8.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> 63.7&#x000b1;4.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">163.4&#x000b1;6.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">163.1&#x000b1;7.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> 66.3&#x000b1;9.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> 67.5&#x000b1;9.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hemiplegic side (right/left)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> 12 (2/10)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> 10 (4/6)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MMSE-K (score)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> 23.5&#x000b1; 3.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> 25.5&#x000b1;3.1</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are expressed as mean &#x000b1; SD</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title> Comparison of sway speed and velocity moment within groups and between

balance and visual perception of stroke patients while in the sitting position.</p><p>At the end of the four-week training period, VFT had improved static sitting balance by 30%
with the eyes open and by 44.4% with the eyes closed. These results are in agreement with
those of previous studies. Karthikbabu et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref><sup>)</sup> reported an improvement in static sitting balance after dual task
training the trunk impairment scale (TIS). In the current study, a force plate was used to
measure static balance. Due to differences between the measurement equipment used in the
present study and in the previous study of Karthikbabu et al., direct comparisons are not
possible. Nevertheless, since trunk balance training using visual feedback produced results
similar to those observed with balance training using a dynamic ball, both studies suggest
the possibility of the clinical application of VFT.</p><p>In a previous study, static sitting balance testing of stroke patients was performed with
their feet off the ground and the back of the chair removed. Greater impairment was found in
co-contractions of the rectus abdominis and latissimus dorsi, which control flexion and
extension movement of the trunk, than of co-contractions of the internal and external
oblique muscles, which control lateral movement of the trunk (p&#x0003c;0.05)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. Greater impairment of the muscles
controlling flexion and extension of the trunk resulted in greater increase of anterior and
posterior sway speed than right and left sway speed. However, in the current study, testing
was performed with the feet in contact with the ground, and the speed of anterior-posterior
sway was lower than the speed of right-left sway in both study groups. We consider that an
ankle joint strategy may compensate for anterior and posterior sway speed, whereas right and
left sway speed was dependent only on trunk control<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, in a previous study, right and left balance control
was found to show substantial correlation with the Berg balance scale<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref><sup>)</sup>, indicating that right and left balance control should be
considered as an important target of rehabilitation.</p><p>In the current study, the decrease in right and left sway speed was greater than the
decrease in anterior and posterior sway speed after VFT in the sitting position, which
suggests the stroke patients&#x02019; balance was improved. We suggest that the right and left
weight shift training elements of the visual feedback program, that is, the flask, vehicle,
and skiing exercises, were responsible for the improvement in right and left sway speed of
the trunk. Our results suggest that, VFT provides an effective additional means of improving
the static sitting balance of stroke patients.</p><p>In the current study, a modified functional reach test was used to evaluate improvements in
dynamic balance in the sitting position. This test measures dynamic movement of the trunk
and it allows easy assessment of the effects of training<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. The average anterior reach of adults between 40 and 50&#x02005;years old
is 421 mm, and that of adults between 60 and 70&#x02005;years old is 346 mm. The average lateral
reach of adults between 40 and 50&#x02005;years old is 262.00 mm, and that of adults between 60 and
70&#x02005;years old is 206 mm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the current
study, pre-intervention, anterior reach and lateral reach of the experimental group and
control groups were below the normal adult averages for 60 to 70&#x02005;years old. This result
indicates both the experimental and control groups had impaired balance. However,
post-intervention, the experimental group had values close to the normal adult average for
anterior and lateral reach, and these improvements were significant (p&#x0003c;0.05). This result
demonstrates that the VFT in sitting position is a useful intervention for improving of
dynamic sitting balance.</p><p>Currently, visual feedback, cognitive training, and dual task training programs are used to
improve the visual perception ability of stroke patients, and these methods have been
reported to be effective<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, few
studies have been conducted on the effects of intervention methods that simultaneously
combine a visual perception program and exercise for stroke patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref><sup>)</sup>. Si Hyun et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted a visual perception program using a computerized visual
feedback system for the experimental group and a cognitive program for the control group. In
their study, MVPT was used to measure visual perception in both the experimental and control
groups. After intervention, the MVPT score had increased by 32% in the experimental group.
Compared to the intervention method used in the current study, the method used by Si Hyun et
al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref><sup>)</sup> appears to have been more
effective at improving the visual perception improvement in stroke patients. However, their
study subjects were acute stroke patients who had possibility of spontaneous recovery;
therefore, direct comparison with our present study should be avoided.. Nonetheless, based
on the results reported by Si Hyun et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref><sup>)</sup> and our present results, it is evident that VFT effectively
improves the visual perception of stroke patients. In particular, we suggest that VFT can be
used to the improve static and dynamic sitting balance of chronic stroke patients. The
results of this study show that VFT in the sitting position improves static and dynamic
sitting balance and visual perception of chronic stroke patients. The VFT used in the
current study increased patient interest and participation, and, thus, we believe that the
method we described could be used in clinics as an effective way of improve sitting balance
of stroke patients. The present study was limited by the small number of subjects, which
prevents generalizations, and total rehabilitation training times differed in the
experimental and control groups. To rectify this situation, a larger study with equal
training time for the experimental and control groups is required.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Thorvaldsen</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Asplund</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Kuulasmaa</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Stroke incidence, case fatality, and mortality in the WHO
