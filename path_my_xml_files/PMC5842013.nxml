Although limited studies are available on weight regain and definitions are varied in these studies, a review reported that approximately only 20% of overweight individuals are successful weight losers.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> Among various reasons for weight regain, one of the important influencing factors is increased appetite.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup></p><p>Based on our knowledge, the regulation of appetite is rather complex. Previous studies showed that long-term (leptin, insulin) and short-term [ghrelin, peptide YY (PYY), cholecystokinin (CCK), and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)] appetite regulating the hormones is crucial for the modulation of energy balance.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> Leptin and insulin reduce food intake primarily by upregulating the anorexigenic (appetite-reducing) neuropeptides and downregulating the orexigenic factors in the brain.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> Hitherto, ghrelin is the only hormone that has been observed to be orexigenic, whereas PYY, CCK, and GLP-1 are considered as satiety regulating hormones.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> These hormones respond to balanced diet and exercise-induced weight loss and play vital roles in the regulation of subjective appetite after the intervention.</p><p>Although balanced diet in combination with aerobic exercise exhibit optimal weight loss effects, increased ghrelin and decreased leptin, insulin, PYY, and CCK would reduce satiety and drive the eating desire that is unfavorable in maintaining the reduced weight.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> Moreover, another proinflammatory factor, interleukin 6 (IL-6), is reported to decrease in resting level after diet and exercise-induced weight loss process as per our previous study. IL-6 is critical in promoting food intake and satiety; thus, decreased IL-6 after weight loss may also be an adverse factor for appetite rebalance.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup></p><p>&#x0201c;Living High-Training Low&#x0201d; (LHTL) mode has been widely used to improve athletic performance in healthy athletes based on hypoxia exposure. However, the reduced appetite and subsequent weight loss after high-altitude sojourns lead to the speculation that exposure to hypoxia may be a viable weight-reduction strategy.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> Nevertheless, only a few studies reported the effect of long-term intermittent hypoxia (IH) exposure on the increased appetite during diet and exercise-induced weight loss in individuals with obesity. Our team has designed a new randomized controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of a 4-week IH exposure plus conventional exercise training and diet intervention for inducing short- and long-term weight loss in adolescents with obesity.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> Recently, a review summarized that ghrelin, leptin, and GLP-1 seemed to be involved in long-term hypoxia exposure-induced changes in orexigenic and anorexigenic hormones.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> In addition, hypoxia would regulate IL-6 expression directly or indirectly in obesity,<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> and the increased IL-6 has also been determined to reduce the food intake.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> Thus, these hormones may participate in hypoxia-mediated appetite changes. Therefore, we hypothesize that weight loss is evident, whereas satiety hormones, as well as IL-6, would be increased after LHTL intervention than &#x0201c;Living Low-Training Low&#x0201d; (LLTL). Furthermore, we compared the changes in body composition, blood lipids, and appetite hormones at the baseline level and postintervention between subjects who slept in normoxia and hypoxia condition to explore the mechanism underlying LHTL on weight loss and appetite regulation.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Study design</title><p>The study, comprising of 35 adolescents, was a randomized, assessment-blinded, controlled clinical trial spanning over 4 weeks. A public health nurse assessed the Tanner stage of each subject using the Tanner grading system.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> A criterion of body mass index (BMI)-matched age of male and female children with obesity was fulfilled for inclusion in the study.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> The trial was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR-TRC-14004106). This trial adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol and informed consent were approved by the institutional review board of Shanghai University of Sport, Shanghai, China. Written informed consents were obtained from all participants and their parents. Because the subjects were obese children and adolescents and need to sleep in a normobaric normoxia condition, we first talked to subjects and their parents about the principles of hypoxia intervention, the detailed process of sleeping in normobaric normoxia condition, the potential risks and the possible physical effects so that they fully understand the experimental process and decide whether to participate or not. Then, subjects who volunteered to participate in the experiment would be scheduled to sleep in normobaric normoxia condition for 1 night to decide whether discomfort problems occurred and whether to continue to participate in the experiment. All participants received identical well-defined and balanced diet program daily during the intervention.

The MET values were established using pulmonary function equipment according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cosmed, K4b2, Roma, Italy). The oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>) for all activities was measured using the Cosmed K4b2 portable metabolic system. The exhaled respiratory gases were collected on a breath-by-breath basis during a submaximal treadmill (H/P/Cosmos Pulsar 4.0, Nussdorf-Traunstein, Germany) test. The participants began the exercise at a speed of 2&#x0200a;km/h, increased by 1&#x0200a;km/h every 2.5 minutes until 8&#x0200a;km/h was reached, without slope gradient in the treadmill. Eighty percent of the maximum heart rate (HR<sub>max</sub>, [220-age]) was set as a standard of exercise termination, during which VO<sub>2</sub> and HR data were collected.

In the LHTL group, GLP-1 levels rose greatly after intervention, and weight change was closely related to the changes in GLP-1 and IL-6, indicating an upward trend of satiety hormones. Moreover, changes in GLP-1 and IL-6 levels were positively correlated, implying an IL-6/GLP-1 synergistic effect in the LHTL group. This finding allows us to first propose that LHTL might induce the upregulation of GLP-1 that may be mediated by IL-6. Consequently, changes in both satiety factors after intervention could be beneficial for the appetite regulation during long-term weight management in adolescents with obesity. Thus, our results proposed a method that may be effective and practical for weight loss practice through exercise in normal conditions and sleeping in hypoxic conditions.</p><p>Interventions with hypoxic exposure are effective in reducing the weight. Presently, most studies have focused on the effect of short-term passive IH exposure or active hypoxic training in healthy subjects. However, we recruit adolescents with obesity as the subjects and use an intervention that distinguish the hypoxia intervention from exercise training process, which simultaneously avoids the load of exercise and hypoxic effects on individuals with obesity. Furthermore, the intervention would coordinate the body's response to hypoxia and exercise in an effective and operable manner. The current study demonstrated that LHTL for 4 weeks might produce favorable cumulative benefits on both weight loss, lipids metabolism, and appetite hormones. These results provided convincing evidence that LHTL intervention exerted favorable benefits on individuals with obesity than LLTL.</p><p>Among the beneficial effects of hypoxia on the body, the changes in appetite hormones during hypoxic exposure are varied. Some studies revealed that changes in ghrelin and CCK were supposedly responsible for anorexia at high altitude,<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> whereas others were identified decreased or unaffected satiety hormones during hypoxic exposure.<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> The current results indicated a decrease in CCK levels in the LLTL but not the LHTL group, thereby indicating a reduced satiety after LLTL intervention. Based on the background that leptin and insulin are elevated in obesity and differently affected by hypoxia and aerobic exercise,<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> we may speculate that the effect of aerobic exercise and hypoxia on leptin and insulin regulation is benign and the changes are accompanied by weight loss. Thus, leptin and insulin displayed a decreasing trend or a significant decrease in both groups, whereas significance between the groups was not found. Moreover, these changes would be favorable for improved sensitivity of leptin and insulin and energy homeostasis of whole body, as well as, individuals with obesity, although crucial long-term appetite regulators are present. The differential regulation of leptin and insulin in response to exercise and hypoxia necessitates further research to explore the mechanism underlying the combination of &#x0201c;aerobic exercise&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;sleeping in hypoxia&#x0201d; in LHTL on leptin and insulin secretion and function.</p><p>We also found an increase in GLP-1 levels in the LHTL group as compared to the LLTL group. The result leads us to explore the role of hypoxia in GLP-1 regulation. Studies on healthy subjects showed that short-term or long-term hypoxia exerted a limited influence on GLP-1 levels,<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> whereas long-term hypoxia and inactivity caused a decrease in the levels of postprandial GLP-1.<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> However, studies on the effect of long-term hypoxia exposure on GLP-1 regulation in individuals with obesity are scarce. Moreover, GLP-1 has been shown to promote satiety, suppresses energy intake, and prevent weight gain.<sup>[<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</sup> Individuals with obesity showed up to 20% impaired GLP-1 response as compared to normal weight individuals.<sup>[<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]</sup> Consistently, we found a significant decrease in the BW, which positively correlated with an evident increase in GLP-1 levels after LHTL intervention. Thus, the increased GLP-1 levels may indicate a beneficial trend for controlling the BW. However, the specific mechanism underlying hypoxia-mediated regulation of GLP-1 levels warrants further studies.</p><p>Notably, the inflammatory factor, IL-6, showed an increased trend but not to a significant level, and presented a negative correlation with weight change in subjects with LHTL intervention. This phenomenon was enhanced by exercise or other factors, and IL-6 has been reported to induce weight loss and alleviate obesity-induced fatty liver and insulin resistance.<sup>[<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</sup> Moreover, the disruption of hypothalamic-specific IL-6 activity could block the beneficial effects of exercise on BW and/or the rebalance of food intake and insulin and leptin resistance.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> Previous studies reported that hypoxia exposure might promote the secretion of IL-6 in adipocytes, and thus, may effectuate the metabolism through several mechanisms.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]</sup> In this study, the 4-week LHTL intervention induced significant weight loss and a corresponding increase in IL-6 level. The negative correlation between alterations in IL-6 change and weight implies a putative rebalanced appetite in an IL-6-dependent response postintervention.</p><p>Interestingly, we found a positive relationship between changes in GLP-1 and IL-6 in the LHTL group. GLP-1 and IL-6 have been reported to interact with each other. IL-6 may reduce the inflammation and insulin resistance in a GLP-1-dependent manner,<sup>[<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]</sup> whereas GLP-1 may affect the food intake and weight change in an IL-6-dependent manner.<sup>[<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]</sup> Although hypoxia activates IL-6 and GLP-1 signal, how hypoxia activates the IL-6/GLP-1 signal and the effect of different oxygen concentration on IL-6/GLP-1 signal modulation is yet unknown. Herein, we may infer that hypoxia-induced significant secretion of GLP-1 may be partially mediated by IL-6, a regulator that responds directly to hypoxia through NF-&#x003ba;B activation.<sup>[<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]</sup> However, the mechanism of appetite regulation is sophisticated and might be involved in synergistic or antagonistic effects of different interventions such as exercise, diet, and hypoxia. Thus, whether the LHTL-induced weight loss and appetite re-balance would be partially mediated by the synergies of IL-6 and GLP-1 is yet to be elucidated. The mechanism underlying the changes in IL-6 and GLP-1 signal occur in central and peripheral organs after long-term intervention necessitate further investigations. Whether these changes result in different effects of hypoxia, diet, and exercise intervention on the regulation of appetite is also worth exploring further.</p><p>Obesity is a risk factor for apnea syndrome. Although the effect in adults of hypoxia intervention is fairly known, there is scarce research in literature about safety of this intermittent exposure to hypoxic conditions in children and adolescents.<sup>[<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]</sup> Previous reviews summarized the usefulness of moderate IH conditioning/training in sick children for treating their various forms of disease but also emphasized the adverse effects that should be noted.<sup>[<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]</sup> However, we did not find any subject with discomfort symptoms (hypoxia-induced symptoms such as pulmonary vasoconstriction, hyperventilation, cerebrovascular relaxation, sympathetic nervous activity, etc) during hypoxia intervention period. We have taken this problem into full consideration. Each participant underwent rigorous screening of cardiovascular and other non-applicable conditions before the inclusion to ensure safety, and professional sports physician also paid close attention to individuals during hypoxia intervention periods and focused on the subject's reaction to consider whether he or she was appropriate to continue the experiment. In fact, most of the lung ventilation index and basic metabolic variables were improved after both interventions, indicating their efficiency and safety in hypoxic treatment (14.7% O2; &#x0223c;2700&#x0200a;m) of obese adolescents for weight loss and management. Moreover, a mean change in weight of 7&#x0200a;kg obtained after both interventions in a month was striking but achievable for obese adolescents, which further proved the effectiveness of the 2 interventions.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]</sup> Notably, this study presented some limitations. First, this is a single-center study with small sample size and did not achieve double-blindness. Second, the short intervention time may also be a confounding factor for the inconspicuous change in appetite hormones. Third, evaluation of the objective appetite is scarce; the subjective appetite of a majority of the weight losers showed an increasing trend after intervention in our previous survey results. The subjects in this summer camp would return to all over the country; thus, data on weight regain and safety assessment should be collected by further follow-ups. Therefore, appropriate follow-up studies are essential for long-term weight management through the LHTL method.</p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our study demonstrated that LHTL might have a better effect than LLTL on managing the BW and composition in adolescents with obesity. It can induce a favorable weight loss and alter the appetite hormones for the benefit of the long-term weight management through a mechanism of upregulation of GLP-1, a satiety hormone that may be regulated by IL-6 for appetite re-balance during the long-term intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank the study participants and other at the &#x0201c;Shanghai Dianfeng Weight Management Limited&#x0201d; for providing the staff, sports venues, sports, and nutrition monitoring.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: BFP = body fat percentage, BMI = body mass index, BW = body weight, CCK = cholecystokinin, FBG = fasting blood glucose, GLP-1 = glucagon-like peptide-1, HDL = high-density lipoprotein HOMA2-IR = homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, IH = intermittent hypoxia, IL-6 = interleukin-6, LBM = lean body mass, LDL = low-density lipoprotein, LHTL = &#x0201c;Living High-Training Low&#x0201d; group, LLTL = &#x0201c;Living Low-Training Low&#x0201d; group, MET = Metabolic Equivalent of Task, TC = total cholesterol, TFM = total fat mass, TG = triglycerides.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>The study was supported by Shanghai Key Lab of Human Performance (Shanghai University of sport) (NO. 11DZ2261100) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NO. 81472148).</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Grossman</surname><given-names>DC</given-names></name><name><surname>Bibbins-Domingo</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Curry</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
