Systematic reviews have shown that nature-related activities also enhance general well-being as reflected in increased physical activity, a healthier diet, reduced stress and better sleep. Recent research suggests that many young children&#x000a0;in Hong Kong between the ages of two and four in Hong Kong are more sedentary than recommended and seldom participate in active play, placing them at risk of becoming overweight or obese. The proposed project aims to investigate&#x000a0;whether connecting families to nature positively influences physical activity (i.e., active playtime) and healthy eating routines in children aged 2 to 4.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We recently conducted a pilot study in Hong Kong to develop a programme, Play &#x00026; Grow, based on the most successful evidence-based international preschool interventions. In addition to adopting the healthy eating and physical activity elements of these interventions, this project will&#x000a0;additionally include a third novel element of Connectedness to nature: discovering nature through games and awareness of sounds, touch, smells, and temperature. To test the effectiveness of this modified intervention, a randomised controlled trial (RCT) involving 240 families with children aged 2 to 4 will be conducted. Families and children will take part in weekly one-hour activity sessions for 10-weeks. Lifestyle-related habits will be assessed before and immediately after the 10-week intervention, with follow&#x000a0;up testing at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months&#x02019; post intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>A novel measuring tool created specifically for assessing Connectedness to nature, Nature Relatedness Scale (NRS), will be validated and tested for reliability prior to the RCT. The results of the RCT are intended to be used to understand which components of the intervention are most effective. The objectives of this project will be achieved over a 30-month period and will contribute to the research that examines key components of successful healthy lifestyle promotion programmes during early childhood. We predict that the inclusion of Connectedness to nature will significantly improve recognised preschool interventions. Finally, the aim of targeting family involvement will hopefully increase the sustainability of longer-term lifestyle modifications in children.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02715544?term=NCT02715544&#x00026;rank=1">NCT02715544</ext-link>.

Modern-day children practice unhealthy habits and routines; they play indoors, engage in sedentary activities, eat poorly and get insufficient sleep. Lifestyles are generally becoming unhealthier worldwide, and Hong Kong is no exception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The urban environment is criticised for being &#x02018;toxic&#x02019;, promoting the &#x02018;nature-deficit&#x02019; phenomenon, and for stimulating less physical activity in young children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In Hong Kong, the majority of people live in densely populated areas, moving within a concrete labyrinth with little exposure to nature. The prevalence of overweight and obesity amongst Hong Kong children has become an increasingly prominent public health concern. A recent study of the Hong Kong population, conducted in 2013, reported that children as young as 6&#x000a0;months were overweight/obese and by the age of 2 years of age almost 5&#x000a0;% of the territory&#x02019;s children were overweight/obese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Any routines, healthy and unhealthy that get introduced in early childhood&#x000a0;may stay for life, strongly suggesting that interventions promoting healthy living should start as early as possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. For these reasons, we have chosen to target families with children aged 2 to 4 in our proposed research. It is widely accepted amongst the caregivers that preschool children are&#x000a0;sufficiently active and&#x000a0;as a result of this belief is that preschool children are often overlooked in physical activity research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This belief, however, does not always reflect the real situation. The family setting provides the most powerful influence on preschool children; consequently, many of the risk factors for obesity in the preschool years are rooted in the family context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Parents have the capacity to impact their children&#x02019;s emerging food choices with their knowledge of nutrition, and their parenting style and modelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The strongest predictor of vegetable consumption in 2&#x02013;6 year old children is parental consumption, and when it comes to negative eating behaviour&#x000a0;in this age group, this can be modified if handled properly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].&#x000a0;Furthermore, children with active parents also tend to be more active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In Hong Kong, parents often adopt inappropriate strategies in managing the physical activities and dietary habits of their children, such as&#x000a0;encouraging overeating i.e. "force feeding", and allowing children to watch&#x000a0;TV while eating, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. We therefore intend to conduct a family intervention, targeting children&#x02019;s caregivers, as it is well-confirmed that they are responsible for introducing the lifestyle routines in young children and thus play&#x000a0;one of the biggest roles in influencing their habits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Although grandparents and domestic helpers and are&#x000a0;also highly involved in taking care of the children of in Hong Kong, we targeted families with parents as the primary caregivers and not domestic helpers in order to test our hypothesis in a more controlled and homogenous group. The tools which are often utilised by parents to manage some problematic behaviour in children (e.g., food fussiness) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] are documented to firstly improve <italic>general</italic> parenting and secondly, the parenting practices in <italic>specific</italic> situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A recent Cochrane review reported only a marginally significant improvement in body weight after some interventions and little to no effect on dietary&#x000a0;or physical activity behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Hence, developing&#x000a0;new lifestyle intervention programs for preschool children and testing these is highly relevant.</p><p>Time spent in nature has also proven to be beneficial for health and wellbeing. The systematic reviews conducted recently have pointed out that nature-related activities enhance general well-being and lead to increased physical activity, a healthier diet, improved sleep and reduced overall stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Worldwide, the most current programmes promoting a healthy lifestyle for children focus almost exclusively on diet and physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], but few take into consideration a family&#x02019;s interactions with nature. We suggest that this emerging research area, known as Connectedness to nature or Nature Relatedness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], is highly related to healthy lifestyle. Unhealthy lifestyle is often explained by environmental factors, while more time spent outdoors in a natural environment is reflected in healthy life patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>We recently conducted a pilot study in Hong Kong, Play &#x00026; Grow learning, which is based on the most successful preschool interventions from Sweden and Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The results of the pilot work helped formulate the basis of the present project by incorporating the healthy eating and physical activity elements of Play &#x00026; Grow to which we also included a third novel element; Connectedness to nature. The proposed project will examine this modified Play &#x00026; Grow intervention aimed at promoting healthy lifestyle in preschool children (aged 2 to 4) through the combined intervention of healthy eating, active play and connectedness to nature habits to children and their families.</p><p>The strategies outlined in this study are particularly appropriate to Hong Kong for several reasons. First, most Hong Kong children in primary schools fail to reach the physical activity levels recommended by the health authorities,&#x000a0;and moreover, their increased sedentary habits lead to deterioration in health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Second, Hong Kong children&#x02019;s food habits fail to meet recommended nutritional standards: the major source of energy intake derives from calorie-dense foods, saturated fats and sugar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], negatively influencing the territory&#x02019;s obesity levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Third, this unhealthy lifestyle has negative consequences not only on general well-being but also academic performance; an issue of great concern to Hong Kong parents. It is therefore hoped that the proposed project will bring sustainable health benefits to Hong Kong&#x02019;s population in a long run. These positive changes and benefits will hopefully in turn lead to reduced prevalence of obesity amongst children in Hong Kong, and a concomitant decrease in healthcare related costs.</p><p>In addition, this pioneering project will have scientific value in development of several important protocols and measurement instruments, including our Nature Relatedness Scale. Existing instruments for nature relatedness are applicable only to adults and have not yet been tested in Asia; thus, our new instrument will contribute to international research in this field, which has been relatively sparse to date.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Conceptual influences</title><p>Children&#x02019;s optimal development is promoted by active family involvement (Patterson&#x02019;s Social Interaction Learning Theory) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. One of the most effective lifestyle parenting programmes is INFANT (Infant Feeding Activity and Nutrition Trial), which focuses on parenting skills to support the development of healthy lifestyle behaviours in infancy and employs an anticipatory guidance framework (AGF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This framework helps the parents manage certain behaviours in advance rather than managing the problems once they have materialised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The modified Play &#x00026; Grow intervention proposed here will use the same AGF in addressing the eating, sedentary habits of children aged 2 to 4. According to our conceptual model (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), the AGF and parenting support theory &#x02018;children&#x02019;s psychological and behavioural goals, logical and natural consequences and encouragement&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], will aid parents in their <italic>general parenting skills</italic> and knowledge on better-practice eating, active play and Connectedness to nature behaviours in children. This will hopefully modify <italic>specific parenting practices</italic> (e.g., eating, active play and Connectedness to nature routines) that will consequently result in improved family lifestyle and child health.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Conceptual modelling of the relationships between the parenting and the outcomes of healthy lifestyle in children</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2016_3111_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>Connectedness to nature/ relatedness is a relatively new concept that, to date, has been investigated primarily in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The concept suggests, for example, that engaging in activities in a natural environment can induce a feeling of Connectedness to nature. Exposing preschool children to nature and to thinking about nature in different ways could stimulate Nature Relatedness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] as a measurable construct. When children are placed in a natural setting, they tend to engage more in active play [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. As noted above, parents are children&#x02019;s role models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and we therefore believe that connecting parents and other caregivers (particular situation in Hong Kong, which includes grandparents and domestic helpers) with nature will have benefits for their children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Many habits and attitudes are developed early in life, and those related to the natural world are no exception. In fact, children are inherently interested in their environment and in nature in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. We hypothesise that both indoor and outdoor nature-related activities may induce Connectedness to nature and bring about positive changes in both eating and activity habits (short-term outcomes) in preschool children, in turn leading to a healthier lifestyle (long-term outcomes) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>The pilot programme Play &#x00026; Grow</title><p>Play &#x00026; Grow is a 10-week family-based, multi-component healthy lifestyle programme for families with preschool children aged 2 to 4, and&#x000a0;was developed and tested in a pilot study (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;39, aged 2.15, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;.88, retention rate of 93&#x000a0;%) by the PI and her team. The aim of Play &#x00026; Grow is to encourage healthy eating habits and active play in children from an early age, and to bring about healthy behavioural changes in families. The programme also includes a Connectedness to nature element designed to equip parents with environmental knowledge and skills. The generated pre- and post-test comparison data indicated the effectiveness of the programme (not presented here). A detailed manual and full resource kit were created, and each session consisted of: (i) a 15-min theoretical education component (food, activity, Connectedness to nature), and (ii) a 30-min component on indoor and outdoor nature-related activities, such as playing with objects found in nature and searching for natural treasures (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Some nature activities were food-related, such as growing plants, creating miniature indoor gardens, and healthy cooking.&#x000a0;While the intervention group received the programme as detailed in the resource kit, the control group received an information folder containing government-recommended physical activity and dietary guidelines for children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. To enhance participation,&#x000a0;all the sessions were scheduled on weekends. The outcome data was collected using a number of scales and questionnaires addessing eating, active play and nature-related habits before and after the programme, and group session debriefings were held at the beginning and end of the programme. The programme proved popular amongst participants and the results demonstrated significant positive changes on a number of health-related outcomes, such as&#x000a0;healthier food habits and&#x000a0;an increase in caregiver physical activity levels.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Intervention content and Anticipatory guidance topics, enhanced with connectedness to nature</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Session</th><th>Activities during the pilot study</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Welcome and Intro: Setting goals, Communication in the family.

As none of the existing methods for measuring children&#x02019;s attitudes and behaviours towards environment and nature have been assessed in preschool children, little is known about how they perceive and interact with the natural environment. This baseline is crucial to understanding whether health-promoting interventions targeting Connectedness to nature can be effective. We modified an existing scale for older children in our recent Play &#x00026; Grow pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Overall, the reliability and construct validity indicated very low applicability to Hong Kong pre-schoolers (Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha and inter-item correlation of most dimensions, e.g. &#x0003c; 0.50). In the proposed study, we will therefore employ a mixed-method approach, including the above mentioned Play &#x00026; Grow pilot test (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;39), qualitative interviews with parents (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10), further modification of the items, and a test of the final short 20-item NRS on children of 2 to 4 years of age (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;100) in 2 different socioeconomic settings in Hong Kong. The qualitative data will lead to construction of an item pool with items representing four theoretical constructs of Nature Relatedness: (1) enjoyment of nature, (2) empathy for nature, (3) sense of responsibility, and (4) awareness of nature. We will collect a sub-sample from 110 children in this age group and explore the factor structure. Participants will be recruited through the Active Health Clinic, HKU. In addition to the Nature Relatedness items, we will include attitude to nature, enjoyment/happiness, psychological health outcomes, and subjective well-being.

For continuity of delivered message, both parents in two-parent families will be invited to join. According to our pilot experience, however, we expect mostly mothers and domestic helpers to attend. The fathers will be welcome as well, but the same caregiver should fill the questionnaires. We set up a requirement of 80&#x000a0;% participation attendance of the same caregiver. Given the Play &#x00026; Grow pilot data, 100 children in each group (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 and power 0.8) will be needed to detect changes between the intervention and control groups.

The sample size calculation is based on a similar study conducted in New Zealand, MEND 2&#x02013;4, which provides relevant parameter estimates for children aged 2 to 4&#x000a0;years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. As there have been no similar interventions in this age group in Hong Kong, we adpoted the MEND design suggestion and calculated the sample size first of all, in regards to our primary outcomes (for example, 25&#x000a0;% increase in vegetable consumption), hence 100 families in each group will be required&#x000a0;for a power of 0.8,&#x000a0;&#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Based on the pilot data, and the dropout rate of 20&#x000a0;%, we intend to recruit 240 families.

The Play &#x00026; Grow will have educational strategies including instructions, parental peer support and group discussions, and homework tasks, in accordance with the elements developed in our Play &#x00026; Grow pilot study. Each session will comprise: (i) 15&#x000a0;min of guided active play involving both children and parents; (ii) 15&#x000a0;min of interactive education and skill development for parents; simultaneous supervised active play with foods for children, to promote acceptance of vegetables, and (iii) 15&#x000a0;min of guided active nature games outdoors, involving both children and parents. The sessions will incorporate a lifestyle component, for example: eating, active play and connectedness to nature). These will target the parents&#x02019; knowledge and skills on how to introduce and maintain their child&#x02019;s correct lifestyle routines. A group leader and co-leader with healthcare backgrounds (and trained by the PI during the Play &#x00026; Grow pilot study) will facilitate the sessions involving 4 to 5 parent-child dyads.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>The novel Connectedness to nature element</title><p>The most appropriate way of instilling habits related to nature is to stimulate children's natural curiosity as early in life as possible.

Connectedness to nature is described as including basic environmental knowledge, environmental sensitivity and awareness, as well as a commitment to protect nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In the proposed intervention, we will employ environmental education and nature-related activities to help participating families develop skills conducive to improving playtime and eating habits in children. Examples of the additional elements&#x000a0;that make up an 1/3 of the programme are: i) inclusion of active nature games outdoors&#x000a0;that involve both children and parents focusing on motor skills, discovering nature, practicing awareness to sounds, touch, smells, temperature, ii) group activities with other families and members, practicing nature related activities, iii) nature homework with follow-ups (collect objects found in nature and make art&#x000a0;or grow&#x000a0;their own plants), iv) environmental care training (paper waste, water saving, recycling), and v) studying new vegetables and cooking together with them (avocado,&#x000a0;using the avocado&#x000a0;to make a boat,&#x000a0;turning the avocado into guacamole, etc.).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Primary outcomes and their assessments</title><p>Measurements will be conducted prior to and after the 10-week intervention, with further follow up assessments at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months in order to observe both the short and long term outcomes (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
