This open&#x02010;label, parallel&#x02010;group study investigated serelaxin pharmacokinetics (PK) after a single 4&#x02010;hour intravenous infusion (10&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/kg) in patients with severe renal impairment (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6) or end&#x02010;stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis (PK on the day of dialysis [n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6] or during dialysis&#x02010;free interval [n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6]), compared with matched healthy subjects (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;18). In all participants, serum serelaxin concentration peaked at the end of infusion and subsequently declined with mean terminal elimination half&#x02010;life of 6.5&#x02013;8.8 hours. Compared with healthy subjects, a moderate decrease in serelaxin systemic clearance (37%&#x02013;52%) and increase in its exposure (30%&#x02013;115%) were observed in all patients. During the 4&#x02010;hour hemodialysis in ESRD patients, 30% serelaxin was removed, with hemodialysis clearance constituting approximately 52% of total systemic clearance. Serelaxin was well tolerated with no deaths, serious adverse events (AE), or AE&#x02010;related discontinuations. Antiserelaxin antibodies were not detected in any participant. Given the shallow dose&#x02010;response relationship observed with serelaxin in clinical studies and its wide therapeutic window, the observed PK differences in patients with severe renal impairment compared with healthy subjects are unlikely to pose a safety risk and do not warrant a predefined dosage adjustment in such patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-generated"><kwd id="jcph607-kwd-0001">serelaxin</kwd><kwd id="jcph607-kwd-0002">pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd id="jcph607-kwd-0003">renal impairment</kwd><kwd id="jcph607-kwd-0004">end&#x02010;stage renal disease</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>source-schema-version-number</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>component-id</meta-name><meta-value>jcph607</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>April 2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>details-of-publishers-convertor</meta-name><meta-value>Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_NLMPMC version:4.9.4 mode:remove_FC converted:13.10.2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><def-list list-content="abbreviations" id="jcph607-dl-0001"><title>Abbreviations</title><def-item><term id="jcph607-ldef-0001">AE</term><def id="jcph607-ldef-0002"><p>adverse events</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="jcph607-ldef-0003">AHF</term><def id="jcph607-ldef-0004"><p>acute heart failure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="jcph607-ldef-0005">AUC</term><def id="jcph607-ldef-0006"><p>area under the serum concentration&#x02010;time curve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="jcph607-ldef-0007">BMI</term><def id="jcph607-ldef-0008"><p>body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="jcph607-ldef-0009">C<sub>max</sub></term><def id="jcph607-ldef-0010"><p>maximum serum concentration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="jcph607-ldef-0011">CI</term><def id="jcph607-ldef-0012"><p>confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="jcph607-ldef-0013">CV</term><def id="jcph607-ldef-0014"><p>cardiovascular</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="jcph607-ldef-0015">DBP</term><def id="jcph607-ldef-0016"><p>diastolic blood pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="jcph607-ldef-0017">eGFR</term><def id="jcph607-ldef-0018"><p>estimated glomerular filtration rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="jcph607-ldef-0019">ELISA</term><def id="jcph607-ldef-0020"><p>enzyme&#x02010;linked immunosorbent assay</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="jcph607-ldef-0021">ESRD</term><def id="jcph607-ldef-0022"><p>end&#x02010;stage renal disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="jcph607-ldef-0023">GMR</term><def id="jcph607-ldef-0024"><p>geometric mean ratios</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="jcph607-ldef-0025">HF</term><def id="jcph607-ldef-0026"><p>heart failure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="jcph607-ldef-0027">IV</term><def id="jcph607-ldef-0028"><p>intravenous</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="jcph607-ldef-0029">PK</term><def id="jcph607-ldef-0030"><p>pharmacokinetics</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="jcph607-ldef-0031">PR</term><def id="jcph607-ldef-0032"><p>pulse rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="jcph607-ldef-0033">RELAX&#x02010;AHF</term><def id="jcph607-ldef-0034"><p>RELAXin in Acute Heart Failure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="jcph607-ldef-0035">SAE</term><def id="jcph607-ldef-0036"><p>serious adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="jcph607-ldef-0037">SBP</term><def id="jcph607-ldef-0038"><p>systolic blood pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="jcph607-ldef-0039">SD</term><def id="jcph607-ldef-0040"><p>standard deviation</p></def></def-item></def-list><p>Serelaxin, currently in clinical development for the treatment of acute heart failure (AHF), is a recombinant peptide identical in structure to human relaxin&#x02010;2, a naturally occurring hormone that is believed to mediate hemodynamic and vascular changes during pregnancy.<xref rid="jcph607-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> Serelaxin stimulates the vascular signaling pathways with short&#x02010;

However, these were mostly patients with mild to moderate renal dysfunction and a relatively small number of patients with severe renal impairment (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;12). In addition, the available serelaxin PK data in these 12 patients were limited to the steady&#x02010;state serum concentrations at 12 hours during infusion (data on file). Therefore, it was deemed important to systematically assess the effects of severe renal dysfunction and renal failure on the PK of serelaxin. This aspect has been addressed in the present study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier NCT01875523), which was conducted in a selected population of patients with severe renal impairment and those with end&#x02010;stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the PK of serelaxin after a single 4&#x02010;hour IV infusion of 10&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/kg serelaxin in patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD requiring hemodialysis in comparison with healthy subjects. The secondary objectives were to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of serelaxin in all the participants.</p><sec id="jcph607-sec-0003"><title>Methods</title><sec id="jcph607-sec-0004"><title>Study Design and Participants</title><p>The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Research Ethics Committee at Ethikkommission Schleswig&#x02010;Holstein, Germany.

In addition, for patients in group 1, inclusion in the study required evidence of severe renal impairment as indicated by clinically significant abnormal creatinine and creatinine clearance levels calculated according to the simplified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula (15&#x02009;mL/[min&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;1.73&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup>] &#x02264; estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &#x0003c;30&#x02009;mL/[min&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;1.73&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup>]). Patients in groups 2 and 3 were included if they had ESRD requiring hemodialysis. The vital signs for patients in groups 1 to 3, at screening and baseline visits, were required to have the following: systolic blood pressure (SBP) ranging from 110 to 170&#x02009;mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ranging from 60 to 105&#x02009;mm Hg, and pulse rate (PR) between 45 and 100 bpm. The corresponding inclusion criteria for healthy subjects were eGFR &#x02265; 90&#x02009;mL/(min&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;1.73&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup>); matching in terms of race, age (&#x000b1;10 years), sex, and BMI (&#x000b1;15%) to an individual patient with renal impairment in groups 1, 2, or 3; SBP ranging from 100 to 150&#x02009;mm Hg; DBP ranging from 60 to 95&#x02009;mm Hg; and PR between 50 and 100&#x02009;bpm.</p><p>The key exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) clinically significant electrocardiogram abnormalities; (2) history of hypersensitivity to the study drug or to drugs of a similar class; (3) use of other investigational drugs at the time of study enrollment; (4) presence of any noncontrolled and clinically significant disease, surgical, or medical condition that could have affected the study outcome or that would have placed the patient at an undue risk, as judged by the investigator; and (5) baseline and other laboratory parameters at screening outside acceptable limits as judged by the investigator. In addition, patients with severe renal impairment/ESRD were excluded from the study if they had hemoglobin levels &#x0003c;9.0&#x02009;g/dL at screening and received treatment with any cytostatic drug or nitrate. Healthy subjects were excluded if they had used any prescription drugs within 4 weeks prior to the initial dosing and/or over&#x02010;the&#x02010;counter medications within 2 weeks prior to the initial dosing, or had tested positive for hepatitis B or C.</p><p>Patients in groups 1 to 3 were enrolled in parallel into the study. Healthy subjects were matched pairwise and enrolled after the corresponding patient with renal impairment/ESRD had completed serelaxin treatment and PK blood sample collection.</p><p>Study participants received a single open&#x02010;label, 4&#x02010;hour IV infusion of 10&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/kg serelaxin on day 1. This dosing regimen (instead of 30&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/kg/day for 48 hours that was implemented in the serelaxin clinical development studies, including the ongoing phase 3 RELAX&#x02010;AHF2 study) was chosen due to the feasibility challenges with regard to the timing of PK assessments and the intermittent hemodialysis (every other day) and for safety considerations. A short infusion was selected over an IV bolus to minimize the potential risks associated with a high initial serum concentration following an IV bolus. For patients with ESRD undergoing PK assessments on the day of hemodialysis, the dialysis procedure was started 2&#x02009;hours (&#x000b1;15&#x02009;minutes) after the end of infusion and lasted for approximately 4&#x02009;hours. The dialysis machines used were Fresenius 4008s (Dialysator FX80, surface area 1.8&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup>), Fresenius 5008s (Dialysator FX80, surface area 1.8&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup>), Fresenius 5008s (Dialysator FX1000, surface area 2.2&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup>), and Gambro AK 200 ultra (Dialysator Polyflux P210H). For ESRD patients with PK assessments performed during the dialysis&#x02010;free interval, serelaxin infusion was started after an interval of at least 12 hours following the previous hemodialysis with PK sample collection and safety/tolerability assessments being performed over the following 48 hours (until day 3) and prior to the subsequent hemodialysis. All participants were required to remain at the study site for approximately 3 days to facilitate baseline, PK, and safety/tolerability assessments, with an additional ambulatory end&#x02010;of&#x02010;study visit on day 15.</p></sec><sec id="jcph607-sec-0005"><title>Pharmacokinetic Assessments and Analyses</title><p>Serum samples for PK analysis were collected during the treatment and follow&#x02010;up periods (time points: pretreatment, 15 minutes, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 4.25, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 24, 28, 36, and 48 hours after the start of infusion) and on day 15 (end of study). Specifically for group 2 patients, who had hemodialysis performed from 6 to 10 hours post&#x02013;serelaxin administration (4&#x02010;hour dialysis period), serum samples for PK analyses were collected from both the line entering (LINE IN) and that exiting (LINE OUT) the dialyzer. In addition, hemodialysis fluid samples were collected from these patients 6 hours prior to the start of dialysis and as fractions during the 4&#x02010;hour dialysis period for assesment of serelaxin concentrations. The dialysate was collected in 20&#x02010;L bottles, with 20&#x02010;mL aliquots (or 0.1% of the respective fraction) being taken from each bottle, pooled, and stored at 3&#x000b0;C to 5&#x000b0;C for the duration of dialysis. At the end of the procedure, 3&#x02010;mL samples of the thoroughly mixed pooled dialysate aliquots were frozen at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C and later shipped on dry ice for analysis.</p><p>The serum serelaxin concentrations were determined by a validated, commercially available enzyme&#x02010;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota). Briefly, the ELISA method used a monoclonal antibody specific for relaxin&#x02010;2 as the capture reagent and an enzyme&#x02010;linked polyclonal antibody specific for relaxin&#x02010;2 as the detection reagent. The lower limit of quantification was 15.6&#x02009;pg/mL. The same kit was used to determine the serelaxin concentration in the dialysate for group 2, following validation, to ensure no matrix interference to the assay. The lower limit of quantification in the dialysate was 31.3&#x02009;pg/mL.</p><p>Noncompartmental PK analysis was performed using WinNonlin Phoenix (Version 6.2). The evaluated PK parameters are described in Table <xref rid="jcph607-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap">1</xref>. The key PK parameters to compare serelaxin exposure between the patient groups and matched healthy subjects were area under the serum concentration&#x02010;time curve (AUC) from time 0 to infinity (AUC<sub>&#x0221e;</sub>) and the observed maximum serum concentration following drug administration (C<sub>max</sub>). In addition, hemodialysis clearance (CLHD) was calculated as (CD&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;VD)/AUC&#x003c4;_in Method 1, where CD is the concentration of the drug in pooled dialysate during the dialysis interval, VD is the volume of pooled dialysate during the dialysis interval and AUC&#x003c4;_in is the area under the serum concentration&#x02010;time curve during the dialysis interval on the basis of the samples collected at the entry of the dialyzer. To avoid a potential underestimation due to adsorption and subsequent underrecovery of serelaxin in the dialysate, an alternative calculation (Method 2) was performed where CLHD&#x02009;=&#x02009;QBIN&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;R&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;f, where QBIN is the blood flowing into the dialyzer; R is the blood&#x02010;to&#x02010;serum drug concentration ratio, which was assumed to be 0.55 as serelaxin does not bind to blood cells; and f is the fraction of drug eliminated during hemodialysis, calculated as (AUC&#x003c4;_in<sub>&#x02009;</sub>&#x02212;&#x02009;AUC&#x003c4;_out)/AUC&#x003c4;_in<sub>,</sub> where AUC&#x003c4;_out is the area under the serum concentration&#x02010;time curve during the dialysis interval on the basis of the samples collected at the exit of the dialyzer.</p><table-wrap id="jcph607-tbl-0001" xml:lang="en" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Pharmacokinetic Parameters Assessed</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><col span="1"/><col span="1"/><thead valign="bottom"><tr style="border-bottom:solid 1px #000000"><th align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Parameters</th><th align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AUC<sub>&#x0221e;</sub>

The primary statistical analyses were performed on the following PK parameters of serelaxin: C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>&#x0221e;</sub>. Parameters were compared between each renal impaired group and the respective matched healthy subjects. Log&#x02010;transformed PK parameters were analyzed using a linear mixed&#x02010;effects model, with the healthy subject group as a fixed effect and the matching pair as a random effect. Least&#x02010;squares means for each group as well as the estimated difference between patients with renal impairment and respective matched healthy subjects with corresponding 90% confidence intervals (CI) on the log&#x02010;scale were calculated. These estimates were back&#x02010;transformed to obtain the ratio of geometric means (GMR) and the associated 90% CI for the comparison of the renal impaired group vs the matched healthy subjects. In addition, PK parameters (C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>&#x0221e;</sub>) obtained on the day of hemodialysis and during the dialysis&#x02010;free interval were compared between the 2 groups of patients with ESRD to evaluate the impact of hemodialysis on the PK of serelaxin, with the healthy subject group as a fixed effect.

Therefore, it is not surprising to see a slower clearance and higher exposure of serelaxin in patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD when compared with matched healthy subjects. However, the differences are moderate, with the GMR of AUC<sub>&#x0221e;</sub> ranging from 1.61 to 2.15. The moderate difference is partly due to the contribution of the catabolism of serelaxin in other tissues and organs outside the kidneys as well as the distribution of serelaxin into the extravascular space (V<sub>ss</sub>
<sub>&#x02009;</sub>=&#x02009;355&#x02013;432&#x02009;mL/kg). This is also consistent with the observed moderate impact of hemodialysis on the PK of serelaxin. During the 4&#x02010;hour hemodialysis, 30% of serum serelaxin was eliminated by hemodialysis, which constituted approximately 52% of the overall systemic clearance, indicating that hemodialysis accelerates drug clearance from the body. Two different methods were used to calculate the estimated CLHD. Method 1 used the total amount of serelaxin recovered from the dialysate in the calculation and generated a lower value than the CLHD estimated using Method 2, which by definition is independent of the serelaxin concentration measurement in the dialysate. The discrepancy between these results was most likely due to underestimation of the total amount of serelaxin in the dialysate, potentially through adsorptive loss of serelaxin to the dialysis device and tubing. Therefore, the results provided by Method 2 are considered more reliable. Renal impairment and dysfunction are often noted in patients with HF.<xref rid="jcph607-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="jcph607-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="jcph607-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> Therefore, in order to evaluate the clinical impact and relevance of the observed PK differences in this study, a population PK analysis was performed on the basis of the pooled data from subjects, including patients with AHF, with various degrees of renal function (normal, mild, moderate, and severe impairment and ESRD) who were treated with serelaxin across multiple studies. Data from this analysis showed that serelaxin clearance was reduced by 38% and 47% in patients with ESRD compared with patients with mild renal impairment and healthy subjects with normal renal function, respectively (data on file). Therefore, serelaxin PK differences between patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD and patients with mild to moderate renal impairment are smaller than the differences observed in this study when healthy subjects with normal renal function are used as comparators.</p><p>In addition, clinical data suggest that serelaxin has a wide therapeutic window and a shallow exposure/dose&#x02010;response relationship.<xref rid="jcph607-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="jcph607-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> Serelaxin doses of up to 960&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/kg/day were administered to patients with AHF, and it was demonstrated that doses ranging from 10 to 100&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/kg/day were generally well tolerated in patients with AHF.<xref rid="jcph607-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="jcph607-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> Moreover, serelaxin was well tolerated in this study by all subjects, including patients with ESRD, regardless of their increased exposure to serelaxin. The PK differences observed in this study are not likely to pose a safety risk to patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD and do not warrant a predefined dosage adjustment based on renal function.</p><p>Possible limitations of this study are that it did not evaluate the effect of peritoneal dialysis on the PK of serelaxin, a factor that may be of particular relevance for patients with ESRD requiring dialysis. Second, the effect of dialysis on the PK of serelaxin was evaluated based on the comparison between the 2 parallel groups of patients (groups 2 and 3), and no intragroup comparisons were performed, where PK data are collected before and during dialysis from the same patients. Given the observed small interpatient serelaxin PK variability, and considering the serious health state of the patient population, the parallel&#x02010;group design is a sound approach for the purpose of the study.</p><p>In summary, this study demonstrated a moderate decrease in clearance and an increase in exposure of serelaxin in patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD compared with healthy subjects. It also showed that serelaxin can be partially eliminated from circulation by hemodialysis. Serelaxin was well tolerated by patients with severe renal impairment, by those with ESRD requiring hemodialysis, and by healthy subjects. No antiserelaxin antibodies were detected in any participant. The observed serelaxin PK differences in patients with severe renal impairment compared with matched healthy subjects are unlikely to pose a safety risk and do not warrant a predefined dosage adjustment in such patients.</p></sec><sec id="jcph607-sec-0016"><title>Funding and Declaration of Conflicting Interests</title><p>This study was sponsored by Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland.
