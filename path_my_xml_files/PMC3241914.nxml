No serious adverse events were reported. The calcium fructoborate showed beneficial effect on the inflammatory markers for all groups subjected to the treatment when compared with the placebo group and slight changes in the lipid metabolism.

By examining the relationship between boron administration and OA prevalence around the world, researchers have discovered that in the areas where boron intake is 1&#x000a0;mg or less per day, the estimated incidence of arthritis is between 20% and 70%. In contrast, in areas where boron intake is usually 3&#x02013;10&#x000a0;mg per day, the arthritis percentage is lower, ranging from zero to only 10%. This remarkable finding is a compelling evidence of the fact that abundant intake of dietary boron can confer strong protection against the development of OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. An analytical study showed that the boron concentration is lower in femur heads, bones, and synovial fluid of OA patients as compared with patients without OA. Moreover, surgeons have observed that the bones of patients that had used boron supplementation were harder to cut than those of patients who had not used these supplements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The most convincing evidence for boron usage in the case of OA patients comes from a double-blind placebo boron supplementation trial conducted in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] reporting that boron supplementation may improve symptoms for people with OA and rheumatoid arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Experimental studies on arthritic rats have led to an emerging hypothesis suggesting that boron reduces the risk of inflammatory disease by downregulating enzymes of the inflammatory response and has a beneficial immunomodulatory effect in the arthritic rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Recent studies have focused on the association between primary OA and dyslipidemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Many researchers have observed that cardiovascular disease (CVD) and OA often coexist in patients; consequently, it has been hypothesized that vascular disease may play a pathogenic role in OA, acting in part via lipid metabolic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The definitions for dyslipidemia, as defined by the NCEP guidelines, include total cholesterol (TC), &#x02265;200&#x000a0;mg/dL; low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, &#x02265;130&#x000a0;mg/dL; triglycerides, &#x02265;150&#x000a0;mg/dL; high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, &#x0003c;40&#x000a0;mg/dL; and TC/HDL ratio, &#x02265;6.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Previous studies have demonstrated an association among OA evolution, dyslipidemia, and inflammation as measured by systemic marker levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. C-reactive protein (CRP), one of the most useful markers of systemic inflammation, has recently been identified as a marker of OA with clinical significance. CRP levels are moderately high for patients with OA as compared with the normal controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Of great clinical significance are CRP levels, with reference values below 0.5&#x000a0;mg/dL in OA patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Increased levels have been associated with the disease evolution as well as with the clinical aggravation, as an unspecific response to inflammations and infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Calcium fructoborate (CF) is used as a recent nonpharmaceutical therapy for osteoarthritis treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. CF is a complex of calcium, fructose, and boron and is naturally found in fresh and dried fruits, vegetables, herbs, and wine. This form of boron is not only safe but also bioavailable compared with other commercial forms of boron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Its structural formula is Ca[(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>6</sub>)<sub>2</sub>B]<sub>2</sub>&#x02219;4H<sub>2</sub>O, identical with the one of a natural product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>An open label pilot study, authored by N. Miljkovic and colleagues from the Orthopedic Clinic of the University from Novi Sad, Novi Sad, Yugoslavia, was conducted. The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of CF on OA symptoms. The study included 20 patients with mild, medium, or severe forms of OA. Two criteria for assessment were used: the Western Ontario McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index and Newnham criteria. After the administration of CF, the results were quite impressive: the pain was strongly diminished, the joint rigidity disappeared, and mobility and flexibility were improved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Our previous investigations have been summarized in two reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] that have revealed an anti-inflammatory property of CF on cellular cultures. In addition, we hypothesized that CF might have dual roles as both an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant agent, with modifying effect on lipid metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>This study investigates whether CF can relieve OA symptoms in selected subjects. Scientists have hypothesized that CF may have a role in diminishing inflammation-related pain, joint stiffness and other discomforts associated with OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Because OA discomfort is often invariably related to joint inflammation, this study approaches the CF effect on inflammatory blood markers levels such as CRP, fibrinogen (FBR), and on erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and on lipid metabolism markers because it has been suggested that boron is involved in both mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>When analyzing inflammatory markers, the 2-week time interval for the CF dietary supplementation was long enough to confirm our previous results obtained in vitro. Because the general characteristic of the placebo effect has a slightly delayed onset and a relatively short duration (from 2 to 6&#x000a0;weeks as cited in the literature) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], a time interval of 2&#x000a0;weeks was chosen for this trial to more accurately observe the short-term efficacy of CF. This pilot study is only a bridge for a future, more complex research study regarding the effects of CF on OA symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods and Materials</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design and Selection of Patients</title><p>The study was placebo controlled, randomized, double blind with four groups of subjects.

At the screening visit, after providing written informed consent, each participant underwent a screening interview. Based on the screening, subjects were declared eligible to proceed if all inclusion criteria were fulfilled and no exclusion criteria were met. This single-center trial was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of the University of Medicine and Pharmacy from Craiova, Romania, according to decision no. 364 from March 2008. The trial is also in agreement with the Helsinki Declaration from 1975, which was revised in 1983.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Patients&#x02019; Characteristics</title><p>The number of total enrolled patients was 116 (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

This study also provides important information regarding the possible molecular mechanisms of an anti-inflammatory compound with an identical natural origin in the treatment of OA. We have demonstrated that CF has potential efficacy in terms of reducing pain and improving the physical ability of OA patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. CRP, FBR, and ESR levels were used to monitor disease activity and to observe the subjects&#x02019; responses to treatment. Increased CRP levels have suggested that it might be associated with the disease evolution in patients with OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Besides that, ESR is not associated with clinical severity in patients with knee or hip OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In addition, CRP levels could be predictive for OA disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. CRP levels have a stronger association with osteophyte production than with joint narrowing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Prior findings have shown that CVD and OA often coexist in patients and CVD could play a pathogenic role in OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In this study, the obtained results demonstrate that in the case of OA associated with dyslipidemia, CF might provide a favorable prognostic for cardiovascular diseases, but the data are not sufficiently conclusive. Consequently, dietary supplementation with CF shows a slightly life-quality improvement for individuals suffering of OA associated with dyslipidemia.</p><p>Previous studies have showed that the optimum boron dietary intake is about 3&#x000a0;mg boron per day and that it may provide protection against some types of cancers (prostate, breast, cervical and lung) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Osteoporosis and OA patients need around 3&#x000a0;mg of boron per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and we tried to assure this boron intake for the subjects of the study. The mechanisms by which CF exerts beneficial effects on systemic inflammatory and dyslipidemia markers are still unclear but some of its molecular biological in vitro activities are known. CF inhibits superoxide within cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. CF stimulates osteoblast differentiation from bone narrowing. In addition, it acts synergistically with dexamethasone to increase bone mineralization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. CF induces an inhibition of IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, and NO released in the culture media and increases TNF-&#x003b1; production. It has no effect on LPS-induced COX-2 protein expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>Summing up, the presented data have important implications for new strategy development for preventing OA and dyslipidemia associated with boron supplementation. The final target is cardiovascular disease prevention. In a recent clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], we have demonstrated the favorable effects of resveratrol combined with CF on the clinical and inflammatory status of patients with stable angina pectoris (Militaru et al., unpublished results).</p><p>The next objective of our research team is to broaden the investigation because the presented observations belong to just a pilot study with a short time duration.</p><p>In conclusion, with this experimental design, the presented study suggests that short-term CF supplementation (only 15&#x000a0;days) can increase the quality of life for OA patients, with a favorable prognosis for inflammatory states. The importance of this study is related to the beneficial actions of CF on systemic inflammation and perturbation of lipid metabolism for elderly individuals who otherwise might have an unfavorable prognosis in cardiovascular diseases. This study presents preliminary results that require further experimentation. A longer supplementation period is needed to ascertain whether CF is an effective anti-inflammatory agent.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>This study was supported by the Natural Research, Ltd.
