Swelling and pain in multiple joints are the main features of <italic>Amavata</italic> (Rhematoid arthritis).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Constant use of incompatible food articles and strenuous exercise immediately after consumption of fatty foods leads to indigestion. This results in the formation of <italic>Ama</italic> which gets circulated throughout the body by <italic>Vyana Vayu</italic>. This then accumulates at <italic>Shlesmasthana</italic>, and especially at the <italic>Shleshakakapha</italic>, i.e., in the joints leading to the manifestation of symptoms of the disease. Body pain, loss of appetite, fever, weakness, excessive thirst and heaviness are also manifested.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Involvement of joints restricts the normal body movements which may lead to contracture of muscle and permanent deformities.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Blood investigations show a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (E.S.R.) and positive Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) factor in 30-40% cases. Prognosis of <italic>Amavata</italic> is poor especially in those cases where <italic>Tridosas</italic> are involved.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] The principles of treatment of <italic>Amavata</italic> are <italic>Langhana</italic> and <italic>Swedana</italic>; and drugs having <italic>Tikta, Katu Rasa, Deepana, Virechana, Snehapana</italic> and <italic>Basti</italic> properties.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Many Ayurvedic formulations are claimed to be effective in <italic>Amavata</italic>, however, scientific evidence needs to be produced.

The drugs of <italic>Simhanada Guggulu</italic> are having mostly <italic>Ama</italic> and <italic>Vata Shamaka</italic> property. <italic>Lepa</italic> was used locally over the involved joints of both the group, by mixing the <italic>Rasona Rasnadi Churna</italic> with <italic>Eranda taila</italic>.

Again <italic>Vyayama</italic> is said to be a causative factor for the <italic>Shakha Gati</italic> of <italic>Doshas</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] If there is already Ama condition and <italic>Vyayama</italic> is done, the increased <italic>Vata</italic> will take the <italic>Ama</italic> to the <italic>Shakha</italic> then causing its <italic>Sthanasamshraya</italic> in the <italic>Sandhis</italic>, leading to <italic>Amavata</italic>. After studing the etiopathogenesis of <italic>Amavata</italic>, it is found that above factors individually or together lead to the <italic>Kapha Prakopa</italic> or <italic>Vataprakopa</italic> or both Along with this role of psychological factors also should be considered.</p><p>In <italic>Amavata</italic>, partially digested dietary substances accumulated at the level of intestine may cause Gastro-enteritis. Part of the <italic>Ama</italic> may get absorbed through the intestinal mucosa, and circulating through the entire body may perform a role of antigen, consequently vitiating the <italic>Dosha</italic> to cause different disorders. The basic pathogenesis of Rheumatoid arthritis is Antigen-antibody complex mediated tissue injury (Autoimmune antibody production).</p><p>The pathogenesis of <italic>Amavata</italic> bears some similarity to the recently described intestinal permeability syndrome (IPS). The impetus for IPS is a process by which some agent or combination of agents initiate an inflammatory response in the digestive tract. Persistent gastrointestinal inflammation eventually disrupts the integrity of the mucosal lining of the gut, and tiny perforations allow for molecules larger than usual to cross this barrier. This includes molecules&#x02032; from dietary protein and fats, bacteria, parasites and fungi. In response to this infiltration, an immune response is initiated, and the body begins to manufacture specific antibodies to these antigens. Once activated, these antibodies then circulate and &#x02018;look&#x02019; for more antigens. If any tissue has markers similar to the exogenous antigen, the antibody initiates an immune response and the tissue destruction begins (Galland 1993).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p><p>It was observed that the hand joint involvement was seen in 100% patients. <italic>Amavata</italic> is a disease which starts mainly in the small joints, especially PIP. (PIP is regarded as the most busy joint as a person uses this joint atleast 2000 times everyday if he is in the conscious state). Newer studies also indicate that the hand joint is most prone for Rheumatoid arthritis, because of the small amount of bursae. As the bursae is a sac of synovial fluid, it acts as a shock absorber, and decreases the chances of inflammation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] The finger joint like PIP and the MCP joint which do not have bursae, are most prone to RA. This is in accordance to the A.R.A. criteria of 1988, that states that atleast one hand joint involvement is mandatory for diagnosing a case of Rheumatoid arthritis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] More aggravation of <italic>Vata Dosha</italic> occurs at <italic>Sandhi Sthana</italic> due to obstruction of <italic>Srota</italic> by the <italic>Kleda</italic> of more virulent <italic>Ama</italic> which is formed due to combination with <italic>Tridosha</italic> in to the <italic>Srotas</italic> at <italic>Sandhisthana</italic>.

Better results were observed in <italic>Sandhishula, Sandhigraha</italic> and <italic>Sparsha-Asahyata</italic> in <italic>Ghanavati</italic> group.
