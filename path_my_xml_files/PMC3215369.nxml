Dysmenorrhea means painful menstruation. Fifty percent of the women suffer from dysmenorrhea. Primary dysmenorrhea is correlated with <italic>Udavartini yonivyapad</italic> in <italic>Ayurveda</italic>. No successful advances have been made in the line of management till today by western medicine. Therefore, a complete, comprehensive and holistic approach toward its understanding and treatment is the need of the age. In this series, <italic>Uttar Vasti</italic>, a unique panchakarma procedure, is studied for its role in <italic>yonivyapads</italic>. A research study was conductedto evaluate the efficacy of <italic>Uttar Vasti</italic> with <italic>Trivrit</italic> and <italic>Lasuna</italic> oil in Primary dysmenorrhea. Thirty-six diagnosed cases of <italic>Udavartini Yonivyapad</italic>, viz., primary (spasmodic) dysmenorrhea, were selected and randomly allocated into two groups. The effect of Uttar Vasti was compared with the commonly used non steroidal anti inflammatory drug (control group). <italic>Uttar Vasti</italic> with <italic>Operculina turpethum</italic> (<italic>Trivrit</italic>) and <italic>Allium sativum</italic> (<italic>Lasuna</italic>) oil has shown encouraging results in <italic>Udavartini yonivyapad</italic>. Statistically significant relief was seen in the intensity of pain and the successive cycles were less painful in the treated group as compared to control group. The mode of action can be attributed to anti-inflammatory (<italic>vatahara</italic>), vasodilatory (<italic>ushna virya</italic>) antispasmodic and laxative (<italic>anulomana</italic>) properties of the trial drugs. The present study shows Uttar Vasti as a safe and easy technique to treat dysmenorrhea like conditions without any side effects.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Lasuna</italic></kwd><kwd>primary dysmenorrhea</kwd><kwd><italic>Trivrit</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Udavartini yonivyapad</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Uttar Vasti</italic>.</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dysmenorrhea means painful menstruation which can be correlated with <italic>Udavartini</italic> of yonivyapad <italic>Charaka</italic> or <italic>Udavartaa</italic> of <italic>Susruta</italic>. It occurs in 50% of post-pubescent females. It is of two types: (i) primary dysmenorrhea refers to menstrual pain without pelvic pathology and (ii) secondary dysmenorrhea is defined as painful menses associated with an underlying pathology. Clinical features of primary dysmenorrhea are (i) onset shortly after menarche; (ii) usual duration of 48&#x02013;72 hours, often starts before or just after the menstrual flow; (iii) cramping or labor like pain; and (iv) often unremarkable pelvic examination findings.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] <italic>Udavarta</italic> is explained in <italic>Ayurveda</italic> as a <italic>Nanatmaja Vata vyadhi</italic> by <italic>Charaka</italic> where there is abnormal movement of <italic>vayu</italic> in <italic>pakwashaya</italic> (Cha.Su. 20/11). <italic>Udavartini yonivyapad</italic> is characterized by painful menstruation (Su.

Current evidence suggests that the pathogenesis of primary dysmenorrhea is due to PGF<sub>2</sub> alpha, a potent myometrial stimulant and vasoconstrictor in the secretory endometrium[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]. The <italic>Udavartini yonivyapad</italic> had been described by various authors as the following: <italic>Udavartini</italic> by <italic>Charaka</italic>, <italic>udavarta</italic> by <italic>Sushruta</italic>, Madhav and Vagbhatta. According to <italic>Charaka</italic>, due to <italic>vegavarodha</italic> (natural urges), the <italic>Apana Vata</italic> is aggravated and moves in reverse direction and fills the entire <italic>Yoni</italic>. This <italic>Apana vayu</italic> pushes the <italic>Raja</italic> upward and causes pain and discomfort in menstruation. The lady feels comfortable after discharging the menstrual blood. <italic>Vata Dosha</italic> is the chief culprit and is vitiated due to faulty dietary habits and lifestyle and suppression of natural urges by the young adults.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3a</xref>] Treatment is aimed at pacifying the aggravated <italic>Vata</italic> and correction of the direction of its normal flow. According to <italic>Sushruta</italic> in <italic>Udavarta</italic>, fresh juice of <italic>Rasona</italic> should be taken in the morning.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2b</xref>] <italic>Lasuna</italic> has <italic>Katu</italic>, <italic>tikta</italic> rasas, <italic>Snigdha</italic>, <italic>Guru</italic> and <italic>picchilla guna</italic>, by which it acts as an antispasmodic, hypolipidemic[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] and has anti-inflammatory properties to pacify <italic>Vata</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6b</xref>] Moreover, <italic>Rasona</italic> has also emmenogogue property by which it normalizes the menstrual blood flow. <italic>Trivrit</italic> is a laxative and has <italic>vatanulomaka</italic> and <italic>sukha rechaka</italic> properties.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3b</xref>] <italic>Tila taila</italic> is best media among <italic>vatahara</italic> oils due to its <italic>Guru</italic>, <italic>Snigdha</italic> and <italic>yogavahi</italic> properties. It is considered as the best agent to pacify vitiated <italic>vayu</italic>. Hence, <italic>uttarbasti</italic> with <italic>Rasona</italic> and <italic>Trivrit</italic> oil was selected for this study.</p><p>The mean age of the registered patients was 28.61 years. Nulligravida and nulliparous patients formed the majority of the total cases registered. These findings show that dysmenorrhea is more common in early reproductive age of nulliparous women and pregnancy relieves the complaint. In India, marriage brings upon a lot of stress to a woman. After marriage, a woman frequently encounters many challenges and responsibilities and there is a sudden change in her lifestyle. All these produce fear and stress. Stress leads to anxiety and depression, which may manifest as pain. Multiparous women are less likely to suffer from dysmenorrhea because pregnancy and childbirth improves the vascularity and growth of uterine muscles and causes less sensitization of nerve endings that carry pain sensation in uterine and cervix musculature after vaginal delivery.</p><p>Most of the women suffering from painful menstruation were housewives (90.32%) and hailed from middle class families (54.83%). Housewives are always busy in household work and they always have anxiety and tension of over work. This anxiety and tension results in hormonal imbalance in women, which is the one of the causative factors of painful menstruation, as progesterone stimulates myometrial contractions of the smooth muscles of the cervix and causes narrowing of the cervical canal. Progesterone further stimulates the production of prostaglandin F<sub>2</sub> alpha which in turn accentuates pain.</p><p>Majority of the cases had normal size cervix with firm consistency, and normal sized, retroverted, mobile uterus with nonpalpable fornices. Initially, pain in the lower abdomen was found in 19 women, which started declining from the first follow-up, and 18 patients were relieved from the pain during the fourth follow-up. Initially, pain in the back was found in 10 women, which started declining from the first follow-up and six patients were relieved from the pain during fourth follow-up. Pain in thighs was seen only in two patients and the patient was relieved of it during second follow-up. On statistical comparison between initial stage and different follow-ups, no significant outcome was seen from first follow-up (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) in intensity and duration of pain but comparison between initial stage and different follow-ups showed highly significant results in the second follow-up (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) with regard to all the symptoms, except diarrhea, backache and pain in vagina. The control group felt symptomatic relief from pain for a few hours but needed frequent dosing (3 tabs/day) in all the patients with many side effects like burning sensation in stomach, nausea and vomiting.</p><p>The above improvement in the <italic>Uttar Vasti</italic> group is due to the anti-inflammatory action of <italic>Lasuna</italic> which inhibits the synthesis of prostaglandins, relieving myometrial contractions and causing vasodilation leading to smooth flow of menstrual blood. <italic>Rasona</italic> also has emmenogogue propertyby which the flow of menstrual blood is made smooth and without any discomfort[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7a</xref>]. <italic>Trivrit</italic> is a laxative and has <italic>vatanulomaka</italic> and <italic>sukha rechaka</italic> properties[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7b</xref>]. According to <italic>Ayurveda</italic>, the action of the trial drugs is due to <italic>vatahara guna</italic> of <italic>Lasuna</italic> (<italic>Allium sativum</italic>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6a</xref>] and <italic>Mridu rechana</italic> <italic>guna</italic> of <italic>Trivrit</italic> (<italic>Ipomea turpethum</italic>).</p><p>On the basis of above facts, it may be concluded that the drugs <italic>Rasona</italic> and <italic>Trivrit</italic> are effective in spasmodic dysmenorrhea without causing any side effects. <italic>Uttar Vasti</italic> is a simple and specialized technique and has significantly improved the outcome of <italic>Udavartini yonivyapad</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Primary dysmenorrhea (spasmodic type) can be correlated with <italic>Udavartini yonivyapad</italic> in <italic>Ayurveda</italic>.
