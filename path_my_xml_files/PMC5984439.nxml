Current vector control strategies have failed to curb disease transmission, but continue to be employed despite the absence of robust evidence for their effectiveness or optimal implementation. The World Mosquito Program has developed a novel approach to arbovirus control using <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> stably transfected with <italic>Wolbachia</italic> bacterium, with a significantly reduced ability to transmit dengue, Zika and chikungunya in laboratory experiments. Modelling predicts this will translate to local elimination of dengue in most epidemiological settings. This study protocol describes the first trial to measure the efficacy of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in reducing dengue virus transmission in the field.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">The study is a parallel, two-arm, non-blinded cluster randomised controlled trial conducted in a single site in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The aim is to determine whether large-scale deployment of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes leads to a measurable reduction in dengue incidence in treated versus untreated areas. The primary endpoint is symptomatic, virologically confirmed dengue virus infection of any severity. The 26 km<sup>2</sup> study area was subdivided into 24 contiguous clusters, allocated randomly 1:1 to receive <italic>Wolbachia</italic> deployments or no intervention. We use a novel epidemiological study design, the cluster-randomised test-negative design trial, in which dengue cases and arbovirus-negative controls are sampled concurrently from among febrile patients presenting to a network of primary care clinics, with case or control status classified retrospectively based on the results of laboratory diagnostic testing. Efficacy is estimated from the odds ratio of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> exposure distribution (probability of living in a <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-treated area) among virologically confirmed dengue cases compared to test-negative controls. A secondary per-protocol analysis allows for individual <italic>Wolbachia</italic> exposure levels to be assessed to account for movements outside the cluster and the heterogeneity in local <italic>Wolbachia</italic> prevalence among treated clusters.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The findings from this study will provide the first experimental evidence for the efficacy of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in reducing dengue incidence.

In 2013, the estimated annual global burden of dengue was approximately 50&#x02013;100 million clinically apparent dengue cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and approximately 10,000 deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The burden of dengue has a cost of approximately $2.1 billion per year in the Americas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and almost $1 billion per year in Southeast Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Another epidemic arbovirus, the chikungunya virus (CHIKV), came to global attention in 2004 when it caused epidemics on several Indian Ocean islands before spreading to southern Europe and South and South East Asia. Like dengue, chikungunya is a febrile systemic viral illness of 4&#x02013;7&#x000a0;days duration. Debilitating polyarthralgia can be a long-lasting sequelae of CHIKV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In 2013, CHIKV emerged again in the Caribbean and caused epidemics in Latin American countries that are ongoing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. There are no licensed vaccines or specific therapies for chikungunya. Against this backdrop of endemic or epidemic dengue in over 100 countries, and recent explosive outbreaks of chikungunya, the Zika virus emerged in epidemic fashion in the Western Pacific in 2013 and in Latin America in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. As evidence accumulated that it causes congenital infections with severe outcomes, including fetal death and severe microcephaly, it was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Like chikungunya, there are no licensed vaccines or specific therapies for Zika.</p><p id="Par19">Vector control targeted against <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> is the mainstay of the fight against dengue, chikungunya and Zika disease transmission in endemic countries. Integrated control strategies include targeted residual spraying, space spraying, larval control and personal protection measures. However, successful broad-scale application of integrated vector control has been especially difficult to achieve in resource-limited endemic countries and impossible to sustain. Additionally, the evidence base to prioritise one intervention over another (e.g. larvicides and outdoor versus indoor insecticide space spraying) is weak as none have been robustly evaluated for impact on human infection and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis of entomological intervention trials highlighted the paucity of reliable evidence for the effectiveness of any vector control method on dengue incidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Strikingly, none of the randomised controlled trials of vector control that were included in the meta-analysis investigated epidemiological impact (i.e. clinical disease endpoint) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The difficulty of making evidence-based policy in relation to vector control has resulted in calls for improved trial methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">The World Mosquito Program (formerly Eliminate Dengue Program) is an international research collaboration aiming to use <italic>Wolbachia</italic> to eliminate arboviral disease transmission by <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The presence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes renders them more resistant to disseminated arbovirus infection, including dengue, Zika, chikungunya and yellow fever viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Thus, the critical and signature effect of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> as a public health intervention is to severely reduce the vectorial capacity of mosquito populations to transmit arboviral infections between humans. For field implementation, the approach works by seeding wild <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations with <italic>Wolbachia</italic> via fortnightly releases, over a period of 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;months, of relatively small numbers of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes. Over the subsequent 3&#x02013;6&#x000a0;months, and through the actions of cytoplasmic incompatibility, the prevalence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in the local mosquito population increases, until such time as virtually all mosquitoes in the area carry <italic>Wolbachia</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Once established, <italic>Wolbachia</italic> sustains itself in the mosquito population for years. Of note, when <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is stably established in mosquito populations, there is predicted to be a 66&#x02013;75% reduction in the basic reproduction number R<sub>0</sub> for dengue viruses (DENV)-1 to -4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Reductions of this magnitude are predicted to result in local elimination of DENV transmission in most epidemiological circumstances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">With a population of approximately&#x02009;250 million, Indonesia is the largest dengue endemic country in South East Asia.

The primary endpoint is symptomatic, virologically confirmed DENV infection of any severity. Secondary objectives are the measurement of the efficacy of the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> method in reducing the incidence of symptomatic, virologically confirmed Zika virus (ZIKV) or CHIKV infection of any severity in treated areas, relative to untreated areas; quantification of the level of human mobility within Yogyakarta City and estimation of the proportion of time that residents spend outside the treatment arm to which they were randomised; and measurement of the impact of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> deployment on the prevalence of arbovirus-infected <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par24">The study is a parallel, two-arm, non-blinded cluster randomised controlled trial conducted in a single site in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.

Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> provides an overview of the elements of the study protocol, as described in a SPIRIT checklist.</p><p id="Par25">The impact of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> deployments on dengue incidence will be assessed using a novel epidemiological study design, the cluster-randomised test-negative design (CR-TND) trial, which is described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In brief, dengue cases and arbovirus-negative controls will be sampled concurrently from within the population of patients presenting with undifferentiated febrile illness to a network of primary care clinics across the study area, with case or control status classified retrospectively based on the results of laboratory diagnostic testing. Efficacy is estimated by comparing the exposure distribution (probability of living in a <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-treated area) among virologically confirmed dengue cases against the exposure distribution in test-negative controls. The distribution of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> exposure in the sampled arbovirus-negative controls is assumed to reflect the distribution of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> exposure in the underlying source population that gave rise to cases, as long as a core assumption is met that the relative propensity to seek healthcare for undifferentiated febrile illness at a primary health clinic (known locally as <italic>Puskesmas</italic>), in intervention versus untreated arms, is the same for dengue cases as for other febrile illness controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This should be upheld if dengue cases and other undifferentiated febrile illness controls are clinically indistinguishable until laboratory diagnosis. The concurrent sampling of controls and cases means that the odds of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-exposure among sampled dengue cases relative to test-negative controls (odds ratio), is an unbiased estimate of the relative incidence of medically attended dengue in <italic>Wolbachia-</italic>treated versus untreated clusters (risk or rate ratio (RR)), from which protective efficacy can be directly estimated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The null hypothesis is that the relative incidence of virologically confirmed dengue in <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-treated and untreated areas is one. If <italic>Wolbachia</italic> has a protective effect against DENV transmission, we would expect the RR for virologically confirmed dengue in <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-treated areas compared to untreated areas to be below one.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study setting</title><p id="Par26">The study will be conducted in the adjacent districts of Yogyakarta City and Bantul, in the province of Yogyakarta Special Region, Indonesia.

Briefly, values for each balancing covariate were calculated for each of the 24 clusters and across the study area as a whole. Stata statistical software (v13.0, StataCorp, USA) was used to generate a large number (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;100,000) of potential random allocations of the 24 clusters equally into two study arms. For each allocation, the value of each balancing criterion was calculated in each study arm in two ways, namely (1) the average of the 12 cluster-level values and (2) the aggregate arm-level value. Each potential random allocation was evaluated against the pre-defined balancing criteria (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), and rejected if they were not met. All potential allocations that satisfied the balancing criteria were retained (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;247), and a single allocation was then randomly selected from within the restricted list of balanced allocations. Finally, a coin toss was used to determine which of the two study arms (A or B) was to receive <italic>Wolbachia</italic> releases.

Sample size requirements will be re-estimated using observed data after 50% of the target recruitment is completed to account for possible violations to these assumptions. This power reassessment will be based on the actual observed distributions of test-positive (i.e. dengue) and test-negative (i.e. other febrile illness) cases across the 24 clusters, and will then be used to make recommendations regarding the necessary sample size of total dengue case counts and whether extending eligible enrolments beyond the current protocol may be desirable.</p><p id="Par48">No formulae have previously been published to estimate sample size for the proposed study design, i.e. a cluster randomised trial with a test-negative design, where the intervention effect is estimated from outcome-based sampling of test-positive and test-negative patients and ascertainment of their exposure status. Randomisation provides a basis of inference in comparing intervention clusters with control clusters as, under the null hypothesis, there should be no difference with regard to the relative appearance of test positives and negatives in clusters, on average, across the two arms. Thus, we have proposed, as the primary analytical approach, a comparison of the exposure odds among test-positive cases versus test-negative controls (for data aggregated across all clusters), with the null hypothesis that the odds of residence in a <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-treated cluster is the same among test-positive cases as test-negative controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

The alternative hypothesis is that the proportion of enrolled participants that are cases is lower in the <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-treated arm than the untreated arm.</p><p id="Par50">Simulations were used to estimate the power to detect a range of intervention effect sizes using the two methods above, assuming 12 clusters per arm, a total of 1000 true dengue cases enrolled and 4000 non-dengue controls, and using empirical data on population, historical dengue incidence and incidence of other febrile illness in the 24 study clusters (including the observed spatial distribution of dengue and other febrile illnesses among clusters) to define the baseline characteristics for the simulated scenarios [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. We randomly allocated half the clusters to receive the intervention; this random allocation was repeated one million times, and only those allocations were kept in which the balancing criteria specified in the constrained randomisation methods were met (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;247 balanced allocations, and thus 494 possible distinct randomisations of intervention allocation). Dengue case numbers per cluster were either kept at baseline values (for the simulation at the null; i.e. RR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1) or reduced proportionately (for simulations of intervention effects of RR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3). For each of these five &#x02018;true&#x02019; effect sizes, applied to each of the 247 balanced allocations, the &#x02018;observed&#x02019; effect size was calculated from the simulated data by the two methods outlined above, namely (1) aggregated odds ratio for residence in a treated cluster among cases versus controls and (2) difference of the average cluster summary proportions (cases/cases+controls) between study arms (compared using a standard <italic>t</italic> test).

The aggregate <italic>Wolbachia</italic> prevalence for each cluster will be calculated each month from all <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> trapped in that cluster. The WEI for each participant will then be calculated by multiplying the cluster-level <italic>Wolbachia</italic> prevalence (in the month of participant enrolment) at each of the locations visited, by the proportion of time spent at each location, to give a value on a continuous scale from 0 to 1.

This acknowledges that the WEI is not a highly precise measure, and serves to reduce error in exposure classification. The per-protocol analysis therefore allows for <italic>Wolbachia</italic> exposure to vary in a location over time, and also accounts for human mobility. This analysis can also account for the temporal matching of dengue cases and test-negative controls, where risk sets of cases and controls will be defined by frequency matching enrolled confirmed dengue cases to arbovirus-negative controls with illness onset in the same calendar month. In the unlikely event that a minimum of four controls cannot be found for a case within the same calendar month, the window for matching can be extended until four controls are identified, for that case only.

The first dengue vaccine has recently been licensed, but has a complex efficacy and safety profile that will constrain its implementation in many endemic settings. A critical need has therefore been highlighted by the scientific community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and the WHO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] for carefully designed trials of existing and novel vector control interventions &#x02013; with epidemiological endpoints &#x02013; in order to effectively impact the transmission of dengue and other arboviruses. This study aims to address this need, as the first trial designed to measure the impact of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes on dengue and other arboviral diseases in an endemic setting.</p><p id="Par79">We have employed a novel epidemiological design, the CR-TND [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], which uses outcome-based concurrent sampling of dengue cases and non-dengue controls to measure the efficacy endpoint. This has the potential to be more efficient, cost effective and logistically simpler to achieve than traditional CRT designs with prospective cohorts. An extensive literature on the application of the TND in (non-randomised) studies of influenza vaccine effectiveness demonstrates the validity of effect estimates (odds ratios) from a TND, and their equivalence to direct estimates of relative risk in the source population, provided certain assumptions are met [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]; primarily, that the distribution of test-negative illness is not associated with intervention status, and that test-negative controls are allowed to include participants who may be classified as dengue cases at other times during the study period.</p><p id="Par80">Our study uses constrained randomisation, balancing on the historical incidence of undifferentiated febrile illness in clusters, to reduce the risk of a chance imbalance in the distribution of test-negative controls between study arms. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that spatial clustering of a non-arboviral febrile illness will result in a differential distribution of test-negative controls between study arms during the 2-year study period. We will assess this in the trial data by calculating the odds of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> exposure among enrolled test-negative controls, with the expectation that the odds should approximate one if the assumption of no association is upheld.</p><p id="Par81">The spatial and temporal heterogeneity that is characteristic of the dengue epidemiology presents a challenge to the evaluation of dengue control interventions. At a range of spatial scales, including within a city, there exists substantial heterogeneity in the distribution of dengue transmission from year to year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. This heterogeneity effectively increases the baseline inter-cluster variance, and therefore reduces the power to detect a difference between study arms that can confidently be attributed to <italic>Wolbachia</italic> deployment or conversely increases the number of clusters needed to detect an effect. We were limited by pre-defined boundaries of the study site to having only 24 clusters, given the requirement to maintain a sufficiently minimum cluster size to enable <italic>Wolbachia</italic> establishment and minimise contamination by mosquito and human movement. Nonetheless, our power calculations have taken into account the spatial heterogeneity observed in historical dengue and febrile illness case distributions, and indicate that adequate power is retained. We will re-run these power calculations using real trial data once the trial has begun. An individual-level (per-protocol) analysis will also account for spatial clustering of test-positive or test-negative illness by incorporating a parameter for participants&#x02019; cluster.</p><p id="Par82">Inter-annual fluctuations in dengue transmission mean that the study might fall in a period of lower incidence just by chance, and indeed the high dengue incidence seen in Yogyakarta in 2016 makes this a real possibility. However, the efficiency gains of the CR-TND make this less of a concern than it would be for a prospective cohort study, and the target sample size of a minimum of 1000 dengue cases and 4000 test-negative controls is seen as feasible even in the event of two consecutive low-transmission seasons.</p><p id="Par83">The nature of the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> intervention means that blinding was considered infeasible, as it would have doubled the resources and time required to conduct field releases of mosquitoes, for example, with inactive eggs as the placebo. The risks to study validity from a non-blinded deployment (for example, if a belief that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is protective against dengue cases, residents of treated areas may be less likely to seek care for a febrile illness) were also seen to be minimised by the fact that dengue cases and test-negative controls are drawn from the same patient population, who are clinically indistinguishable at the time of presentation and enrolment at clinics. Thus, the CR-TND is tolerant to the possibility that healthcare seeking behaviour is modified by knowledge of the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> status, as long as this modified behaviour applies equally to test-positive dengue cases and test-negative controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p id="Par84">Human movement is a challenge for cluster randomised trials of community-based interventions applied to geographic areas, because the individuals in whom the efficacy endpoint is measured may spend some proportion of their time outside their cluster of allocation, resulting in exposure misclassification. This has the effect of making the populations in treated versus untreated study arms more similar to each other in their true exposure distribution, and therefore biases the estimation of intervention effect towards the null. We have accounted for this in two ways. Firstly, by powering the study to detect a relatively conservative effect size of 50%, we have allowed for some dilution of effect by human movement. Secondly, by collecting travel history data from the period immediately prior to the onset of febrile illness, we will perform an individual &#x02018;per-protocol&#x02019; analysis in which a quantitative exposure status is adjusted both for the time spent in clusters away from home and the local measure of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> prevalence in visited clusters.</p><p id="Par85"><italic>Wolbachia</italic> establishment is likely to be heterogeneous within a cluster due to spatial variation in mosquito populations and dispersal. The classification of individual participants&#x02019; <italic>Wolbachia</italic> exposure status will therefore be imperfect even in the per-protocol analysis, because <italic>Wolbachia</italic> prevalence is aggregated from all trapped mosquitoes within one cluster in one 4-week period (from a network of traps at a density of 16 per km<sup>2</sup>). Because this inaccuracy is assumed to be non-differential between clusters, the resulting exposure misclassification should only bias the effect estimate towards the null.</p><p id="Par86">Extensive effort has been invested in local community engagement leading up to this trial, extending from community leaders and key stakeholders to the media and the general public, with an aim of informing the community about the planned <italic>Wolbachia</italic> releases and addressing any concerns. Approval for releases was given by community leaders after extensive community consultation, with individual residents&#x02019; consent obtained for hosting an MRC at their property. Community acceptance of the releases has remained high prior to, during and now post-releases, and will continue to be monitored throughout the duration of the trial.</p><p id="Par87">We anticipate that, if the results of this trial do demonstrate a reduction in dengue incidence associated with <italic>Wolbachia</italic> deployment, this should be broadly generalisable to other dengue endemic settings. Any threats to external validity of the study findings will likely relate to the local entomological context that influences the ability of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> mosquitoes to establish and sustain, and thus the specific approach to deployment may need to be tailored to local contexts. The dengue-blocking phenotype of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is also partly serotype specific, so the local distribution of circulating DENV serotypes in other settings &#x02013; and also differences in intensity of transmission &#x02013; may theoretically result in differences in observed disease impact in different settings. A critical next step in translating efficacy trial results into public health implementation of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> will be cost-effectiveness analyses and cost optimisation of different deployment scenarios, so that the findings from this trial can be used to inform decision-making in other settings as efficiently as possible.</p><sec id="Sec26"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par88">At the time of submission, <italic>Wolbachia</italic> releases in intervention clusters have finished and participant recruitment in the clinical study has commenced.
