transfemoral cardiac catheterization with a 6F introducer sheath followed by
3-hour versus 5-hour rest. </p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p> randomized clinical trial. Subjects in the intervention group (IG) ambulated 3
hours after sheath removal, versus 5 hours in the control group (CG). All patients
remained in the catheterization laboratory for 5 hours and were assessed hourly,
and were contacted 24, 48, and 72 h after hospital discharge. </p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p> the sample comprised 367 patients in the IG and 363 in the GC. During cath lab
stay, hematoma was the most common complication in both groups, occurring in 12
(3%) IG and 13 (4%) CG subjects (P=0.87). Bleeding occurred in 4 (1%) IG and 6
(2%) CG subjects (P=0.51), and vasovagal reaction in 5 (1.4%) IG and 4 (1.1%) CG
subjects (P=0.75). At 24-h, 48-h, and 72-h bruising was the most commonly reported
complication in both groups. None of the comparisons revealed any significant
between-group differences. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p> the results of this trial show that reducing bed rest time to 3 hours after

having the highest incidence<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>. Particularly in the first 6 to 12 hours after a transfemoral procedure, care of
the insertion site is a determining factor in the occurrence or mitigation of these
complications and a reminder of the constant vigilance that these patients require<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>Despite rapid advancement in techniques, catheters, contrast agents, and implantable
devices, post-catheterization nursing care has not evolved at a similar pace, and
remains classically based on bed rest, which may last 2 hours<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref> to 24 hours<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>. A recent meta-analysis of 20 studies and 4,019 patients found that a bed rest
duration of 2-3 hours after transfemoral catheterization is safe, has no effect on the
incidence of vascular complications, and may reduce back pain and discomfort<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Although the literature suggests that early mobilization is safe after diagnostic
catheterization, studies are unclear as to the setting of this intervention.
Furthermore, the only study on shorter bed rest conducted in Brazil was carried out at a
private clinic<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>; therefore, its results cannot be extrapolated to a large, high-complexity
teaching hospital, which was the proposed setting for the present study. In addition, at
the facility where the present study was carried out, transfemoral diagnostic
catheterization is performed by multiple operators, ranging from experienced physicians
to residents in training, and is followed by a standard 5-hour rest period. This study
is relevant insofar as it reports the results of an intervention that could be
incorporated immediately into the clinical practice of a variety of health facilities
with similar profiles. </p><p>Within this context, the present randomized controlled trial (RCT) was designed to test
the hypothesis that reducing the duration of bed rest to 3 hours in the intervention
group (IG) from 5 hours in the control group (CG) would not increase the rate of
arterial puncture-related complications after elective transfemoral diagnostic cardiac
catheterization with a 6F introducer sheath.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This is a report of the THREE CATH (<italic>Reducing rest time to THREE hours after
cardiac CATheterization does not increase complications related to the
procedure</italic>) RCT, registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with accession number
NCT-01740856, with blinded outcome assessment. This trial was conducted at the
catheterization laboratory (cath lab) of a public university hospital located in the
greater Porto Alegre area, state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, from January 2011 to
September 2013. </p><sec><title>Participants</title><p>The study sample comprised adult outpatients who underwent elective transfemoral
diagnostic cardiac catheterization with a 6F introducer sheath. The exclusion
criteria were any restrictions to ambulation, use of coumarin anticoagulants, body
mass index (BMI) &#x0003e; 35kg/m<sup>2</sup>, hypertension with a systolic blood pressure
(SBP) &#x0003e; 180mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &#x0003e; 110mmHg at the end of the
procedure, and a history of uncontrolled bleeding. </p><p>The study protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the facility
where the trial was carried out. All patients were informed of the objectives of the
study and were only included after having read and signed an informed consent
form.</p></sec><sec><title>Study protocol and group allocation</title><p>Patients who met the inclusion criteria and were considered eligible were invited to
take part in the study. At the end of the procedure, patients were taken to the
observation unit (OU). Removal of the introducer sheath with hemostasis valve and
manual (digital) compression of the insertion site for 15 minutes were performed by
the nursing staff in both groups. Patients were instructed to refrain from moving the
affected leg. After the second hour of bed rest, the nursing team contacted the unit
secretary to be informed of patient randomization. All interventions were performed
by the nursing staff, which had been duly trained to carry out all actions in a
consistent manner in accordance with the study protocol.</p><p>Data on pre- and post-procedure clinical condition and clinical parameters of
interest (sex, age, BMI, diabetes, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, current
antiplatelet therapy) from patients in both groups (IG and CG) were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention group</title><p>Patients randomly allocated to the intervention group (IG) remained in bed, in the
supine position, for 2 hours after completion of manual (digital) compression. After
this period, the nursing staff initiated the intervention by elevating the head of
bed at 45 degrees for 60 minutes and making the patients ambulate around the cath lab
for approximately 10 minutes. The staff than instructed patients to remain seated out
of bed in the cath lab until the end of the 5-hour rest period, at which time
patients were discharged and walked out of the hospital.</p></sec><sec><title>Control group</title><p>Participants randomly allocated to the CG remained in bed, in the supine position,
for 4 hours after completion of the manual compression period. After this period,
patients remained with the head of bed elevated at 45 degrees for 60 minutes and were
made to ambulate around the cath lab for 10 minutes. Patients were then discharged
and walked out of the hospital.</p><p>Both groups received post-procedural care guidance and were monitored hourly by the
nursing staff. Patients were notified that they would be contacted by telephone 24,
48, and 72 hours after hospital discharge, and were given an instruction sheet
containing descriptions and illustrative images of bleeding, hematoma, bruising, and
pseudoaneurysm, as well as a ruler, with which they could measure any visible
complications at the puncture site. </p></sec><sec><title>Primary outcome</title><p>The primary outcome was occurrence of complications (hematoma, bleeding, and
pseudoaneurysm), defined as follows:</p><p>

</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>The secondary outcomes of interest were vasovagal response to sheath withdrawal,
bruising, association/comparison between current medications and comorbidities, and
association/comparison between sex and events during OU stay and at 24-, 48-, and
72-hour follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>The sample size calculation was based on the assumption that the proportion of events
would not be higher in IG than in CG participants. Considering a negligible
difference between the intervention and control group, a 2% rate of events, and a 20%
attrition rate, the minimum sample size was estimated at 714 patients for an alpha
level of 0.05 and 80% statistical power<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref>. Overall, 48 participants (6.6%) were lost to follow-up, for a final sample
size of 730.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>The website www.randomization.com was used to generate a simple random numbers list,
which was managed by a person not involved in the trial (cath lab secretary)
responsible for patient allocation into IG and CG. Participants were always
randomized at hour 2 of bed rest at the OU after the procedure. At that time, the
cath lab secretary was instructed by the nursing team to check the randomization list
and state the group to which the patient should be allocated.</p></sec><sec><title>Blinding</title><p>The interventional radiology team and cath lab nursing staff were blinded to group
allocation until the second hour of bed rest. Outcome monitoring during OU stay was
carried out by the nursing team, whereas outcome assessment by telephone was
performed by a provider blinded to group allocation.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Variables were entered into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and analyzed in PASW
Statistics 18<italic>.</italic> Continuous variables were expressed as means and
standard deviations if normally distributed, and categorical variables were expressed
as absolute number and relative frequencies. Student's <italic>t-</italic>test was
used for between-group comparisons of normally distributed quantitative variables.
Pearson's chi-square test was used with the same purpose for categorical variables,
as well as to test for potential associations of current medications and
comorbidities with occurrence of the events of interest. Relative risks with
respective 95% confidence intervals were calculated to assess the effect size of the
intervention. Two-tailed P-values &#x0003c; 0.05 were considered significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>From January 2011 to September 2013, 2,827 patients underwent elective diagnostic
catheterization with a 6F introducer sheath at the study facility. Of these, 387 met at
least one of the exclusion criteria and were thus left out of the sample. High blood
pressure at the time of randomization (SBP &#x02265; 180mmHg or DBP &#x02265; 110mmHg at the end of the
procedure) was the leading reason for exclusion, followed by motor issues that hindered
ambulation and, at lower rates, obesity and use of coumarin anticoagulants and heparin.
Thirty-seven patients dropped out of the study, and 1,673 were excluded for other
reasons, including hospitalization at the time of diagnostic catheterization (n=669,
40%), transradial catheterization (n=602, 36%) and, at lower rates, cognitive
impairment, right heart catheterization, and logistical issues. Overall, 730
participants were randomized: 367 into the IG and 363 into the CG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>

complications</title><p>Among patients who were on clopidogrel or aspirin, use of these agents was not

stay and at 24-hour, 48-hour, and 72-hour follow-up</title><p>During OU stay, event rates were similar in male and female participants, regardless
of group (P=0.250). At 24-, 48-, and 72-hour telephone follow-up, the pooled event
rate (bruising, pain, hematoma) was significantly higher in women (n=156, 41%) than
in men (n=92, 30%) (P=0.004). Between-group comparison of the occurrence of events
during OU stay showed no significant difference between IG and CG (P=0.691). This
finding remained unchanged during follow-up in both groups (P=0.888). </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This RCT was the first study conducted in a public teaching hospital in Latin America to
test the hypothesis that reducing bed rest from 5 to 3 hours after transfemoral
diagnostic catheterization with a 6F introducer sheath would be safe and would not
increase the rate of arterial puncture-related complications. </p><p>As a result of reducing the duration of bed rest from 5 to 3 hours, involving multiple
operators with different learning curves for arterial puncture and insertion site
hemostasis, there was no increase in the rate of hematoma, bleeding, pseudoaneurysm,
vasovagal response, or other complications during OU stay. Likewise, at 24-hour,
48-hour, and 72-hour telephone follow-up, the majority of participants were free of
complications. Among patients who were on clopidogrel or aspirin, use of these medicines
was not associated with occurrence of complications. The presence of comorbidities was
also not associated with increased risk of complications at any time during follow-up. </p><p>In both groups, the most common vascular complication during OU stay was puncture site
hematoma (no significant between-group difference), followed by bleeding and vasovagal
response. However, at 24-hour, 48-hour, and 72-hour telephone follow-up, it was the
complication least reported by patients. The literature suggests that the incidence of
arterial access-related hematoma ranges from 0.1 to 9%, with hematomas graded as large
if &#x0003e; 10cm or small if &#x0003c; 10cm<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>In a meta-analysis of 20 studies and 4,019 patients that sought to assess the effects of
bed rest duration after transfemoral cardiac catheterization, the incidence of hematoma
was approximately 7.6%<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>. It should be noted that the included studies employed different introducer
sheath sizes, ranging from 4F to 9F. Some authors have reported that female patients are
more prone to developing hematoma<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">

<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. Characteristics such as body surface area, vessel size, increased sensitivity
to anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents, or hormonal differences may explain this
predilection<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">

<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>. In the present RCT, regardless of group allocation, women reported
significantly more events than men at 24-hour, 48-hour, and 72-hour telephone follow-up,
which corroborates the existing literature.</p><p>Puncture site bleeding was the second most common complication in both groups during OU
stay; conversely, no cases were reported at 24-hour, 48-hour, and 72-hour telephone
follow-up. All bleeding episodes occurred in participants still resting in bed at the OU
and as soon as participants began to ambulate, after the time frame stipulated for each
group. Bleeds were classified as minor and exhibited similar clinical characteristics in
both groups. In one study of 80 patients undergoing transfemoral diagnostic cardiac
catheterization with a 4F introducer sheath with hemostasis valve, where 40 patients
ambulated after 2 hours and 40 after 4 hours, three patients developed bleeding in the
4-hour group, versus none in the 2-hour group<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref>. With the advent of increasingly potent anticoagulant therapies and antiplatelet
agents designed to reduce the incidence of periprocedural ischemic complications, a
reassessment of bleeding risk is in order. Early identification of hematoma or bleeding
requires knowledge, skill, and rapid intervention by the nursing team. Supervision and
continued training of nurses can help ensure rapid identification and treatment of this
complication, thus benefiting patient safety. </p><p>Another complication observed only during OU stay was vasovagal reaction, which occurred
in 5 (1.4%) IG participants and 4 (1.1%) CG participants. Similar results regarding this
complication were observed in a study conducted at a university hospital in
Australia<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref>. Of the 611 patients analyzed, 35 (5.7%) developed this complication during
sheath removal. Vasovagal responses triggered by anxiety or pain now occur in fewer
patients, possibly due to widespread awareness of the nature of cardiac catheterization
(thus reducing patient tension), better care by multidisciplinary teams, more effective
sedation, and greater operator experience<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>. The malaise caused by prolonged supine positioning and immobility, compounded
by difficulty urinating, pelvic discomfort, and anxiety, are predictors of vasovagal
response during sheath withdrawal<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref>. Within this context, shortening the duration of bed rest may reduce this
complication. </p><p>In both groups, bruising at the insertion site was the most commonly reported
complication at telephone follow-up, followed by pain and hematoma. In a study<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref> of 1,446 patients undergoing diagnostic cardiac catheterization with a 6F
introducer sheath with hemostasis valve, there were no major bleeding events or large
hematomas, only bruising (in 10% and 21% of IG and CG patients respectively) and small
hematomas (22% and 9% of IG and CG patients respectively) after discharge. Thus, the
authors concluded that early ambulation was safe in their patient population<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>Patients who have undergone cardiac catheterization experience restricted mobility due
to arterial puncture of the catheterized limb. Back pain and discomfort secondary to
immobilization are often recorded by cath lab nurses, and are the most common complaints
of patients in this setting<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>. Nursing care should focus on patients' difficulties and judicious monitoring.
Studies of patients undergoing interventional radiology procedures have demonstrated
that duration of bed rest is associated with discomfort<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. Indeed, discomfort and impatience have been observed in patients during the
recovery period, both while in hospital and after discharge to home. Pain and discomfort
was the second most common complication (complaint) at 24-hour, 48-hour, and 72-hour
follow-up. A Swedish study<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref> that assessed this complication up to 3 days post-procedure found that
shortening the immobilization period had beneficial effects on patient comfort and
satisfaction. Prolonged rest can cause muscle weakness and fatigue due to constant
pressure over the same muscle groups, and fatigue can, in turn, lead to muscle spasms
and back pain. These authors also reported that reducing the duration of bed rest can
reduce back pain and discomfort without increasing vascular complications. In this
setting, early ambulation is a particularly relevant additional strategy to improve
patient comfort after cardiac catheterization procedures. In the present sample,
antiplatelet therapy and presence of comorbidities were not associated with increased
risk of complications. </p><p>In short, the strategy tested in this trial - i.e., reducing duration of bed rest after
diagnostic cardiac catheterization to 3 hours - proved feasible and safe. Reduction of
cath lab length of stay is consistent with a focus on resource optimization and can help
meet the growing demand for procedures. Trials such as this are necessary if providers
are to abandon care routines for which there is no evidence basis and change their
practices, using consistent results from large-scale RCTs as a reference.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Based on the results of this RCT, we conclude that reducing the duration of bed rest
from 5 to 3 hours in patients undergoing transfemoral diagnostic cardiac catheterization
with a 6F introducer sheath did not increase the rate of arterial puncture-related
complications during OU stay or at 24-hour, 48-hour, and 72-hour telephone follow-up.
Antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel and aspirin) and presence of comorbidities (HTN, DM,
and DVP) were not significantly associated with occurrence of the clinical outcomes of
interest at any point during the study period. Women, regardless of group allocation,
experienced more events than men at 24-hour, 48-hour, and 72-hour follow-up.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn1"><label>1</label><p>Paper extracted from Master's Thesis "Repouso de tr&#x000ea;s horas no leito ap&#x000f3;s cateterismo
