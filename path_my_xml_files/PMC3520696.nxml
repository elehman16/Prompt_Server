This study evaluated the safety and tolerability of the thrombopoietin mimetic romiplostim and its effects on the incidence of clinically significant thrombocytopenic events (CSTEs) in lower risk MDS patients receiving lenalidomide.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Patients were assigned to weekly placebo (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;12) or romiplostim 500&#x02009;&#x003bc;g (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;14) or 750&#x02009;&#x003bc;g (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;13) for four 28-day lenalidomide cycles.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The treatment groups were generally similar with respect to baseline disease characteristics. Del(5q) abnormalities were noted in 1 (8%) patient in the placebo group, 3 (21%) in the romiplostim 500&#x02009;&#x003bc;g group, and two (15%) in the 750&#x02009;&#x003bc;g group. CSTEs were noted in 8 (67%) patients in the placebo group, 4 (29%) in the romiplostim 500&#x02009;&#x003bc;g group, and 8 (62%) in the romiplostim 750&#x02009;&#x003bc;g group. Throughout the study, median platelet counts trended lower in placebo-treated than in romiplostim-treated patients. Thrombocytopenia-related adjustments in lenalidomide occurred in 6 (50%) patients in the placebo group, 5 (36%) in the romiplostim 500&#x02009;&#x003bc;g group, and 2 (15%) in the 750&#x02009;&#x003bc;g group. Although the percentages of patients who received platelet transfusions were similar across treatment groups, there was a trend toward lower numbers of transfusions in both romiplostim groups during each treatment cycle. There were two serious treatment-related adverse events during the treatment period (cerebrovascular accident, placebo; worsening thrombocytopenia, romiplostim 500&#x02009;&#x003bc;g). Two patients (romiplostim 500 and 750&#x02009;&#x003bc;g, respectively) had an increase in bone marrow blasts to &#x0003e;20% during treatment, but had no post-treatment biopsy to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of progression to AML.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These data suggest that romiplostim administered to MDS patients during lenalidomide treatment may decrease the frequency of dose reductions/delays due to thrombocytopenia.

MDS is characterized by stem-cell-derived clonal myelopoiesis, hypercellular bone marrow with dysplastic changes, ineffective hematopoiesis, and increased apoptosis resulting in peripheral cytopenias
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. MDS is one of the most common hematologic malignancies in older individuals
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], with an annual incidence between 75 and 162 per 100,000 persons 65&#x02009;years or older
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Patients often present with complications related to anemia (fatigue), neutropenia (infections), and/or thrombocytopenia (bleeding). Over the course of the disease, thrombocytopenia occurs in 40&#x02013;65% of patients with MDS and can result in serious hemorrhagic complications, leading to death in 14&#x02013;24% of patients
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Worsening thrombocytopenia is closely linked to the underlying MDS disease biology and has been associated with higher risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and lower overall survival
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Currently, platelet transfusion and aminocaproic acid are the only supportive treatments for thrombocytopenia in MDS patients.</p><p>The pathogenesis of MDS is incompletely understood but involves genetic, epigenetic, and immune-mediated mechanisms
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Chromosomal aberrations are found in half of patients at diagnosis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 (del[5q]) is the most frequently reported cytogenetic aberration in MDS and has been reported in up to 15% of cases
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Lenalidomide
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], an immunomodulatory agent, is approved for the treatment of patients with MDS associated with del(5q) on the basis of results of prior studies demonstrating that this agent resulted in transfusion independence in 67% of treated patients
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, treatment-related thrombocytopenia occurs in 44&#x02013;74% of lenalidomide-treated MDS patients
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Because this myelosuppression is dose dependent, cytopenias constitute the most common reason for lenalidomide dose adjustments, which have been reported in up to 84% of treated MDS patients
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In a study of the relationship between lenalidomide-related cytopenias and treatment response, thrombocytopenia was predictive of red blood cell transfusion independence (TI) in lower risk MDS patients with del(5q)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This finding suggests that response to lenalidomide depends on effective suppression of the MDS clone
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Given that thrombocytopenia is common in MDS patients responding to lenalidomide and reflects the pharmacological activity of the drug, concomitant treatment with a thrombopoietic agent to reduce clinically significant bleeding events related to low platelet counts may be of significant benefit to affected MDS patients.</p><p>Romiplostim is a Fc-peptide fusion protein (peptibody) that increases platelet production by binding to and activating the thrombopoietin receptor initiating megakaryopoiesis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It has no sequence homology to thrombopoietin. Romiplostim is indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) who have had an insufficient response to corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, or splenectomy
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. It has been investigated for treatment of MDS patients with or without del (5q)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In phase 1/2 studies, 46&#x02013;65% of lower-risk thrombocytopenic MDS patients receiving romiplostim achieved an International Working Group (IWG)-defined platelet response
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In other studies, administration of romiplostim in combination with methyltransferase inhibitors appeared to confer therapeutic benefits in patients with low- or intermediate 1/2-risk (per IPSS score) MDS
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>We conducted this study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of romiplostim and its effects on the incidence of clinically significant thrombocytopenic events (CSTEs) in patients with low or intermediate-1-risk (&#x0201c;lower-risk&#x0201d;) MDS receiving lenalidomide therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design and ethical considerations</title><p>This phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted at 24 centers throughout the United States from March 2007 to March 2009.

Patients were stratified by baseline platelet count (&#x02265; 50&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup>/L or &#x0003c; 50&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup>/L). During the treatment period, all patients received a 10-mg lenalidomide capsule orally each day for four 28-day&#x02009;cycles, for a planned total dose of 1120&#x02009;mg; doses were reduced or delayed when necessary as directed in the product labeling
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In addition, patients received subcutaneous injections of placebo or romiplostim 500&#x02009;&#x003bc;g or 750&#x02009;&#x003bc;g each week for 16&#x02009;weeks. If a patient had a platelet count&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;450&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup>/L, investigational product was withheld until the platelet count fell to &#x0003c; 200&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup>/L. Once the platelet count fell to &#x0003c; 200&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup>/L, investigational product was resumed on the next scheduled dosing day. Patients whose dose of lenalidomide was delayed continued to receive their weekly doses of romiplostim. Patients who were thrombocytopenic for &#x02265; 4&#x02009;weeks after discontinuation of romiplostim could resume romiplostim treatment whether or not they were receiving lenalidomide.</p><p>During the open-label extension, patients who had received romiplostim during the treatment period remained on the same dose, and patients who had received placebo began treatment with romiplostim 500&#x02009;&#x003bc;g. All patients continued lenalidomide 10&#x02009;mg daily. If a patient discontinued lenalidomide, romiplostim was also discontinued temporarily. Patients who became thrombocytopenic (as evidenced by an average of at least two platelet counts &#x02264; 50&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup>/L with one count on the day romiplostim was restarted) at least 4&#x02009;weeks after the last dose of romiplostim and lenalidomide could remain on study and restart romiplostim at a dose of 750&#x02009;&#x003bc;g weekly until the end of the extension period.</p><p>During the double-blind portion of the study, investigational product was packaged in two identical vials for each scheduled dose for each patient.

Rescue medication, defined as any medication, including platelet transfusions, administered to raise platelet counts, was given only when a patient was at immediate risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments</title><p>Throughout the treatment and extension periods, patients returned to the study center weekly for administration of investigational product and review of adverse events, bleeding events, and concomitant medications. During the treatment period, samples were drawn weekly for complete blood counts (including platelet counts and differential) and blood chemistry analyses. Blood samples were also intermittently collected for tests for antibodies to romiplostim. Bone marrow biopsy and aspirate samples were obtained for assessment of bone marrow reticulin or collagen formation and cytogenetics at the screening and end-of-treatment visits. Progression to AML was determined on the basis of a marrow or peripheral blast cell count &#x02265; 20% with confirmation 4&#x02009;weeks after withdrawal of romiplostim. During the extension period, samples were drawn weekly for platelet counts, every 2&#x02009;weeks for complete blood counts and differential, and every 4&#x02009;weeks for blood chemistry analyses. Blood samples were collected for tests for antibodies to romiplostim at weeks 1, 17, and 33 and at the end-of-study visit, and for cytogenetics at the end-of-study visit. Bone marrow biopsy and aspirate samples were also collected at the end-of-study visit.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>The proposed sample size was 12 patients per group. CSTEs were defined as (a) any platelet count obtained from week 3 of cycle 1 through the follow-up visit that was &#x0003c; 50&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup>/L and/or (b) the receipt of a platelet transfusion at any time through the follow-up visit. The distance from the observed difference to the sides of the 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) was 0.362, with the assumption that the rates of CSTEs would be 20% for romiplostim and 50% for placebo.</p><p>No formal hypothesis testing was planned for this dose-finding study. Descriptive statistics for demographic and baseline characteristics, safety, and efficacy were summarized for all patients. For categorical variables, the number and percentage of patients in each category were summarized. Continuous variables were summarized by number, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, Q1 (25th percentile), Q3 (75th percentile), and minimum and maximum values. For efficacy variables, 95% exact binomial confidence intervals for the incidence were provided for each treatment group and for the difference between treatment groups. The Mantel-Haenszel common odds ratios controlling for baseline platelet counts were estimated along with 95% confidence intervals. Additional summary by del(5q) status was also provided.</p><p>Efficacy analyses were performed using the set of all randomized patients. Patients who discontinued the study before the occurrence of an event were considered not to have had the event and were included in the analysis unless otherwise noted. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients who had a CSTE. Additional efficacy endpoints included the percentage of patients who had a reduction or delay in lenalidomide dose due to thrombocytopenia during the treatment period; the percentage of patients who received&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;1 platelet transfusions and the total number of units administered during the treatment period; the percentage of patients who had a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or overall response (CR + PR) at the end of the treatment period based on the 2006 modified IWG guideline
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]; and the incidence of bleeding events. The exposure-adjusted bleeding event rates were provided with 95% CIs. Post hoc endpoints included the proportion of patients whose platelet counts were &#x0003c; 20&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup>/L at any point during the treatment cycle or overall, by baseline platelet count and for all patients, and the percent decreases in platelet counts from day 1 of the treatment cycle to the nadir for each treatment cycle.</p><p>Safety analyses were performed using the set of patients who received at least one dose of investigational product. Patients were analyzed according to the treatment actually received. Safety was assessed on the basis of the incidence of adverse events, anti-romiplostim antibody formation, and formation of antibodies that cross-react with endogenous thrombopoietin (eTPO).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Of the 39 patients randomized, 12 were assigned to receive weekly placebo, 14 to receive weekly romiplostim 500&#x02009;&#x003bc;g, and 13 to receive weekly romiplostim 750&#x02009;&#x003bc;g.

No clinically meaningful differences were detected in bone marrow reticulin/collagen formation between placebo and romiplostim treatment groups.</p><p>No patients met the study-defined criteria for disease progression to AML (i.e., marrow or peripheral blast cell count &#x02265; 20% with confirmation 4&#x02009;weeks after withdrawal of romiplostim) during the treatment or extension period. Two patients, one in the romiplostim 500&#x02009;&#x003bc;g group and the second in the romiplostim 750&#x02009;&#x003bc;g group, were reported as having an increase in bone marrow blasts to greater than 20%, consistent with the WHO definition of AML, but both were receiving romiplostim at the time of the blast increase. The patient in the 500&#x02009;&#x003bc;g group at study entry was a 63-year-old woman with an IPSS score of 1.5 (whose entry into the trial was due to a protocol violation), a WHO classification of RAEB-1, and a bone marrow blast count of 5%.

No additional follow-up information is available.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Analysis of the results of this study suggests that romiplostim can reduce the rate of CSTEs while increasing platelet counts in lower risk MDS patients receiving lenalidomide. These effects were reflected in trends toward smaller percentages of patients requiring lenalidomide dose reductions or delays, higher percentages of patients achieving MDS treatment response, and lower percentages of patients receiving transfusions during each lenalidomide cycle in the romiplostim groups than in the placebo group. There was no observed romiplostim dose response identified, possibly because of the small numbers of patients in each treatment group.</p><p>The results of this study were consistent with those of two previous studies in which MDS patients received romiplostim in combination with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors azacitidine or decitabine
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In those studies, trends toward lower platelet transfusion rates, higher platelet counts at the beginning and nadir of each treatment cycle, and lower percentages of patients with bleeding events in the romiplostim-treated groups were observed. These results suggested that adding romiplostim to methyltransferase inhibitor therapy was associated with clinical benefits. Attempts to compare our results with those of studies of romiplostim monotherapy in MDS patients were confounded by differences in study design, severity of disease in the patients studied, and the outcome variables assessed
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>In this study, the overall MDS response to lenalidomide appeared to be modestly affected by romiplostim. In previous reports, thrombocytopenia was shown to be common among MDS patients receiving lenalidomide and is postulated to constitute a predictive indicator of therapeutic response
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], as well as a frequent cause of lenalidomide dose reduction and interruption
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In one study of lenalidomide in del(5q) MDS patients
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], the duration of lenalidomide treatment was significantly less in patients with baseline thrombocytopenia because of recurring dosing interruptions due to myelosuppression. In that study, thrombocytopenia was a significant predictor of a lower probability of transfusion independence. These findings suggest that duration of lenalidomide treatment is an important determinant of hematologic improvement. In other studies, severe thrombocytopenia in MDS patients treated with lenalidomide generally occurred within the first two cycles, with median times to dose adjustments ranging from 22 to 43&#x02009;days
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Here in our study, romiplostim treatment was associated with increases in platelet counts by the third week of treatment, and lenalidomide dose reductions or delays tended to be lower in patients treated with romiplostim. These effects may have contributed to the observed higher rates of MDS responses in the romiplostim- versus placebo-treated groups.</p><p>Adverse events in this study were similar in the three treatment groups, with only two serious events (cerebrovascular accident, worsening thrombocytopenia) considered treatment related. No neutralizing antibodies to romiplostim were detected in any patients, and there was no evidence of increased bone marrow reticulin or collagen formation in individuals treated with drug. Although possible transformation to AML was noted in two patients, these patients did not meet protocol-defined criteria for AML because of the lack of repeat marrow evaluation after a 4-week drug washout period. Moreover, the reported increases in marrow blasts were noted in both patients while they were still receiving romiplostim, which may transiently increase blast cell counts
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Therefore, it remains unclear whether these cases represent transient drug-related blast increases or true AML progression. It is noteworthy that the data monitoring committee recommended discontinuing investigational treatment in a previous randomized trial of romiplostim in MDS patients
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. At the time of investigational treatment discontinuation in that trial, a non-significant numeric imbalance of AML cases was observed; there were concerns that the potential small benefit seen in the reduction of bleeding did not outweigh the potential risk for disease progression to AML and that transient increases in blast cell counts may put patients at risk for diagnosis of and treatment for AML. As a result of these events, a second trial was modified by Amgen administratively such that patients discontinued romiplostim and entered long-term follow-up
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion<bold>,</bold> the results of this study suggest that romiplostim may reduce the rate of CSTEs while increasing platelet counts in lower risk MDS patients receiving lenalidomide. Our data show that romiplostim can decrease the frequency of lenalidomide dose reductions and delays due to thrombocytopenia and is potentially associated with improved treatment responses. Inferences drawn from this study are limited by the small sample size, enrollment of patients with variable degrees of baseline thrombocytopenia, and imbalances in MDS disease characteristics between treatment groups. Additional study is needed to confirm the results of this preliminary trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AE: Adverse event; AML: Acute myeloid leukemia; CI: Confidence interval; CR: Complete response; CSTE: Clinically significant thrombocytopenic event; Del(5q): Interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5; ECOG: Eastern Cooperative Oncology; eTPO: Endogenous thrombopoietin; FDA: Food and Drug Administration; GCP: Good Clinical Practice; ICH: International Conference on Harmonisation; IP: Investigational product; IPSS: International Prognostic Scoring System; ITP: Immune thrombocytopenia; IVRS: Interactive voice response system; IWG: International Working Group; MDS: Myelodysplastic syndrome; MDS-U: Myelodysplastic syndrome, unclassified; PR: Partial response; Q1: 25<sup>th</sup> percentile; Q3: 75<sup>th</sup> percentile; RA: Refractory anemia; RAEB: Refractory anemia with excess blasts; RARS: Refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts; RCMD: Refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia; RCMD-RS: Refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and ringed sideroblasts; SAE: Serious adverse event; SD: Standard deviation; TI: Transfusion independence; WHO: World Health Organization.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>ESW served on an advisory board for Amgen Inc. in 2011 and received a consulting fee.
