Electro-acupuncture is considered a potentially useful treatment for osteoarthritis. The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of electro-acupuncture on pain control, pain perception, plasma cortisol and beta-endorphin levels, patient-perceived quality of life, and pain medication use in patients with chronic knee pain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This study is a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, parallel design trial. One hundred sixty out-patients who are more than 50 years old and who have osteoarthritis of the knee will be recruited from the island of Mallorca, Spain. Each participant will be randomly placed into one of two groups: (sham) electro-acupuncture non-insertion technique and real electro-acupuncture.</p><p>Acupuncture treatments will be the Traditional Chinese Medicine type. The patients will be evaluated after a period of 1 month (with two weekly sessions), 3 months (with one monthly session), 6 months (with one session every 45 days), and 1 year later with follow-up sessions at the end of the study (with one session every 2 months).</p><p>The primary outcomes will be based on the observed changes from the baseline of the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) for pain measured at 12 weeks after the end of treatment.</p><p>Also to be included in the study are the possible changes in the secondary efficacy variables from baseline as assessed by the Short Form 36 version 2 health survey (patient-perceived quality of life), patient plasma cortisol and beta-endorphin levels at the different treatment stages, the Goldberg Anxiety and Depression Scale, pain medication use, functional capacity and stiffness (WOMAC subscales), and a VAS. These variables will be assessed at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after study commencement.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The findings from this study will help to determine whether electro-acupuncture is effective for chronic knee pain management in older people and whether electro-acupuncture can deliver results for the improvement of pain relief, stiffness, and disability. The study will therefore be a major step toward understanding the roles of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the endogenous opioid system in the effectiveness of electro-acupuncture for chronic pain.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov identifier <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02299713?term=NCT02299713&#x00026;rank=1">NCT02299713</ext-link> (11 Nov. 2014).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Electro-acupuncture</kwd><kwd>Knee osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>Chronic pain</kwd><kwd>Osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>Beta-endorphin</kwd><kwd>Non-puncturing needle</kwd><kwd>Cortisol</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Its prevalence is greater among women than men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Several factors contribute to the risk of OA, including age, gender, genetics, behavioral influences, obesity, injury, and reduced muscular strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Significant consequences of OA are activity limitations, reduced participation in work and social activities, and mental distress.</p><p>The most recent clinical guidelines based upon evidence from the UK National Institute of Clinical Excellence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and the Osteoarthritis Research International (OARSI) suggest that the treatment for OA be multidisciplinary in nature and consider non-pharmacological treatment (such as education, aerobic and resistance exercises, and weight loss) as well as pharmacological treatment options (paracetamol) when an additional treatment is required. In an OARSI systematic review, five of the eight guidelines considered acupuncture to be one of the 12 possible non-pharmacological therapy modalities for OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Acupuncture has been demonstrated to be a safe treatment with a low risk of serious side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. OA guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] emphasize treatment safety as an important issue, especially when the therapeutic agents for elderly patients with knee OA and comorbidities are concurrent drugs that could have serious, life-threatening interactions.</p><p>Acupuncture could be used to explain the roles that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the endogenous opioid (EO) system play as important mediators of pain, the stress response, and other stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Recent neuroimaging studies by positron emission tomography have shown that the relationship between the neurochemical imbalance in the EO system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and the long-term pain relief produced by acupuncture practice has the opposite results of those observed with placebo (sham) acupuncture and that only acupuncture exerts a long-term effect through the EO system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>The effect of acupuncture on the HPA system is far from clear. Although cortisol release is one of the consequences of HPA system activation, different studies have shown opposite responses of cortisol release in response to acupuncture. One mediating factor may be the presence or absence of anxiety and depression, which are known to predict the onset and severity of chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Although many studies have demonstrated the efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of OA-associated knee pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], only one study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] demonstrates the effectiveness of electro-acupuncture (EA) for pain reduction that includes the indicative reduced cortisol levels and elevated blood beta-endorphins within the same patient group. It would be of great interest to determine whether the lack of these kinds of results could be masked by interfering factors such as anxiety and depression.</p><p>When acupuncture was compared with some control groups (waiting list and control groups with active treatment), the positive effects reached the threshold of clinical relevance. Moreover, the only non-pharmacological therapeutic treatment for OA shown to reduce pain and improve physical function was exercise, and this treatment either closely met or exceeded the threshold for clinical relevance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Although many studies show the efficacy of acupuncture for OA pain, the lack of a common methodology for the trial design complicates the possibility of comparing the respective results in order to determine treatment efficacy.</p><p>In this work, we have collected the following methodological suggestions for acupuncture studies that would minimize the design biases: the number of patients recruited to achieve the significant differences, treatment number, long-term treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], recruitment blinding method, EA use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], assessment of patient perceptions about the type of technique used before and after treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], the objective and subjective assessment of the technique, and finally the use of sham with no needle penetration (a non-penetrating sham control). Thus, our aim is to apply these methods to verify the effectiveness of acupuncture for OA pain. Furthermore, our placebo use would permit the validation of the hypothesis.</p><p>Additionally, the current economic reality that dictates the need to develop favorable cost-benefit therapies for both patients and the health-care system should not be overlooked, and acupuncture is a cost-effective therapy for the treatment of knee OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>Finally, a great deal of evidence indicates that various possible physiological mechanisms explain how acupuncture may provide pain relief, and these indicate that further research is needed to clarify the interrelationship and regulation of these mechanisms.</p><p>Although cortisol release is one of the consequences of HPA system activation, some studies have shown responses opposite to the cortisol release produced by acupuncture practice. Normal individuals show opposite cortisol responses to those with chronic pain conditions. This suggests that if the HPA axis contributes to the efficacy of acupuncture, its role is more complex than simply deactivating this system. Rather the contribution may depend on the population being studied. One of the objectives of this study is to provide more data to elucidate possible mechanisms of action and to show correlations between reductions in pain and changes in hormonal markers of HPA axis function. This will aid in establishing whether changes in HPA axis are causal or merely epiphenomenal in treatment efficacy.</p><p>This following study is a project to assess the effectiveness of EA for the treatment of common pathologies that involve chronic OA pain in knee. Additionally, it will evaluate pain perception, plasma endorphin and cortisol levels, patient quality of life, and the need for pharmacological drugs regardless of whether EA is applied.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Hypothesis</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Conceptual hypothesis</title><p>Patients who receive EA will have, to some degree, better pain control than non-treated patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Operative hypothesis</title><p>Patients who receive EA will have a measured basal pain perception that is three points less on the visual analogue scale (VAS) after EA treatment in comparison with non-treated patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Statistical hypothesis</title><p>Practice of EA will result in a statistically significant control of pain compared with the pain levels of non-treated patients.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Trial design</title><p>This study proposes a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pre- and post-test, parallel design clinical trial which conforms to the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and STRICTA (Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] for acupuncture studies (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Trial flow.

The VAS is a continuous scale made up of a 10-cm, unmarked, horizontal line, upon which the subject makes a hash mark depending on the amount of pain felt; a mark on the far left of the line indicates &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d; (score of 0), and a mark to the far right qualifies as &#x0201c;pain as bad as it could be&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;unbearable pain&#x0201d; (score of 100). The WOMAC scale is used to evaluate the condition of patients with OA of the knee and the hip and includes pain, stiffness, and physical functioning of the joints. This scale measures five items for pain (with a score range of 0&#x02013;20), two for stiffness (score range of 0&#x02013;8), and 17 for functional limitation (score range of 0&#x02013;68).

The range will be 0&#x02013;98.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Analgesic medicine use</italic>. This questionnaire will have four questions developed according the EUROHIS (European Health Interview Survey) recommendations in order to harmonize the information regarding medicine use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Subjects will be asked (1) about the prescription medicine their general practitioner may have prescribed for them (&#x0201c;Have you taken any pain medicine prescribed by your general practitioner?&#x0201d;) as well as any medication not prescribed by their general practitioner (&#x0201c;Have you taken any pain medicine not prescribed by your general practitioner&#x0201d;) and (2) whether or not their prescribed and non-prescribed pain medication use has increased or decreased.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>The degree of functionality and stiffness</italic> according to the WOMAC scale. There are two questions for stiffness (scale of 0&#x02013;8) and 17 questions for functional limitation (score range of 0&#x02013;68).

This consists of two subscales (of nine questions for each scale): an anxiety scale (1&#x02013;9) and a depression scale (10&#x02013;18). The first questions for each scale (1&#x02013;4 and 10&#x02013;13) are preconditioned questions to determine whether the patient should attempt to answer the rest of the questions of the two subscales. Effectively, at least two questions must be answered affirmatively in the first scale (1&#x02013;4) for the patient to continue; in the second scale, one answer is sufficient for questions 10&#x02013;13 for the patient to continue with the rest of the questions.

To avoid any diurnal variation in plasmatic hormonal levels, subjects will always be assigned the same hour for the extractions. Five blood samples (5 ml each) from each patient will be taken under aseptic conditions from the antecubital vein; one extraction will required before the treatment, one at 1 month after the start of treatment, one at 3 months, one at 6 months, and one at the end of treatment. Except for the first pre-treatment sample, extractions will take place 5 min after finishing the acupuncture treatment. Once extracted, blood will be placed in a refrigerated tube with EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) anticoagulant and centrifuged immediately. Plasma will be extracted with a micropipette and divided in two equal fractions (one for the cortisol and one for the beta-endorphin analysis).

The objective is for control patients to perceive the De-Qi sensation, which is like a tingling or numbness on the specific points punctured. Subsequently, EA will be used between <italic>Xiyan</italic> points and also to the points that the patient recalls as the area of pain. If both knees are affected, the same acupuncture points will be applied.</p><p>To ensure that the treatment procedures for the treatment and the control groups are as similar as possible, we will tape two guide tubes to two sham points at the abdominal area, approximately 3 cm lateral to and slightly above the umbilicus bilaterally. Immediately after, we will affix a pair of needles by adhesive tape to the surface at these same points though without needle insertion. This site was chosen for two reasons. First, these sites were at two meridians that are theoretically irrelevant to knee pain. Second, to facilitate blinding, we wanted to provide the participants of both groups the opportunity to be able to feel a sensation similar to the actual insertion of the needle.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Control group (group B)</title><p>A valid method of placebo acupuncture with non-insertion of the needle will be used for the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Two needles will be inserted into the sham points of the abdominal area in the same position used for group A, approximately 3 cm lateral to and slightly above the umbilicus bilaterally, and then two pieces of adhesive tape will be immediately taped next to the needles. In addition, a mock plastic needle guide tube will be placed on the surface of each of the nine true points in the leg so that some discernable sensation will be produced; then a needle will be immediately applied without needle insertion to the dermal surface at each point and will be retained at this position for 20&#x02013;30 min. These plastic guide tubes will be applied in the same manner as for group A in order to produce the same perceptible sensation.</p><p>The control group will receive the same session and schedule as group A. This will include the same active needle placements, although needle insertion will not occur at these nine points (local and distal points). Not only will the accessories of the EA equipment be connected in the same point in group A without electric stimulation, a mock transelectrical stimulation unit (which emits a &#x0201c;timer&#x0201d; sound and has a blinking light) will be attached to the sham needles at the knee.</p><p>To facilitate patient blinding for both groups, a screen will be placed below the abdomen to prevent participants from actually observing true or sham procedures at the knee area but at the same time will permit them to see the procedure that is being given in the abdominal area. It is important to state that this type of intervention will need some time for the results to be noted, and a thorough follow-up is necessary to avoid dropouts from both groups.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Next several visits for treatment (two sessions per week until the completion of eight sessions)</title><p>The same treatment will be repeated according to group.

Effectiveness indicators should be the relief of pain, stiffness and functional disability of the knee, the improvement of quality of live and a reduction in medication use.</p><p>The principal challenge expected with this study is the difficulty of effectively blinding SA application in a manner that is believable or credible for the patient. For this reason, we will avoid using the terms &#x0201c;sham acupuncture&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;placebo&#x0201d; in the information letter and consent form. The attempt to blind the process will be done by explaining to the patient that a new pain treatment will be assessed and compared with other techniques (infiltrations and analgesic stimulation) and that the selected patients must have no history of acupuncture treatment. The literature reports that the non-penetrating SA method has been widely used and has also been validated for avoiding skin receptor stimulation in SA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Disclosure of a patient&#x02019;s group affiliation will be avoided so that they will not be able to share information among themselves or compare treatments. The only person who will have full knowledge of the applied treatment will be the acupuncturist, although he will remain blind to the rest of the details of the study.</p><p>A satisfaction questionnaire will be completed at the end of the study to assess whether the patients believe they have or have not received treatment. To avoid introducing bias that could be caused by the interference of the circadian rhythm in the beta-endorphin and cortisol levels, patients will always be scheduled for blood sampling at the same hour.</p><p>As has been shown, it would seem clear that the treatment of knee OA must be a multidisciplinary approach, as there is currently no treatment alone that may be considered beneficial in absolute terms.</p><p>Although there are studies showing the efficacy of acupuncture for the treatment of OA pain, the lack of a common methodology to apply the treatment design complicates the comparison of the results between studies.</p><p>In this article, we combine all of the methodological suggestions for acupuncture studies, attempting to minimize the biases that may result from study design. We intend to make a comparison with a placebo that would allow the hypothesis to be validated.</p><p>We must not forget the current economic circumstances that drive us to look for therapies that are cost-beneficial for both the patient and the health system. In this direction, there are studies that suggest acupuncture as a cost-effective therapy for the treatment of knee OA.</p><p>Finally, sufficient evidence about the different physiological mechanisms would encourage further research on how acupuncture can relieve pain. However, the effect of acupuncture on the HPA system is not clear, and therefore we intend to provide more information that would clarify its function.</p><sec id="Sec27"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial is currently in the recruitment phase.
