gait in subacute stroke patients. [Subjects] Thirty patients with subacute stroke were
randomly divided into two groups: the experimental group (n = 15) and the control group (n
= 15). Mulligan taping was applied to the knee joints of participants in the experimental
group while placebo taping was applied to knee joints of subjects in the control group.
Biodex was used to assess their balance ability and the GAITRite System was used to test
gait. All measurements were performed before and after the intervention. [Results] Dynamic
standing balance of the experimental group significantly improved after taping. Gait, gait
cadence, velocity, step length, and stride length also improved significantly. However, no
significant differences in standing balance or gait were observed for the control group.
Furthermore, significant differences in dynamic standing balance, cadence, and velocity
were found between the two groups after the intervention. [Conclusion] Our results
demonstrate that Mulligan taping is effective for improving balance and gait in subacute
stroke patients. Thus, this technique is a potential method for actively facilitating
rehabilitation programs for hemiplegia patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Mulligan taping</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke is a neurological disorder that occurs abruptly due to loss of brain function
followed by an abnormal decrease in blood supply, and is often accompanied by profound
memory and attention impairments<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stroke
victims often exhibit symptoms such as spasticity along with sensory and motor dysfunction.
Additionally, gait dysfunction and balance disruption are frequently observed. Stroke
patients often appear to have their center of gravity shifted to the unaffected side due to
the instability of the affected side. Stride length of these individuals is also decreased,
with shortening of the stance phase on the affected side and swing phase on the unaffected
side. During the stance phase of the affected side, genu recurvatum, talipes equinus, and
other symptoms are observed, while dynamic varus and foot drop can be seen during the swing
phase<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, one of the
rehabilitation goals for stroke patients is to recover balance and restore gait<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For improving the balance and gait of stroke patients, various treatment methods are
currently in use in clinics and studies. These techniques include weight shift training
using visual feedback<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, virtual reality
exercises<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, lower trunk strengthening
training<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, stair gait exercise<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, task orientation training<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, and traditional ankle-foot orthosis (AFO).
Taping is also used to improve motor function. The application of tape supports the joint
and enables functional movement by providing soft-tissue protection. This type of external
support increases joint stability by enhancing ligament strength and restricting undesirable
movement<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Such taping can help stroke
patients improve their gait and increase activities of daily living (ADL) performance<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Mulligan taping with non-elastic tape has been applied to provide increase motor function
and stability in joints. The tape is attached parallel or vertically to the joint for
limiting normal physiological movement that causes pain. Additionally, Mulligan taping can
continuously increase dynamic stability during active exercise, such as dynamic
stability<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Previous studies of taping interventions were conducted with healthy people and patients
with musculoskeletal disorders<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Other investigations were performed to evaluate taping as
a way to increase upper limb functioning of neurological patients<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the application of Mulligan taping for treating
hemiplegia patients has not been assessed. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to
demonstrate that Mulligan taping of the knee joint improves the dynamic balance and gait of
individuals who have suffered subacute strokes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty stroke patients treated at K rehabilitation hospital located in Incheon city
(Republic of Korea) agreed to participate in this study. The following selection criteria
were used. First, the subacute stroke patients were recruited 3 to 6 months after their
stroke and were diagnosed with hemiplegia. Second, the patients were capable of walking over
10&#x02005;m with a cane or other ambulatory devices. Third, individuals without orthopedic disease
were selected. Fourth, patients needed to score two points or lower on the Modified Ashworth
Scale (MAS). Fifth, patients with over 21 points on the Korean version of the Mini Mental
Status Examination (MMSE-K) were included. The researcher described the objective of the
experiment to all participants to receive informed consent. The study was conducted only
after sufficient information about the experimental procedures had been provided. The
experimental procedure was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Gachon
University.</p><p>The 30 stroke patients who met the selection standards were randomly assigned to the
experimental or control group (15 patients per group). Mulligan taping was applied to the
knee joint for the experimental group while placebo taping was applied to the same knee
joint for the control group. A pre-test to evaluate cadence, gait velocity, step length, and
stride length was performed before taping. A post-test was conducted using the same method
30 minutes after taping the knee joint. A practice session was performed with the subjects
before evaluation. Non-elastic Endura-sports tape (OPTP, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and elastic
Endura-fix tape (OPTP, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was used for the taping.</p><p>To apply Mulligan taping to the knee joint, while the participant was in the standing
posture, inversion of the foot was done at the femur by bending the knee on the affected
side about 10&#x000b0;. The upper center portion of the tape with a width of 5&#x02005;cm and length of
35&#x02005;cm was placed right under the knee joint starting from the exterior of the lower leg. The
tape was wrapped diagonally toward the femur by crossing the lower leg. Maximum tightness of
the tape was maintained<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Placebo taping
involved the tape being placed in a manner similar to that as Mulligan taping, but the
pressure generate by the tape was not maintained.</p><p>To measure dynamic standing balance ability, a balance system SD (Biodex Medical Systems
Inc., USA) was used to assess posture imbalance, which was recorded as the
anterior-to-posterior postural sway and the medial-to-lateral sway for 30 seconds. The
evaluation was conducted twice and the average was calculated. GAITRite (CIR System Inc.,
USA) was used to measure the gait ability. The gait of the participants was analyzed before
and after taping. A comparative analysis of cadence, gait velocity, step length, and stride
length was performed to evaluate temporal and spatial elements of the gait.</p><p>All statistical analyses were conducted with SPSS (18.0 version). A paired t-test was used
to compare changes before and after the taping intervention within each group. In order to
compare differences in dependent variables according to the taping protocol, an independent
t-test was performed. P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>No significant differences between the general characteristics of the two groups were

dynamic standing balance and gait of subacute stroke patients. The application of Mulligan
taping effectively improved the balance of the patients. Additionally, Mulligan taping
effectively improved the gait of these individuals.</p><p>Ernst et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that taping the
knee joint with proper patella alignment effectively improves balance and lower limb
function. Kramer et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
the application of non-elastic tape to the patella of arthritis patients enhances balance as
a result of immediately softening the affected tissues and improving the alignment. This
method was effective for alleviating the symptoms of patella arthritis and provided pain
relief. Similar to the results of previous studies, findings from the present investigation
demonstrate that Mulligan taping significantly improves dynamic standing balance.</p><p>Unlike placebo taping, we applied Mulligan taping with proper pressure on the joint. We
assumed that this could enhance joint stability. However, no significant change in balance
was observed, although placebo taping was applied to the same area. Simple stimulation of
proprioceptors through taping has been determined to be ineffective for improving the
standing balance of stroke patients. In addition, knee joint stabilization with pressure
taping was determined to be an important factor that influences dynamic standing balance.
This is based on the same concept as the use of assistive ambulatory devices to improve the
balance of stroke patients, and results from the provision of lower limb joint
stability<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Lin et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> performed a study on the
correlation between gait performance, motor function of the lower limbs, and positioning
sensation of the joint for 25 stroke patients. The results of this investigation indicated
that changes in positioning sensation of the ankle joint brings about significant
differences in gait velocity and stride length. Chae et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> measured the changes of gait ability following somatosensory
training in 24 stroke patients. A statistically significant increase in gait velocity (from
38.06&#x02005;cm/s to 41.68&#x02005;cm/s), cadence (from 74.67 steps/min to 76.49 steps/min), and step
length for the paralyzed side (from 27.39&#x02005;cm to 31.58&#x02005;cm) were observed in the experimental
group. In the present study, Mulligan taping resulted in a significant difference in
cadence, step length, stride length, and change in gait velocity (p &#x0003c; 0.05). No
statistically significant differences in variables of gait function were found after tape
application in the placebo group (p<italic> &#x0003e;</italic> 0.05).</p><p>Mulligan taping was used in the current study to improve joint function through a complete
range of motion. This taping is an effective intervention to recover joint re-alignment and
to help with postural adjustment<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also,
this modality promotes prompt recovery by relieving pain by changing the direction of weight
load on the affected parts and reinforcing the tendons<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In summary, the findings from the present study demonstrated that
Mulligan taping significantly increases the dynamic standing balance and gait of hemiplegia
patients. This technique can also help improve asymmetric body alignment.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Cho</surname><given-names>HY</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>KT</given-names></name><name><surname>Jung</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Effects of computer assisted cognitive rehabilitation on
