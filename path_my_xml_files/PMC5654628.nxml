We adapted empirically-supported interventions for similar patient populations to develop a <underline>C</underline>ognitive <underline>B</underline>ehavioral <underline>C</underline>oping <underline>S</underline>kills group intervention for HCV patients (CBCS-HCV) undergoing treatment. The objectives of this paper are to describe the research activities associated with CBCS-HCV development and pilot testing, including: (1) formative work leading to intervention development; (2) preliminary study protocol; and (3) pilot feasibility testing of the intervention and study design. Formative work included a literature review, qualitative interviews, and adaption, development, and review of study materials. A preliminary study protocol is described. We evaluate the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the CBCS-HCV with 12 study participants in Wave 1 testing to examine: (a) feasibility of intervention delivery; (b) patient acceptability; (c) recruitment, enrollment, retention; (d) feasibility of conducting a RCT; (d) therapist protocol fidelity; and (e) feasibility of data collection. Numerous lessons were learned. We found very high rates of data collection, participant attendance, engagement, retention and acceptability, and therapist protocol fidelity. We conclude that many aspects of the CBCS-HCV intervention and study protocol were highly feasible. The greatest challenge during this Wave 1 pilot study was efficiency of participant enrollment due to changes in standard of care treatment. These findings informed two additional waves of pilot testing to examine effect sizes and potential improvements in clinical outcomes, with results forthcoming.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Liver</kwd><kwd>Psychosocial</kwd><kwd>Lifestyle</kwd><kwd>Stress</kwd><kwd>Treatment</kwd><kwd>Direct acting antiviral (DAA)</kwd><kwd>Psychological</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a global health epidemic that can lead to advanced liver disease, cirrhosis, and liver cancer and is associated with high morbidity, mortality, and healthcare utilization <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.

Until 2014, treatment consisted of peginterferon/ribavirin (PegIFN/RBV) and caused numerous side effects, leading to nonadherence and premature treatment discontinuations <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Since 2014, advances in treatment have virtually eliminated use of PegIFN in the U.S. and treatment now consists of newer, more effective directing acting antiviral (DAA) medicines <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. However, some regimens still contain RBV, and while DAAs are more tolerable, they are still associated with side effects and decrements in HRQOL <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Moreover, higher risk patients (i.e. those with active psychiatric and addiction comorbidities) who were previously ineligible for treatment are now seeking treatment after waiting decades; these subgroups bring additional management challenges for providers <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p id="p0020">Perhaps most importantly, the current repertoire of healthcare services available to people with chronic HCV is woefully limited to medical surveillance or curative, but expensive treatment. Many patients are denied access to treatment by insurance payors and are left with no other healthcare alternatives to improve their overall health and well-being. Psychosocial interventions could offer patients an alternative, holistic healthcare option: for some patients as they await treatment, for some to successfully undergo treatment, and for others, a non-medical service that may improve HRQOL beyond just viral cure.</p><p id="p0025">Psychosocial interventions that include cognitive, behavioral, and lifestyle strategies may attenuate the negative impact of HCV symptoms and treatment side effects on HRQOL. Interventions that help patients cope with chronic illness have been developed for similar patient and treatment populations (e.g., HIV, cancer, chronic fatigue, chronic pain). Efficacy studies demonstrate improvements in psychological, physical, and immunological outcomes <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Despite the high prevalence of HCV and its individual and societal burden, few psychosocial interventions have been developed specifically for this large, underserved community <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p id="p0030">Empirically-supported psychosocial interventions developed for other patient populations can be adapted for the needs of the HCV population <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.

According to this model, research programs that are designed to scientifically evaluate behavioral/psychosocial treatments should progress through several specific stages, and within each stage, there are several essential steps to complete before moving on to the next stage. In this paper, we describe the steps we took during Stage 1a and Stage 1b to develop a new intervention for HCV patients. According to the stage model, the objective of Stage 1a research is to develop a preliminary treatment manual and study protocol. The objective of Stage 1b is to pilot test the preliminary intervention to evaluate feasibility of study design and aspects of the intervention. Performing these essential steps in Stage 1a and 1b research increases preparedness to conduct Stage 2 research, which is evaluation of an intervention in a future efficacy trial.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Stage 1a: Extensive formative work led to the development of the CBCS-HCV intervention study</title><p id="p0040">The bulk of Stage 1a research activity was intervention development and manual writing, which culminated in two work products, the CBCS-HCV Patient Workbook and Therapist Manual. The formative work conducted to adapt and develop the CBCS-HCV included several activities which are elaborated below: (1) extensive literature review; (2) needs assessment of patients on HCV treatment; (3) drafting of the preliminary Therapist Manual and Patient Workbook; (5) review of these products by patients and clinical staff; (6) development of a provisional study protocol, including study design and methods; and (7) specification of provisional treatment outcomes and measures. Development of the CBCS-HCV intervention was also informed by several years of clinical experience that included conducting over 1000 psychological evaluations and brief interventions with HCV patients.</p><sec id="sec2.2.1"><label>2.2.1</label><title>Literature review to inform intervention development</title><p id="p0045">As part of Stage 1a research, to inform the content and structure of the intervention, we conducted an extensive literature review of (1) psychological, social, and behavioral aspects of living with chronic HCV and undergoing antiviral therapy and (2) empirically-based psychosocial interventions that could plausibly be adapted to improve HCV treatment and health outcomes. The findings from this literature review were published and directly informed several elements of CBCS-HCV <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. First, we noted that patients complained of chronic, diffuse HCV-related symptoms prior to treatment, which could reflect extrahepatic manifestations of a chronic infectious, inflammatory disease or co-occurring conditions <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. These studies corroborated our clinical experience. We postulated that the development of cognitive behavioral and lifestyle skills to cope with HCV-related symptoms (e.g. fatigue, insomnia) impairing HRQOL needed to occur <italic>before</italic> treatment began in order to improve coping with pre-existing symptoms and prepare patients to deal with the unpleasant side effects of treatment. Second, we learned that somatic side effects (e.g., fatigue, insomnia, flu-like symptoms) occurred <italic>early</italic> in treatment and preceded and predicted later changes in cognitive-affective depressive symptoms (tearfulness, hopelessness, sadness) <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Therefore, it seemed prudent that the CBCS-HCV be structured so that cognitive behavioral skills to cope with somatic symptoms (e.g., fatigue, insomnia) occurred early in therapy to reduce the risk of developing cognitive-affective components of depression later in treatment. Third, we noted that patients experienced feelings of social isolation and stigma <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. They desired peer support that was often unavailable <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, leading to our decision to adapt a treatment that could be delivered in a group format versus individually. Collectively, these discoveries led us to review various cognitive behavioral interventions that previously demonstrated empirical support to improve outcomes in similar patient populations (e.g., HIV, cancer, osteoarthritis, insomnia, chronic fatigue) and which could be delivered in a group setting.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2.2"><label>2.2.2</label><title>Patient needs assessment to inform intervention development</title><p id="p0050">Simultaneous with the literature review, we conducted a qualitative needs assessment with patients undergoing antiviral treatment for HCV <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. We sought to better understand patients' experiences during treatment, side effects, coping strategies, barriers and facilitators of medication adherence and persistence, and initial reactions to the idea of a group intervention that could provide skills training and peer support. Qualitative findings related to adherence were published and directly informed development of CBCS-HCV intervention material related to medication adherence <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. For instance, facilitators of adherence included patient education, internal and social/external motivation, and practical behavioral strategies and routines. Barriers to adherence included changes in daily routine, being preoccupied with family or work responsibilities, and sleeping through dosing times. We also gathered patients' experiences with side effects of treatment and how lay people apply cognitive and behavioral skills to deal with side effects. Specifically, patients reported more difficulty coping with somatic symptoms, such a flu-like symptoms and exhaustion, rather than cognitive and emotional depressive symptoms; however, prolonged exposure to somatic symptoms led to depressive symptoms in some patients. These insights, combined with the literature review, confirmed our decision to address healthy lifestyle habits and somatic symptoms <italic>early</italic> in the intervention before patients start HCV treatment, to attenuate the risk of developing depressive symptoms later in treatment. Finally, most study participants indicated that a group setting would be acceptable.</p><p id="p0055">Based on our literature review and formative studies, we identified several criteria that the ideal intervention would embody: 1) delivered in a group setting; 2) developed for patients undergoing a medical treatment that causes side effects; 3) teaching cognitive behavioral coping skills to manage physical and emotional symptoms and attenuate side effects such as fatigue, pain, depression, sleep disturbance; 4) improving healthy lifestyle habits as part of symptom prevention and management; 5) instilling stress management skills including coping with daily and interpersonal stressors; and 6) imparting medication adherence strategies.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2.3"><label>2.2.3</label><title>Selection of evidence-based interventions to adapt for HCV</title><p id="p0060">Several empirically-based psychosocial interventions for patients undergoing medical treatments were inspected during our literature review <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management (CBSM) intervention <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, developed by psychologists at the University of Miami, is one such empirically-based intervention with over 20 years of rigorous testing and supportive evidence among populations of patients with medical illnesses such as cancer, HIV, and chronic fatigue syndrome, however not yet examined with HCV patients. The CBSM met several criterion and seemed highly suitable for adaptation to the HCV population. The original CBSM is a 10-session group-based cognitive-behavioral intervention focused on stress reduction, relaxation skills, coping skills, decreasing negative mood, improving HRQOL, and communication training. After our literature review <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, the CBSM was selected as the backbone on which to adapt the CBCS-HCV intervention. It met most of our requirements and had an impressive track record of clinical improvements in health and treatment outcomes for similar patient populations.</p><p id="p0065">Meanwhile, we noted that the intervention needed to be modified to address specific issues and side effects unique to liver disease and HCV treatment which were not addressed in the CBSM. Therefore, we added health information about HCV and liver disease available online from the National Institute for Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. We also reviewed other empirically-proven strategies and interventions that could address the needs of HCV patients and enhance treatment and health outcomes. For example, pre-existing depression, depressive side effects of treatment, and medication nonadherence were factors identified clinically and in the literature as frequently leading to worse treatment outcomes <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Therefore, we inspected empirically-supported interventions to address depression and adherence. The Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy intervention for Adherence and Depression (CBT-AD) which was developed for HIV&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;patients and includes modules on adherence and depression treatment, seemed highly suitable for HCV&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;patients undergoing treatment <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The HIV+ and HCV&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;patient populations share a number of similarities; both are chronic infectious diseases with similar symptomatology such as fatigue, both are highly stigmatized diseases, and both populations have a high prevalence of comorbid psychiatric and substance abuse histories. Furthermore, the treatment regimens both require high levels of adherence to daily medications that may involve challenging side effects and necessitate frequent follow-up visits with medical providers. Therefore, elements of the CBT-AD were incorporated into the CBCS-HCV. Likewise, strategies from other empirically-based psychological treatments were integrated into the CBCS-HCV to expand the comprehensiveness of the intervention for HCV patients: (1) the Cognitive Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia (CBT-I) protocol to target sleep disturbance with stimulus control, sleep hygiene, sleep restriction, and constructive worry techniques <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>; (2) Pain Coping Skills Training strategies, such as activity-rest cycles to cope with diffuse muscular and joint aches <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>; (3) Dialectical Behavioral Therapy and Anger Management strategies for coping with irritability, anger, interpersonal stress, and improving assertive communication <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>; and (4) educational materials and strategies to promote healthy living to address nutrition, physical activity, and hydration, obtained from public access websites (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.choosemyplate.gov/ChoseMyPlate.gov" id="intref0010">https://www.choosemyplate.gov/ChoseMyPlate.gov</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.move.va.gov/" id="intref0015">http://www.move.va.gov/</ext-link>). To summarize, the CBCS-HCV was adapted starting with CBSM modules as the primary backbone for intervention development, but we integrated material from other empirically-based interventions to develop a comprehensive psychosocial intervention relevant and useful for HCV patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2.4"><label>2.2.4</label><title>Development of the preliminary CBCS-HCV intervention: structure and content</title><p id="p0070">Based on the extensive literature review and needs assessment described above, the research team made several decisions that drove the structure and content of the CBCS-HCV group intervention. With regard to structure, the CBCS-HCV was developed to include 10 modules, similar to the structure of the CBSM, with several sections within each module to cover. Five weekly sessions occurred before starting HCV treatment to allow patients time to learn and practice new skills in order to have them readily available once treatment side effects developed. The other five sessions occurred during the first 12 weeks of HCV treatment concurrent to standard clinical follow-up visits (i.e., weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 of treatment), to minimize patient burden and maximize fidelity to the intervention. The CBCS-HCV was designed for delivery in group format consisting of 6&#x02013;8 participants, with each session anticipated to last approximately 90&#x000a0;min.</p><p id="p0075">With regard to content in the modules, we adapted existing CBSM content for the CBCS-HCV when appropriate and thoughtfully integrated additional exercises, skill-building, and modules from other efficacious psychological treatments mentioned above <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. The topics and skills covered in each of the 10 CBCS-HCV modules are listed in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>. Each module and group session was organized and delivered in the following order, similar to the format of CBSM modules, which has a proven record of patient satisfaction: (1) Introduction and practice of new relaxation techniques; 2) Review and application of the previous week's skills and homework exercises; and 3) Acquisition of new cognitive and behavioral skills. The first group session included an extensive discussion of confidentiality, group dynamics, and rules of conduct. Basic education about HCV, liver disease, and current HCV therapies were addressed in module 1. Positive lifestyle behaviors to promote liver health and coping with HCV symptoms were begun in module 1 and integrated into most of the earlier pre-treatment modules to help patients prepare for starting HCV treatment. Several CBT-based modules from the CBSM intervention were conducted before treatment began. Once treatment began, an emphasis was placed on depression prevention and healthy sleep hygiene, content that was added during adaptation, to work on skills to avoid these side effects commonly experienced during HCV treatment. Finally, the last few sessions were devoted to coping with interpersonal stressors applying various strategies from other interventions <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Patients were asked to practice the new skills between sessions and return to the group with real-life examples of how these skills were applied and/or barriers to application. Patients had homework assignments to complete each week to encourage practice, tracking and application of new skills. Though HCV treatment could last 24 or 48 weeks for some patients, patients were encouraged to continue utilizing the CBCS skills during the remainder of treatment.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Content and structure of 10 CBCS-HCV group modules.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0015">Table&#x000a0;1</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">Module</th><th colspan="3">Specific Elements of Each Module<hr/></th></tr><tr><th>Relaxation Training</th><th>Review and Application of Previous Skills</th><th>Training in New Topic and Skills</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Progressive Muscle Relaxation</td><td>Introductions, Group Expectations</td><td>Intro &#x00026; Overview, Positive Lifestyle Changes</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Diaphragmatic Breathing</td><td>Positive Lifestyle Changes</td><td>Stress Awareness &#x00026; Appraisal Lifestyle Changes</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Autogenic Training</td><td>Stress &#x00026; Appraisal, Lifestyle Changes</td><td>Negative Automatic Thoughts, Cognitive Distortions</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Healing Wellness Imagery</td><td>Negative Automatic Thoughts, Cognitive Distortions</td><td>Cognitive Restructuring</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Light Imagery</td><td>Cognitive Restructuring</td><td>Coping with Stress &#x00026; Symptoms</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Passive PMR</td><td>Coping with Stress &#x00026; Symptoms</td><td>Cognitive-Behavioral Skills for Depression, Behavioral Activation, Pleasurable Activities</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Immune System Guided Imagery</td><td>Cognitive-Behavioral Skills for Depression, Behavioral Activation, Pleasurable Activities</td><td>Activity-Rest Cycles, Sleep Hygiene</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Self-Forgiveness Script</td><td>Activity-Rest Cycles, Sleep Hygiene</td><td>Anger Prevention/Management, Interpersonal Effectiveness</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Mindfulness</td><td>Anger Prevention/Management, Interpersonal Effectiveness</td><td>Assertive Communication, Interpersonal Effectiveness</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Group Choice</td><td>Assertive Communication, Interpersonal Effectiveness</td><td>Review of CBCS-HCV Program, Maintenance of Positive Changes</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="sec2.2.5"><label>2.2.5</label><title>Patient Workbook reviewed by patients and providers</title><p id="p0080">The culmination of the Stage 1a research activities noted above were two work products: a preliminary 230-page, 10 module CBCS-HCV Patient Workbook and accompanying Therapist Manual.

During Stage 1a we conducted formative work that led to the development of the intervention, Patient Workbook and Therapist Manual, and in Stage 1b we conducted a small pilot feasibility study to evaluate the feasibility of the study methods and intervention. We learned numerous lessons from pilot testing in Wave 1 with regard to successful features of the study methods and intervention, as well as the most challenging areas in need of consideration to move the CBCS-HCV research program forward. The major challenge during this Wave 1 pilot study was that recruitment and enrollment impediments prevented us from randomizing participants. However, patient acceptability ratings of the CBCS-HCV group intervention were very promising, and aside from recruitment issues, the majority of other study elements were found feasible.</p><p id="p0325">In this paper, we thoroughly described the formative work leading to the development of the CBCS-HCV group intervention, including the literature review, a patients' needs assessment, drafting and beta-testing of a preliminary Patient Workbook and Therapist Manual. We also delineated details of the preliminary study design and testing of methods used with Wave 1 study participants to determine if a full scale RCT efficacy trial would be doable. It was critical to test the feasibility of conducting a two-armed RCT study design and other study procedure implementation, as well as pilot test the CBCS-HCV group intervention to ensure patients found it acceptable and useful.</p><p id="p0330">Recruitment was substantially impaired by the rapid changes in HCV treatment regimens and patients or providers deferring treatment to await easier treatments. This drastically reduced the number of patients available to participate. As a result of slow enrollment, it took 3 months to recruit 12 patients (of 54 screened); therefore, we had to forego the infeasible RCT study design. Instead, we conducted an observational study, assigning willing patients to each condition, which still allowed us to evaluate all aspects of the CBCS-HCV intervention as well as the feasibility of implementing several other study elements. In the future, an RCT will still be the preferred approach to minimize confounding and bias. Recruitment will be much more feasible in future studies when a larger number of patients are initiating treatment and there is a greater chance of rapid enrollment of a block of patients required for randomization. Transportation and travel cost to attend the five CBCS-HCV sessions prior to HCV treatment initiation posed additional patient-level barriers. During the recruitment process, some patients reported interest and value in attending a group intervention, but could not commit due to transportation and travel issues for research-only visits. In the future, innovative delivery methods, such as telehealth videoconferencing may need to be considered to disseminate and implement the CBCS&#x02013;HCV on a wider scale, particularly in rural states where travel to optimal healthcare is a salient patient-level obstacle <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>.</p><p id="p0335">Also during Wave 1 pilot testing, several patients were discontinued from HCV treatment due to viral nonresponse or side effects. Premature discontinuation occurred equally in both conditions, but all study participants were committed to remaining in the study and completed most subsequent assessments. Under newer regimens and treatment standards, stopping rules due to viral nonresponse are no longer recommended and therefore will not affect future CBCS-HCV studies.</p><p id="p0340">Despite these challenges, we had very high rates of participant engagement, attendance in the study and CBCS intervention, study retention, and enthusiasm for the CBCS-HCV intervention. Patient acceptability ratings were very high. Data collection across time points was very high, likely attributable to aligning the majority of data collection time points with patients' regularly scheduled medical visits. Finally, all aspects of implementing the intervention sessions and data collection were smoothly integrated within a busy liver outpatient clinic, with high levels of support and flexibility from clinical staff.</p><p id="p0345">Enthusiasm for the CBCS-HCV group intervention as assessed by patient acceptability measures was high and seemed related to several therapeutic factors. Participants rated nonspecific therapeutic factors, such as group cohesiveness and an engaging therapist, as very high. They also rated the modules and material covered in the Patient Workbook as highly relevant, informative, and useful. During the exit interview, participants noted that the CBCS skills that they acquired and practiced (e.g., relaxation, stress management, cognitive appraisal, assertiveness training) were applicable and useful not only for undergoing HCV treatment, but also for coping with a wide range of daily life stressors that diminish quality of life, well-being, and interpersonal relationships. This patient feedback suggests that the CBCS-HCV group intervention may have even broader applicability to the larger untreated HCV population who suffer from significantly worse physical, social and mental health functioning, compared to the general U.S. population <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>.</p><p id="p0350">The patient acceptability findings also provide insight into ways in which to improve future iterations of the CBCS-HCV materials and intervention. Relative to other high scores, patients indicated that there was too much material to cover in each session and inadequate time for discussion and review. They also found some material less easy to understand. Future studies may need to determine the health literacy of all session materials to revise complicated language. Extending the number of sessions was recommended by the participants during the exit interview and would provide more adequate coverage and opportunity for discussion. The findings also suggest that therapists need to pay attention to group dynamics and bonding while balancing coverage of all materials to ensure protocol fidelity. Increasing the number of sessions would allow more time for group discussion and facilitate group cohesiveness.</p><p id="p0355">Based on Wave 1 pilot testing, lessons learned, and patient feedback, we followed recommendations of the Stage Model and revised some aspects of the study methods and group intervention to conduct further pilot testing with a small number of Wave 2 and Wave 3 study participants. With Wave 2 and 3, we will continue to evaluate feasibility, but will specifically address the last few elements of Stage 1b research, a) to estimate effect sizes and b) demonstrate clinically significant improvement in some of the outcome measures to inform a future efficacy trial. The results of Wave 2 and 3 are forthcoming.</p><p id="p0360">To conclude, we present the formative work, preliminary study protocol, and feasibility testing for the CBCS-HCV group intervention in Wave 1 study participants. A mini-RCT was not feasible due to treatment deferral at the time of recruitment for Wave 1, as patients and providers were awaiting IFN-free treatment. A RCT study design will be re-evaluated with Wave 2 and 3 participants and those results are forthcoming. The majority of study elements were found to be feasible and the intervention was smoothly implemented. Importantly, the CBCS-HCV received extremely positive reviews from participants who were enthusiastic about the group setting and content of the intervention. Participants reported that the CBCS-HCV would be useful for all patients with HCV dealing with daily stressors, symptoms and quality of life issues, not only those initiating HCV treatment. Based on further pilot testing with Wave 2 and 3, it may be beneficial in the future to examine the CBCS-HCV group intervention in patients undergoing all-oral HCV treatment, as the medications still induce side effects such as fatigue, headaches, and nausea <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. It may also be useful to consider the CBCS-HCV as an alternative healthcare service for patients awaiting HCV treatment or for those who are cured but still suffer from poor physical, mental, and social functioning. A final consideration moving forward may be to evaluate the CBCS-HCV group intervention delivered via telehealth videoconferencing, as a way to reduce enrollment barriers in an efficacy study, and in the long run, to provide easier access to a potentially useful psychosocial intervention for the broader HCV population <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Funding</title><p id="p0365">Support for this study was provided to Donna Evon (K23DK089004-04), Carol Golin (K24HD06920), Michael Fried (K24DK066144).</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Disclosures</title><p id="p0370">Carol Golin and Rachel Ruffin have no conflict of interests to disclose.
