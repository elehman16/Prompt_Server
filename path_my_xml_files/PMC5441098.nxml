Lately, the laparoscopic mini gastric bypass (LMGB) has gained worldwide popularity with similar results to LRYGB in terms of weight loss and comorbidity resolution. However, there is a lack of randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing LMGB and LRYGB. This article describes the design and protocol of a randomized controlled trial comparing the outcomes of these two bariatric procedures.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The trial is designed as a single center, randomized, patient and observer blinded trial. The relevant ethics committee has approved the trial protocol. To demonstrate that LMGB is not inferior to LRYGB in terms of excess weight loss (EWL) the study is conducted as a non-inferiority trial with the sample-size calculations performed accordingly. EWL 12&#x000a0;months after surgery is the primary endpoint, whereas 3-year EWL, morbidity, mortality, remission of obesity related comorbidities, quality of life (QOL) and hormonal and lipid profile changes are secondary endpoints. Eighty patients, 18&#x000a0;years or older and with a body mass index (BMI) between 35 and 50&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> who meet the Swiss guidelines for the surgical treatment of morbid obesity will be randomized. The endpoints and baseline measurements will be assessed pre-surgery, peri-surgery and post-surgery (fixed follow up measurements are at discharge and at the time points 6&#x000a0;weeks and 12 and 36&#x000a0;months postoperatively).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>With its 3-year follow up time, this RCT will provide important data on the impact of LMGB and LRYGB on EWL, remission of comorbidities, QOL and hormonal and lipid profile changes.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02601092">NCT02601092</ext-link>.

Morbid obesity reduces life expectancy, in particular among younger adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Bariatric surgery, the only effective treatment for morbidly obese patients, has shown effective long-term weight loss and significant reduction of obesity-related comorbidities and mortality in randomized controlled trials (RCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) is considered the gold standard among the different bariatric procedures, achieves durable long-term weight loss and improves obesity-related comorbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The laparoscopic mini gastric bypass (LMGB), first reported by Rutledge et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], has recently gained popularity as a new procedure for the treatment of morbid obesity. LMGB is suggested to be a technically less demanding operation compared to LRYGB and offers comparable benefits. Several studies have been published assessing the efficacy and safety of LMGB. The first and only randomized controlled trial comparing the LRYGB to LMGB was carried out by Lee et al. in 2005 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The authors observed excess weight loss (EWL) of 64.9% after LMGB and of 64.4% after one and two years, respectively. In comparison, patients with LRYGB had EWL of 58.7% and 60.0%, respectively. Excess weight (EW) is defined as the amount of weight that is in excess of the ideal body weight (IBW), which is determined as a body mass index (BMI) of 25&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Therefore, EWL is the quotient of weight loss and EW. In addition, LMGB patients had fewer postoperative complications and shorter hospitalization.</p><p>Given the increasing number of bariatric procedures performed worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], the impact on weight loss, morbidity and mortality of LMGB in comparison to LRYGB needs to be further assessed in randomized controlled trials. Therefore, the aim of the current trial is to analyze the EWL and resolution of comorbidities with LMGB and LRYGB. Furthermore, the differences in hormone levels and changes in the lipid status of patients undergoing one of these two operations will be analyzed. These results have the potential to influence bariatric surgery guidelines profoundly and may bring additional insights in the pathophysiology of the intestinal tract after bariatric surgery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Primary objective</title><p>The general objective of this study is to compare LMGB to LRYGB in terms of clinical outcome and safety parameters. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the non-inferiority of LMGB in comparison to LRYGB in terms of EWL (percent) one year after surgery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Secondary objective</title><p>The secondary objectives are the long-term effects of LMGB on weight loss, the perioperative and postoperative morbidity and the changes in different pathophysiological parameters during the study period: EWL at 36&#x000a0;months, morbidity, mortality, operative time, length of stay, subjective perception of appetite and satiety, quality of life (QOL), incidence of dumping syndrome, hormone levels (ghrelin, glucagon-like peptide 1, peptide YY, insulin), bile acids and lipid profile and functionality.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design and site</title><p>This single center, randomized, controlled, patient and observer blinded, non-inferiority trial is being conducted at the Limmattal Hospital in Zurich-Schlieren, a reference center for bariatric surgery according to the Swiss Study Group for Morbid Obesity (SMOB).

After this period, samples will be disposed of as biohazardous waste following policies in force at the University of Zurich and at ETH Zurich for the handling and disposal of biohazardous material. At the completion of the study, there will be a final reconciliation of samples collected, samples used and samples remaining. This reconciliation will be reported on a samples accountability form, signed and dated. All stored samples will be coded with a unique storage identifier. The list of patient identifiers is accessible to UZ, TD, MK and EO. The scientists who will carry out analyses on these materials are all experienced researchers. They will not have access to personal identifiers and will not be able to link the results of these tests to personal identifier information. Access to the study results will be restricted. A password system will be utilized to control access. These passwords will be changed on a regular basis.

Over time, these procedures have improved in respect to safety and can be offered at a low mortality and morbidity rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Various surgical options are available, with LRYGB and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) being the two most common procedures. In addition, there are many new operations, one of them being the LMGB. The quest for the most effective bariatric procedure is not yet completed as weight loss and improvement of metabolic status, comorbidity and quality of life have only been evaluated in a few randomized controlled trials over a short-term period. This study investigates the effectiveness of LMGB compared to LRYGB, analyzing defined clinical endpoints such as EWL, morbidity and mortality, metabolic changes and quality of life. In addition, the RCT will also answer some important questions about LMGB, such as the course of obesity-related comorbidities and dumping syndrome.</p><p>Furthermore, this study addresses the postoperative course of hormones and lipids in these two different bariatric procedures. It has been shown that after bariatric operations the levels of hormones such as GLP-1 and PYY are markedly increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Surgery improves obesity-associated pro-atherogenic dyslipidemia as well, which is characterized by high LDL and TG and low HDL-C plasma levels. Low HDL-C levels are associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. It was recently demonstrated that RYGB improved the endothelial protective properties of HDL in obese patients; 12&#x000a0;weeks after RYGB these properties were comparable to those of healthy subjects although the patients were still obese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Overall, the data indicate that RYGB may achieve a dual HDL benefit, first the rapid restoration of quality to more &#x0201c;healthy&#x0201d; HDL, and second the increase in circulating HDL levels in the longer-term period. The influence of LMGB on changes in lipoprotein profile and function and bile acids are not yet known.</p><p>One issue surrounding LMGB that remains highly controversial is the reflux of bile into the gastric pouch and potentially into the esophagus. LMGB is often compared to the refluxogenic loop gastric bypass (LGB) described by Mason et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], which consists of a large gastric pouch transected horizontally with the gastrojejunostomy close to the gastroesophageal junction. However, LMGB consists of a long narrow vertical gastric pouch, thus, reflux into the esophagus is not believed to be an LMGB-specific problem. By contrast, the surgical technique of LMBG is comparable to the Billroth II procedure performed in peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. In LMBG and Billroth II, the most important parallel is the single anastomosis bypass of the duodenum without a Roux-limb. The LMGB distance of the gastrojejunostomy to the esophagus is longer than in Billroth II. Furthermore, the biliopancreatic limb in LMGB measures 200&#x000a0;cm compared to 60&#x02013;80&#x000a0;cm for the Billroth II operation.</p><p>In conclusion, the perfect bariatric procedure is technically easy and safe, and leads to adequate EWL and improvement in obesity-related comorbidities. In contrast to the widely used LRYGB and LSG, the LMGB might fulfill all of these criteria. The current study will answer questions about safety, effectiveness and pathophysiological changes in obesity-relevant hormones and lipids after LMGB. These findings might therefore influence decision-making in bariatric surgery implementing current surgical protocols towards personalized indications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial has received ethics approval, and enrollment in the trial has begun but has not yet reached full enrollment.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec28"><title>Additional file</title><p>
