Subarachnoid block was administered at the L<sub>2-3</sub> or L<sub>3-4</sub> vertebral level using 26-gauge Quincke spinal needle with patients in the sitting position under all aseptic precautions. Patients were made supine following the block. The anesthesiologist performing the block recorded the intraoperative data.</p><p>The onset and duration of sensory block, highest level of sensory block, time to reach the highest dermatomal level of sensory block, motor block onset, time to complete motor block recovery, and duration of spinal anesthesia were recorded. The onset of sensory block was defined as the time between injection of intrathecal anesthetic and the absence of pain at the T8 dermatome assessed by sterile pinprick every 2 min till T8 dermatome was achieved. The highest level of sensory block was evaluated by pinprick at midclavicular line anteriorly every 5 min for 20 min after the injection, thereafter every 15 min.</p><p>The duration of sensory block was defined as the time of regression of two segments in the maximum block height, evaluated by pinprick.

IV fluids were given to maintain the blood pressure.</p><p>Hypotension was defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 30% from baseline and was treated with IV boluses of 6 mg ephedrine or crystalloid fluids. Heart rate (HR) less than 50 beats/min was corrected using 0.6 mg of IV atropine sulfate. The incidence of pruritus, nausea, vomiting, and sedation were recorded. De Kock sedation scale[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] was used: 1 = patient somnolent but responding to verbal commands; 2 = patient somnolent, not responding to verbal commands but responding to manual stimulation; and 3 = patient somnolent, not responding to verbal commands or manual stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Postoperative</title><p>Motor block recovery (modified Bromage score of zero), sensory block regression were assessed every 15 min after completion of surgery till the time of regression of two segments in maximum block in the post-anesthetic care unit (PACU) along with the vital signs and VAS scores.

Quality of analgesia significantly improved with use of dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant when compared to groups containing fentanyl and clonidine or lone bupivacaine.</p><p>The mechanism by which intrathecal &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenoreceptor agonists prolong the motor and sensory block of local anesthetics is at the best, speculative. It may be an additive or synergistic effect secondary to the different mechanisms of action of the local anesthetics and intrathecal &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenoreceptor agonists. Local anesthetics act by blocking sodium channels. &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenoreceptor agonists act by binding to the presynaptic C-fibers and postsynaptic dorsal horn neurons. They produce analgesia by depressing release of C-fiber transmitters and by hyperpolarization of post synaptic dorsal horn neurons.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] The complementary action of local anesthetics and &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenoreceptor agonists accounts for their profound analgesic properties.

On the basis of this, we assumed that 3-5 g of dexmedetomidine is equipotent to 30-45 g clonidine when used for supplementation of spinal bupivacaine.</p><p>Time of onset of sensory block was comparably similar among all the groups. These findings were in concordance with the results of Al Ghanem <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] who observed no difference in the onset time in patients receiving dexmedetomidine (7.5 &#x000b1; 7.4 min) and fentanyl (7.4 &#x000b1; 3.3 min) as adjuvants to isobaric bupivacaine (<italic>P</italic> = 0.95). The onset times observed in the study conducted by Al Ghanem <italic>et al.</italic>, were relatively shorter than those observed by us which can be attributed to their use of isobaric bupivacaine, difference in definition of onset time (T10 dermatome vs T8 in our study), and differences in patient positioning (lithotomy vs supine in our study). Similarly, comparable time of onset of sensory block among study groups was also observed by Kanazi <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] when comparing 3 g of dexmedetomidine with 30 g of clonidine and Gupta <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] on comparison of 5 g dexmedetomidine with 25 g fentanyl when used as adjuvants to isobaric and hyperbaric bupivacaine, respectively.

These doses of adjuvants used in our study did not affect the near maximal sympatholysis caused by local anesthetics. Small dosages of adjuvants may also be responsible for minimal or no sedation observed in any of the groups in the study. The 15 &#x003bc;g intrathecal dose of dexmedetomidine used by Hala EA Eid <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] showed significantly higher sedation scores which can be beneficial for patients undergoing lengthy complex surgeries as an alternative to epidural or prolonged general anesthetics and can preclude the use of IV sedatives. However, such high sedation scores may be harmful in elderly and high risk surgical patients owing to the risk associated with excessive sedation and respiratory depression. Pruritus after intrathecal fentanyl is known and was observed in a few patients but was not significant.</p><p>Although this study adds to the current knowledge on dexmedetomidine, the results should be considered taking into consideration the obvious limitations: The population involved includes the young and otherwise healthy patients and the effect in older patients with cardiovascular comorbidities are yet to be investigated. This study also lacks an active control for systemic dexmedetomidine effect. Hence, further studies that compare the effect of intrathecal and IV dexmedetomidine on the spinal bupivacaine may also be warranted.</p><p>Thus, as the renewed interest in regional anesthesia techniques grows, especially for the prolongation of excellent quality of intraoperative and postoperative analgesia with minimal side effects, use of intrathecal dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant to local anesthetics is evolving gradually and further clinical studies are proving its efficacy and safety and will be determining the suitable dosages of dexmedetomidine required for supplementation of spinal local anesthetics.</p><p>To conclude, our study report shows that the use of intrathecal dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant to bupivacaine seems it to be an attractive alternative to fentanyl and clonidine for long duration surgical procedures due to its profound intrathecal anesthetic and analgesic properties combined with minimal side effects. However, prolonged duration of motor blockade with dexmedetomidine may be undesirable for short-term surgical procedures or ambulatory surgeries.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
