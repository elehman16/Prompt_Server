We conducted a randomised experimental design to evaluate the impact of the intervention. Data on the same measures were collected pre and post the intervention in order to identify any changes that occurred (between baseline and end of project) in the capacity of supervisors in intervention a&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;b and intervention a&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;b&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;c to support and supervise their staff. These were compared to supervisors in a control group in each of Tanga, Iringa and Tabora regions (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;9). A quantitative survey of 95 and 108 supervisors and 196 and 187 health workers sampled at baseline and end-line, respectively, also contained open-ended responses which were analysed separately.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Supervisors assessed their own competency levels pre- and post-intervention. End-line samples generally scored higher compared to the corresponding baseline in both intervention groups for competence activities. Significant differences between baseline and end-line were observed in the total scores on &#x02018;maintaining high levels of performance&#x02019;, &#x02018;dealing with performance problems&#x02019;, &#x02018;counselling a troubled employee&#x02019; and &#x02018;time management&#x02019; in intervention a&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;b. In contrast, for intervention a&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;b&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;c, a significant difference in distribution of scores was only found on &#x02018;counselling a troubled employee&#x02019;, although the end-line mean scores were higher than their corresponding baseline mean scores in all cases. Similar trends to those in the supervisors&#x02019; reports are seen in health workers data in terms of more efficient supervision processes, although the increases are not as marked.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">A number of different indicators were measured to assess the impact of the supportive supervision intervention on the a&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;b and a&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;b&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;c intervention sites. The average frequency of supervision visits and the supervisors&#x02019; competency levels across the facilities increased in both intervention types. This would suggest that the intervention proved effective in raising awareness of the importance of supervision and this understanding led to action in the form of more supportive supervision.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12960-017-0225-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Supportive supervision</kwd><kwd>Supervisors</kwd><kwd>Intervention</kwd><kwd>Supervision</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000803</institution-id><institution>Directorate-General for Development and Cooperation - EuropeAid</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DCI-SANTE/2010/257-308</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McAuliffe</surname><given-names>Eilish</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009099</institution-id><institution>Irish Aid</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par5">There is a growing body of evidence on the importance of Human Resource Management (HRM) in the quality of services that health workers are able to deliver. Agencies such as the Capacity Project have identified planning, developing and supporting the workforce as the three pillars needed to strengthen human resources for health (HRH) to implement quality health programming in developing countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Most governments are addressing the planning aspects of HRM, through initiatives such as increasing the output from health professional training colleges or attracting retired health workers back into the workforce, but outputs from previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] clearly articulate the need to address support of the workforce.</p><p id="Par6">Supporting the workforce involves strengthening systems to improve and sustain health worker performance. Central to this is the critical need to improve supervision systems to enhance health worker motivation and productivity. Sporadic supervision visits from district management and programme managers have been found to be erratic and their use of conflicting guidance during supervision leaves staff confused and demoralized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The World Health Organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] emphasized that supportive supervision that strengthens relationships, identifies/resolves problems and gives constructive feedback can contribute more to performance of health workers; however, the operationalization of the supportive supervision concept is challenging. In many resource-constrained countries, the traditional visiting supervisor model is common, but there is broad consensus that this is not effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Benefits of having supportive supervisors in the workplace include enhanced job performance, satisfaction, collaboration and organizational commitment for subordinates, as well as reduced turnover intentions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Ongoing support is needed for health workers in the frontline of service delivery to perform to their full potential. Supervision, therefore, is one of the most relevant tasks in HRM. However, health managers commonly neglect supervision, and many supervisors lack the knowledge, skills and tools for effective supervision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Tanzania&#x02019;s Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) has made several efforts to address supervision at the primary care level by structuring the process to ensure that every frontline staff member is supervised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Primary health care workers in Tanzania have reported dissatisfaction with the supervision they receive and often go months without supervision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The quality of the supervisory visits also vary, though many found it helpful it was reported to be infrequent and of poor quality because of the minimal amount of time spent at the facilities during supervision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Supervisors were also reported to be judgemental, fault finding and unsystematic in their approach and to provide inadequate feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Reviewing the literature and current developments in Tanzania human resource training, it has become apparent that what is needed is a comprehensive, feasible, methodologically sound and evaluated intervention to improve HRM.</p><p id="Par8">The Support, Train and Empower Managers (STEM) intervention was designed to provide a structure and skill set to put HRM policies into practice by supporting health workers in supervisory roles to provide supportive supervision. This paper reports changes in supervisors&#x02019; assessment of their competency levels as a result of taking part in the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study setting</title><p id="Par9">The study took place in the regions of Iringa, Tanga and Tabora in Tanzania. The selection of the districts was influenced by the team&#x02019;s decision to:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p id="Par10">Work with facilities where few or no other non-governmental or governmental organisations were currently providing supervision training</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par11">Include a range of facilities with high, medium and low levels of attractiveness as places to work (this was determined through analysis of data from a previous study)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par12">Include geographically dispersed councils to reduce the risk of cross-contamination between groups that might be located in neighbouring councils</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="Par13">In each region, three districts were selected with two intervention groups and one control group, i.e. Handeni, Muheza and Tanga city (Tanga region), Ludewa, Mufindi and Iringa Municipal (Iringa region) and Urambo, Nzega and Tabora municipal (Tabora region). Five health facilities were selected for inclusion in the study from each district and were assigned to the same group. The criteria for selection were facility level and staffing level. Regarding facility level, all health centre in the district were first selected (all have a larger number of staff compared to dispensaries), and where the number health centre is lower than required, the dispensaries that provide Reproductive Child Health Services (RCH) and with higher staffing level compared to others in the district were selected to fulfil the requirement. All health workers in the selected districts participated in the study. A total of 45 health facilities were sampled in Tanzania, 15 from each of three geographical regions&#x02014;Iringa, Tabora and Tanga at baseline and end-line. Within each region, five health facilities were sampled from each of three districts. The sampled health facilities included both health centres (21) and dispensaries (24). Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1 shows the distribution of sampled health centres and dispensaries across the three regions, grouped by district and intervention group. All five health facilities in each of the selected councils were assigned to the same group or cluster.</p><p id="Par14">The intervention components were (a) workshop with district health management teams and facility managers on human resource management, (b) intensive training in supervisory and support skills for managers directly engaged in supervision, aimed at strengthening the capacity of these in-charges at a facility level or (c) action learning sets for staff engaged in supervision at the district and facility level which followed on from the training and continued for a period of 12&#x000a0;months.</p><p id="Par15">The first element of the STEM was a series of workshops on HRM with the reproductive and child health personnel on the District Health Management Team and with obstetric care facility managers; focus group discussions were also carried out with these personnel. The data generated from the workshop and focus group discussions provided us with information on their needs and priorities.</p><p id="Par16">The second element was a 5-day training with health workers with supervisory responsibility and district level staff with supervisory responsibilities. The challenges and practice gaps that supervisors had highlighted during the workshop were used to refine and focus the content of the training. They were also used as the foundation for some exercises or peppered throughout the training to illustrate key learning points, bringing texture and clarity to the theory. The training content and implication is being reported in another paper. This intensive training aimed to equip supervisors with the knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary to undertake effective, supportive supervision. The complete set of training slides and facilitator&#x02019;s notes can be found in the STEM Training Manual for Facility Supervisors. The training was designed to challenge participants to rethink the elements of their current supervision process. Its focus on supportive supervision aimed to engender a mindset where teams of health workers identified their own challenges and achieved results with support from their supervisors.</p><p id="Par17">The third element was action learning sets with supervisors in the facilities selected for the intervention which met monthly over a period of 1&#x000a0;year. The ALS built on the learning from the intensive training and allowed participants to discuss successes and challenges in implementing their new supervisory skills; it was also aimed to support collaborative learning. The ALS enabled supervisors to participate in a peer group network who met once a month to provide mutual learning and support and to share best practices. Results of the impact of the ALS are reported elsewhere.</p><p id="Par18">The overall objective of the STEM project (support, train and empower managers) was to strengthen the human resource management (HRM) function at district and health facility level, by increasing the capacity of managers to support and supervise their staff. The study was based on two hypotheses.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par19">Regular supportive supervision delivered by local facility staff will improve job satisfaction and engagement and reduce turnover</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par20">Action learning sets will enhance the anticipated benefits of supportive supervision.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="Par21">This paper reports only on the perceptions of supervisors and health workers in changes of the supervision competency level at the target facilities before and after the intervention. Other aspects of the study including the action learning sets, impact on health workers are reported in separate papers. We used a quasi-experimental design with districts assigned to intervention or control groups and pre- and post-test measures were taken from supervisors and health workers to evaluate the impact of the following interventions on HRM:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par22">Group 1: Intervention with steps a and b&#x02014;a&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;b</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par23">Group 2: Intervention with steps a, b, and c&#x02014;a&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;b&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;c</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par24">Group 3: No intervention&#x02014;control.</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Data collection</title><p id="Par25">The baseline study assessed supervisors&#x02019; (direct beneficiaries) and health workers (indirect beneficiaries) understanding of and competence in supervisory tasks, as well as the frequency with which they perform the key tasks of supervision. Data were collected on the same measures at the end of the project to identify any changes that occurred (between baseline and end of project) in the capacity of managers/supervisors in intervention group 1 (a&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;b) and group 2 (a&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;b&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;c) to support and supervise their staff, and compare these to managers/supervisors in control group 3.</p><p id="Par26">The baseline data collection took place in May and June 2012 and end-line data collection took place in March and April 2014, with the intervention components running from June/July 2012 to February 2014. The sample of respondents comprised approximately 40% of the total available staff in the targeted facilities on the day of data collection for baseline and 38% for end-line.</p><p id="Par27">The profile of supervisors at baseline and end-line was similar although end-line sample has a slightly lower average age; there were a total of 95 and 108 supervisors sampled at baseline and end-line respectively. Demographic characteristics were broadly similar in the two samples. Forty-one supervisors completed both baseline and end-line surveys (10 control, 18 intervention a&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;b and 13 intervention a&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;b&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;c). Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows the breakdown of sample size by intervention group, which is similar at baseline and end-line. The health worker sample distributions across intervention groups were also similar at baseline and end-line, with a larger percentage of health workers from intervention a&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;b&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;c districts (46.4% at baseline, 42.8% at end-line). The control group had the lowest relative sample size, making up about one fifth of the baseline and end-line samples.

Each of the nine selected councils was informed about tentative dates for data collection. As such, the relevant staff (the District Health Secretary, District Medical Officer (DMO), and District Reproductive and Child Health (RCH) Coordinator) at the council level were aware and prepared to receive the research team. This facilitated planning and logistical arrangements for data collection. In every district, data collection began after a brief introduction of the STEM team to the relevant council top officials, i.e. the District Executive Director, District Medical Officer and District Health Secretary. The introduction included seeking facilitation of the teams to the selected health facilities. All data collection was carried out using standard ethical procedures. The objectives of the study were explained and confidentiality was assured. Informed, signed consent was obtained from every respondent and all data and records were rendered anonymous through the use of a unique identity number.</p><p id="Par29">The STEM intervention aimed to change the behaviour of supervisors and having a positive impact on health workers&#x02019; experience of supervision and on their levels of job satisfaction and engagement as a result of positive changes in the behaviour of their supervisors so needed instruments that captured supervisor performance and perspectives. This was achieved by adapting an existing Supervisor Competency Self-Assessment Inventory developed by Management Sciences for Health. This is a self-report measure designed to assess the frequency with which in-charges/managers carry out 24 specific supervisory activities. The inventory was administered to health facility personnel in all project districts who had supervisory responsibility (e.g. facility in-charge, maternity/ward in-charge, programme supervisors). The questionnaire has been used by individuals and organisations to assess their competence and performance as supervisors and the results used to develop a plan of improvement. It is also used as a guide to curriculum development for supervisory training using the components as a basis for a need assessment exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Section A contains demographics, medical qualifications, current job position and length of service in the current facility.</p><p id="Par31">Section B contains information on the manager&#x02019;s experience of supervision.

</p><p id="Par65">Overall, there are some noticeable differences in the baseline and end-line scores for supervisors in interventions a&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;b and a&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;b&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;c. Table <xref rid="Tab12" ref-type="table">12</xref> shows the difference in mean (with standard error) and median scores on CSAI between baseline and end-line samples, by intervention group. Also shown are the <italic>p</italic> values from Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> tests for a difference in the distribution of total scores between baseline and end-line (Table <xref rid="Tab13" ref-type="table">13</xref>). The rightmost column in the table shows the <italic>p</italic> values adjusted for multiple testing error (FDR-p). For the control group, there is little difference in the mean and median scores from baseline to end-line, with end-line mean scores slightly lower than the baseline mean scores. This is also reflected in the lack of significant differences between baseline and end-line scores. For intervention a&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;b, significant differences between baseline and end-line were observed in the total scores on &#x02018;maintaining high levels of performance&#x02019;, &#x02018;dealing with performance problems&#x02019;, &#x02018;counselling a troubled employee&#x02019; and &#x02018;time management&#x02019;. In contrast, for intervention a&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;b&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;c, a significant difference in distribution of scores was only found on &#x02018;counselling a troubled employee&#x02019;, although the end-line mean scores were higher than their corresponding baseline mean scores for all parts of the CSAI. The fewer significant differences for intervention a&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;b&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;c could possibly be explained by the fact that the baseline scores in this group tended to be higher to begin with, leaving less scope for improvement.<table-wrap id="Tab12"><label>Table 12</label><caption><p>Supervisors &#x02013; summary of total scores by intervention group</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="3">Total score</th><th rowspan="3">Stage of data collection</th><th colspan="9">INTERVENTION GROUP</th></tr><tr><th colspan="3">Control</th><th colspan="3">a&#x02009;+&#x02009;b</th><th colspan="3">a&#x02009;+&#x02009;b&#x02009;+&#x02009;c</th></tr><tr><th>Mean</th><th>SD</th><th>Median</th><th>Mean</th><th>SD</th><th>Median</th><th>Mean</th><th>SD</th><th>Median</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2">In my interactions with staff</td><td>Baseline</td><td char="." align="char">21.56</td><td char="." align="char">2.12</td><td>21</td><td char="." align="char">21.81</td><td char="." align="char">2.52</td><td>22</td><td>22.19</td><td char="." align="char">2.79</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>End-line</td><td char="." align="char">21.3</td><td char="." align="char">2.58</td><td>21</td><td char="." align="char">22.4</td><td char="." align="char">2.62</td><td>23</td><td>22.8</td><td char="." align="char">2.23</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">To maintain high levels of performance</td><td>Baseline</td><td char="." align="char">37.37</td><td char="." align="char">3.7</td><td>37</td><td char="." align="char">35.34</td><td char="." align="char">4.53</td><td>35</td><td>37.83</td><td char="." align="char">6.69</td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td>End-line</td><td char="." align="char">36.44</td><td char="." align="char">5.22</td><td>36</td><td char="." align="char">38.83</td><td char="." align="char">5.28</td><td>39</td><td>39.59</td><td char="." align="char">5.44</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">When dealing with performance problems</td><td>Baseline</td><td char="." align="char">17.26</td><td char="." align="char">2.18</td><td>17</td><td char="." align="char">16.31</td><td char="." align="char">2.56</td><td>16</td><td>17.22</td><td char="." align="char">3.4</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>End-line</td><td char="." align="char">16.59</td><td char="." align="char">2.87</td><td>16</td><td char="." align="char">18.3</td><td char="." align="char">1.83</td><td>19</td><td>17.9</td><td char="." align="char">2.52</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Counselling a troubled employee</td><td>Baseline</td><td char="." align="char">13.11</td><td char="." align="char">1.72</td><td>13</td><td char="." align="char">12.91</td><td char="." align="char">1.86</td><td>13</td><td>12.89</td><td char="." align="char">2.35</td><td>13.5</td></tr><tr><td>End-line</td><td char="." align="char">12.07</td><td char="." align="char">2.62</td><td>12</td><td char="." align="char">13.9</td><td char="." align="char">1.24</td><td>14</td><td>14</td><td char="." align="char">1.48</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Time management</td><td>Baseline</td><td char="." align="char">12.63</td><td char="." align="char">2.1</td><td>13</td><td char="." align="char">12.75</td><td char="." align="char">2.05</td><td>13</td><td>13.5</td><td char="." align="char">2.08</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>End-line</td><td char="." align="char">12.52</td><td char="." align="char">2.23</td><td>13</td><td char="." align="char">13.9</td><td char="." align="char">1.39</td><td>14</td><td>13.61</td><td char="." align="char">2.12</td><td>15</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>

</p><p id="Par69">About half of the supervisors did not respond to these questions, so it is likely that these did not complete the STEM training. Of the supervisors who completed this section, responses were very positive. A large majority of supervisors (87.8%) felt that they were much better at &#x02018;treating staff with respect and recognizing their contribution&#x02019;, with a further 9.8% responding that they were &#x02018;a little better&#x02019; at this. Furthermore, 81% of the supervisors felt that &#x02018;problem solving within the facility&#x02019; was much better, while 14.3% felt it was a little better. The least improvement was seen regarding &#x02018;overall workload&#x02019;, with 81% saying this was either a little or much better, 9.5% about the same, and 9.5% (4 supervisors) a little worse or much worse.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par70">The results of the study suggest that the intervention package, which includes workshops, 1-week intensive training and 12&#x000a0;months of action learning sets, within 18&#x000a0;months can contribute to improved understanding and application of supportive supervision by supervisors and help remove some self-perceived barriers such as time management and lack of confidence. The absence of supervision or the provision of poor quality, sporadic supervision has a demotivating effect on frontline health workers. A key aim of this intervention was to improve the working environment and specifically supervision, by targeting managers and their approach to HRM. Improvements in working environment were determined through changes in the perceptions and experiences of supervisors and health workers in the facilities selected for participation in this study. The results indicated an improvement in the intervention a&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;b and a&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;b&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;c districts. In both intervention groups, the end-line samples have generally higher scores than the corresponding baseline samples for both supervisors and health workers. However, the difference is more marked in intervention a&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;b for the supervisors and in intervention a&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;b&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;c for health workers. This provides evidence of the positive impact of the intervention on supervisors&#x02019; behaviours in the intervention groups, compared with the control group and demonstrates that supervisors are making procedural changes within their facilities which will in turn have a positive impact on staff. Of concern was that only half of the supervisors and health workers who participated in the baseline survey were available and participated at the end-line survey suggesting that there is a substantial amount of transfers and movement of health workers between facilities and districts. This may have some implications on human resource for health planning especially as it relates to human resource management strategies in district health systems because of the lack of continuity.</p><p id="Par71">The study has several limitations. First, the unavailability of many of the baseline sample at end-line has reduced the power of the study. The fact that the pre- and post-intervention surveys were completed by different individuals in many cases (i.e. the data was not paired) meant that it was not possible to calculate individual <italic>changes in scores</italic> and compare <italic>change in scores</italic> between intervention groups, and between control and intervention. Furthermore, the study was powered to detect only a medium-large effect size for the supervisor sample; the study is not sufficiently powered to detect small effect sizes for most analyses.</p><p id="Par72">Our measure on supportive supervision was based on supervisor&#x02019;s self- reported perceived performance and the health workers&#x02019; perceptions of their supervisors&#x02019; performance at baseline and end-line. This may not be a complete reflection of the support provided by the supervisors and/or received by the health workers.</p><p id="Par73">In our previous studies and also from previous research, we have observed that motivation is difficult to maintain in a supervisory culture of inspection and fault finding using a checklist approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. STEM is one of the few interventions that has attempted to address this problem in sub-Saharan Africa and, despite its limitations, interventions like STEM can be used to support existing policy. With some countries like Tanzania moving towards a supportive supervision approach and the government publication of National Supportive Supervision Guidelines to address earlier shortcomings in human resource management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], a systematic approach to supportive supervision is recognised as a vital component of HRM and critical to development of the health workforce. In an earlier research study in Tanzania exploring districts health managers&#x02019; perception of supervision, policy-level attention to the importance of supportive supervision as a tool for advancing health sector objectives was observed and the managers&#x02019; attitudes suggested a paradigm of teaching, problem solving and improvement. This reflects a national commitment, reinforced with clear mechanisms, structures and shared expectations that views supportive supervision and the attitudes upon which this is based as a necessary part of the HRM process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Supervisors felt that STEM provided them the skill set to be a good supervisor and the support to further develop these skills. The benefits of developing such skill sets have been documented in literature and they include increased job satisfaction, improved health worker motivation, better ability to identify problems and solve them in a timely manner, identifying staff needs and providing opportunities for personal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par74">Lack of quality human resource management can affect health care systems in Tanzania and our result shows a general improvement of supervisor&#x02019;s knowledge and practice of supportive supervision as a result of training in supportive supervision and the use of action learning as a team work and problem solving tool within the facilities. Thus training in supportive supervision using interventions such as STEM may be helpful not only for improving supervisors knowledge but also to promote the acceptance and practice of supportive supervision and positively influence health workers motivation and satisfaction with their supervision. The movement of staff within and across facilities and districts may prove a challenge to such an approach but this can be addressed by policy interventions to reduce health workers transfer outside their districts.</p><p id="Par75">Though the analysis demonstrated several benefits of STEM on supervisors&#x02019; perceptions of their competencies, there are several factors which can affect the success of supportive supervision beyond the capacity of supervisors. This may include the organisational structure and the health care system. Logistical and financial constraints are major limitations to supportive supervision in low-income countries.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par76">In conclusion, the intervention has developed, training materials and learning tools to enable effective supportive supervision to happen at a facility level. In the districts where this has been implemented, there is evidence of increased supervisory activity at the facility level, improved supervision competency, and increased health worker satisfaction with supervision. The government of Tanzania should further explore the success of the intervention by continuing the process in the districts studied and scaling up the implementation of the model in other districts for sustainable results. The materials and tools for the intervention have been made available to the Ministry and civil society organisations, and we suggest that a plan be put in place to extend the intervention beginning with the control districts in this study. We strongly advise continued monitoring of work environment indicators and retention rates to track whether the positive outcomes from the intervention endure over time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec16"><p>
