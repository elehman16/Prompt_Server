The factors responsible for <italic>Parikartika</italic> are found as <italic>Basti-Virechana Vyapada</italic> (complication of the <italic>Basti</italic> and <italic>Virechena</italic> procedures)[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] <italic>Bastikarma Vyapada</italic> (complication of the <italic>Basti</italic> procedures), <italic>Arsha</italic> (piles), <italic>Atisara</italic>, <italic>Grahani</italic>, <italic>Udavarta</italic>, etc., are mentioned in various texts. The study place is such a dry place, so there is already high prevalence of ano-rectal disorders particularly <italic>Arsha</italic> and <italic>Parikartika</italic> (fissure-in-ano). Chronic fissure-in-ano is having the prevalence rate approximately 30&#x02013;40% of total ano-rectal sufferings whereas the incidence is supposed to be very common in constipated people particularly once who pass hard and dry stool. In this regard, the percentage of disease anal fissure may be higher than 30% of attendance of ano-rectal cases in Outdoor Patient Department (OPD) of Shalya Tantra at study place. It is interesting to note that the maximum cases are of chronic fissure-in-ano; either by late approach for treatment or failure of conservative treatments. In modern surgical treatments such as Lord's anal dilatation, fissurectomy, and sphincterotomy for anal fissure are available but they have their own limitations like recurrence, incontinence, etc.</p><p>The cause of fissure-in-ano is primarily constipation with passing of hard stool and secondary due to many diseases like chronic amoebic dysentery, diverticulitis, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis etc., and even post hemorrhoidectomy or fistulectomy. The common site of fissure-in-ano is 6 o&#x02019;clock, that is, midline posterior, lower half of the anal canal which is commonly found in young adults and after delivery in females. The disease has been classified into two varieties viz., acute fissure-in-ano and chronic fissure-in-ano. Acute fissure-in-ano is a condition in which only inflammation of the anal mucosa and which was subsided by conservative treatment. In chronic cases, there are associated pathologies such as external and internal hemorrhoids, sentinel tag which needs surgical intervention.</p><p><italic>Ksharasutra</italic> therapy, in the day-to-day practice, is receiving its nationwide popularity with the extension to Western and European countries. The unique advantages of <italic>Ksharasutra</italic> therapy in curing the diseases have been emphasized by medical science beyond any doubt. As it is a known fact that satisfactory and curable result is being achieved in ano-rectal disorders like piles, fistula, fissure, etc., by the application of <italic>Ksharasutra</italic> and other products of <italic>Kshara</italic>. Many research studies carried out for treatment of <italic>Parikartika</italic> at postgraduate level as well some research manuscript were published in the journal.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] But most of these studies are conservative measures[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and in chronic fissure-in-ano, there is a need of surgery for complete remission. Thus, considering all factors this study was planned with aim and objective to evaluate the role of <italic>Ksharasutra</italic> in the management of <italic>Parikartika</italic> (chronic fissure-in-ano).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Selection of patients</title><p>The patients of chronic fissure-in-ano were registered randomly from OPD and Indoor Patient Department (IPD) of Shalya Tantra, IPGT and RA, Gujarat Ayurved University, Jamnagar, Gujarat, India, irrespective of age, sex, occupation, and religion.

Statistically highly significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) results had been seen in weekly interval. In the case of wound healing, four patients required more than 28 days and significant results were seen in weekly interval. In patients of Group-B, an intensity of pain decreased day by day and complete pain relief was observed on 14<sup>th</sup> postoperative day in entire patients while oozing was stopped in all patients by 28 days. Statistically highly significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) results seen in pain and oozing by weekly assessment. In the case of wound healing, two patients required more than 28 days and statistically significant result was observed in all patients by weekly assessment.</p><p>The percentage of pain relief on 14<sup>th</sup> day in Group-A was 86% while in Group-B 100% was observed [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>].

It can be said that young middle-aged patients are more sufferer because they bear more family responsibility. Junk and spicy food consumption becomes routine diet to spare more time for fulfilling their responsibility. Male patients were more (65%); the reason might be the more awareness about the disease among male in comparison to females and female patients are also hesitate to consult a surgeon. But there is no any such reason mentioned in the text of proctology or surgery; rather they have suggested that the fissure-in-ano can occur irrespective to gender equally.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Labor class patients were observed maximum (31%); might be the flow of patients in Govt. Hospital is more of labor than other classes. The patients from urban background were noted maximum (70%) in this study; might be due to sedentary lifestyle and more consumption of spicy and junk foods which are held responsible for <italic>Agnimandya</italic> and chronic constipation; ultimately leads to <italic>Parikartika</italic>. The observation showed that socio-economically poor patients were more (64%) due to negligence about the gravity of disease <italic>Parikartika</italic> in acute condition, which leads to a chronic stage after repeated attacks.</p><p>In India, age of marriage is 21 years for females and 25 years for males which was found in co-relation with the number of married patients observed were maximum 85%; also suggested that this disease is occurred mainly in middle-aged group and married patients. This finding is supported by the reference available in classics of Ayurveda that the Parikaritka is commonly found in pregnant and <italic>Prasuta</italic>[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] patients. Sound sleep was found in 79% of patients which showed that the disease <italic>Parikartika</italic> did not disturb the sleep. The pain in ano is mostly occurred after defecation and may likely to be present for few minutes to hours; after that patients feel comfortable.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Patients having <italic>Krurakoshtha</italic> (38%) were more in number which showed predominance of <italic>Vata Dosha</italic> and considered as a prime <italic>Dosha</italic> vitiated in pain dominating disorder like <italic>Parikartika</italic>. <italic>Mandagni</italic> is said to be the root cause of all diseases in Ayurveda,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] particularly disorders related to the gastro-intestinal tract and ano-rectal region. In <italic>Mandagni</italic> cases, improper digestion of food takes place which may lead to either constipation or diarrhea and ultimately <italic>Parikartika</italic>. In this study, maximum patients (72%) were suffering from Parikatika having features of <italic>Mandagni</italic> and constipation. <italic>Vata-Pittaja Prakriti</italic> patients were found maximum (54%) which showed <italic>Vata Dosha</italic> vitiation relation to patients of <italic>Prakriti</italic>.</p><p>The 73% of patients were observed to be having irregular bowel habits which might be due to <italic>Agnimandya</italic> and improper digestion of foods, leading to vitiation of <italic>Vata Dosha</italic> particularly <italic>Apana Vayu</italic> and causes irregularity in evacuation of stool. <italic>Vishamashana</italic> (38%) followed by <italic>Adhyashana</italic> (34%) type of the dietetic habit was seen; due to these types of eating habits patients were suffering from indigestion &#x02013; <italic>Agnimandya</italic> - <italic>Malabaddhata</italic> (constipation) and ultimately <italic>Parikartika</italic>.</p><p>Totally, 35% of patients were reported having chronicity up to 1 year and 33% patients were reported 1&#x02013;2 years because entire patients were selected of chronic fissure-in-ano. The 87% patients were observed with fissure at posterior (6 o&#x02019;clock) position of the anus because fissure bed at posterior position is mainly due to the impact of direct pressure of stool at posterior aspect of the anal canal during defecation. The sentinel tag is mostly found in cases of chronic fissure-in-ano which develops to guard fissure from more tear of the anal verge, so maximum 84% of patients had developed sentinel tag. These data are well-supported by the authentic texts of surgical practice.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In this study, on per rectal digital examination; 83% patients had spasmodic anal sphincter; it is due to increased intra-rectal pressure and causes delay in healing[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and finding also supported by previous research work.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>The main symptom of <italic>Parikartika</italic> is <italic>Vedana</italic> (pain in ano); after 28 days both groups showed statistically highly significant relief in pain, but in Group-B pain relief was early in comparison to Group-A might be due to relaxation of sphincter spasm after Lord's anal dilatation. In cases of <italic>Parikartika</italic>, sphincter spasm and the presence of fissure lead to painful defecation and due to which patient scared and avoid passing stool. Hence, after surgery, pain wear off due to relaxation of anal sphincters as well as removal of unhealthy tissue by KSS from fissure bed which promotes healthy and complete healing. Hence, it can be said that the pain relief in patients of Group-B is found better than the patients of Group-A.</p><p>Slight oozing from the raw and clean wound of fissure bed was there after <italic>Ksharasutra</italic> removal in the form of serous discharge. Smeared <italic>Kshara</italic> on <italic>Ksharasutra</italic> is alkaline in nature (pH - 10.39) which is capable to inhibit the bacterial growth. Hence, created wound after cut through of <italic>Ksharasutra</italic> found in <italic>Shuddha Avastha</italic> (clean and non-infected wound). Maximum patients in both groups have relief in oozing within 7<sup>th</sup> postoperative day, and very few patients had taken 14 days to stop oozing. Discharge of serous is due to the inflammation present around the wound in early days, but use of <italic>Jatyadi Taila</italic> (10 ml/rectum) once daily was found helpful to control oozing/discharge in both groups. The statistical analysis also showed highly significant results in both groups on weekly assessment. But on inter group comparison of result significant difference was observed on 7<sup>th</sup> day in cessation of oozing in which Group-B showed better result than Group-A.</p><p>The spontaneous removal/cut through of <italic>Ksharasutra</italic> leads to a fresh wound, and maximum patients showed wound healing after 21 days. Hence, study supports the principle that clean and healthy wounds take minimum 3 weeks or 21 days for complete healing. The sitz bath with <italic>Sphatikadi Yoga</italic> and per rectal instillation of <italic>Jatyadi Taila</italic> definitely helped to achieve the conditions of <italic>Shodhana</italic> and <italic>Ropana</italic> of wound. Wound healing was found better in Group-B than Group-A, because sphincter spasm became relaxed due to anal dilatation which helped in early wound healing. In Group-A, wound healing took more time due to the presence of some sphincter spasm even after KSS; as complete relaxation could not be achieved without dilatation. Therefore, it can be said that, Group-B showed better result over Group-A in duration of wound healing.</p><p>In 49% patients, <italic>Ksharasutra</italic> sutured at fissure bed, sloughed out spontaneously on 4<sup>th</sup> postoperative day whereas 38% patients were observed sloughing out of <italic>Ksharasutra</italic> by 5<sup>th</sup> postoperative day. Very few patients (3%), had taken 6 days to slough out <italic>Ksharasutra</italic> from fissure bed. The sloughing out of sutured <italic>Ksharasutra</italic> was taken almost similar time in patients of both groups.

The oozing in the form of serous discharge was considered as an important parameter to assess the result of KSS. Hence, it can be inferred that KSS was effective to stop bleeding as fissure bed was removed, and no further trauma occurred to the healthy wound.</p><p>Every procedure including surgical/para-surgical, has its own merits and demerits. In four patients (3 in Group-A and 1 in Group-B), complications were observed within the treatment period of 1 month might be due to excessive local tissue reaction of <italic>Kshara</italic>. These patients were treated accordingly by incision and drainage of abscess while fistula cases were treated with <italic>Ksharasutra</italic> application.
