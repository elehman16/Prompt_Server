They accounted for 50% of deaths in developed countries, and each year many people die due to lack of treatment or suffer from related chronic disabilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Forty percent of men and 20% of women suffer from cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, health care costs and the costs of medication, equipment, and rehabilitation are estimated to be over 62 billion dollars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Coronary artery disease causes arterial stenosis, compromises blood circulation to the myocardium, and leads to ischemia and infarction because of the build-up of unnatural lipid, fat and fiber in the vessel wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Treatment methods for coronary artery disease consist of angioplasty, drug therapy, stenting, atherectomy, and surgical treatments such as coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, CABG is still the first choice for patients with severe coronary artery disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] since drug therapy is incomplete without follow up in cardiac rehabilitation, cardiac rehabilitation, as a secondary prevention, plays an important role among non-pharmacological interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In a study by Dadvand et al. (2008) of 66 patients with myocardial infarction, the number of relapses decreased after 8&#x02009;weeks of cardiac rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Coronary artery bypass graft surgery is a traumatic event that causes considerable anxiety and depression for patients. Therefore, one of the main aims of nursing is to enhance their comfort and reduce their stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In a study, 53 patients who were scheduled for CABG were examined a few days before and after the operation. They completed the Speilberger Anxiety Questionnaire. Patients who had agreed to undergo coronary artery bypass graft surgery experienced considerable anxiety before (55%), shortly after (34%), and 3&#x02009;months after surgery (32%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Crowe et al. (1996) reported that symptoms of anxiety are common among patients who are hospitalized for cardiac complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Signs of depression are seen in 32% of patients before surgery, in 28% immediately after surgery, and in 26% 3&#x02009;months after surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In another study of 155 patients undergoing CABG who were depressed or anxious before surgery, they also had a higher level of depression and anxiety after surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Cardiac rehabilitation is a group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and interdisciplinary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] intervention aimed at reducing the risk of further cardiac events and conditions through individual and group training and physical activities. Rehabilitation is used to enhance the patients&#x02019; quality of life, encourage them to return to work and their previous life style, improve their social and mental condition, and prevent future cardiac complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Most studies have shown that rehabilitation programs after surgery have been effective in reducing the amount of depression and anxiety and increasing the quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Cardiac rehabilitation describes all measures used to help people with heart disease return to an active and satisfying life to prevent the recurrence of cardiac events. Cardiac rehabilitation services consist of three types or stages: inpatient, outpatient and ongoing prevention. Inpatient rehabilitation begin as soon as possible after admission to hospital, outpatient rehabilitation is after patient discharge from the hospital, and ongoing prevention approaches consist of maintaining the patient&#x02019;s long term cardiovascular stability and physical condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In a case&#x02013;control study, Lin and colleagues (2002) reported reduced anxiety rates on discharge compared to the admission day after the patients had undergone phase 1 (inpatient) cardiac rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Since in Iran we do not have sufficient cardiac rehabilitation centers, we started cardiac rehabilitation after CABG surgery. Improvements in technology in developing societies are leading to changes in life style such as reduce of physical activity, change dietary patterns, and thus lead to increases in risk factors for various diseases such as diabetes and coronary artery disease. Because of the increasing numbers of patients, the capacity measures needed for cardiac rehabilitation are not always taken and existing rehabilitation training is insufficient. This study was designed to determine the effect of cardiac rehabilitation on depression and anxiety in patients undergoing CABG.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>In this randomized controlled trial, the effects of cardiac rehabilitation on anxiety and depression were investigated in patients after CABG. All patients were evaluated in three stages (before intervention, immediately after intervention, and 2&#x02009;months after intervention) at Nemazee and Faghihi hospitals in Shiraz, southern Iran. These hospitals are the referral centers for Fars province in southwest Iran.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients</title><p>The research population consisted of patients scheduled for CABG. The inclusion criteria were: 40&#x02013;70&#x02009;years of age, an ejection fraction ratio of over 40%, scheduled for CABG by a cardiologist, ability to read, write, perform the exercises in the rehabilitation program, and attend rehabilitation sessions.</p><p>The exclusion criteria were: history of mental illness, previous participation in cardiac rehabilitation programs, death or recurrence of illness and hospitalization, disorder or disability that interfered with the patient&#x02019;s ability to do the rehabilitation exercises, history of cardiac surgery, urgent need for surgery, history of coronary artery transplant along with other operations such as valve replacement, history of severe depression or anxiety and use of antianxiety and antidepressant drugs, history of participating in yoga and meditation programs, severe depression or anxiety, inability to perform exercise and refusal to participate in rehabilitation sessions.

Rehabilitation sessions were held at Faghihi Hospital and consisted of fitness programs and educational programs lasting for 4&#x02009;weeks. Two sessions were held each week lasting for 2 hours in the form of group education. The participants were trained regarding their use of drugs and diet, weight control (30&#x02009;min), stress management, quitting smoking (45&#x02009;min), light physical exercise, and relaxation (45&#x02009;min). The contents of the program were developed by a research team consisting of a cardiologist and a heart surgeon. All patients were seen and examined by the research team before rehabilitation and then the questionnaires were given to patients by the researcher. In the rehabilitation center the patients were under the supervision of sport medicine experts too. The control group received the hospital&#x02019;s routine postoperative care which was a cardiac rehabilitation pamphlet about their appropriate diet, physical activity and use of medication.</p><p>At the end of the intervention, educational booklets were given to the participants of the control group and they were referred to rehabilitation centers. If the patient in the control group was in need of education and rehabilitation during the study, he/she was given the appropriate education and excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Instruments</title><p>Data were collected using a demographic information questionnaire, Spielberger&#x02019;s Two-part Anxiety Scale (STAI) and Beck&#x02019;s Depression Inventory (BDI).</p><p>Spielberger&#x02019;s anxiety scale was used to determine the state and trait anxiety. The scale consisted of 40 questions and scores ranged from 40 points (no anxiety) to a maximum of 160 points. The first part of this two-part questionnaire consists of 20 questions focusing on the state anxiety, and the second part consists of 20 questions focusing on the trait anxiety. Each response is scored between 1 and 4, and total scores for each section (state and trait) are between 20&#x02013;80. A score of 20&#x02013;40 indicates mild anxiety, 41&#x02013;60 moderate anxiety, and 61&#x02013;80 severe anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].

The test-retest reliability (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.97) and validity of the Persian version of the questionnaire was reported by Aghamohamadi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>The Beck Depression Inventory is the most commonly used screening instrument for depression in the general population. This self-evaluation questionnaire is used to evaluate depression more extensively in psychiatric patients and to identify depression in other patients. The inventory contains 21 items and responses are scored from 1 to 3. Ghasemzadeh et al. (2005) reported high internal consistency of the Persian language version (Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.87) and acceptable test-retest reliability (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.74) in an Iranian sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Scores of 0&#x02013;9 are considered normal, 10&#x02013;16 indicate mild depression, 17 to 20 indicate moderate depression, 21&#x02013;30 indicate severe depression, and scores&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;30 indicate very severe depression.</p><p>The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.

The educational program consisted of relaxation, correct breathing exercises and appropriate physical exercises. The results showed that educational intervention was effective in the intervention group (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) for reducing depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In another uncontrolled trial conducted in Iran, the researchers assessed the effect of progressive muscular relaxation training on postoperative anxiety and quality of life in patients who underwent CABG surgery. They found that after an interventional course consisting of exercise training, lifestyle education and muscular relaxation, anxiety levels reduced significantly, while quality of life scores increased compared to the usual care for the control group (exercise training and lifestyle education) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In this study we did not mainly focus on relaxation, although relaxation was only a part of our educational cardiac rehabilitation intervention. In our study the mean anxiety level after the intervention reduced from 37 (before intervention) to 31 (after intervention) and 28 (2&#x02009;months after intervention) but the difference between the three time points were not significant, in contrast to the previously mentioned study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Although the difference between the three time-points was not significant, the reduction of mean anxiety score was lower than Hazavei et al&#x02019;s study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Lie et al. (2007) reported that 32% of the participants had anxiety before surgery in their study, which was reduced by 15% after the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. They found that 6&#x02009;weeks and 6&#x02009;months after the intervention, the signs of anxiety and depression improved considerably in both case and control groups. However, no significant statistical difference was seen between the two groups, which is consistent with our results. The lack of significance may be related to the short duration of the interventions.</p><p>We believe that fear and worry about health and the future remains an important influence on the patients&#x02019; mental health even after rehabilitation. In this regard, Rymazewska and Kiejna (2003) noted that severe anxiety in patients before surgery declined after successful surgery and then increased gradually three months later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Seki et al. (2003) observed a statistically significant difference in anxiety and depression 6&#x02009;months after cardiac rehabilitation in patients suffering from stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In a similar study by Dugmore et al. (1999) to determine the effect of cardiac rehabilitation on the quality of life in patients suffering from acute cardiac attacks, improvement was achieved only in the mental and psychological aspects of quality of life 4&#x02009;months after the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. These findings indicate the effect of cardiac rehabilitation on reducing depression in patients who have undergone CABG.</p><p>We found that two months after intervention, anxiety and depression scores reduced although the reduction was not significant for the anxiety scores between the groups. However, the insignificance could be due to the short duration or our interventional programs. One study on the effect of postoperative cardiac rehabilitation programs on anxiety as well as quality of life of patients after CABG, showed that anxiety levels significantly reduced in the patients, suggesting that longer interventional programs might be more beneficial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>Lie et al. (2007) assessed the effect of intervention at home on anxiety and depression in patients who underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery in a psychoeducative intervention. The rate of depression decreased from 19% before the intervention to 13% after the intervention (5).</p><p>These findings are consistent with the effect of educational interventions in reducing depression in patients who underwent CABG, as found in the present study. Our findings are also consistent with those of Yoshida et al. (2002), who reported physical and psychological improvements after a 4-week period of stage-two cardiac rehabilitation in patients suffering from stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>In contrast, Mohammadi et al. (2007) assessed the effect of home-based cardiac rehabilitation on quality of life in 38 patients suffering from stroke. At base line the participants&#x02019; knowledge about disease management and quality of life were measured. Then the experimental group was instructed by multidisciplinary team about home based cardiac rehabilitation programs. The patients received information and support and guidance through phone calls and home visits. At the end of the three months follow-up, the patients&#x02019; knowledge and quality of life were measured again. She concluded that their intervention was not significant in social dimensions of quality of life and positive effect of home based CRP on QOL wasn&#x02019;t supported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Moreover, in the Birmingham rehabilitation uptake maximization (BRUM) study, in which the researchers compared home-based with center-based cardiac rehabilitation, no significant difference was found between the two types of cardiac rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Considering that our study was center-based, it seems that home or center based interventions might yield similar results.</p><sec><title>Limitation of the study</title><p>Although the mean anxiety was reduced in the intervention group the difference was not statistically significant between the groups. This may be because anxiety is a subjective, dynamic, and multidimentional concept and it&#x02019;s improvement needs a larger sample with a longer period of time especially with the application of a comprehensive rehabilitation program.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this study provide evidence of the benefits of cardiac rehabilitation for depression and anxiety in patients undergoing CABG. We recommend that rehabilitation programs will be established to help prevent depression and anxiety among patients as well as to reduce healthcare costs and increase the patients&#x02019; quality of life. Our findings are potentially useful in planning nursing services for post-cardiac surgery rehabilitation, in nursing education, and in designing interdisciplinary rehabilitation programs.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>FS, the main investigator, coordinated the research and wrote the first draft of the manuscript.
