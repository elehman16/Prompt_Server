Sixty severe nonacute LBP patients (pain duration of at least 3&#x000a0;weeks, Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) &#x02265;5) will be recruited at four Korean medicine hospitals. Participants will be randomly allocated to the <italic>Chuna</italic> group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20), usual care group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20), or <italic>Chuna</italic> plus usual care group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20) for 6&#x000a0;weeks of treatment. Usual care will consist of orally administered conventional medicine, physical therapy, and back pain care education. The trial will be conducted with outcome assessor and statistician blinding. The primary endpoint will be NRS of LBP at week 7 post randomization. Secondary outcomes include NRS of leg pain, the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), the Credibility and Expectancy Questionnaire, lumbar range of motion (ROM), the EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) health survey, the Health Utility Index III (HUI-III), and economic evaluation and safety data. Post-treatment follow-ups will be conducted at 1, 4, and 10&#x000a0;weeks after conclusion of treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will assess the comparative effectiveness of <italic>Chuna</italic> manual therapy compared to conventional usual care.

Therefore, appropriate LBP treatment selection is of considerable importance for individual patients, physicians, and decision-makers of health care policy.</p><p>Spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) is extensively used for acute and chronic LBP, and its efficacy has been reported in numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews (SRs). However, upon closer inspection, the two Cochrane reviews on SMT for acute and chronic LBP mainly use search terms such as manipulation, osteopathy, and chiropractic, and do not include Korean <italic>Chuna</italic> manual therapy or Chinese <italic>Tuina</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Moreover, it can be reasonably inferred that though SMT is widely recommended for both acute and chronic LBP in various guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], the vast disparity in background history, diagnosis and treatment principles and techniques precludes unitary appreciation of treatment effect.</p><p>
<italic>Chuna</italic>, literally meaning manual treatment in Korean, is a Korean spinal manipulation that has developed absorbing aspects of Chinese <italic>Tuina</italic>, chiropractic manipulation, and osteopathic medicine over time. Manipulative therapy can, therefore, be likened to a reservoir rich with academic contributions from various health care disciplines, drawing from, and emptying into, reserves to form a continuous cycle. <italic>Chuna</italic> incorporates radiology-based diagnosis, which is not customary for Chinese SMT, and includes meridian theory, meridian muscle concepts, and organ pattern identification diagnosis not usually seen in chiropractic manipulation or osteopathic medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, a recent study assessing the <italic>Chuna</italic> literature published from 1995 to May 2013 in Korea reported that clinical studies mainly consisted of case series (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;99; 72%), RCTs (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;15; 11%), and non-RCTs (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;21; 16%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. While the proportion of RCTs in <italic>Chuna</italic>-related studies is steadily increasing, most studies take on an integrative approach as opposed to single treatment, and are not well-equipped to rigorously evaluate its therapeutic effect. Also, in quality assessment of RCTs in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], weaknesses regarding identification in title or structured summary in abstract, inadequate trial design description, statistical limitation from small sample size, inaccuracy of randomization and allocation process, difficulty in blinding, and insufficient reporting of participant flow and estimated effect size of interventions and its precision were reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>While <italic>Chuna</italic> manual therapy is primarily used for LBP in Korea with high patient satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], it is currently not covered by national health insurance and thus accessibility due to cost is limited considering its high satisfaction rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare&#x02019;s 2011 report on usage of Korean medicine shows that <italic>Chuna</italic> was one of the most common usages of Korean medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. At the 2011 National Assembly forum for insurance guarantee reinforcement of Korean medicine, increasing national insurance coverage of Korean medicine treatments, such as <italic>Chuna</italic> manual therapy, was proposed with the aim of increasing accessibility to Korean medicine services, promoting national health, and improving quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Therefore, well-designed, high-quality RCTs are highly needed in the research sector to determine the effectiveness and economic value of <italic>Chuna</italic> manual therapy and to meet social demand.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives</title><p>Objective evaluation of the comparative effectiveness, safety, and economic evaluation of <italic>Chuna</italic> manual therapy for application in cost-effective, evidence-based practice are important issues both for the Korean medicine sector and for national health services improvement. High-quality RCTs are warranted for rigorous assessment of <italic>Chuna</italic> effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness. The hypotheses of this study are as follows: (1) <italic>Chuna</italic> manual therapy will be more effective and safer than (or equally safe as) conventional usual care in nonacute LBP patients and (2) concurrent treatment consisting of <italic>Chuna</italic> manual therapy and usual care will be more effective than <italic>Chuna</italic> alone or conventional usual care alone in nonacute LBP patients. Therefore, the objectives of this pCRN (pilot <italic>Chuna</italic> Research Network) study are to investigate the following in nonacute LBP patients: (1) the comparative effectiveness and safety of <italic>Chuna</italic> manual therapy compared to conventional usual care through comparison of pain, functionality, quality of life parameters and adverse events, (2) the effectiveness and safety of a concurrent treatment consisting of <italic>Chuna</italic> manual therapy and usual care, which is reflective of actual clinical practice, through comparison of two single treatment groups of <italic>Chuna</italic> manual therapy and usual care, and a combined treatment group of <italic>Chuna</italic> manual therapy with usual care and (3) costs and effectiveness (utility) data of the three groups for exploratory cost-effectiveness analysis (economic evaluation). However, if the current sample size deters this pilot study from reaching a definite conclusion regarding aims (1), (2), and (3), the main objectives of this preliminary study will be to determine a sample size appropriate for statistical testing in future large-scale studies and to assess the feasibility of a full-scale multicenter trial.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><p>The protocol of this pCRN study is presented in accordance with the 2013 SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) Statement (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for the populated SPIRIT Checklist and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for the trial schedule of enrollment, interventions, and assessments in accordance with recommended SPIRIT figure).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Time points of each assessment index</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th colspan="11">Study period</th></tr><tr><th rowspan="2">Time point</th><th>Enrollment</th><th>Allocation</th><th colspan="6">Active treatment post allocation</th><th colspan="3">Follow-up</th></tr><tr><th>Week &#x02212;1</th><th>Week 0 (Baseline)</th><th>Week 1</th><th>Week 2</th><th>Week 3</th><th>Week 4</th><th>Week 5</th><th>Week 6</th><th>Week 7</th><th>Week 10</th><th>Week 14</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="12">Enrollment</td></tr><tr><td>Eligibility screening</td><td>&#x025cb;</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Written informed consent</td><td>&#x025cb;</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Vital signs</td><td>&#x025cb;</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>&#x025cb;</td><td>&#x025cb;</td><td>&#x025cb;</td></tr><tr><td>Sociodemographic characteristics, medical history (e.g., LBP, medication history)</td><td>&#x025cb;</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Physical examination</td><td>&#x025cb;</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Randomized allocation</td><td/><td>&#x025cb;</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td colspan="12">Interventions</td></tr><tr><td>Treatment in CMT group</td><td/><td/><td colspan="4">&#x02190;2&#x02013;3 times/week &#x02192;</td><td colspan="2">&#x02190;1&#x02013;3 times/week &#x02192;</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Treatment in UC<sup>a</sup> group (times/week)</td><td/><td/><td colspan="4">&#x02190;2&#x02013;3 times/week &#x02192;</td><td colspan="2">&#x02190;1&#x02013;3 times/week &#x02192;</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Treatment in CMT&#x02009;+&#x02009;UC<sup>a</sup> group (times/week)</td><td/><td/><td colspan="4">&#x02190;2&#x02013;3 times/week &#x02192;</td><td colspan="2">&#x02190;1&#x02013;3 times/week &#x02192;</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td colspan="12">Assessments</td></tr><tr><td>Symptoms and change in medicine</td><td/><td>&#x025cb;</td><td/><td>&#x025cb;</td><td>&#x025cb;</td><td>&#x025cb;</td><td>&#x025cb;</td><td>&#x025cb;</td><td>&#x025cb;</td><td>&#x025cb;</td><td/></tr><tr><td>NRS of LBP and leg pain</td><td>&#x025cb;</td><td>&#x025cb;</td><td/><td>&#x025cb;</td><td>&#x025cb;</td><td>&#x025cb;</td><td>&#x025cb;</td><td>&#x025cb;</td><td>&#x025cb;</td><td>&#x025cb;</td><td>&#x025cb;</td></tr><tr><td>ODI</td><td/><td>&#x025cb;</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>&#x025cb;</td><td/><td>&#x025cb;</td><td>&#x025cb;</td><td/></tr><tr><td>PGIC</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>&#x025cb;</td><td/><td>&#x025cb;</td><td>&#x025cb;</td><td/></tr><tr><td>ROM</td><td/><td>&#x025cb;</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>&#x025cb;</td><td/><td>&#x025cb;</td><td>&#x025cb;</td><td/></tr><tr><td>EQ-5D</td><td/><td>&#x025cb;</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>&#x025cb;</td><td/><td>&#x025cb;</td><td>&#x025cb;</td><td>&#x025cb;</td></tr><tr><td>HUI-III</td><td/><td>&#x025cb;</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>&#x025cb;</td><td/><td>&#x025cb;</td><td>&#x025cb;</td><td>&#x025cb;</td></tr><tr><td>Economic evaluation</td><td/><td>&#x025cb;</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>&#x025cb;</td><td/><td>&#x025cb;</td><td>&#x025cb;</td><td>&#x025cb;</td></tr><tr><td>Adverse events</td><td/><td>&#x025cb;</td><td colspan="6">&#x02190; every visit &#x02192;</td><td>&#x025cb;</td><td>&#x025cb;</td><td>&#x025cb;</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>

Functional status will be evaluated using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) questionnaire. The ODI is a 10-item questionnaire developed for the purpose of LBP-related disability assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Each item has a six-level answer choice, and each level correlates with a score of 0&#x02013;5. Higher scores reflect greater disability. The accredited Korean version of the ODI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] will be used. The Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) will be assessed for comprehensive and global assessment of change in LBP and movement limitation due to pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The PGIC discerns subjective impression of change in seven levels ranging from 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;very much improved; 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;much improved; 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;minimally improved; 4&#x02009;=&#x02009;no change; 5&#x02009;=&#x02009;minimally worse; 6&#x02009;=&#x02009;much worse; to 7&#x02009;=&#x02009;very much worse. While the PGIC was initially developed for psychological use, it is currently applied in pain evaluation of various medical fields. The EuroQol-5 dimensions (EQ-5D) health survey is a measurement tool for health-related quality of life and widely used across the health care sector. The range of scores is from &#x02212;1, indicating health considered worse than death to 1, meaning perfect health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The EQ-5D comprises five dimensions or items assessing current health state, which are mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression and graded into three levels (level 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;no problem; level 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;some/moderate problem; and level 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;extreme problem).

Medical cost covers direct expenses incurred by the use of medical facilities and services (official medical cost) and purchase of health foods and medical devices (unofficial medical cost). Nonmedical cost refers to accompanying costs incidental to medical use such as transportation, patient time, and nursing costs. Lost productivity cost represents economic loss from decreased work capability because of the disease itself or premature death due to disease.

Continuous data will be analyzed with a paired <italic>t</italic> test for pre-post within-group difference and with an independent <italic>t</italic> test for group comparison between <italic>Chuna</italic> and usual care if normally distributed, and the Wilcoxon rank sum test if not. For comparing between the three groups of <italic>Chuna</italic> with usual care, <italic>Chuna</italic>, and usual care, if continuous data satisfies the normality test, analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to test between-group difference, and the Kruskal-Wallis test if it does not. <italic>Chuna</italic> with usual care versus <italic>Chuna</italic>, and <italic>Chuna</italic> with usual care versus usual care will be analyzed using Duncan&#x02019;s post-hoc test. Post-hoc analysis of non-normally distributed data will use the Wilcoxon rank sum test with significance level adjusted by the Bonferroni test. Categorical data will be analyzed using the chi-square test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. A paired <italic>t</italic> test will be used in pre-post within-group differences by time point. Secondary analyses will include analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusting for statistically significant between-group differences in baseline outcomes or covariant factors at baseline, and subgroup analyses by LBP disease differentiation (nonspecific LBP, lumbar intervertebral disc herniation, and spinal stenosis), pain duration (subacute, chronic, and hyperchronic), and main site of pain (LBP worse than leg pain, and LBP less than leg pain) to explore the feasibility of a large, multicenter, pragmatic RCT.</p><p>All statistical analysis will use a two-tailed test as a principle, and significance level will be set at 5%.

Various national and international clinical practice guidelines and systematic reviews were consulted in discussion of usual care contents for LBP. While current guidelines indicate the benefits of conservative treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], the evidence for individual conservative treatment methods and opinions on what should constitute standard care of LBP are somewhat inconsistent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Moreover, recent reports state that the effect of acetaminophen, which is recommended for first-line use in LBP guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], is unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Therefore, in this study we opted to use the most frequently used LBP treatments in Korea as opposed to an evidence-based selection. Korea has a unitary government-run national health insurance system which aims to cover the entire South Korean population and all medical institutions. This insurance system reimburses HIRA-approved medical costs for the greater majority of diseases including LBP, and the HIRA database contains extensive information on medication, medical services, and diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. For this study, we extracted the most frequently used treatment types in patients with a main diagnosis code of LBP from the 2011 HIRA national patients&#x02019; sample (NPS) data, and provided this list to usual care providers for reference in patient treatment in an effort to secure validity in usual care treatment selection.</p><p>While the updated Cochrane review on spinal manipulative therapies for chronic LBP covers many study designs similar to the current study comparing spinal manipulation with other treatments, such as usual care, or as an add-on treatment to other treatments, such as usual care alone, evidence for the effect of spinal manipulative therapy is not conclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, as <italic>Chuna</italic> manual therapy and the spinal manipulative therapies included in the Cochrane review hold distinct differences, clinical effects may also be disparate. Meanwhile, a 2013 systematic review of RCTs on <italic>Chuna</italic> published in the Korean <italic>Chuna</italic> literature states that the two RCTs related to LBP both support a significant effect of <italic>Chuna</italic>, but that they are limited by qualitative issues and small sample size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Therefore, it can be inferred from these evaluations that further rigorous clinical studies on <italic>Chuna</italic>, a Korean spinal manipulative therapy, are in order.</p><p>The aim of this pCRN study is to examine the comparative clinical effectiveness of <italic>Chuna</italic>, a Korean spinal manual therapy, through comparison of <italic>Chuna</italic> manual therapy and usual care treatments most frequently used in Korea, and investigate whether the combined treatment of <italic>Chuna</italic> manual therapy and usual care, which is reflective of, and more frequently encountered, than singular treatment of <italic>Chuna</italic> or usual care in real-world clinical practice, is more effective than single treatment. While this pilot study may fail to reach a definite conclusion due to current sample size, it will still hold relevance as one of the first well-designed, rigorous RCTs on <italic>Chuna</italic> manual therapy for nonacute LBP patients, and provide preliminary effectiveness and safety monitoring results for future large-scale, multicenter RCTs.</p><sec id="Sec29"><title>Trial status</title><p>Participant recruitment is anticipated to be from March to August 2016, and study completion to be reported in December 2016.
