S<italic>atiation</italic> occurs within a meal leading to its termination. This state is determined by factors occurring during the period of eating, such as cognitive influences, mouth feel and gastric distension. S<italic>atiety,</italic> on the other hand, arises in between meals. This state is induced by hormonal responses to food components in the stomach and small intestine as well as to absorbed nutrients in the blood stream <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">(2)</xref>. An increase in satiation and satiety per food calorie could help to decrease energy intake and thereby beneficially influence the rapidly growing global public health concern of obesity.</p><p>At a fixed energy level satiation and satiety vary depending on several aspects of the food composition. Most short-term studies comparing the relative impact of protein, carbohydrate and fat have found protein to be the most satiating macronutrient per calorie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>). The satiating capacity among carbohydrate-rich foods varies largely depending primarily on energy density and dietary fibre (DF) content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>). The majority of controlled short-term intervention trials show an association between high DF intake, both soluble and insoluble DF from a wide variety of sources, and increased satiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>).</p><p>A great variation in satiating capacity (2 h after consumption) for various foods among and within food groups has been demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">(11)</xref>. This was done by serving 1,000 kJ portions of a variety of foods to subjects who then rated their appetite every 15 min during 120 min. Appetite ratings depended on a number of factors; satiety was elevated by increased DF content, lowered energy density and increased cooked weight of the food. Among breakfast products, the highest satiety was induced by oat porridge. In order to further evaluate whole grain cereal porridge, we have studied the satiating effect (4 h) of oat versus rye porridge in comparison to wheat bread reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">(12)</xref>. The strong satiating capacity of porridge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">(11)</xref> was confirmed in that oat porridge induced a satiating effect significantly higher than that from wheat bread reference. The results from our study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">(12)</xref> also indicated that porridge made from rye flakes gave an even stronger effect than the oat porridge. The superior satiating properties of rye may have been due to a higher DF content. The main DF constituents of rye are partly soluble arabinoxylans, &#x003b2;-glucans, cellulose and also fructans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">(13)</xref>. Further results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">(11)</xref> showed that pasta made from whole grain provided one of the highest satiety responses among the carbohydrate-rich foods. Although an increased satiety for whole grain porridge and pasta 2 h after consumption was shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">(11)</xref>, the study did not reveal the effect of the foods eaten as complete meals with additional foods, or the effects on satiety beyond 2 h after consumption.</p><p>Whole grain consumption has been suggested to reduce the risk for obesity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">(14)</xref> and related chronic disease such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease as well as for certain cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">(13)</xref>. These health effects are likely to be mediated by DF and several bioactive compounds mainly located in the germ and bran parts of the cereal kernel may contribute.</p><p>The aims of the present study were to investigate subjective appetite and following voluntary energy intake after consumption of whole grain foods for lunch and breakfast, compared to refined grain foods. At breakfast a commercially available Swedish cereal, rye flakes (whole grain), was eaten as porridge. The lunch included pasta made from 100% whole grain wheat flour. The whole grain material used was whole grain as defined by the American Association of Cereal Chemists (AACC): ground or flaked grain containing endosperm, germ and bran in the same proportion as the intact kernel. As reference products we used bread for breakfast and pasta for lunch, both made from refined wheat.</p><sec id="S0002"><title>Subjects and methods</title><sec id="S20003"><title>Subjects</title><p>Criteria for inclusion were the following: age between 20 and 60 years; body mass index (BMI) 20&#x02013;27 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; regular eating habits meaning habit of consuming breakfast, lunch and dinner every day; fasting P-glucose 4&#x02013;6 mmol/l; haemoglobin (Hb) in men 130&#x02013;170, in women 120&#x02013;150 g/l; alaninaminotransferase (ALT) 0.15&#x02013;1.1 &#x000b5;kat/l; thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 0.3&#x02013;4.0 mlE/l; willingness to comply with the study procedures; signed written informed consent and signed written biobank consent.

Each subject spent three weekdays at the clinic (08:00&#x02013;16:30), separated by one week during which they followed their ordinary diet. On each test day they received one of three combinations of the two breakfasts and two lunch meals: the combinations are referred to as A, B or C as described in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">1</xref>. The day prior to the test day subjects were instructed: not to conduct any heavy exercise or drink any alcoholic beverages; to avoid eating and drinking after 20:00 and to eat a similar type and amount of evening meal. Upon arrival at the clinic on the test day shortly before 08:00 the subjects had been fasting for 12 h. The breakfast meal was given at 08:00 and lunch at 12:00. Both meals had to be entirely consumed. Afternoon coffee/tea was served at 14:00 and an <italic>ad libitum</italic> meal at 16:00. Subjective appetite ratings were registered just before breakfast at 08:00 and then repeatedly every half hour between 08:30 and 16:00 and thereafter hourly until bedtime. During the study day the subjects were restricted to sedentary activities but were not allowed to sleep. After leaving the clinic at 16:30 the subjects were instructed not to eat or drink anything until 19:00.

The porridge and the bread were both served with 45 g of apple sauce, 5 g of margarine (40% fat), 200 g of milk (1.5% fat) and a cup of coffee or tea.

Each portion of uncooked pasta was added to a full pot of boiling water and boiled for 12 min (whole grain pasta) or 9 min (refined wheat pasta) before being drained. Both pastas were served with 210 g of tomato sauce and 10 g of parmesan cheese (all additional foods were obtained from a local store). Energy and macronutrient composition of the test foods are given per 100 g in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">1</xref>. The meals were composed so that the test and reference products contributed to about half of the total energy content of the complete meals. The lunch and breakfast were served in two energy levels to meet varying requirements of the subjects (based on BMI and physical activity) and the energy level was standardised for each subject between the three test days. All subjects but two consumed the lower energy level meals that are described in the text and tables. The higher energy level gave an extra 31% of energy. All meals were well balanced regarding energy and macronutrient composition and differed mainly in DF content and cooked weight (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0002">2</xref>). Calculations were made using Dietist XP, version 3.0, Bromma, Sweden.

The main difference in composition of the two breakfast meals was DF content. But also processing (flakes versus flour) and cooking method differed, the porridge being more energy diluted due to higher water content and therefore served in larger portion size in order to provide the same amount of energy as the bread. Particle size of cereal grains have been shown to influence postprandial satiety, glucose and insulin responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">18</xref>). Water incorporated into a food, but not served with a food, decreases energy intake at a directly following meal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0019">(19)</xref>. Furthermore, the early response may have been affected by a difference in palatability. Certainly, the satiating effect of the porridge compared to the bread depends on a combination of these factors.</p><p>The mechanisms underlying the satiating effects were not investigated in the present study. However, the satiating properties of DF have been related to several stages in the physiological processes of short-term appetite regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">(7)</xref>. Those include bulking effects resulting in increased extension of the stomach and, for some viscose DF, delayed gastric empting causing early signals of satiation to increase. Furthermore, pre-absorptive hormonal signalling at the level of the small intestine is essential in the induction and maintenance of satiety. DF that delay absorption of nutrients may therefore lead to prolonged satiety by increasing the time that macronutrients are in contact with the absorptive surfaces. Finally, end products caused by colonic fermentation of DF, such as acetate and propionate, have been proposed to affect satiety. How this effect is mediated is not clear. Suggested mechanisms are stimulated release of satiety hormones: GLP-1, PYY, by L-cells in the colon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">(20)</xref> and through a delay of gastric emptying <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">(21)</xref>. The increased satiety during the afternoon, seen in the present study after a high intake of rye fibre for breakfast, may be explained by colonic events.</p><p>The two lunch meals, whole grain wheat pasta versus refined wheat pasta, did not differ in any of the subjective appetite ratings. These lunch foods had similar cooked weight, appearance and texture and mainly differed in DF content from wheat bran.</p><p>The fact that there was no difference in voluntary food intake at 16.00, in the evening or during the following morning is important to consider. In order for the increase in satiety to contribute to maintenance of energy balance, a spontaneous decrease in voluntary food intake is necessary. When using an <italic>ad libitum</italic> meal as a marker for how a test meal affects following voluntary food intake, the timing of the <italic>ad libitum</italic> meal is central; and the fact that there was no significant difference in hunger at the time of the <italic>ad libitum</italic> meal implies that the meal was planned too late to reflect the differences in hunger that occurred earlier in the day. This study was, however, primarily designed to measure appetite over the course of the day under energy-standardised conditions, which ruled out an earlier <italic>ad libitum</italic> meal. The controlled conditions between 08:00 and 16:00 may have hidden possible effects that rye porridge may provoke in a real life situation, where the availability of food often is unlimited at every hour. One may also speculate that less would be eaten if the rye porridge was served <italic>ad libitum</italic>, due to its relatively low energy density.</p><p>This study has shown that a breakfast based on whole grain rye flakes served as a hot porridge compared to reference wheat bread in a complete breakfast meal gave a significantly increased satiety, subsequent decreased hunger and desire to eat up to 8 h after consumption. However, no effect could be demonstrated on subsequent food intake.</p></sec><sec id="S0005"><title>Conflict of Interest and Funding</title><p>This study was financed by the producer of the test products, Lantm&#x000e4;nnen Food R &#x00026; D, Sweden and conducted by KPL &#x02013; Centre of Human Studies of Foodstuffs, Uppsala, Sweden (now KPL Good Food Practice AB).
