This is because PPI takes many forms, is sometimes only token and is not always reported clearly. This makes it difficult to combine the evidence so that clear conclusions can be reached about the ingredients of successful PPI and what PPI achieves. Previous research that has tried to combine the evidence has led to several guidelines for researchers to use in setting up and reporting PPI.</p><p id="Par2">This paper was written jointly by researchers and PPI contributors as a reflection on our experiences. The aim was to add to the evidence, by giving detail about the use of PPI in a large randomised controlled trial and the effect it had. We were guided by published PPI reporting guidelines. The effects on the trial are shown in a table of changes made because of suggestions from the PPI group. A survey was used to ask PPI contributors and researchers about their experience and effects they had noticed. Three themes were noted: impact on the trial, the effect of involvement on individual researchers and group members, and group environment. The PPI work affected the trial in many ways, including changes to documents used in the trial and advice on qualitative data collection methods and analysis. Individuals reported positive effects, including enjoying being in the group, gaining confidence, and learning how to share views.</p></sec><sec><title>Abstract</title></sec><sec><title><bold>Background</bold></title><p id="Par3">Patient and public involvement (PPI) is believed to enhance health care delivery research, and is widely required in research proposals. Detailed, standardised reporting of PPI is needed so that strategies to implement more than token PPI that achieves impact can be identified, properly evaluated and reproduced. Impact includes effects on the research, PPI contributors and researchers. Using contributor and researcher perspectives and drawing on published guidelines for reporting PPI, we aimed to reflect on our experience and contribute evidence relevant to two important questions: &#x02018;What difference does PPI make?&#x02019; and &#x02018;What&#x02019;s the best way to do it?&#x02019;</p></sec><sec><title><bold>Methods</bold></title><p id="Par4">Fourteen people living with multiple long-term conditions (multimorbidity) were PPI contributors to a randomised controlled trial to improve care for people with multimorbidity. Meetings took place approximately four times a year throughout the trial, beginning at grant application stage. Meeting notes were recorded and a log of PPI involvement was kept. At the end of the trial, seven PPI contributors and four researchers completed free-text questionnaires about their experience of PPI involvement and their perception of PPI impact. The responses were analysed thematically by two PPI contributors and one researcher. The PPI group proposed writing this report, which was co-authored by three PPI contributors and two researchers.</p></sec><sec><title><bold>Results</bold></title><p id="Par5">Meeting attendance averaged nine PPI contributors and three to four researchers. The involvement log and meeting notes recorded a wide range of activities and impact including changes to participant documentation, advice on qualitative data collection, contribution to data analysis and dissemination advice. Three themes were identified from the questionnaires: impact on the study, including keeping the research grounded in patient experience; impact on individuals, including learning from group diversity and feeling valued; and an environment that facilitated participation. The size of the group influenced impact. Researchers and PPI contributors described a rewarding interaction that benefitted them and the research.</p></sec><sec><title><bold>Conclusions</bold></title><p id="Par6">PPI was wide-ranging and had impact on the trial, contributors and researchers. The group environment facilitated involvement. Feedback and group interactions benefitted individuals. The insights gained from this study will postitively influence the researchers&#x02019; and contributors&#x02019; future involvement with PPI.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Patient public involvement</kwd><kwd>Qualitative</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001881</institution-id><institution>Service Delivery and Organisation Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12/130/15</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par11">It is generally accepted that patient and public involvement (PPI) enhances the value of health care delivery research by making it more relevant to the targeted patient group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Consequently, PPI is now required in all health care research undertaken for funders such as the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, this may lead to tokenism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and several reviews of PPI have concluded that evidence of impact is weak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A better evidence base is needed to substantiate claims of benefit and to evaluate impact and cost-effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This would also facilitate learning about how to achieve effective PPI and what key factors operate when it does have impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Achieving a robust evidence base requires more comprehensive, structured reporting of PPI in individual studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Many suggestions have been made about what should be included in planning and reporting PPI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and some detailed tools have recently become available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Some argue that the complexity of PPI makes it difficult to assess its impact on research beyond documenting contributions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Others have noted that the impact on individuals, both contributors and researchers, should not be overlooked [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Attempts have been made to categorise PPI activity to aid reporting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and to design a structured set of questions to plan and prompt reflection on PPI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Some consensus has developed about what leads to successful PPI in a research study, including planning how to incorporate PPI, initiating PPI from the outset and good relationships between researchers and PPI contributors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Reports of PPI should include contextual details, because the mechanisms for successful PPI will vary with the type of study, PPI aims, resources available and what values are held by researchers, particularly the Chief Investigator, regarding PPI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">This paper describes the PPI processes within a randomised controlled trial (RCT) setting and analyses the perceptions of both PPI contributors and researchers regarding the process and impact of the PPI and the challenges they experienced. This addresses a relative gap in the literature as reports of PPI from both researcher and contributor prespectives are under-represented, as are reports of PPI in RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Following Crocker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and Dudley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], we have used the term &#x02018;PPI contributor&#x02019; to refer to the members of the PPI group, as they were not co-applicants in the research proposal or co-researchers in carrying out the research. Instead they were consulted and actively contributed their ideas to help shape how the research was carried out.</p><p id="Par14">The paper was initiated by the PPI group towards the end of the trial, who wished to record their contribution to the trial and their experience. We aimed to create a PPI report that included recommended detail on context, process and impact to add to the evidence base and which would facilitate evidence synthesis by conforming to published reporting guidelines as far as possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Thus, the main aim of this paper is to contribute evidence towards understanding how and in what circumstances PPI makes a difference. We also aimed to provide an example of how researchers and contributors with little experience of PPI succeeded in overcoming tokenism, achieved meaningful collaboration and experienced individual impact. We hope that this will be encouraging and informative to other researchers in a similar position.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Description of trial</title><p id="Par15">The PPI group contributed to a large cluster RCT (The 3D Study; ISRCTN06180958) that took place in 33 general practices in three areas of the UK. The aim of the RCT was to improve the care of people with a wide range of multiple long-term conditions (multimorbidity) by addressing patient-reported generic deficiencies in their care and issues that negatively impacted their quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The intervention aimed to enhance continuity of care and establish a more patient-centred approach to reviewing patients with multimorbidity by eliciting patients&#x02019; own agendas, reviewing all conditions together and agreeing shared action plans to address issues. Full details are available in the protocol paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The trial design included an economic evaluation to examine cost-effectiveness and a process evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] to explore participants&#x02019; response and how and why the intervention was implemented or not. The intervention ran over 15&#x000a0;months and involved 1546 patients, 797 of whom were in the 16 intervention group practices. The trial funding began in March 2014 and concluded in September 2017. The funding proposal took over a year to develop prior to the start of the trial and included PPI funding of &#x000a3;13,612 plus 5% FTE of one researcher to co-ordinate the PPI, representing approx. 1.1% of the total cost.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aim of PPI</title><p id="Par16">The aim of the PPI was to ensure maximum relevance of the trial intervention to people with multimorbidity, to enhance response to recruitment and follow-up, to help interpret results and to gain assistance with dissemination to interested groups and individuals. Plans for PPI described in the proposal specified meeting 4 times a year to advise on patient information leaflets, questionnaire design, ethical issues, recruitment approaches, dissemination of results, and impact. We also stated the intention to identify two members of the group willing to sit on the Trial Steering Committee and the Trial Advisory Group and another member to contribute to the qualitative data analysis. The PPI group was named the Patient Involvement in Primary Care Research (PIP-CaRe) group to give it an identity and to reflect a wider aim of it being a resource that researchers developing new primary care research ideas could use.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par17">During proposal development, PPI co-ordination and facilitation was delegated to a named co-applicant (CM). An open meeting to discuss the research proposal was advertised with relevant patient groups and local PPI facilitators. Four people responded to the first invitation. There were no formal selection procedures beyond the criterion of living with multimorbidity as a patient or carer. Recruitment continued until, in December 2013 just prior to the start of the research programme, an introductory meeting was set up with fourteen PPI contributors. Two had prior experience of PPI and two were co-ordinators of voluntary patient groups. The PPI co-ordinator had minimal previous exposure to PPI and no previous experience of facilitating PPI groups but had prior training in group facilitation. After becoming co-ordinator she attended two one-day courses on PPI in research that drew attention to important facilitation considerations such as the group&#x02019;s needs and different motivations.</p><p id="Par18">Eleven PPI contributors remained in the PIP-CaRe group after a year, of whom 3 were male. The age range was approximately 45&#x02013;85 and contributors had a variety of long-term conditions. They all continued to attend meetings throughout the trial, averaging nine PPI contributors at every meeting. Following the introductory meeting, the group met four times in 2014, three times in 2015, and four times in 2016 and 2017. Between meetings, PIP-CaRe members were often asked for their opinions by email. They were compensated for their time at the rate of &#x000a3;12 per hour for meetings, preparation work, and for additional work or reading undertaken between meetings. These payments were made in vouchers and payments for travel expenses were in cash. Meetings were board-room style on university premises with lunch provided. Diet, mobility, sight and hearing needs were accommodated where possible with alternative food options, access on the level or by lift, large font for meeting papers and rooms with good acoustics. Two other members of the lead site research team also attended meetings regularly; the trial manager (MM) and the main trial researcher. The Chief Investigator of the trial was supportive of PPI and attended approximately one third of meetings. Occasionally other researchers attended for a specific purpose, such as development of a new patient-reported measure used in the trial. In the first year, the PPI co-ordinator provided half a day&#x02019;s training in trial methodology to PIP-CaRe members. They were also encouraged to attend free training at a local PPI hub. Nine members attended the trial methods training and five attended the local PPI training. One year into the trial, one member left the group following unresolved conflict with the PPI co-ordinator when differing participation requirements within the group became incompatible. Following this, the functioning of PIP-CaRe was appraised and members were asked by questionnaire about their needs in attending the group. This resulted in some adjustments to the physical environment. The group discussed whether they were happy with how PIP-CaRe was chaired and facilitated and chose not to make any changes.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data</title><p id="Par19">Throughout the trial, a log was kept of all PPI activity and contributions. Detailed notes of PIP-CaRe meetings were written up by the PPI co-ordinator immediately after the meeting and circulated to all attending researchers to check accuracy. Within a week of the meeting, the notes were sent to the whole group, who were also asked to amend anything they felt to be inaccurate. Those who had not attended were also sent a copy so that they remained informed.</p><p id="Par20">Towards the end of the 3D Study both PPI contributors and researchers were invited to comment on their experience of working with the PPI group. A questionnaire, developed with input from PIP-CaRe, was provided to group members and to researchers. The purpose was to prompt reflection on both process and impact and enable all involved to relate their experiences in general terms, whilst providing specific examples where they wished. Both questionnaires are shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The PPI co-ordinator did not complete the questionnaire but her reflections are included in the discussion.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>PPI contributor and researcher questionnaires</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>PPI contributor questions</th><th>Researcher questions</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Why do you think it is important that the group was involved?</td><td>Why do/did you think it is important that the group was involved?</td></tr><tr><td/><td>What do/did you see as the group&#x02019;s purpose in the study?</td></tr><tr><td>What do you think has been the most important contribution made by:<break/> a.

Only those who did not send any response to the invitation were reminded.<break/>The group later highlighted concerns that patients might have about their questionnaire responses being seen by their health care team.

Material elements included having a suitable place to meet and adequate funding. All these factors support successful PPI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">Our PPI process was broadly consistent with previous recommendations about PPI implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], although only the INVOLVE guidelines were consulted at the trial outset. Our appraisal covers many of the questions raised in the PiiAF framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and maps well to the standard operating procedure (SOP) developed by Evans et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] in timeframe, planning, resourcing, PPI co-ordinator role, support from the Chief Investigator and involvement of the PPI group at all stages of the trial. Our experience also aligns with the findings of the RAPPORT study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], which identifies six conditions most influential in establishing effective PPI. Four of these were evident in our study: a research team positive about PPI, a key individual to co-ordinate, ensuring diversity, and relationships that are established and maintained over time. The other two conditions, a shared understanding of moral and methodological purposes of PPI and proactive and systematic evaluation of PPI were at least partially met in our work.</p><p id="Par55">In line with recommendations, we have reported on all aspects of the PPI process we undertook, largely complying with the reporting recommendations in GRIPP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The GRIPP2 short form was insufficient for our purposes but our report does not entirely comply with the GRIPP2 longform either, since it was a retrospective appraisal and was not conceived as a research study of PPI in its own right. Therefore, we have not explicitly used either, although much of what we report maps to those checklists.</p><p id="Par56">Our findings echo others&#x02019; experience that building good relationships can be challenging, requiring flexibility, clarity of expectations, and skilful facilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The incidence of significant conflict that led to one PPI contributor leaving the group highlighted the importance of clarifying needs and expectations at the outset. If this had been done, a compromise might have been negotiated that reconciled the different requirements individuals had to be able to participate.</p><p id="Par57">Initially, the PPI co-ordinator felt there was an academic divide, with researchers sometimes seeming to defend against the PPI contributors&#x02019; comments, although this was a perception not necessarily shared by the PPI contributors. Tension can occur over who has control of the research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and in this case may have resulted from a perception that PPI contributors wanted more influence over the research than researchers felt they could give. Later, slight tension arose because some members of the PPI group were interested in the impact of the intervention on individuals&#x02019; behaviour, whereas the trial design only allowed for generalisable results. Some members of the group would have liked more say in which outcomes were measured, and were frustrated in this by not being involved until the trial was fully designed. However, they did significantly contribute to development of a measure of treatment burden that was used in the trial. Ultimately, contributors&#x02019; wish to know more about intervention impact on individual patients was largely satisfied by sharing and inviting comment on anonymised data from the process evaluation. These qualitative data explored participants&#x02019; perceptions of the intervention.</p><p id="Par58">Researchers had their own perception of what they wanted from the PPI group, which did not necessarily coincide with PPI contributors&#x02019; interests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Another possible factor was that PPI contributors had divergent expectations and motivations that differed depending partly on the amount of PPI experience they had [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, the PPI co-ordinator perceived that as the relationships between the researchers and the PPI contributors evolved, mutual trust deepened, which was evident in increased openness in communication. Researchers seemed to relax and perceive greater potential for the PPI group to contribute to the trial. PPI contributors seemed to gain confidence and freedom to challenge which led to an enhanced sense of making a difference and a strong sense of ownership towards the trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par59">Ultimately, both PPI contributors and researchers experienced personal benefits and satisfaction from their involvement and felt that challenge and difference produced constructive outcomes. PPI contributors engaged well with the research process and found the technical, clinical and procedural aspects of it interesting. The Chief Investigator, although already supportive of PPI, had not previously experienced such a high level of engagement, perhaps leading to revised expectations of PPI in future research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Although there were some tensions, the expectations of researchers and PPI contributors regarding the research were sufficiently aligned to avoid the situation of &#x02018;colliding worlds&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The research team&#x02019;s regular feedback on the impact of PPI contributors&#x02019; input was noted and valued, helping to maintain motivation and engagement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par60">Since the relationships that develop between researchers and PPI contributors are pivotal to the success of PPI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], the quality of the relationships may perhaps be used as an additional indicator of success, alongside the impact on the trial and those taking part. In line with other research, one PPI contributor suggested that the designated coordinator was key to constructive interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The co-ordinator should be experienced in the potential challenges of PPI, including power and control issues, and the consequences of PPI contributors lacking knowledge of research processes, terminology, and ethical constraints. In addition, the PPI co-ordinator should be sufficiently aware of the needs of the PPI group itself.</p><p id="Par61">Despite some challenges, the diversity of PIP-CaRe group members was clearly perceived to be a strength in our study, because of their range of experience. This included prior research experience as there were both research-na&#x000ef;ve and experienced PPI contributors in the group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Although the research-na&#x000ef;ve contributors sometimes required lengthy explanations and made suggestions incompatible with research design and ethics constraints, they also asked thought-provoking questions. They used their own experience to provide a very real patient perspective, reminding researchers of the potential real-life impact of the research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Experienced contributors, with greater understanding of research, seemed more confident to comment about and challenge the research design. These observations are reflected in the debate about whether previous PPI experience is desirable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and linked to the question about the extent to which PPI contributors should be representative of the population on which the research is being carried out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It is usually not feasible to achieve representativeness in PPI recruitment which relies on people volunteering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Some may feel this is a flaw in PPI work, as did one researcher in our study with respect to literacy, but contributors may need to possess different characteristics from research partipicants, such as a certain level of literacy so that they can contribute. However, PPI contributors and research participants do need to share some characteristics, principally personal experience of the condition being researched.</p><p id="Par62">Another strength of this study is that we have included diverse evidence of impact. The activity log provides evidence for impact on the trial, and the researchers&#x02019; and PPI contributors&#x02019; perspectives demonstrate impact on the experiential knowledge of both; knowledge that is gained through the interaction of individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, whether the impacts on the trial translated into a difference in trial outcomes by influencing intervention implementation is not possible to determine. The group strongly supported early involvement and felt they might have had more impact if they could have contributed more to the actual research design including outcome measures, which echoes recommendations made by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Although two PPI contributors sat on the trial steering committee and advisory group, the sense of co-ownership of the research and impact might have been strengthened if there had been a co-applicant from the target patient group involved from the very beginning of the trial design.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par63">Our PPI was wide-ranging, contributed to every stage of the trial and demonstrably had impact on trial processes. Both researchers and PPI contributors had a positive experience which will influence future PPI involvement. From this, we conclude that the PPI was successful. In fully reporting the PPI in the 3D study we have contributed to the evidence base regarding both &#x02018;What difference does PPI make?&#x02019; and &#x02018;What&#x02019;s the best way to do it?&#x02019;.
