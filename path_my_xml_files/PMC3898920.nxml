Rifabutin has been proposed as an alternative rifamycin, but there is concern that the current recommended dose is suboptimal. The principal aim of this study was to compare bioavailability of two doses of rifabutin (150 mg three times per week and 150 mg daily) in patients with HIV-associated tuberculosis who initiated lopinavir/ritonavir-based antiretroviral therapy in Vietnam. Concentrations of lopinavir/ritonavir were also measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This was a randomized, open-label, multi-dose, two-arm, cross-over trial, conducted in Vietnamese adults with HIV-associated tuberculosis in Ho Chi Minh City (Clinical trial registry number NCT00651066). Rifabutin pharmacokinetics were evaluated before and after the introduction of lopinavir/ritonavir -based antiretroviral therapy using patient randomization lists. Serial rifabutin and 25-O-desacetyl rifabutin concentrations were measured during a dose interval after 2 weeks of rifabutin 300 mg daily, after 3 weeks of rifabutin 150 mg daily with lopinavir/ritonavir and after 3 weeks of rifabutin 150 mg three times per week with lopinavir/ritonavir.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Sixteen and seventeen patients were respectively randomized to the two arms, and pharmacokinetic analysis carried out in 12 and 13 respectively. Rifabutin 150 mg daily with lopinavir/ritonavir was associated with a 32% mean increase in rifabutin average steady state concentration compared with rifabutin 300 mg alone. In contrast, the rifabutin average steady state concentration decreased by 44% when rifabutin was given at 150 mg three times per week with lopinavir/ritonavir. With both dosing regimens, 2 &#x02013; 5 fold increases of the 25-O-desacetyl- rifabutin metabolite were observed when rifabutin was given with lopinavir/ritonavir compared with rifabutin alone. The different doses of rifabutin had no significant effect on lopinavir/ritonavir plasma concentrations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Based on these findings, rifabutin 150 mg daily may be preferred when co-administered with lopinavir/ritonavir in patients with HIV-associated tuberculosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00651066?term=ANRS12150B&#x00026;rank=1">NCT00651066</ext-link>

The most recent data show that 97% of adults and children on antiretroviral therapy are taking a first-line regimen, in general consisting of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and one non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor <xref rid="pone.0084866-World2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The remainder is on a second-line regimen, usually consisting of a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone and a protease inhibitor. The low number of patients on second-line treatment reflects the poor availability of viral load monitoring during antiretroviral therapy in resource-limited countries, and thus a limited ability to correctly diagnose treatment failure and switch patients accordingly to more effective therapy. With the development of point-of-care tests for viral load under the World Health Organization (WHO) new Treatment 2.0 initiative <xref rid="pone.0084866-UNAIDS2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, and recommendations from the WHO that 12-monthly viral load monitoring should become the norm for monitoring antiretroviral therapy <xref rid="pone.0084866-World3" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, it is likely that increasing numbers of patients will be identified with treatment failure and will need switching to a second-line regimen with a protease inhibitor. While this is a welcome move, this change will have implications for the care and treatment of patients with HIV-associated tuberculosis.</p><p>Observational studies have clearly shown that antiretroviral therapy improves the prognosis of patients with HIV-associated tuberculosis <xref rid="pone.0084866-Harries1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, and clinical trials have also established the importance of early initiation of antiretroviral therapy in reducing early mortality <xref rid="pone.0084866-Blanc1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0084866-Havlir1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0084866-Karim1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. While first-line antiretroviral therapy using efavirenz is safe and effective when combined with rifampicin-based anti-tuberculosis treatment <xref rid="pone.0084866-World4" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, there are challenges when it comes to using second-line regimens. The combination of rifampicin and protease inhibitors is problematic because rifampicin significantly reduces the bioavailability of all known protease inhibitors by 75% to 95% by induction of cytochrome 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzymes <xref rid="pone.0084866-Loeliger1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Attempts to overcome this adverse drug-drug interaction by either increasing the dose of the protease inhibitor or altering the dose of rifampicin have been thwarted by hepatotoxicity and other problems with tolerance <xref rid="pone.0084866-Burman1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, and such approaches are anyway incompatible with large-scale and decentralised public sector roll-out of ART.</p><p>Rifabutin is an attractive alternative to rifampicin as it is a less potent inducer of CYP3A4 <xref rid="pone.0084866-Baciewicz1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, and the drug can safely be combined with ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors without protease inhibitor dose adjustment. Rifabutin is recommended at a standard dose of 300 mg daily for the prophylaxis and treatment of <italic>Mycobacterium avium</italic> complex and for the treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis. Plasma concentrations of rifabutin are increased in the presence of protease inhibitors <xref rid="pone.0084866-Loeliger1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, and therefore dose adjustments are recommended. Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC, Atlanta, USA) recommended in 1998 that the dose of rifabutin be reduced from 300 mg to 150 mg in the presence of a protease inhibitor <xref rid="pone.0084866-Centres1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, and the guidelines further recommended in 2004 that the dose be reduced to 150 mg three times a week (TPW) when used in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) <xref rid="pone.0084866-Centres2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. However, two recent reports have suggested that rifabutin given at a dose of 150 mg TPW in combination with LPV/r in patients with HIV-positive tuberculosis may result in inadequate rifamycin levels <xref rid="pone.0084866-Boulanger1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0084866-Khachi1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Case reports of tuberculosis relapse in patients administered rifabutin 150 mg TPW with LPV/r <xref rid="pone.0084866-JennyAvital1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and further data showing that low rifamycin concentrations are associated with acquired rifamycin resistance in patients taking intermittent doses of rifabutin <xref rid="pone.0084866-Weiner1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> all add to concerns that rifabutin given intermittently with protease inhibitor-based antiretroviral therapy is sub-optimal.</p><p>The present study was therefore undertaken with the primary objective of comparing the pharmacokinetic parameters of two doses of rifabutin (150 mg TPW and 150 mg daily) in patients with HIV-associated tuberculosis in Vietnam who initiated antiretroviral therapy with LPV/r. Secondary objectives were to investigate (i) the pharmacokinetics of LPV/r in combination with RBT, and (ii) the safety and toxicity of rifabutin in combination with antiretroviral therapy during the initial phase of anti-TB treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084866.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0084866.s002">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and Ethical Review committee at Pham Ngoc Thach Hospital, the Health Department of Ho Chi Minh City and the Ministry of Health, Vietnam, as well as the Union Ethics Advisory Group of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, Paris, France.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study design</title><p>This study was a randomized, open-label, multi-dose, two-arm, cross-over trial, conducted in Vietnamese patients with HIV-associated tuberculosis - Clinical trial registry number: NCT00651066.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study setting</title><p>The study was carried out in Pham Ngoc Thac Hospital, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam, a tertiary care facility that has 800 beds and cares for TB patients, about 10% of whom have associated HIV-infection.

At enrolment into the trial, patients were started on rifabutin 300 mg once a day (OD), in combination with standard doses of isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol. After two weeks (representing the first 2 weeks of the initial phase of treatment) the first pharmacokinetic study (PK1) was done. Patients were continued on the same anti-tuberculosis treatment and at two weeks from the start of anti-tuberculosis treatment were started on antiretroviral therapy with stavudine-lamivudine-lopinavir/ritonavir (d4T/3TC/LPV/r &#x02013; standard doses of stavudine 30 mg/lamivudine 150 mg/lopinavir/ritonavir 400 mg/100 mg &#x02013; taken twice daily) and randomized to one of two arms:- Arm A&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; Rifabutin 150 mg TPW or Arm B&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; Rifabutin 150 mg OD.

Patients remained on these doses along with isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol and antiretroviral therapy for a further three weeks and the third PK study (PK3) done. After PK3, the patients stopped rifabutin and started the continuation phase of anti-tuberculosis treatment with rifampicin and isoniazid under the care of the National Tuberculosis Program. They were also referred to the National AIDS Program to be treated according to standard care with stavudine/lamivudine/efavirenz.

Subsequent bloods were drawn at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h (in the case of intermittent RBT dosing) after drug ingestion. The samples were placed on ice immediately and centrifuged at 3000 rpm at 4&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes within 30 minutes of collection. Separated plasma was transferred to polypropylene tubes and stored immediately at -70&#x000b0;C until analysis. The drug assays for RBT and its metabolite (25-O-desacetylrifabutin) as well as lopinavir and ritonavir are described in the following section <xref rid="pone.0084866-Taburet1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><sec id="s2h1"><title>Drug analyses for rifabutin, 25-O-desacetylrifabutin, lopinavir and ritonavir</title><p>Rifabutin and 25-O-desacetylrifabutin were analyzed simultaneously with a validated HPLC assay. Rifabutin and 25-O-desacetylrifabutin standards were kindly provided by Pfizer. In brief, after addition of medazepam as internal standard both chemicals were extracted from 0.2 mL of plasma with a hexane/dichloromethane solution (6/4 v/v). After vortex and centrifugation, the organic phase was evaporated to dryness. Dry residue was reconstituted with 100 &#x000b5;L of mobile phase constituted of [Phosphate mono potassic dihydrogen solution 0.05 M, pH&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3,85]/acetonitrile: 600/400 (v/v). 50 &#x000b5;L is injected onto the Eclipse XDB RP-C18, 150&#x000d7;4, 6 mm, 5 &#x000b5;m &#x02013; Agilent column. The spectrophotometer for UV detection was set at 272 nm. Lower limits of detection were 12.5 ng/mL and 6.25 ng/mL for rifabutin and desacetyl rifabutin respectively. Linearity of standard curves was demonstrated up to 500 ng/mL and 250 ng/mL for rifabutin and desacetyl rifabutin respectively. Variability of day to day quality controls inserted in each analytical run was lower than 9% for median and high concentrations and lower than 15% for low concentrations.

The peak concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), and time to C<sub>max</sub> (T<sub>max</sub>) were obtained directly from the concentration-time profiles. Drug concentrations at the end of a dosing interval were reported as C<sub>min</sub> and pre-dose concentrations on the day of pharmacokinetic evaluation reported as C<sub>0</sub>. The steady-state AUC (AUC&#x003c4;) during a dosing interval &#x003c4; 24 hours or 48 hours for rifabutin and 12 hours for lopinavir/ritonavir were calculated for each drug by the linear up/log down trapezoidal method. As an index of exposure during a dosing interval, the average concentration at steady state (Cave) was calculated for rifabutin and its metabolite as Cave&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;AUC&#x003c4;/&#x003c4; where &#x003c4; is the dosing interval. The metabolite ratio was calculated as the ratio of metabolite to parent drug AUCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Analysis and statistics</title><p>The steady state pharmacokinetics of rifabutin and 25-O-desacetylrifabutin were determined at each of the three pharmacokinetic evaluations and the pharmacokinetics of lopinavir were determined after the second and third pharmacokinetic evaluations. In order to identify an effect of sequence randomization on the pharmacokinetic measures, a linear mixed effects regression model using baseline dose considered as reference (rifabutin 300 mg daily) as a covariate was applied. As no sequence or day effect was found, the drug groups were pooled and dose levels were compared. Rifabutin parameters for assessing the interaction when combined with LPV/r were Cmax, C0, and Cave. These parameters were logarithmically (log) transformed and a linear mixed model fit was used which included treatment, period and sequence as fixed effects and the patient as a random effect. Ninety percent confidence intervals (90% CIs) for the difference in mean log-transformed (log) PK parameters for a particular rifabutin combination therapy (150 mg OD or 150 mg TPW) compared to rifabutin monotherapy (300 mg OD) were calculated. These differences in mean log PK parameters and 90% CIs were back transformed and presented in their original units as geometric means and 90% CIs. The geometric mean ratio presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0084866-t001">
<bold>Table 1</bold>
</xref> can be interpreted as a relative change (either fold or percentage) in geometric mean PK parameters for a particular combination therapy compared to rifabutin monotherapy The rifabutin regimen combined with LPV/r was deemed equivalent to rifabutin alone when the 90% CI for the ratio fell within the equivalence interval of 0.80% to 1.25%. Baseline and final viral loads and CD4<sup>+</sup> counts were compared using t-tests.

When rifabutin 150 mg OD was combined with lopinavir/ritonavir, Cmax was only slightly lower than when rifabutin was administered alone, and a 2 to 3-fold increase in trough concentrations was observed. With the TPW dosing, a 35% decrease in Cmax was observed although pre-dose concentrations were close to meeting equivalence with rifabutin monotherapy. Assuming that the average concentration at steady state (Cave) represents plasma exposure, the two tested rifabutin dosing regimens combined with lopinavir/ritonavir failed to show bioequivalence. Only rifabutin at 150 mg OD with LPV/r led to a significantly 32% higher rifabutin Cave compared with when it was administered alone. Rifabutin Cave reached after the TPW regimen was lower compared with rifabutin alone. A large increase in 25-O desacetyl rifabutin concentrations was observed when rifabutin was co-administered with lopinavir/ritonavir.

The main findings were that peak concentrations (C<sub>max</sub>) and the area under the curve (AUC&#x003c4;) of the drugs were in the same range, regardless of the dose used. There was a significant and almost one third higher average concentration at steady state of rifabutin when used with LPV/r at a dose of 150 mg daily compared with 300 mg alone. The intermittent dosing of rifabutin co-administered with LPV/r led to a lower average concentration compared with 300 mg alone, although pre-dose concentrations remained in the same range. The different doses of rifabutin had no significant effect on the concentrations of lopinavir or ritonavir. Although there were a large number of recorded adverse effects, these were largely low grade and mainly related to an increase in serum liver enzyme levels. Of the 24 patients who completed the pharmacokinetic studies and who completed six months of anti-tuberculosis treatment, over 90% had negative <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> cultures, all but two patients had a measurable increase in CD4 cell counts and over 70% of patients had undetectable viral loads.</p><p>There have been previous studies assessing the pharmacokinetic interaction of rifabutin with ritonavir-boosted HIV protease inhibitors (fosamprenavir, darunavir, atazanavir and saquinavir <xref rid="pone.0084866-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0084866-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0084866-Sekar1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0084866-Ford1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. All these studies were conducted in healthy volunteers with various rifabutin dosing regimens, 150 mg or 300 mg OD when rifabutin was administered alone and 150 mg once every other day, twice weekly or every 3 days when combined with a protease inhibitor. All these studies showed that when the rifabutin dose was reduced in the presence of a potent drug metabolizing enzyme inhibitor (namely a protease inhibitor) this led to unchanged or moderate increases in rifabutin concentrations and a large increase in rifabutin metabolite concentrations. Interestingly, the steady state concentrations seen with the daily dose of rifabutin in the absence of antiretroviral therapy were in the same range as or somewhat lower than those described in our Vietnamese population <xref rid="pone.0084866-Sekar1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0084866-Ford1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. There have not been previous published studies assessing these drug-drug interactions when using the tablet formulation of LPV/r (Aluvia), which is now the most widely used protease inhibitor formulation in global HIV programs due to its heat stable properties <xref rid="pone.0084866-Taburet1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>A different version of the current study was carried out in South Africa from 2008 to 2010, in which the start of antiretroviral therapy was at 10 weeks after the start of anti-tuberculosis treatment when the patient was in the continuation phase on rifabutin and isoniazid <xref rid="pone.0084866-Naiker1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In the South African study, it was found that the peak concentrations of rifabutin were significantly reduced in patients taking rifabutin three times a week, and, furthermore, over 85% of patients on the intermittent dose had areas under the curve less than 4.5 &#x000b5;g.h/mL, levels which have previously been associated with acquired rifamycin resistance. Interestingly, rifabutin concentrations were higher in our Vietnamese population, and only one patient had a Cmax less than 0.3 &#x000b5;g/mL on the 150 mg TPW regimen. The AUC&#x003c4; of rifabutin during the dosing interval were higher than those measured in the South African population (median levels for the 300 mg OD dose were 5640 ng.h/mL in Vietnam compared with 3053 ng.h/mL in South Africa). These differences may be due to ethnic differences or other differences in the two populations &#x02013; for example, the median body mass index was 18 in Vietnam and 23 in South Africa. In both Vietnam and South Africa, LPV/r led to a significant increase in rifabutin concentrations with the 150 mg OD regimen and a decrease in rifabutin concentrations with the 150 mg TPW regimen. As a consequence of higher rifabutin concentrations in Vietnam, only one patient had an AUC&#x003c4;less than 4.5 &#x000b5;g.h/mL on the 150 mg OD regimen compared with four on the 150 mg TPW and six with the 300 mg OD regimen.</p><p>Although the study was not designed to compare lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations on and off anti-tuberculosis treatment, trough lopinavir concentrations were higher than those observed in previous studies <xref rid="pone.0084866-Taburet1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. There have been reports for example of increased lopinavir concentrations on rifabutin which have decreased once rifabutin was discontinued <xref rid="pone.0084866-Matteelli1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Importantly in our study, the findings showed that lopinavir/ritonavir concentrations were not reduced during rifabutin therapy.</p><p>It was initially planned that the same study design run in South Africa would be implemented in Vietnam. However, for various reasons implementation of the Vietnam study was delayed, and by the time patients were being recruited, the WHO had released their 2010 Guidelines for ART, recommending that antiretroviral therapy should start between 2 &#x02013; 8 weeks after the start of anti-tuberculosis treatment <xref rid="pone.0084866-World5" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Investigators in the Vietnam study felt that the Vietnam study protocol starting antiretroviral therapy at 10 weeks was in conflict with recommended international best practice <xref rid="pone.0084866-Lan1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The trial was stopped and an amended study protocol with patients starting antiretroviral therapy two weeks after start of anti-tuberculosis treatment as presented in this paper was developed and implemented instead.</p><p>Although we were only able to study the effect of rifabutin with LPV/r in the intensive phase of anti-tuberculosis treatment, we continued with the cross-over design to ensure that if there was any sequence effect of the different rifabutin doses on pharmacokinetic measures this would be identified. In the event, no sequence or day effect was found, and the drug groups could therefore be pooled and dose levels compared. There is still controversy over whether Cmax or AUC&#x003c4; is the best pharmacodynamic measure for rifamycins in general. Some studies on guinea pigs have found Cmax to be the critical pharmacokinetic parameter <xref rid="pone.0084866-Mitchison1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0084866-Verbist1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, while other studies on mice and using hollow fibers have found that AUC&#x003c4; is a superior parameter <xref rid="pone.0084866-Jayaram1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0084866-Gumbo1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. For these reasons, both parameters were measured and reported on in this study, showing that rifabutin and 25-O-desacetylrifabutin levels were higher using the daily dose with LPV/r than without, and with the average concentration at a steady state being one third higher using 150 mg daily and 40% lower using 150 mg TPW compared with rifabutin alone. A limitation of this study is that we cannot provide answers about the toxicity or efficacy of single dose rifabutin, and a more formal clinical trial is warranted to determine whether daily rifabutin with an increase in rifabutin concentrations is associated with improved efficacy and acceptable adverse effects.</p><p>In conclusion, this study supports the use of rifabutin given at a dose of 150 mg once daily when combined with LPV/r based antiretroviral therapy, at least in patients with a low body mass index. It is not possible to generalize the results of this study to other ethnic groups outside of South-East Asia who may differ in their body mass index and in the way in which they metabolize drugs. The WHO Guidelines for the treatment of HIV-associated tuberculosis <xref rid="pone.0084866-World4" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> recommend that treatment is given daily throughout the intensive and continuation phases of anti-tuberculosis treatment. Giving rifabutin as a daily dose is in line with these recommendations. This would facilitate the important programmatic issue of combining rifabutin with other anti-tuberculosis medications as a fixed-dose combination pill to be taken on a daily basis, a necessary measure if the results of this and other research are going to reach patients being managed routinely within general health service care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0084866.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
