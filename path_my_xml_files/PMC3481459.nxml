Its annual incidence is about 20 cases per 100,000 population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. More than 70% patients end up with death or dependence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The main clinical management of SICH includes surgical and medical treatment. Whether patients can benefit from surgery is still controversial, especially for those with basal ganglia hemorrhage, which is the major subtype of SICH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Surgical evacuation of hematomas can relieve the mass effect and reduce the harmful substance released during their coagulation, liquefaction, and resolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], but surgical procedures may also injure the brain tissue, and cause other operative complications. These disadvantages reduce the benefit of surgery. Some clinical trials were carried out to compare surgery with medical treatment. The most famous trial is the STICH trial conducted by Mendelow et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. 1033 patients were randomized. After 6&#x02009;months follow-up, 26% of patients in the early surgery group had a favourable outcome compared with 24% in the group of initial conservative treatment. Early surgery did not show significant advantages. However, in this study less than 25% of the operations were minimally invasive. Trials of stereotactic surgery or craniopuncture were also carried out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. But none of the trials and systematic reviews provide sufficient evidence for the choice of treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>In clinical practice, neurologists and neurosurgeons tend to choose conservative treatment for patients with small-volume hematomas, and surgery for those with large-volume hematomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, when the volume of the hematoma exceeds 60&#x02009;ml, neither of the methods give much help [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Treatments for moderate-volume hematomas have the most uncertainty. Some recently randomized trials indicate these patients may benefit from minimally invasive surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] randomized 387 patients with basal ganglia or thalamus hematomas to stereotactic-guided evacuation (group A) or conservative treatment (group B), and the mean hematoma volume was 23.1&#x02009;ml. At the end of 6&#x02009;months follow-up, the mean score of modified Barthel index was 90.9 in group A and 62.4 in group B, and the mean score of modified Rankin scale was 1.2 in group A and 3.0 in group B. Patients received stereotactic-guided evacuation had better clinical outcomes and motor function.</p><p>Endoscopic surgery is one of the minimally invasive ways for hematoma evacuation. Compared with other surgical methods, it has advantages as follows. A). The hematoma evacuation is performed under direct vision of neurosurgeons. It&#x02019;s much easier to spot any bleeding site, so that the risk of postoperative rebleeding is lower. B). The evacuation rate of hematomas is higher because of a wider vision. C). This also leads to less brain retraction and brain tissue injury. D). The operation time is shorter. Cho et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] carried out a randomized controlled trial which compared endoscopic surgery, stereotactic aspiration and craniotomy. The results showed endoscopic surgery had the highest hematoma evacuation rate, the lowest mortality and complication rate, and shorter waiting time than stereotactic aspiration. However, there are few randomized controlled trials which contrast endoscopic surgery and conservative treatment. The trial completed by Auer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] in 1989, showed 28% lower of the mortality in the endoscopic surgery group than the medical treatment group after 6&#x02009;months follow-up. But this trial did not restrict the volume of hematomas.</p><p>It's not clear whether endoscopic surgery gives this type of patients better outcomes, so we have designed this study to find more clues for the clinical management of SICH.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study objective</title><p>To compare the efficacy of endoscopic surgery and conservative treatment for the moderate-volume hematoma in spontaneous basal ganglia hemorrhage.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>&#x000b7; Spontaneous basal ganglia hemorrhage confirmed by computed tomography(CT).</p><p>&#x000b7; The volume of the hematoma is between 20&#x02009;ml to 40&#x02009;ml.

When the qualification of a patient is confirmed, the investigator sends the basic information of the patient to a special trialist who is responsible for patients randomization. After the information of the patient is imported, the software will randomize him/her into the endoscopic surgery group or the conservative treatment group. The presetted variables for minimization are age, hematoma volume, and admission GCS.</p><p>The allocation of patients cannot be changed. If the patients' condition deteriorates during conservative treatment, and the surgical indications are clear, hematoma evacuation will be performed after fully informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Blinding</title><p>Both patients and surgeons cannot be blinded. In order to minimize the measurement bias, the following procedures are made. A). Patient outcomes will be measured by two special investigators who are not involved in the allocation and the treatment. Before the outcome measurement starts, patients, their relatives, and the related medial staff will be told not to reveal any information about the treatment. B). Every patient will have a gauze covered on the hemorrhage side of the head to conceal the scar or baldness. C). Because the follow-up forms and the treatment forms are printed on the same set of Case Report Form (CRF), these two investigators must hand in a copy of the original score sheets to the Quality Monitoring Board (QMB), before they are allowed to get the CRF of the patient. D). The statistical analysis will be made by a statistician who doesn't participate in the implementation of the trial, and the treatment information of the groups will be blinded.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of the hematoma volume</title><p>The ABCs method is adopted to measure the hematoma volume: Volume(ml)&#x02009;=&#x02009;(A&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;B&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;C)/2[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. &#x0201c;A&#x0201d; is the long axis of the hematoma on the CT slice where the hematoma has the largest area. &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; is the longest axis of the hematoma perpendicular to the long axis on the same CT slice. &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; is the product of the interslice distance and the count of slices on which the hematoma is visible. The intraventricular hematoma is not counted.

There are already more than 10 randomized controlled trials referring to the treatment choices of SICH, but we still designed this study due to the following reasons. A). To evacuate or not, it&#x02019;s controversial, especially for moderate-volume hematomas. B). It&#x02019;s reasonable to evacuate the hematoma considering its mechanical, chemical, and biological harm to the brain tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. C). As a minimally invasive technique, endoscopic surgery may reveal the benefit of the hematoma evacuation, which is probably covered by the secondary injury caused by traditional craniotomy. D). There is a lack of randomized controlled trial focusing on endoscopic surgery for the moderate-volume hematoma in spontaneous basal ganglia hemorrhage.</p><p>For patients in the conservative treatment group, if their condition deteriorates because of hematoma expansion or rebleeding during the trial, and the surgical indications are clear, then hematoma evacuation should be performed. The crossover will be analyzed in both ways: ITT and PP.</p><p>Surgical approaches for the hematoma evacuation in the basal ganglia include the temporal approach, the frontal approach, and the transsylvian approach. The last one is often performed under the microscope, so it won&#x02019;t be applied in this study. The temporal approach usually provides the shortest distance from the cortex to the hematoma, but it may cause injury to the visual pathway, and if the hematoma is elliptical, neurosurgeons may fail to evacuate the frontal part of the hematoma because of the blind angle. In the frontal approach, the trajectory of endoscope is parallel to the long axis of the hematoma, so neurosurgeons get a better view through this approach, and it&#x02019;s advised to be used for hematomas larger than 50&#x02009;ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. However, for small and moderate volume hematomas, much further distance is needed to reach them by the frontal approach, which means more brain tissue damage. Also, the aspect ratio of moderate-volume hematomas is more approximate to 1:1 than the large ones, which makes fewer blind angle through the temporal approach. In this study, surgical approaches will be decided according to the location, size, and shape of hematomas.</p><p>In conclusion, the ECMOH trial is a randomized controlled trial designed to assess if endoscopic surgery is better than conservative treatment for patients with moderate-volume hematomas in the basal ganglia.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ECMOH: Endoscopic surgery versus conservative treatment for the moderate-volume hematoma; SICH: Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage; CT: Computed Tomography; GCS: Glasgow Coma Score; CRF: Case Report Form; QMB: Quality Monitoring Board; GOSE: Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale; mRS: Modified Rankin Scale; NIHSS: National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; BI: Barthel Index; BMEC: Biological and Medical Ethics Committee; AE: Adverse Event; SAE: Severe Adverse Event; ITT: Intention To Treat; PP: Per-Protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>CY is the principle investigator, has initiated the trial, been part of the trial design and protocol writing.
