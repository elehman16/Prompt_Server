is characterized by widespread pain and fatigue. The aim of this study was to investigate
the effects of aquatic, aerobic and isometric strength-stretching exercises on the
physical and psychological parameters of patients with FMS. [Subjects and Methods] Seventy
five female patients with FMS were randomly selected and divided into three groups.
Patients (18&#x02013;50 years) were treated for 3 months using one of three methods: a home-based
isometric strength and stretching exercise program (ISSEP), a gym-based aerobic exercise
program (AEP), and a pool-based aquatic aerobic exercise program (AAEP). Items evaluated
were: the number of tender points, Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Fibromyalgia Impact
Questionnaire (FIQ), the Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), SF-36 physical and mental health
scores, and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). [Results] The results revealed that AAEP
was the most effective treatment of the three. All of the groups showed significant
improvements in all variables between pre-and post-test, except the mean values of VAS and
BDI in ISSEP. [Conclusion] The results suggest that aquatic aerobic exercise program is
more effective than AEP and ISSEP in the treatment of FMS.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Fibromyalgia</kwd><kwd>Exercise</kwd><kwd>Treatment</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), which is characterized by widespread pain and fatigue, is a
disease that affects the connective tissues and locomotor system<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patients with FMS also suffer from weakness, fatigue, lack of
energy, sleep disturbances, waking up tired in the morning (non-restorative sleep), and
stiffness. While complaints especially in cold weather increase with the change of seasons,
patients&#x02019;work is affected and they experience, a decrease in their quality of life<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is reported that the incidence of
fibromyalgia is 3.4% among women and 0.5% among men, and 70&#x02013;80% of patients are women<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although it may be observed at any age groups<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, FMS is often observed in sedentary women between 30&#x02013;50 years of
age<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is reported that muscle
oxygenation changes, and psychological, biochemical, hormonal and immunological factors are
involved in the pathogenesis of FMS<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Psychological disorders are observed in nearly 30&#x02013;40% of FMS patients<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, irritable bowel syndrome, tension-type
headaches, perfectionist personality, premenstrual syndrome, sicca, female urethral
syndrome, and Raynaud like symptoms are all associated with FMS<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) suggested some criteria for the classification
of fibromyalgia in 1990. According to the criteria, widespread pain lasting longer than 3
months (pain in the right and the left side and in the lower, and upper back must be located
in the axial skeleton) and tenderness in at least in 11 of 18 tender points are symptomatic
of FMS<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, hyperemia and skin
discoloration are observed at the tender points of patients with FMS<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There is no suggested cure for fibromyalgia, as in the treatment of common chronic
illnesses, so informing and educating the patients about the illness should be the focus of
treatment<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Numerous studies have
shown that low intensity physical activity and exercise including stretching, swimming,
walking, jogging, and cycling are beneficial for patients with chronic pain and FMS,
increasing fitness levels, reducing the spread of pain and tenderness, improving the quality
of life, and reducing depression levels<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Muscular strength, endurance, and the
aerobic fitness levels of FMS patients are lower than those of healthy controls<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, it is important to provide
well-structured exercise programs and physical activity for FMS patients in order to reduce
their sedentary life style.</p><p>In the study of Gowans et al., 20 female patients were assigned to pool exercise twice a
week for 30 minutes, while a control group did not do any exercise. There were significance
changes in Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), fatigue, pain, and improvement in
disease symptoms between the control and experimental groups. The experimental group
patients also maintained their wellbeing level after three months<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Alina investigated the relationship between functional capacity and a self-report of
quality of life with the practice of regular exercise by patients with FMS, and found that
intervention elicited<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup> significant
differences in the quality of life and functional capacity between the regular exercise
group and the no-regular exercise group. A significantly lower score for functional capacity
in the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) was found in the no-regular exercise group,
while higher values were observed in the regular exercise group for the physical functioning
(p<italic>&#x0003c;</italic>0.001) and bodily pain (p<italic>&#x0003c;</italic>0.05) domains of
SF-36. There were no significant differences between two the groups in the physical, general
health, vitality, social functioning, emotion and mental health domains, and Alina concluded
that regular exercise had a positive impact on the functional capacity and quality of life
of patients with FMS<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Cedraschi et al. observed 164 FMS patients during a 6-week pool exercise program. The
patients practiced relaxation techniques 2 times a week for 6 weeks. Each session consisted
of 45 minutes and the FMS patients in the exercise group were followed for 6 months. Their
FIQ anxiety scores showed a significant improvement compared to the control group<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In a study of 50 patients with FMS by Altan et al., the patients were divided into
experimental and control groups and performed balneotherapy pool workouts. The experimental
group performed a two-week training program of 2 &#x000d7; 35 minutes sessions/week consisting of
aerobics, flexibility and relaxation exercises. The control group did not participate in any
exercise program and were only treated with spa therapy. The experimental group showed a
significant level of depression. In both groups, significant improvements in pain intensity
stiffness, and fatigue were observed<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>.
In the studies conducted by Verstappen et al. and Gowans et al., FMS patients were tested
after exercise treatments including aerobics and pool exercises<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The exercise
groups showed improvements in overall well-being compared to the control group, and both
study groups reported that the exercise program had not only a corrective effect on posture
during sitting or standing upright, due to strengthening of the muscles, but also decreased
pain through more balanced muscle contraction<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Various exercise modalities such as ground-based, water-based, aerobic, pool or aquatic
balnotherapy, and hot water spa are used in the treatment of patients with FMS<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Especially, balnotherapy (hot water therapy), isokinetic strength stretching, aerobic and
strengthening exercises are commonly used for the reduction of pain<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the
implementation of these exercises are generally based upon the availability of facilities,
so water-based exercises are very rare in Turkey.</p><p>This study compared the effects of home-based isometric strength and stretching, gym-based
aerobic and pool-based aquatic exercises programs on the physical and psychological
parameters of patients with FMS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The data were collected from fibromyalgia patients who were diagnosed by a specialist in
the clinic of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Department, Faculty of Medicine, Cukurova
University. Among the 107 patients recruited for the study, 32 were excluded because: 9 were
postmenopausal, 10 were over 50&#x02005;years, refused to participate in the study, one had a
cardiovascular problem, one had Cushing syndrome, and one was under 18&#x02005;years. The study was
approved by the local ethics committee. After informing all the subjects about the design
and the risks of this study, they gave written consent prior to participation in the
study.</p><p>The patients were randomly assigned to one of three exercise program groups and matched by
age and their symptoms of FMS.</p><p>The exercise training programs comprised aerobic gymnastic, isometric strength-stretching,
and aquatic exercises, all of which aimed to increase flexibility, and muscular and aerobic
endurance based on graded activity.</p><p>Seventy-five female patients with FMS according to the ACR definition between the ages of
18&#x02013;50 (35.0&#x000b1;8.8) were randomized into three groups. The first group (n: 25) performed a
home-based isometric strength and stretching exercise program (ISSEP) lasting 15 minutes per
day. The second group (n: 25) attended a gymnastic-based aerobic exercise program (AEP) with
group therapy two times per week<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
third group (n: 25) attended a pool-based aquatic aerobic exercise program (AAEP) with group
therapy two times per week. The durations of the exercise programs were 40 minutes for AEP
and AAEP in first month, 45 minutes in the second month and 50 minutes in the third month.
All the exercise programs lasted 3 months. The primary outcome measure was pain Visual
Analog Scale (VAS). The secondary outcome measures were: health status FIQ, the Six-Minute
Walk Test (6MWT) for endurance<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>, quality
of life scores represented by SF-36 physical and mental component scores<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup> and depression as assessed by the Beck
Depression Inventory (BDI)<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
intensity of exercise was determined according to the Karvonen method and was generally
60&#x02013;80% of a subject&#x02019;s maximal heart rate. Heart rates were measured eight times at regular
intervals during the exercise program to monitor loading level during aerobic exercise
programs.</p><p>All of the subjects completed the three-month exercise program. Three-minute loadings with
30 seconds rest between three sets of low to moderate intensity were repeated in the first
month of the exercise program (3 &#x000d7; 3). In the second month 30 seconds high intensity
loadings with 30 seconds rest period between four sets were performed after three minutes of
low intensity loading (3 &#x000d7; 4). With reducing rest intervals from 30 to 10 seconds,
three-minute loadings of five sets were repeated in the third month of the exercise program
(3 &#x000d7; 5).</p><p>SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) for Windows version 13.0 was used for the
statistical evaluation of the data. Descriptive statistics were calculated and the chi
square test, Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test were used for two-and three-group
comparisons. The Wilcoxon test was also used for pairwise comparisons of pre- and post-test.
A 0.05 significance level was used for statistical significance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Demographic characteristics of the patients including age, weight, height, mean symptom

characterized by fatigue and tenderness at specific tender points along with commonly
associated symptoms such as altered sleep, cognitive and emotional disturbances (anxiety and
depression), increase of disability and decrease of quality of life. Researchers suggest
that the effective treatment for fibromyalgia should include medication with lifestyle
changes and alternative treatments<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Thus, this study aimed to determine which exercise program among isometric strength and
stretching, and aerobic and aquatic exercises programs is the best at reducing the symptoms
of fibromyalgia<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>VAS was compared among the three groups and, both the aquatic (AAEP) and gym (AEP) groups
showed statistically significant improvements compared to the isometric strength-stretching
exercise (ISSEP) group. In addition, no statistically significant difference was found
between the AAEP group and the AEP exercise group. When the intra-group results were
compared, only the ISSEP group showed an increase in the mean value of VAS, whereas both the
AAEP and AEP exercise programs improved the pain threshold with only slight differences
between them. Similarly, in the study of Assis et al., no significant difference in VAS was
found when AEP and AAEP groups were compared<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the 48-week study conducted by Ramsey et al., one group
performed aerobic exercises, while the other group participated in a home-based
stretch-strength exercise program, and no improvement in the values of VAS was found between
the two groups. Besides, no statistically significant difference between the groups was
found<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Contrary to several previous
studies reporting similar treatment effect of ISSEP and AEP, our present study found no
difference in VAS between AEP and AAEP<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.
In addition, Bircan et al. reported that aerobic exercise and strength exercise were
similarly effective at improving symptoms, tender point count, fitness depression, and
quality of life in FMS<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>When BDI was compared among the three groups, no significant difference before the exercise
program was observed. However, a significant decrease was found after the exercises in the
mean values of the AAEP and AEP groups. The AEP group showed more significant improvement
than the AAEP group in the level of depression. Conversely, Assis et al. found no
significant improvement in BDI after the exercise program<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup>. In our study both the AAEP and AEP exercise programs had a
significant effect on depression levels, but AEP was more effective than AAEP at decreasing
the depression level. Similar to our results, Sanudo et al.<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><sup>)</sup> reported BDI scores decreased by 8.5&#x000b1;8
(p<italic>&#x0003c;</italic>0.001) and 6.4&#x000b1;4 points (p<italic>&#x0003c;</italic>0.001) in a supervised
aerobic exercise group and a combined program of supervised aerobic, muscle strengthening,
and flexibility exercises, respectively. Similarly, Santiago and Lacomba reported that
aquatic and combined exercise, and alternative activities seemed to be better for the
treatment of depression<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Among the exercise groups, both the AAEP and AEP exercise groups showed more improvement
than the ISSEP group in the mean value of FIQ. Also, no statistically significance
difference was found between the AAEP and AEP exercise groups. Similarly Assis et al.
reported that the level of improvement in the AAEP group was higher than that of the AEP
group<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the study of Mannerkorpi et
al., the effect of aquatic training on FIQ of FMS patients was investigated with a
combination of six sessions education, which resulted in significant differences in the mean
value of FIQ as compared to the control<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Jentoft et al. found a significant difference in FIQ between the groups in their
studies<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study there
was a significant improvement in FIQ in both the AAEP and AEP groups, but there was no
difference between the two groups. This result suggests that both of the exercise programs
were equally effective at improving physical functioning, increasing quality of the life,
and decreasing of pain. The results for FIQ were similar those reported by Sanudo et al.,
who compared an exercise program of exclusively aerobic exercise, with another of combined
exercise, and found similar improvements of around 14% in FIQ<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In previous studies, better results were obtained by the aquatic program, however, in the
present study no significant difference was observed<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Evcik et al. showed that aquatic and home-based land exercise
therapy was beneficial for pain reduction at the end of treatment, and after a long-term
follow up of 3 months. Additional benefits of aquatic exercises may be related to the water
itself, as well as the benefits derived from the social aspects of exercising with others
outside of the home<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref><sup>)</sup>. The comparison of
our three groups revealed that both the AAEP and AEP groups showed statistically significant
improvements in 6MWT as compared to the ISSEP exercise group. No statistically significant
difference was found between the AAEP and AEP groups, indicating that both AAEP and AEP had
equally positive effects on walking ability.</p><p>Although the 6MWT is a simple, safe and low cost test that has gained much attention in the
clinical and scientific fields<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref><sup>)</sup>, researchers have reported that a substantial number of women with
FMS show increased pain intensity and perceived effort compared to controls<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref><sup>)</sup>. Mannerkorpi et al. combined six sessions
of education investigated the effect of aquatic training on the 6MWT distance of FMS
patients. The 6MWT distance of the aquatic training group was significantly longer than that
of the controls<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref><sup>)</sup>, suggesting that
patients with fibromyalgia might benefit from aerobic fitness training.</p><p>The PCS of SF-36 was compared across the three groups. Both the pool-based aquatic and
gym-based aerobic exercise groups showed more improvement than the home-based isometric
strength-stretching exercises group. However, no statistically significant difference was
found between the pool and gym groups. Assis et al. found no statistically significant
difference groups in the SF-36 physical health scores of two groups<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the literature only the study conducted by Jentoft et
al. reported a result similar and comparable to that of our study. They did not find
statistically significant differences in the physical health scores when the groups were
compared<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Both the pool and gym
exercise programs provided similar increases in the quality of life.</p><p>The MCS of SF-36 was compared across the three groups. Both the pool-based and gym-based
groups showed statistically significant differences, but the home-based exercise group did
not. When the pool and gym groups were compared, a more significant difference was found in
the pool group than in the gym group. Two studies presented similar results, reporting no
significant difference in terms of MCS<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of our present study suggest
that gym exercise programs lead to improvement of the MCS of FMS patients, and that,
different from other studies, the aquatic program was more efficient than the other programs
in this regard.</p><p>In a study conducted by Van Santen et al., 37 FMS patients were divided into two groups and
one group with 19 members exercised with higher intensity while the other group with 18
members performed aerobic exercises of lower intensity<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Their showed low intensity exercises provided a medium-level
improvement in the quality of life and physical health after 20 weeks, but it had no effect
on the general health and psychological state of the patients; also, the high intensity
exercises had no statistically significant effect on the quality of life or physical
health<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the study of Salek et al.,
patients were assigned to two groups, and one group of patients did exercises while the
other group was given antidepressants and analgesics. When the pre-treatment and the
post-treatment measurements after 16 weeks were compared, it was found that the level of
sore points and pain had improved 48% in the group that exercised regularly, and 39% in the
group that did not exercise. However, there was no significant difference between the
groups<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Water-based exercises are not only an important effective treatment for FMS<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>, but they are also important and effective
tools for improving isometric, isotonic, and isokinetic strength in young women<xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref><sup>)</sup>. Significant improvements in isokinetic knee extensor and flexor
torques in the elderly after a water-based program were reported<xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref><sup>)</sup>. It was also reported that isokinetic muscle contraction
in the water provided excellent rate of strength gain over range of motion and with a low
possibility of muscle injury compared to isometric and isotonic muscle contractions<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The results of our present study show that the ISSEP group demonstrated only slight
improvements between pre-and post-test in FIQ, 6MWT, MCS and PCS, while significant
improvements (p&#x0003c;0.01) in all variables were observed in the AEP and AAEP groups with
respect to their baseline values. The ISSEP group showed significant improvements
(p&#x0003c;0.01) only VAS and BDI between pre-and post-test (<xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>The AAEP group had statistically better results than the AEP and ISSEP groups for all
variables. Significant differences among the three groups were derived from the low
improvements of the ISSEP group, ISSEP with the exception of 6MWT distance. Both the AAEP
and AEP groups had significantly higher scores of MCS and PCS than the ISSEP group.</p><p>In conclusion, AAEP and AEP are effective methods in the treatment of FMS. AAEP also had
additional effects on the SF-36 mental health score and the BDI. AAEP was also significantly
more effective in the treatment of FMS than to AEP and ISSEP. The superiority of AAEP as a
treatment method for FMS may originate from its lack of impact force on the joints, and the
use of only concentric or isokinetic contractions during shallow and deep water
exercises<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Further research is required to assess the advantages and disadvantages of ISSEP, AAEP and
AEP in the treatment of FMS using experimental groups matched for health status, symptoms,
body structure, physical fitness and age, and a long-term follow-up.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work project with no. BESYO2006D was supported by a grant from the Scientific Research
