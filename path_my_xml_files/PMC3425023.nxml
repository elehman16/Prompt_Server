These findings were incremental to, and independent of, statin use, which also have beneficial effects on both atherosclerosis and CRP. The current study and the prior two studies documenting the effect of AGE on CAC and inflammatory biomarkers sets the stage for an outcomes based study to assess whether this approach may reduce CVD events.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This study was supported by a grant from Wakunaga of America to Dr. Budoff, the manufacturer of AGE and CoQ10 used in this research.
