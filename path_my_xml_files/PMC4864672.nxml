Melzack and Wall proposed the gate control theory of pain in 1965. The gate theory of pain has had considerable influence on anesthesiologist's management of pain by focusing attention on the unique pharmacology of dorsal horn of spinal cord. Anesthesiologist's have learnt to suppress nociceptive transmission at the first synaptic relay in the spinal cord by using intrathecal and epidural injections in lower abdominal surgeries. Use of adjuvant drugs for anesthesia is intended to improve the success of regional anesthesia by prolonging analgesia of local anesthetics and preventing deleterious clinical effects of their toxic doses. Since long time intrathecal opioids have been used extensively to treat pain, despite their universal ability to alleviate pain with less hemodynamic instability, spinal opioids have certain unpleasant side effects such as nausea, vomiting, pruritis, urinary retention, respiratory depression, and tolerance. Clinicians and investigators have been looking at opioids alternative, where &#x003b1;-2 adrenergic agonist are one of the most studied nonopioids, nonlocal anesthetics, pain modulatory systems in recent years. With the introduction of dexmedetomidine in recent times, a more potent &#x003b1;-2 agonist than clonidine, there is increased use of these drugs as adjuvants for spinal anesthesia. This study is designed to evaluate effects of intrathecal hyperbaric bupivacaine alone versus intrathecal low dose clonidine with hyperbaric bupivacaine in lower abdominal surgeries.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>&#x0201c;A comparative study of intrathecal hyperbaric bupivacaine with small dose clonidine versus hyperbaric bupivacaine alone in lower abdominal surgeries,&#x0201d; was a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind study for a period of 1 year comprising of 60 patients, undertaken from May 2009 to May 2010 in our Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India.

Group C (<italic>n</italic> = 30): Patients received intrathecal hyperbaric bupivacaine 12.5 mg with 1 &#x000b5;g/kg clonidine (approximated to 0.5 ml with normal saline). All patients underwent thorough preanesthetic check-up including relevant history and systemic examination. On a day before surgery, vitals were examined, and investigation reports checked. All patients were thoroughly screened for any previous medication and drug therapy for concomitant medical problems, which was continued as deemed appropriate by an anesthesiologist. After shifting patient in the preoperation room, an intravenous (i.v.) cannula was inserted and patients were preloaded with crystalloid of choice (10&#x02013;12 ml/kg) 15 min prior to the procedure. The monitoring of following parameters, noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), heart rate (HR), electrocardiogram (ECG), oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), respiratory rate, was started after taking the patient into operation theater (baseline values were noted). NIBP was measured at 5 min interval for first 30 min thereafter every 30 min until completion of surgery. HR, SpO<sub>2</sub>, ECG, respiratory rate were monitored continuously. Under all aseptic precautions, lumbar puncture was performed at L3&#x02013;4 intervertebral space in the midline, with the patient in sitting position, by using 25-gauge Whitacre needle.

Thus, the groups were comparable in demographic parameters. No significant difference in HR between two groups was seen at any time interval (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). No significant difference in systolic BP (SBP) of two groups was seen at any time interval except that at 10 min when mean SBP of the study group was found to be significantly lower as compared to control group. A significant difference in diastolic BP (DBP) of two groups was seen at 10 min, 30 min and 1 h with study group showing lower values as compared to control group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).

The mean of MAP was at baseline (pre), it reached to its minimum at 10 min in the study group and at 30 min in control group thereafter it started showing a gradual increase.

A statistically significant difference between two groups was seen from 30 min onward (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). The patients were sedated to that extent where they could be woken up by calling their respective name or a gentle ear tug on the right side.

General anesthesia is associated with higher morbidity and longer hospitalization in comparison to regional anesthesia; however regional anesthesia also needs careful selection of patients. However, side effects such as delayed respiratory depression have prompted further research to develop nonopioid analgesics. Intrathecal clonidine is being extensively evaluated as an alternative to neuraxial opioids for control of pain and has proven to be a potent analgesic, free of some of opioids related side effects.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Local anesthetic bupivacaine acts mainly by blockage of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels in axonal membrane. It also interferes with synaptic transmission by presynaptic inhibition of Ca<sup>++</sup> channels in addition to their effect on nerve conduction. On other hand, clonidine is a specific &#x003b1;-2 receptor agonist; &#x003b1;-2 receptors are present within both presynaptic and postsynaptic terminals of primary afferent nociceptive neurons within the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Spinal &#x003b1;-2 receptors agonist alter pain transmission by binding presynaptically to nociceptive A&#x003b4; and C fiber terminals and reducing neurotransmitter release, and postsynaptically by hyperpolarizing second-order neurons within the dorsal horn. Therefore, a combination of these effects may explain the synergism between bupivacaine and clonidine found in our study.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>In this study, there were not much significant changes in HR, SBP, or MAP as compared to the control group. Although there was a significant difference in the DBP between the two groups, but this parameter did not affect our study significantly because no active therapeutic intervention was needed during perioperative period. To support our result, the data obtained from Sethi <italic>et al</italic>. 2007 indicated that addition of 1 &#x000b5;g/kg of clonidine to 0.5% bupivacaine prolongs analgesia. Even though a statistically significant decrease in MAP and HR was noted in clonidine group compared to control group, none of the patients required any therapeutic intervention for either.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Hemodynamic and analgesic profile after intrathecal clonidine in humans: A dose response study conducted by Filos <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that clonidine reduced MAP compared with baseline only in Group 1 (21% &#x000b1; 13%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Delayed hypotension or bradycardia was not encountered after any of the three dose studies (150 [Group 1], 300 [Group 2], or 450 [Group 3] &#x000b5;g clonidine). After 300 and 450 &#x000b5;g intrathecal clonidine a relative hemodynamic stability is observed, suggesting a presser effect at peripheral sites with larger doses.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Our results of onset time of sensory block showed that there was faster onset in clonidine group 3.73 &#x000b1; 1.3 min compared to control group 5.60 &#x000b1; 1.6 min. Our findings are in tandem with those of Van Tuijl <italic>et al</italic>. Their study came to a conclusion that 71% of the patients, who received low dose clonidine (15 &#x000b5;g) and hyperbaric bupivacaine for spinal anesthesia achieved optimal time of onset of analgesia, that is within 5 min of intrathecal injection, compared with only 54% in control group. They also found that increasing the clonidine dose to 30 &#x000b5;g did not increase time of onset.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Kanazi <italic>et al</italic>. 2006 in their study concluded that combination of 12 mg of intrathecal bupivacaine with low dose of 3 &#x000b5;g of dexmedetomidine or 30 &#x000b5;g of clonidine significantly shortened the onset of motor block.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Which is further supported by Fournier <italic>et al</italic>., that a slightly shorter onset of action was observed with the sufentanil (7.5 &#x000b5;g) + clonidine (30 &#x000b5;g) mixture when compared to sufentanil (7.5 &#x000b5;g) used alone in patients undergoing total hip replacement.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>In this study, median, upper level of sensory block achieved was higher (T<sub>6</sub>) in clonidine group as compared to control group (T<sub>8</sub>) which is in support with Dobrydnjov <italic>et al</italic>., while comparing three groups; (i) Group B with low dose bupivacaine 0.5%; (ii) Group BC15 with bupivacaine 0.5% + clonidine 15 &#x000b5;g; and (iii) Group BC30 with bupivacaine 0.5% + clonidine 30 &#x000b5;g, during spinal anesthesia for inguinal herniorrhaphy, concluded in their study that cephalad spread of sensory block on dependent side was significantly higher (2&#x02013;4 dermatomes) in Group BC15 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and BC30 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.02) compared to Group B.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The study also showed that patients who received intrathecal clonidine had more intensified motor blockade compared to control group. Eisenach <italic>et al</italic>. in their clinical review of clonidine (1984&#x02013;1995) for regional anesthesia confirmed above finding that clonidine enhances both sensory and motor blockade from epidural and peripheral nerve block of local anesthetics. They also concluded that clonidine prolongs and intensifies anesthesia from epidural local anesthetic without increasing hypotension during surgical epidural anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Strebel <italic>et al</italic>. observed a significantly larger proportion of patients with intense motor blockade that resolved after 8&#x02013;10 h in patients who received 150 &#x000b5;g intrathecal clonidine compared with control group in a dose response study for small dose intrathecal clonidine and isobaric bupivacaine for orthopedic surgery.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The explanation for this could be that &#x003b1;-2 adrenoceptor agonist induce a cellular modification in ventral horn of spinal cord (motorneuron hyperpolarization) and facilitate local anesthetic action (Bonnet <italic>et al</italic>. 1990).[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Improved perioperative analgesia after co-administration of clonidine and bupivacaine can be explained by the synergistic inhibitory action of clonidine (&#x003b1;-2 adrenergic agonist) and bupivacaine (a local anesthetic) on A&#x003b4; and C-fiber conduction, presynaptic and postsynaptic, respectively. This suggests that clonidine does potentiates or prolong neuronal blockade effects of local anesthetic, by reducing vascular uptake and thereby maintaining a higher concentration of lidocaine near neuronal tissues for a longer period of time.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Our results were supported by Van Tuijl <italic>et al</italic>., they demonstrated that addition of 75 &#x000b5;g clonidine to hyperbaric bupivacaine prolongs spinal analgesia and the motor block after cesarean section and improves analgesia. They also concluded that this effect was obtained without clinically relevant maternal or neonatal side effect (Van Tuijl <italic>et al</italic>.; 2006).[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The results of Kaabachi <italic>et al</italic>. indicated that clonidine is an effective adjuvant to bupivacaine in spinal anesthesia in adolescents. At a dose of 1 &#x000b5;g/kg of body weight, clonidine prolonged the duration of sensory block achieved with bupivacaine 0.2&#x02013;0.3 mg/kg by 30 min, motor block by 60 min, and postoperative analgesia by 120 min. These results were in tandem with their previous experience in younger children, where clonidine 2 &#x000b5;g/kg was used as an adjuvant to bupivacaine 5 mg/ml for spinal anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] However, in adolescents, clonidine 1 &#x000b5;g/kg of body weight seems to be more appropriate dosage. In fact, a dose of 2 &#x000b5;g/kg clonidine added to bupivacaine seems to cause more frequent and severe bradycardia and hypotension than that observed in the present study.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] D'Angelo <italic>et al</italic>. studied effects of spinal clonidine administered with spinal sufentanil and bupivacaine on labor analgesia using combined spinal-epidural technique and conclude that clonidine significantly prolongs labor analgesia from spinal sufentanil and bupivacaine without producing serious adverse effects. In their study, clonidine 50 &#x000b5;g significantly prolonged labor analgesia from sufentanil 7.5 &#x000b5;g and bupivacaine 2.5 mg and they reported 197 min of labor analgesia in the study. This difference of postoperative regression of motor and sensory blockade in comparison to our study could be due to increased amount of bupivacaine 0.5% in our study.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Clonidine affects the electroencephalogram in a variety of ways: It increases slow-wave activity (delta) and attenuates the physiological alfa fluctuations.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In a study by Hall <italic>et al</italic>. on a sedative, analgesic and cognitive effects of clonidine infusions in humans demonstrated significant sedation without analgesia and hypotension when using clonidine at lower doses. By and large good sedation was seen that was easily overcome by calling patients name in a normal or loud voice.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] The present study sedation results were supported by Sethi <italic>et al</italic>. in which the incidence of sedation as assessed by sedation score, was higher in clonidine group than in control group, even 3&#x02013;6 h after injection which was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-5"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A prospective, double-blind, randomized study was done to compare and evaluate the effect of intrathecal hyperbaric bupivacaine with low dose (1 &#x000b5;g/kg) clonidine for lower abdominal and orthopedic surgeries. We found that both groups were comparable demographically with respect to age, weight and sex. We concluded that mean time of onset of sensory block was faster in patients who received intrathecal clonidine (3.73 &#x000b1; 1.3 min) compared to control patients (5.9 &#x000b1; 1.6 min) with maximum upper level of sensory block attained T6 in both groups. Thus mean value of the highest level of block was comparable in two groups. On other hand intensity of motor blockade was better in clonidine group patients compared to control patients. These all factors increased duration of analgesia in clonidine group (363.07 &#x000b1; 166.30 min) compared to control group (226.95 &#x000b1; 119 min) and they also required less top up analgesic in postoperative period. There was a significant fall in MAP in study group after 10 min of subarachnoid procedure as compared to control group. Sedation of different quality was observed during and after the surgery in study group without any respiratory depression or any decrease in SpO<sub>2</sub>. When interviewed regarding patients satisfaction in spinal anesthesia all patients in clonidine group were satisfied while in control group patients remained dissatisfied. The present study revealed that when clonidine in low doses 1 &#x000b5;g/kg was added to hyperbaric bupivacaine 12.5 mg, leads to faster onset and intense sensory and motor blockade. The duration of postoperative analgesia was also prolonged without any remarkable side effects such as severe hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory depression, shivering, xerostomia, nausea, vomiting, backache or a headache. Thus, overall combined effect of intrathecal clonidine-bupivacaine is far superior over bupivacaine alone.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>RD</given-names></name></person-group><source>Miller's anesthesia</source><year>2005</year><volume>Vol. I</volume><edition>6th ed</edition><publisher-loc>Philadelphia</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Elsevier Churchill Livingstone</publisher-name><fpage>9</fpage><lpage>25</lpage><comment>Ch.1, Sec. 1</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Caplan</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name><name><surname>Ward</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Posner</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Cheney</surname><given-names>FW</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Unexpected cardiac arrest during spinal anesthesia: A closed claims analysis of predisposing factors</article-title><source>Anesthesiology</source><year>1988</year><volume>68</volume><fpage>5</fpage><lpage>11</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">3337390</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gustafsson</surname><given-names>LL</given-names></name><name><surname>Friberg-Nielsen</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Garle</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Mohall</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Rane</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Schildt</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Extradural and parenteral morphine: Kinetics and effects in postoperative pain.
