Post-thrombotic scar formation and May-Thurner syndrome (MTS) are the most common causes of DVO. Conventional treatment of DVO focuses on reducing pain or leg swelling by use of (pain) medication and therapeutic elastic stockings. In the past, a venous bypass was offered in severe post-thrombotic cases, but this procedure showed bad clinical and patency outcomes. With the introduction of percutaneous angioplasty and dedicated venous stents new opportunities were created. Deep venous stenting has been shown to be effective in retrospective case series. However, there is no prior research in which QoL after interventional treatment is compared with QoL after conventional treatment. Currently, there is a debate about the true additional value of interventional treatment. We investigate whether those patients who are treated with stenting experience a change in short form 36 (SF-36) and the Veines-QoL/Sym questionnaires compared with conventionally treated patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This is a randomised trial comparing conservative deep venous management to interventional treatment. A total of 130 patients with post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) or MTS, eligible for interventional percutaneous treatment, who did not have previous deep venous intervention will be included. Patients will be randomised to conservative treatment or venous stenting and stratified for the PTS or MTS subgroup. Conservative treatment consists of either one or a combination of pain medications, manual lymphatic drainage, compression stockings and regular post-thrombotic anticoagulant therapy.</p><p>The primary outcome is the QoL change after 12 months compared with baseline QoL. Secondary outcomes are QoL changes at 6 weeks, clinical assessment of DVO, recurrence rate of deep venous thrombosis at 6 weeks and 12 months, and the total amount of working days lost. Intervention-specific outcomes include complications and patency.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The protocol is approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Academisch ziekenhuis Maastricht/Universiteit Maastricht, The Netherlands (protocol number NLNL55641.068.15 / METC 161008).We aim to publish the results of this study in a peer reviewed journal and present our findings at national or international conferences.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>The study protocol was registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> (registration number: NCT03026049) on 17 January 2017.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>vascular surgery</kwd><kwd>vascular medicine</kwd><kwd>radiology &#x00026;imaging</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Optimed GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The quality of life (QoL) of patients with post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) and May-Thurner syndrome (MTS) with or without a deep venous intervention has never been evaluated before.</p></list-item><list-item><p>It&#x02019;s a prospectively randomised designed trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The outcomes of this study will make it possible to differentiate QoL outcomes between patients with PTS and MTS.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Since this is a randomised trial, it is likely that there will be systematic difference between the patients who are willing to participate in this trial compared with those who are not.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The investigated interventional therapy requires in-depth knowledge and related clinical skills which may interfere with the replication of the related outcomes.</p></list-item><list-item><p>No haemodynamical data are available to indicate therapy.

Annually, about 1&#x02013;2 per 1000 people in Western European countries develop a DVT,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> in which 40% of cases affect the iliofemoral region.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> After a DVT, the blood clot should resolve by natural recanalisation of the vessel.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> However, in 59% of patients with iliofemoral DVT, the recanalisation process is inadequate which leads to vein scarification and venous outflow obstruction.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref> Subsequently, this may result in debilitating symptoms which are categorised in the post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS).<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> These symptoms may include pain, tired legs, venous claudication&#x000a0;(VC), cramps, oedema, hyperpigmentation or even venous ulcers.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref></p><p>As aforementioned, the second cause of venous outflow obstruction is an extraluminal obstruction, of which the iliac vein compression syndrome is most common. The best known iliac vein compression syndrome is the May-Thurner syndrome (MTS).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> MTS is generally characterised by a significant compression (&#x0003e;50%) of the left common iliac vein between the lumbar vertebral column and the right common iliac artery<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). Subsequently, this causes a venous outflow obstruction which leads to venous hypertension and related symptoms like leg swelling and pain. Besides the outflow obstruction, patients with MTS may have an increased risk of developing a DVT and patients with PTS may have an increased risk of developing a recurrence because of anatomical variance and related blood stasis.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Example of May-Thurner compression.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-017233f01"/></fig><p>The component of blood stasis is encompassed in the Virchow&#x02019;s triad in which a hypercoagulable state, vascular wall damage and venous stasis explain the development of a DVT. The pathological pathway of DVO is not completely understood, but is possibly related to these altered haemodynamics. Nowadays, the first two causes of Virchow&#x02019;s triad are encountered in the standardised treatment of an acute DVT or chronic post-thrombotic symptoms. Accordingly, the conventional treatment of DVO consists of elastic compressions stockings, exercise, lymph drainage therapy and the use of (pain) medication.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> For most patients, the physician selects one treatment or a combination of treatment modalities in an attempt to reduce the symptoms.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> However, the venous stasis component is not taken into account because until a few years ago no adequate therapy existed. The introduction of percutaneous angioplasty (PTA) and dedicated venous stents gave opportunities to treat this component. This procedure is already performed in various clinics around the world with good results, both on an individual basis as in case series.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;19</xref> Although no comparative studies have been performed, guidelines recommend that PTA as a single treatment should not be offered to patients with DVOs but a combination with stent placement can be considered and may result in resolution of symptoms.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref></p><p>Since patients with established DVO can experience a significant impact on their quality of life (QoL) which is comparable to chronic pulmonary disease or angina pectoris this is an important issue to focus on.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref> In the past, the effect of deep venous treatment on QoL has been investigated in small series. Furthermore, previous research has mainly focused on patency rates and complication outcomes after deep venous stenting.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Unfortunately, the perceived QoL after interventional treatment has never been compared with this perception after conventional treatment. Currently, there is a debate about the true additional QoL value of this interventional treatment. The aim of this study is to analyse the perceived short form 36 (SF-36) and the Veines-QoL/Sym QoL in patients treated with stenting compared with conventionally treated patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>This prospective randomised controlled, singe-blind study will be performed in the Maastricht University Medical Care Centre (MUMC).

Randomisation will be stratified for the PTS or MTS group. Patients in the intervention group will be scheduled and treated with regular interventional deep venous stenting. When performing an interventional treatment, patients should be administered to the patient ward for at least 24&#x02009;hours. The creatinine, haemoglobin and International Normalized Ratio (INR) levels will be checked before start of the procedure. INR levels above 4 should be treated with lowering the amount of used anticoagulant tablets and can result in postponement of the procedure until an INR level of&#x000a0;&#x0003c;2.5 has been reached.</p><p>The procedure will be performed in an angiosuite after cleansing and sterile draping of the abdomen and leg. Patients with MTS will be treated with local anaesthesia (lidocaine, 1%) and patients with PTS will receive sedation. All patients will have an intravenous infusion and the sedated patients will receive a urinary tract catheter. Percutaneous venous access will be performed by sonographic guided puncture of the popliteal, femoral, common femoral or jugular vein. After puncture of the vein, a sheet is introduced with radiological and contrast agent assistance. Second, a guide wire is passed along the affected segment and this segment is dilated with a PTA balloon (with 2&#x02009;mm overdilation). During the intervention a bolus of 5000 IE of heparin will be administered. Afterwards, one or multiple dedicated venous stents (Optimed, GmbH, Germany) will be deployed in the vein and postdilatation with a PTA balloon will follow to optimise the geometry of the stent. Lastly, all patients need to lie down for at least 3&#x02009;hours to ensure optimal closure of the percutaneous vessel puncture. Pneumatic stockings are used to increase the inflow when immobilised. All patients will receive therapeutic anticoagulation after stenting for a minimum of 6 months. In the bridging period low molecular weight heparins will be used until therapeutic anticoagulation levels are reached. After 6 months, the anticoagulation is continued if the patient was already on anticoagulation before the intervention. Also when stent related issues occur, the anticoagulation might be continued.</p><p>Conservative treatment consists of either one or a combination of the following items: pain medication, manual lymphatic drainage therapy, compression stockings and regular post-thrombotic anticoagulant therapy. The necessity of each therapy, except for therapeutic elastic stockings short (till knee) Class II, will be evaluated on an individual basis in interaction with both the patient as well as the treating physician.</p><p>In case of conservative management without any indications for prolonged anticoagulant therapy, this will not be started again.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Outcomes</title><sec id="s4b1"><title>Quality of life</title><p>QoL can be measured by numerous questionnaires, for example, with specifically general questionnaires and disease-specific questionnaires. The SF-36, is a widely&#x000a0;used questionnaire to measure the general QoL.</p><p>This questionnaire is composed of eight dimensions and mainly focuses on the patients&#x02019; experiences in which a high score in all dimensions reflects a good QoL.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>The Veines-QoL/Sym questionnaire is a 100-point disease-specific scoring questionnaire which can be used to evaluate the psychometric properties of venous disease. This census&#x000a0;paper is a valid and reliable instrument which has been used to evaluate outcomes in previous literature.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 26</xref></p><p>Both, the SF-36 and the Veines-QoL/Sym will be used to evaluate the effect of the treatment.</p><p>The primary outcome evaluated in this study, is the change in QoL measured by the Veines&#x000a0;QoL/Sym score in patients with DVO. The scores will be evaluated at baseline and after 12 months of follow-up. A comparison will be made between the intervention (stenting) group and the conservative group (individually based management with short, class II elastic compression stockings, exercise, lymph drainage therapy and the use of (pain) medication).</p><p>Secondary outcomes will be QoL change evaluated by the SF-36, EuroQOL-5D, and Pain Disability Index in patients with DVO. Equal to the primary outcome, these scores will be evaluated at baseline and at&#x000a0;12 months follow-up. A comparison will be made between the intervention group and the conservativegroup.</p></sec><sec id="s4b2"><title>Patency</title><p>The stent patency will be evaluated by DUS during every follow-up visit. Primary patency is defined as flow in the stent lumen without the need for additional interventional procedures due to stenosis or occlusion. Assisted primary patency is defined as flow in the stent lumen after additional stenting or PTA because of a stenosis with related clinical symptoms. Secondary patency is defined as flow in the stent lumen after additional thrombolysis, thrombectomy, creation of an AVF, re-stenting or PTA because of previous stent occlusion.</p></sec><sec id="s4b3"><title>Clinical outcomes</title><p>Venous claudication will be scored positive whenever patients experience onset or worsening of pain during (mild) exercise, which subsides during rest, especially when sitting or lifting the leg.</p><p>The Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) and the Villalta Score are clinical scores which have been validated for PTS.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Both scores will be analysed before and after treatment and changes will be compared between the intervention group and conservative group.</p><p>Since patients with MTS may have a higher chance of DVT, and patients with PTS have a higher chance of a&#x000a0;recurrent DVT, due to the outflow obstruction, the DVT recurrences will be registered.</p><p>Lastly, it is important to analyse the burden of working loss, as DVO can cause invalidating symptoms in daily practice. For this reason, the number of working days lost will be registered for both treatment groups in every follow-up visit. Furthermore, modifications in the time and type of work will be evaluated.</p><p>All outcomes will be evaluated at baseline, at 6 weeks&#x000a0;follow-up and at 12 months follow-up by an observer who is blinded to treatment assignment. In the intervention group, patency will be assessed at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months. When a stenosis or occlusion of the stent is seen, the date is registered. Further treatment will be offered and dates of additional treatment will be recorded.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Time line</title><p>Like in regular workup for patients with deep venous pathology, all eligible patients will have imaging of the veins by DUS and MRV or CTV. Related to these radiographic images, the extent of the obstruction or occlusion of the veins will be assessed.</p><p>Eligible patients will be contacted and offered the opportunity to participate in the study. After gaining informed consent, patients will be randomised to either conservative treatment or stenting at a 1:2 ratio.</p><p>At baseline and during all follow-up visits, patients will have a full clinical examination to assess the extent of complaints and clinical manifestations of DVO. The severity of complaints is scored using VCSS, Venous Claudication Score, highest C of CEAP and the Villalta Scale.</p><p>To assess QoL, the SF-36&#x000a0;V.2 will be used for generic QoL and the Veines-QoL/Sym will be used for the disease-specific QoL.</p><p>In all patients, a baseline as well as 12 months follow-up EDTA, serum and citrate blood sample (a total of 20&#x02009;mL) will be requested. All of these blood samples will be taken by the diagnostic lab and sent to the Biobank in Maastricht. Blood samples will be frozen for 15 years in order to perform possible future examinations.</p><p>Questions about having a (paid) job will be asked and registered at baseline and follow-up visits. All patients will visit the outpatient clinic at 6 weeks and 12 months after enrolment into the study. The assessment of all clinical scorings and questionnaires will be accompanied by an independent investigator who is blinded for the type of intervention.</p><p>Patients in the conservative treatment group will be asked to take off the therapeutic elastic stockings to obtain the blinding.</p><p>The patients in the intervention group will have additional visits at 2 weeks, 12 weeks and 6 months to assess the patency of the stents by DUS. When a stenosis or occlusion of the stent is seen, further treatment will be offered. In case of an occlusion this additional treatment can consist of either ultrasound-enhanced catheter-directed thrombolysis or thrombectomy with or without endophlebectomy and the creation of an AVF. In case of a significant stenosis, a PTA with or without re-stenting can be performed. Lastly, in both cases a conservative treatment will be discussed whenever clinical complaints are absent or mild.</p><p>After 12 months, all patients in the intervention group will receive CTV to evaluate the stent patency and stent position.</p><p><underline>Table 1.

For all analyses, a p value &#x02264;0.05 is being used to indicate statistical significance</p></sec><sec id="s9b"><title>Power calculation</title><p>The sample size calculation is based on the consideration that an improvement in QoL (from baseline to 12 months) of 14 points on the disease-specific Veines Qol/Sym questionnaire can be considered as minimally clinical relevant.

To account for loss to follow-up of&#x000a0;&#x000b1;10% of patients, a total of 130 patients need to be included (86 in the intervention group vs 44 in the conservatively treated group). We will perform a subgroup analysis (PTS vs MTS) to evaluate consistency of the effect of intervention across subgroups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s10"><title>Discussion</title><p>Previous systematic reviews have shown low complication rates (0%&#x02013;8.7%) and high technical successes (up to 98%) for deep venous stenting.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 16</xref> Reviews also show a relief of oedema and pain in up to 64%&#x02013;68%&#x02009;and, respectively, 82% of patients. Furthermore, primary patency rates between 32% and 98.7%&#x02009;and secondary patency rates of 66% to 96% are reported.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Although these reviews show favourable results, the outcomes are mainly based on retrospective, single-centre, cohort trials. Besides this, the main important outcome for patients, that is the QoL they experience in relation to their complaints, is not continuously examined.</p><p>Therefore, this research focuses on the reported QoL of patients with PTS and MTS. Moreover, the prospectively randomised design underlines the strength of this study. The outcomes of this study will clarify if the QoL in DVO will improve and to which extent it will change. Furthermore, this study will show if the QoL outcomes are comparable for both interventional treatment and conservative management. Additionally, it is possible to differentiate between outcomes in PTS and MTS. Since PTS and MTS are different entities, this study will focus on the effect in both patient groups and show the difference in QoL. We hypothesise that the change in QoL in patients with MTS will be different from patients with PTS since PTS causes DVO as well as venous insufficiency. With deep venous stenting, complaints related to valve reflux will not be treated and thus not all complaints will resolve.</p><sec id="s10a"><title>Limitations</title><p>Since this is a randomised trial, it is likely that there will be systematic difference between the patients who are willing to participate in this trial compared with those who are not. This can eventually lead to an outcome that cannot be translated to all patients with DVO. On&#x000a0;the contrary, the patients who are not willing to participate in this study, may not experience the symptoms in a way that their daily activities are affected&#x000a0;and so&#x000a0;will not opt for interventional treatment at all.</p><p>Second, MUMC is the most experienced centre in deep venous stenting in the Netherlands. The investigated interventional therapy requires in-depth knowledge and related clinical skills. This may interfere with&#x000a0;the replication of the interventional treatment and specifically the related outcomes across other institutions.</p><p>If a similar randomized controlled trial would be performed in other countries, it would be beneficial to pool all data and perform a meta-analysis. However, the treatment diagnostics and definition of an MTS should be standardised to compare actual outcomes. Especially, the definition of MTS may alter the decision to perform a deep venous intervention.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In our centre, treatment is based on a combination of DUS, MRV and phlebography showing a compression of&#x000a0;&#x0003e;50%&#x02009;and apparent collaterals. Other countries may use an intravascular ultrasound to plan their treatment decisions. The pooling of these data in a meta-analysis may be a challenge.</p></sec><sec id="s10b"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This study is financially supported by Optimed GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany, unrestricted grant number 155025 (CTCM).
