We investigated the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a behavioural activation intervention (BeatIt) for people with intellectual disabilities and depression. BeatIt was compared with a guided self-help intervention (StepUp).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We did a multicentre, single-blind, randomised, controlled trial with follow-up at 4 months and 12 months after randomisation. Participants aged 18 years or older, with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities and clinically significant depression were recruited from health and social care services in the UK. The primary outcome was the Glasgow Depression Scale for people with a Learning Disability (GDS-LD) score at 12 months. Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with ISCRTN, number ISRCTN09753005.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Between Aug 8, 2013, and Sept 1, 2015, 161 participants were randomly assigned (84 to BeatIt; 77 to StepUp); 141 (88%) participants completed the trial.

BeatIt was not cost-effective when compared with StepUp, although the economic analyses indicated substantial uncertainty. Treatment costs were only approximately 3&#x000b7;6&#x02013;6&#x000b7;8% of participants' total support costs. No treatment-related or trial-related adverse events were reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>This study is, to our knowledge, the first large randomised controlled trial assessing individual psychological interventions for people with intellectual disabilities and mental health problems.

Approximately 2% of adults and 3&#x000b7;5% of children have an intelligence quotient (IQ) of less than 70, although this figure might be rising because of increasing life expectancy, improving survival outcomes of babies with very low birthweight, and increasing maternal age.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref></p><p id="para20">Depression is as common in adults with intellectual disabilities as in the general population, with a point prevalence of about 5%.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> The disorder is more enduring for these adults than for the general population, suggesting it is either a more severe condition or more poorly managed than in the general population. For example, a study with a British cohort found that adults with intellectual disabilities were four times more likely than the non-intellectually disabled population to meet criteria for chronic depression over a 28-year period.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref></p><p id="para30">Although psychological therapies have become established first-line interventions for depression in the general population, this has not been the case for adults with intellectual disabilities, because of the additional complexities involved in making these interventions accessible to adults with cognitive and verbal communication impairments. Awareness of the inequity in provision of psychological therapies has grown, but substantial limitations remain in the existing evidence base and in its implementation. The available literature was reviewed for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> on mental health problems in people with intellectual disabilities. A key recommendation was for modifications to and trials of psychological interventions to ensure they are accessible to adults with intellectual disabilities.</p><p id="para40"><boxed-text id="cetextbox10"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><p id="para50"><bold>Evidence before this study</bold></p><p id="para60">In September, 2016, a review for the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guideline for mental health problems in people with learning disabilities reported that the only available evidence on psychological interventions for depression in people with intellectual disabilities was for cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), adapted for people with intellectual disabilities. Of 130 studies identified in that review, three randomised controlled trials and three controlled before-and-after studies investigated CBT for treatment or prevention of depression in adults with intellectual disabilities. NICE concluded that CBT might result in a clinically meaningful reduction in depressive symptoms when compared with treatment as usual at a follow-up of 38 weeks, but graded the evidence as being of very low quality.</p><p id="para70"><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p id="para80">This study is, to our knowledge, the largest randomised controlled trial of individual psychological therapy for adults with intellectual disabilities published to date. Participants were successfully recruited and randomly assigned to receive manualised individual psychological therapies for depression. Participant retention was 88%, and therapies were delivered with excellent fidelity to the manuals. Significant reductions in depression scores were apparent by the end of treatment for both BeatIt and StepUp, and were maintained at 12 months after randomisation. Neither treatment was better than the other. The long-term nature of the follow-up period (12 months after randomisation) and the health economic analysis of the psychological interventions also make important contributions to the existing scientific literature.</p><p id="para90"><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p id="para100">High-quality randomised controlled trials of individual psychological therapies can be done in adults with intellectual disabilities and mental health problems such as depression. Psychological interventions such as behavioural activation and guided self-help can be manualised and used as first-line interventions for adults with intellectual disabilities and depression. Moreover, health-care workers can be trained and supervised to deliver behavioural activation and guided self-help as part of their regular practice, without requiring specialist therapists.</p></boxed-text></p><p id="para110">In behavioural activation, the focus of the intervention is on behaviour change rather than cognition, emphasising engagement with potential environmental reinforcers.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> In the general population, behavioural activation has been shown to be as effective as antidepressant medications, and superior or equivalent to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), pill-placebo, and treatment as usual among patients with more severe depression,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> with effects lasting as long as those for CBT following treatment termination.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Non-specialist health-care workers can be trained to deliver behavioural activation.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Although there have been promising developments in CBT approaches for people with intellectual disabilities, including a recent pilot randomised controlled trial of a computerised intervention,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> behavioural activation might be more accessible than CBT for people with intellectual disabilities, since it is less cognitively demanding. We therefore aimed to assess the effectiveness of behavioural activation for people with intellectual disabilities and depression. The study reported here was informed by a pilot open trial of behavioural activation alone in people with intellectual disabilities, done at one site.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Outcomes from the pilot study showed evidence of a reduction in depressive symptoms for those able to self-report on the Glasgow Depression Scale for people with a Learning Disability (GDS-LD)<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> before and after the intervention, and at a 3 month follow-up after the end of treatment.</p></sec><sec id="cesec20"><title>Methods</title><sec id="cesec30"><title>Study design and participants</title><p id="para120">We did a multicentre, single-blind, randomised controlled trial comparing adapted behavioural activation (BeatIt) with guided self-help (StepUp). At the request of the funder, the comparator was not treatment as usual. We also did an accompanying health economic evaluation of the interventions. Nested qualitative studies exploring the experiences of participants, supporters, and therapists will be reported elsewhere.</p><p id="para130">An internal pilot phase was done in Scotland before opening additional study sites in England and Wales. Participants were recruited mostly from specialist intellectual disabilities health services (not specifically mental health services) and social care services, with some recruited from Improving Access to Psychological Therapy (IAPT) services in Lancashire. IAPT services provide first-line psychological interventions for all adults in England with mental health problems. Inclusion criteria were mild to moderate intellectual disabilities, measured by a score of 75 or less on the Weschler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence;<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> the ability to provide informed consent; age 18 years or older; and clinically significant depression as assessed by the Diagnostic Criteria for Psychiatric Disorders for use with Adults with Learning Disabilities.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Participants also needed to have a supporter (a staff member, family member, or friend) who could provide support in therapy sessions. Participants who were actively suicidal or having difficulties that would prevent them from interacting with the therapist or retaining information from sessions (eg, late-stage dementia), were excluded. Those participating in the trial did not receive another psychological therapy for depression while they were receiving either BeatIt or StepUp.</p><p id="para140">Information was provided and presentations were made to health and social care services about the trial. Professionals identified individuals they were working with who might be suitable and passed on details of the study, with advice to talk through the information with a support person of their choosing, since potential participants had few, if any, literacy skills. The researcher then arranged to meet with those who replied, ordinarily alongside a support person, and talked through the information sheet. If the participant was satisfied with the researcher's answers to any questions they had, they were invited to choose whether or not they would like to take part in the study. The West of Scotland Research Ethics Committee 3 gave national approval for the study (NRES: 13/MH97). The full trial protocol has been published.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="cesec40"><title>Randomisation and masking</title><p id="para150">Participants who gave written informed consent (they were asked to sign the consent form and their signature was witnessed by a carer or someone independent of the study) were screened and provided baseline data before being randomly assigned. Individuals were allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive the BeatIt or StepUp intervention, by use of block randomisation. Mixed block sizes of length four and six were used at random. Randomisation was stratified by study centre and use of antidepressants. Changes in the prescription of antidepressants and other mood-stabilising drugs were monitored for the duration of the study.</p><p id="para160">To conceal the allocation of participants from the research team, each participant was randomly assigned to a treatment group by use of an automated system run by the Robertson Centre for Biostatistics (University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK). The system did not reveal the random allocation to the researcher but notified the study coordinator, who then contacted clinicians to arrange subsequent treatment visits. Thus, the researchers collecting outcome data remained unaware of the intervention group to which participants had been assigned. Processes were in place to ensure researchers continued to be unaware of participants' designations over the course of their involvement in the trial. On the two occasions that researchers were unmasked, both during the process of arranging data collection, the participants were reassigned to another researcher.</p></sec><sec id="cesec50"><title>Procedures</title><p id="para170">The BeatIt intervention was a 12-session manualised approach<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> based on a published protocol and carefully adapted and successfully piloted in people with intellectual disabilities. The focus of the intervention was on increasing activity, scheduling activity, and addressing barriers to achieving engagement in activity. The first stage of therapy involved obtaining an insight into the participant's pattern of life and sharing a formulation of their difficulties linked to the underpinning theory of behavioural activation, before working to increase the participant's engagement and overcome emotional and organisational barriers to change. Therapy ended with a plan to maintain or continue progress.</p><p id="para180">The eight-session guided self-help intervention, StepUp,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> was chosen as the comparator because it was deemed similar to BeatIt in terms of therapist attention, use of a structured, manualised approach, and the presence of a supporter. The self-help materials had been developed before the study by a member of the research team. StepUp was thought to differ from BeatIt in relation to the active components of the intervention, which were perceived to be less person-centred and essentially psychoeducational. After building rapport in the first session, a series of four booklets provided a focus for the next five sessions. The booklets concerned depression and factors linked to low mood, sleep, physical activity, and problem solving. Therapy finished with a review of all booklets and then a final session making a plan for their continued use.</p><p id="para190">In addition to ensuring that the materials and exercises from both interventions were accessible and engaging, a key adaptation was delivery of the therapy alongside a support person. These were individuals who were able to provide support in sessions and who were therefore available for a minimum of 2 h per week. For BeatIt, people with intellectual disabilities ordinarily relied on others for support to engage in activity and negotiate change. Those taking part in StepUp typically needed help with understanding the booklets and using them in their everyday lives. The involvement of supporters also ensured that participants had help to maintain therapeutic gains once the interventions had finished.</p><p id="para200">Both interventions were delivered on an outreach basis, by community nurses and allied health professionals with experience of working with people who have intellectual disabilities. Some IAPT workers were also involved. All therapists received 1&#x02013;2 days of training in the delivery of the intervention and were supervised by clinical psychologists. All therapists were asked, where possible, to record two sessions selected by the trial coordinator, for the purpose of establishing fidelity to the manual and quality of therapy delivery.</p></sec><sec id="cesec60"><title>Outcomes</title><p id="para210">The primary outcome measure was the GDS-LD score<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> at 12 months after randomisation.

Our study was powered to detect a mean between-group difference of 0&#x000b7;60 SD units or 3&#x000b7;14 points on the GDS-LD.</p><p id="para230">If the BeatIt group in the present study could achieve an 8&#x000b7;50-point improvement in GDS-LD scores at 12 months, then this outcome would allow for the StepUp group to show a 5&#x000b7;36-point improvement during the same time period (ie, 63% of the improvement in the BeatIt group). Alternatively, this outcome allowed for detection of a small improvement in the StepUp group in conjunction with a large, short-term improvement in the BeatIt group, followed by some regression. For example, if the BeatIt group showed an improvement from baseline to 12 months of 6&#x000b7;00 points, then the study would be powered to detect a difference if the mean improvement in the StepUp group was 2&#x000b7;86 points.</p><p id="para240">To have 90% power to detect this difference, this study required 60 participants in each group to provide outcome data at 12 months after randomisation. The primary analysis was an analysis of covariance adjusting for baseline GDS-LD score, which should have the same power to detect smaller intervention effects, depending on the level of correlation in scores over time.</p><p id="para250">There were no data to inform the effect of clustering of outcomes for participants with intellectual disabilities seen by each therapist. We assumed that each therapist would work with an average of nine participants (ie, several part-time therapists at each site) and we assumed an intraclass correlation of 0&#x000b7;025, resulting in the sample size being increased by 20% to 72 per group, or 144 in total. A recruitment target of 166 participants allowed for up to 13&#x000b7;3% of participants to be lost to follow-up.</p><p id="para260">The primary analysis compared GDS-LD scores at 12 months after randomisation between intervention groups, adjusting for baseline GDS-LD scores, study centre, and use of antidepressants at baseline as fixed effects within a mixed-effects linear regression model, including random intercepts for therapists. Similar methods were applied to the primary outcome measure at the immediate assessment after the intervention (4 months after randomisation) and to secondary outcome measures at each assessment point. These models were used to estimate between-group differences and within-group changes from baseline. Intraclass correlation coefficients were estimated as the ratio of the between-therapist variance to the sum of between-therapist and residual variance from these models. Additionally, for each outcome measure, data from both follow-up timepoints were analysed simultaneously by use of repeated measures models, adjusting for the baseline value of the outcome, stratification factors, and timepoint as fixed effects, with random intercepts for therapists and participants; intervention-by-time interactions were used to test whether any between-group differences varied over time.</p><p id="para270">Analyses of the primary outcome were repeated with multiple imputation to assess whether the results were sensitive to missing data. To impute missing values at each timepoint, prediction models were based on age, antidepressant use, and any previous or subsequent measurements of the primary outcome; these prediction models did not include randomised group. Models for the primary outcome were extended to explore the effects of baseline characteristics, including stratification factors, chronicity of depressive symptoms, life events, and history of previous psychological intervention. These models were extended with interaction terms, to assess whether between-group differences varied by subgroup.

None of the 24 serious adverse events were treatment or study related and they were all hospital admissions. Four BeatIt and five StepUp participants were admitted to a mental health ward, of whom two BeatIt and three StepUp participants presented with suicidal ideation. One attempted overdose was reported during the trial. The participant had been randomised but had not started therapy.</p><p id="para420">For the health economic analysis, missing data were less than 5% in both resource use and EQ-5D-Y questionnaires. A significant difference in baseline utilities between groups favoured StepUp. However, at the 4 month and 12 month follow-ups no significant difference in utilities was observed. After adjustment for missing data and baseline imbalance, the initial QALY gain favouring StepUp was reversed to favour BeatIt, although neither result was significant. Mean intervention costs differed significantly between groups, with BeatIt being around &#x000a3;769 (95% CI &#x000a3;622&#x02013;917) more expensive than StepUp. However, we found no significant difference in non-intervention costs or total costs (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). The incremental costs for StepUp versus BeatIt were &#x000a3;1593 (standard error &#x000a3;1827); the incremental adjusted QALYs were &#x02212;0&#x000b7;002 (standard error 0&#x000b7;043); and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio showed that BeatIt dominates (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). Although the adjusted multiple imputation results suggested that BeatIt dominates, the associated 95% CI ranges from BeatIt dominating to being dominated by StepUp, indicating substantial uncertainty. A dominated intervention is more costly and less effective than the comparator. The only certainty in the results is that the BeatIt intervention is more costly than StepUp. Exclusion of non-intervention costs and calculation of an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) solely with intervention costs for BeatIt compared with StepUp results in an ICER of &#x000a3;385&#x02008;000 per QALY gained (95% CI &#x000a3;8000 to dominated), which would not be considered cost-effective. The cost-effectiveness plane in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref> shows that incremental costs and QALYs are spread in all quadrants, indicating that there is uncertainty in the results (see the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref> for the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve).<fig id="fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Cost-effectiveness plane (multiple imputation, adjusted results)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr3"/></fig><table-wrap id="tbl3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Outcomes of health economics analyses (adjusted multiple imputation)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th align="left"><bold>StepUp</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>BeatIt</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Difference</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>p values</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>95% CI</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Intervention costs</td><td align="left">&#x000a3;1019 (&#x000a3;36&#x000b7;40)</td><td align="left">&#x000a3;1789 (&#x000a3;65&#x000b7;90)</td><td align="left">&#x02212;&#x000a3;769 (&#x000a3;75&#x000b7;10)</td><td align="left">0&#x000b7;000</td><td align="left">&#x02212;&#x000a3;917 to &#x02013;&#x000a3;622</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Non-intervention costs</td><td align="left">&#x000a3;27&#x02008;181 (&#x000a3;2491)</td><td align="left">&#x000a3;24&#x02008;630 (&#x000a3;2503)</td><td align="left">&#x000a3;2552 (&#x000a3;1807)</td><td align="left">0&#x000b7;160</td><td align="left">&#x02212;&#x000a3;1021 to &#x000a3;6215</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Total costs<xref rid="tbl3fn1" ref-type="table-fn">*</xref></td><td align="left">&#x000a3;27&#x02008;962 (&#x000a3;2347)</td><td align="left">&#x000a3;26&#x02008;369 (&#x000a3;2382)</td><td align="left">&#x000a3;1593 (&#x000a3;1827)</td><td align="left">0&#x000b7;384</td><td align="left">&#x02212;&#x000a3;2008 to &#x000a3;5194</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Total QALYs<xref rid="tbl3fn2" ref-type="table-fn">&#x02020;</xref></td><td align="left">0&#x000b7;655 (0&#x000b7;029)</td><td align="left">0&#x000b7;657 (0&#x000b7;031)</td><td align="left">&#x02212;0&#x000b7;002 (0&#x000b7;043)</td><td align="left">0&#x000b7;965</td><td align="left">&#x02212;0&#x000b7;085 to 0&#x000b7;082</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Data are mean (standard error).

Both interventions were associated with significant reductions in depressive symptoms. Within-group improvements were observed at 4 months after randomisation (at the end of treatment) and were maintained until the 12-month follow-up. The same pattern was found for secondary measures of mental health and wellbeing, with moderate to large effect sizes.</p><p id="para440">Given the similar outcomes for both interventions, it was unsurprising that we found no evidence that BeatIt is cost-effective when compared with StepUp. No differences in resource use were found at 12 months, although BeatIt did cost more to deliver than StepUp. However, overall, most of the support costs for participants in both treatment groups were not related to the treatments themselves: intervention costs were approximately 3&#x000b7;6&#x02013;6&#x000b7;8% of total support costs for participants.</p><p id="para450">A key question when interpreting these findings is whether the associated improvements in depressive symptoms simply reflect spontaneous recovery. The background characteristics of study participants indicate that many had unsuccessful treatment histories. Approximately two thirds of participants in both groups were taking antidepressants, and 20% allocated to BeatIt and 18% allocated to StepUp had received psychological therapy before enrolling in the trial, which suggests that these participants might have been at the severe and enduring end of the depression spectrum. It is known from UK birth cohorts that adults with intellectual disabilities have a more severe and enduring pattern of depression than the general population.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Moreover, the results of six small pilot trials<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> of psychological interventions for depression in people with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities reviewed by NICE<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> reported that for participants receiving treatment as usual, in all six studies, there was virtually no change in depression scores from baseline to follow-up, including up to 11 months after baseline. Consequently, it seems unlikely (although it cannot be ruled out) that the marked improvements in self-reported depressive symptoms in both BeatIt and StepUp groups were due to spontaneous recovery of symptoms.</p><p id="para460">No related serious adverse events were reported for either of the intervention groups. Although there were few withdrawals overall, there were more from the BeatIt group than from StepUp. This difference might, in part, reflect the greater number of BeatIt sessions and the higher expectations made of BeatIt participants, with the aim of supporting participants and supporters to engage in scheduled activities between sessions.</p><p id="para470">This study is, to our knowledge, the first randomised controlled trial of behavioural activation for people with intellectual disabilities and depression, and provides the first data collected about the use of guided self-help in this population. This study is also the first large-scale randomised controlled trial of any individually delivered psychological therapy for a mental health problem in people with intellectual disabilities. Overall, the successful delivery of the trial refutes a widely held contention that it is not possible to recruit people with intellectual disabilities into large-scale randomised controlled trials of individual psychological therapies.<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref></p><p id="para480">The main limitation of the trial was the absence of a treatment as usual condition. It might have been more difficult to recruit participants and deliver the intervention if participants faced the prospect of being randomly assigned to treatment as usual, especially since they were recruited through intermediaries who acted as gatekeepers, seeking help for those they support or those with whom they work. One of the main reasons a guided self-help intervention was selected as the comparison group was because it was seen as a less person-centred and more rigid psychoeducational approach than BeatIt, with a different set of active components from behavioural activation. What was not anticipated was the ability of therapists to personalise the materials, as highlighted in the strong fidelity scores for non-specific therapy factors, and the agency shown by the participants and their supporters to follow through on ideas and plans made in therapy sessions, as suggested in the nested qualitative studies to be reported elsewhere.</p><p id="para490">A potential limitation of the trial was the differential follow-up rate in the two randomised groups (81% for BeatIt <italic>vs</italic> 95% for StepUp). Some baseline characteristics were associated with dropout (eg, female sex, higher IPDL scores, higher ABS [responsibility] scores), but none of these characteristics translated into significant baseline differences between randomised groups for those with follow-up data (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). With the exception of EQ-5D-Y, we did not observe any between-group differences for study outcome measures at baseline, for those included in either the intention-to-treat or per-protocol analyses, and all analyses were adjusted for baseline values of the outcome being analysed, so differential follow-up is unlikely to have biased our results to a substantial degree.</p><p id="para500">In conclusion, the lessons learned from this study have important implications for the conduct of future trials of psychological therapies involving people with intellectual disabilities. The successful delivery of this trial, carried out in existing services, shows the possibility of training professional groups, who are already working with people who have intellectual disabilities and depression, to deliver focused psychological interventions such as behavioural activation and guided self-help. This implementation work is a priority and might help to address the inequities faced by people with intellectual disabilities, who often do not have access to psychological therapies for commonly occurring mental health problems.</p><p id="para510"><boxed-text id="cetextbox20"><p id="para520">For the online version of the <bold>British National Formulary</bold> see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.medicinescomplete.com" id="interrefs10">https://www.medicinescomplete.com</ext-link></p></boxed-text></p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref10"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cooper</surname><given-names>SA</given-names></name><name><surname>Smiley</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Morrison</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Williamson</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Allan</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Mental ill-health in adults with intellectual disabilities: prevalence and associated factors</article-title><source>Br J Psychiatry</source><volume>190</volume><year>2007</year><fpage>27</fpage><lpage>35</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17197653</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref20"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Maulik</surname><given-names>PK</given-names></name><name><surname>Mascarenhas</surname><given-names>MN</given-names></name><name><surname>Mathers</surname><given-names>CD</given-names></name><name><surname>Dua</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Saxena</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Prevalence of intellectual disability: a meta-analysis of population-based studies</article-title><source>Res Dev Disabil</source><volume>32</volume><year>2011</year><fpage>419</fpage><lpage>436</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21236634</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref30"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Collishaw</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Maughan</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Pickles</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Affective problems in adults with mild learning disability: the roles of social disadvantage and ill health</article-title><source>Br J Psychiatry</source><volume>185</volume><year>2004</year><fpage>350</fpage><lpage>351</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15458996</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sbref40"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>NICE</collab></person-group><chapter-title>Mental health problems in people with learning disabilities: prevention, assessment and management.
