However, little is known about whether this is dependent on the size of the meal. The purposes of this study were: i) to determine if the differential impact on blood glucose and insulin responses induced by contrasting GI foods is similar when provided in meals of different sizes, and; ii) to determine the relationship between the total meal glycemic load and the observed serum glucose and insulin responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Twelve obese women (BMI 33.7 &#x000b1; 2.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were recruited. Subjects received 4 different meals in random order. Two meals had a low glycemic index (40&#x02013;43%) and two had a high-glycemic index (86&#x02013;91%). Both meal types were given as two meal sizes with energy supply corresponding to 23% and 49% of predicted basal metabolic rate. Thus, meals with three different glycemic loads (95, 45&#x02013;48 and 22 g) were administered. Blood samples were taken before and after each meal to determine glucose, free-fatty acids, insulin and glucagon concentrations over a 5-h period.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>An almost 2-fold higher serum glucose and insulin incremental area under the curve (AUC) over 2 h for the high- versus low-glycemic index same sized meals was observed (p &#x0003c; 0.05), however, for the serum glucose response in small meals this was not significant (p = 0.38). Calculated meal glycemic load was associated with 2 and 5 h serum glucose (r = 0.58, p &#x0003c; 0.01) and insulin (r = 0.54, p &#x0003c; 0.01) incremental and total AUC. In fact, when comparing the two meals with similar glycemic load but differing carbohydrate amount and type, very similar serum glucose and insulin responses were found. No differences were observed for serum free-fatty acids and glucagon profile in response to meal glycemic index.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study showed that foods of contrasting glycemic index induced a proportionally comparable difference in serum insulin response when provided in both small and large meals. The same was true for the serum glucose response but only in large meals. Glycemic load was useful in predicting the acute impact on blood glucose and insulin responses within the context of mixed meals.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The extent of the postprandial serum glucose response results mainly from the combined effect of the amount and the glycemic index (GI) of carbohydrate contained in a food serving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The glycemic load (GL) corresponds to the product of each food item's GI and the amount of carbohydrate in a serving (g) divided by 100. This concept has recently been validated using isolated carbohydrate foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. It has been shown that by adjusting the amount of carbohydrate foods in order to obtain identical GL values, a similar blood glucose response is achieved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In addition, stepwise increases in GL produced proportional increases in glycemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>When mixed meals containing carbohydrate foods of contrasting glycemic index are consumed, it is known that the difference in postprandial blood glucose response is maintained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, the magnitude of this differential blood glucose response may be dependent on the meal size.</p><p>According to results from studies using isolated carbohydrate foods with contrasting GIs, a higher absolute difference in blood glucose response is anticipated as the meal size increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and, in proportional terms, this difference will be similar at any meal size. This situation can theoretically be predicted by calculating the total GL of a meal. Thus, in meals with equal GI-carbohydrate foods, the absolute difference in blood glucose response will increase as the amount of carbohydrate increases.</p><p>We aimed to test these assumptions in the present study by assessing the serum glucose response and other relevant blood variables, after consumption of small and large size meals with contrasting GI. The relationships between the meal GL and serum glucose and insulin responses were also tested. This study showed that meals with two contrasting GIs are equally able to differentially affect the serum insulin responses when provided in a small or large sized meal. Furthermore, direct associations between meal GL and serum glucose and insulin responses were observed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Twelve obese but otherwise healthy women (age 33.2 &#x000b1; 8.0 (mean and SD) years, weight 82.3 &#x000b1; 10.6 kg, BMI 33.7 &#x000b1; 2.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were recruited. Inclusion criteria were absence of clinical signs or symptoms of chronic disease as determined by physical examination and laboratory analyses, not dieting in the preceding 3 months, sedentary life style, not using medication, normal oral glucose tolerance test to rule out diabetes and glucose intolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and normal fasting lipid profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. All subjects gave their written informed consent to participate in the study. The Institute of Nutrition and Food Technology (INTA) Ethics Board approved the experimental protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental design</title><p>Subjects were asked to avoid any strenuous exercise and maintain their customary dietary intake for 48 h prior to the testing days. On 4 separate occasions, subjects came to INTA on the evening prior to the actual test day. After arrival they ate a standardized dinner containing 34 kJ/kg body mass providing 55% energy as carbohydrates, 25% as fat and 20% as protein. After an overnight fast of 12 h, a blood sampling i.v. cannula was inserted into the antecubital vein. Blood samples were taken at -15, -10 and -5 min (analysed as a pool) before the experimental meal, every 15 min for the first hour and every 30 min thereafter to complete a 5-h postprandial period. All tests were performed within 10 d of the anticipated onset of menses.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental meals</title><p>Meals were served at 08.40 hours and consumed within 20 min. They differed in size (large or small) and type of carbohydrate (high- or low-GI). Thus, the following 4 meals were administered: 1) high-GI/large meal; 2) high-GI/small meal; 3) low-GI/large meal; and 4) low-GI/small meal. Meal size for the large and small meals represented an energy supply equivalent to 49% and 23%, respectively, of the individually predicted basal metabolic rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In all meals the energy contributed by carbohydrates, fat and protein was 55%, 30%, and 15%, respectively. In order to achieve similar energy density for equal size meals with contrasting GI, water was added to the high-GI meals. Macronutrient composition and foods used in each meal are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Macronutrient composition was calculated using the Chilean Food Composition Database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and the food GI was obtained from published international tables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. For each meal, GI and GL were calculated according to the following formulae: GI (%) = &#x02211;(carbohydrate content of each food item (g) &#x000d7; GI)/total amount of carbohydrate in meal (g); GL (g) = &#x02211;(carbohydrate content of each food item (g) &#x000d7; GI)/100. Given the combination of varying total amount of carbohydrate and GI, there were two meals with similar GL (low-GI/large size and high-GI/small size) ultimately resulting in essentially three GL levels (low, medium and high) as shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. The assignment of subjects to receive each test meal was randomized first by meal size (small or large) and subsequently by GI (low or high). The first and second test meals in each pair were separated by 2&#x02013;5 d; the second pair of test meals was given approximately 28 d after the first pair.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Food composition and nutritional characteristics of the experimental meals.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" colspan="3"><bold>High glycemic meals</bold></td><td align="center" colspan="3"><bold>Low glycemic meals</bold></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center"><bold>Large meal</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Small meal</bold></td><td></td><td align="center"><bold>Large meal</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Small meal</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Liquid 12% fat milk</td><td align="center">328 &#x000b1; 8</td><td align="center">153 &#x000b1; 4</td><td align="left">Liquid 12% fat milk</td><td align="center">554 &#x000b1; 13</td><td align="center">259 &#x000b1; 6</td></tr><tr><td align="left">White bread</td><td align="center">149 &#x000b1; 3</td><td align="center">70 &#x000b1; 2</td><td align="left">Long-grain white rice (boiled 29')</td><td align="center">45 &#x000b1; 1</td><td align="center">21 &#x000b1; 1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Low-fat cheese</td><td align="center">37 &#x000b1; 1</td><td align="center">17 &#x000b1; 0</td><td align="left">Low-fat cheese</td><td align="center">51 &#x000b1; 1</td><td align="center">24 &#x000b1; 1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Sucrose</td><td align="center">15 &#x000b1; 0</td><td align="center">7 &#x000b1; 0</td><td align="left">Fructose</td><td align="center">22 &#x000b1; 1</td><td align="center">10 &#x000b1; 0</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Oil</td><td align="center">10 &#x000b1; 0</td><td align="center">5 &#x000b1; 0</td><td align="left">Pear (raw)</td><td align="center">133 &#x000b1; 3</td><td align="center">62 &#x000b1; 1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Butter</td><td align="center">3 &#x000b1; 0</td><td align="center">2 &#x000b1; 0</td><td align="left">Bran-cookies</td><td align="center">9 &#x000b1; 0</td><td align="center">4 &#x000b1; 0</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Water</td><td align="center">287 &#x000b1; 7</td><td align="center">133 &#x000b1; 3</td><td align="left">Oil</td><td align="center">14 &#x000b1; 0</td><td align="center">7 &#x000b1; 0</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Energy (kJ)</td><td align="center">3208 &#x000b1; 55</td><td align="center">1517 &#x000b1; 35</td><td></td><td align="center">3249 &#x000b1; 74</td><td align="center">1516 &#x000b1; 35</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Carbohydrate (g)</td><td align="center">111.0 &#x000b1; 1.9</td><td align="center">52.5 &#x000b1; 1.2</td><td></td><td align="center">112.3 &#x000b1; 2.6</td><td align="center">52.4 &#x000b1; 1.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Fat (g)</td><td align="center">22.3 &#x000b1; 0.4</td><td align="center">10.5 &#x000b1; 0.2</td><td></td><td align="center">22.6 &#x000b1; 0.5</td><td align="center">10.5 &#x000b1; 0.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Protein (g)</td><td align="center">30.6 &#x000b1; 0.5</td><td align="center">14.5 &#x000b1; 0.3</td><td></td><td align="center">31.0 &#x000b1; 0.7</td><td align="center">14.5 &#x000b1; 0.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Dietary fiber (g)</td><td align="center">5.4 &#x000b1; 0.1</td><td align="center">2.6 &#x000b1; 0.1</td><td></td><td align="center">6.4 &#x000b1; 0.3</td><td align="center">2.9 &#x000b1; 0.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Energy density (kJ/g)</td><td align="center">4.10 &#x000b1; 0.00</td><td align="center">4.18 &#x000b1; 0.01</td><td></td><td align="center">3.92 &#x000b1; 0.00</td><td align="center">3.93 &#x000b1; 0.02</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Glycemic load (g)</td><td align="center">95 &#x000b1; 8</td><td align="center">48 &#x000b1; 4</td><td></td><td align="center">45 &#x000b1; 4</td><td align="center">22 &#x000b1; 2</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Glycemic index %</td><td align="center">85</td><td align="center">85</td><td></td><td align="center">43</td><td align="center">43</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Mean &#x000b1; SD</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Blood sample analyses</title><p>Venous blood samples for glucose, insulin and FFA were collected in glass tubes and allowed to coagulate on ice for 10 min; serum was then separated at room temperature and stored immediately at -20&#x000b0;C until analysis.

The GI influenced the integrated (iAUC and tAUC) postprandial serum insulin responses over 2 and 5 h in both meal sizes (p &#x02264; 0.016, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). The difference in the serum insulin response for the large meal was observed for all time periods (0&#x02013;2 h, 0&#x02013;5 h, 2&#x02013;5 h) independent of the method of analyzing the postprandial response. On the other hand, for the small meal, the differential effect of GI over 5 h was accounted for in the early postprandial period (0&#x02013;2 h), when observing both serum insulin iAUC and tAUC. As observed for serum glucose response, a close relationship between GL and serum insulin iAUC was found over 2 h (r = 0.60, p &#x0003c; 0.01) and 5 h (r = 0.65, p &#x0003c; 0.01) with a virtually identical serum insulin response between the two similar GL meals.

However, differences did not reach significance for serum glucose response after the consumption of the small meal. On the other hand, meal GL predicted moderately well the serum glucose and insulin iAUCs and tAUCs. When the amount and type of carbohydrates (together with other macronutrients) present in the meal were adjusted to obtain similar GL values, highly comparable serum glucose and insulin iAUC and tAUC were elicited. In fact, virtually a straight line relationship between the meal GL and serum glucose and insulin responses was found. This relationship was observed despite quite different GI values. With regard to the magnitude of the differences in serum glucose iAUC obtained when meals of contrasting GI are eaten, these can be compared in relative or absolute terms. The relative difference between contrasting GI meals was similar for the small and large meals (about 1.6-fold over 5 h), whilst the absolute difference in median terms was 65 versus 158 mmol&#x000b7; l<sup>-1 </sup>&#x000b7;5 h<sup>-1 </sup>for the small and large meals, respectively. These results were predictable from the calculations of GL. This arises from the fact that for foods or meals with equal GI, as the amount of carbohydrate increases, a proportionally constant increase in blood glucose and insulin responses will be observed (e.g. a 2-fold increment in carbohydrate will result in about a 2-fold increase in serum glucose iAUC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Whereas when this is compared in absolute terms, the difference is amplified as a function of the increment in the amount of carbohydrate (see formulae in Methods). As a consequence, it is expected that the higher absolute difference is observed for the largest meal (ie, higher GL meal).</p><p>When mixed meals are consumed, other food and macronutrients will be present. In this study, the results were similar to those observed in studies using isolated carbohydrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and imply that other macronutrients had a negligible effect on the differential serum glucose and insulin responses. It has, in fact, been reported elsewhere that the amount and type of carbohydrate account for about 90% of the total variability in blood glucose response, whereas protein and fat in mixed meals scarcely contribute to the variance in blood glucose and insulin responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>In relation to other blood metabolic responses, this study and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] demonstrated that mixed meals comprising contrasting GI foods do not, or only slightly affect, the blood FFA response. Only in the late postprandial period (4&#x02013;5 h) was serum FFA suppression higher for the large versus small meals. This is an expected finding as a function of the higher serum insulin concentration observed during the early postprandial period. In terms of the effect of GI, the result was somewhat unexpected since increased serum FFA concentration was found for the high-GI, small meal. The biological relevance of these findings requires further research as it may be important for understanding disorders of insulin resistance, food intake regulation, and lipid metabolism. With regard to peripheral plasma glucagon levels, as found in other studies, no influence of meal GI or size was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>An aspect of this study that should be commented is the method (for which many choices exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]) chosen to analyze the integrated postprandial response. In order to estimate the food glycemic index in healthy subjects, the Food and Agriculture Organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] recommends the use of the incremental AUC, which was corroborated by Wolever [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] after comparing several analysis methods. This recommendation was made based on the fact that the outcome (i.e., GI) was independent of the subjects' characteristics (e.g., diabetic, healthy, etc). On the other hand, when different methods were employed to estimate the change in the blood glucose response before and after a 9-mo exercise program in overweight subjects, Potteiger et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] found no differences among the incremental, positive incremental or total AUCs for blood glucose. All of the methods were equally effective in measuring the impact of the intervention on glycemia. In the present study, a virtually identical conclusion was obtained using the incremental and total AUC for both serum glucose and insulin. Critical evaluation of this issue deserves further research.</p><p>In conclusion, this study showed that GI alone is unable to predict the glycemic impact when different amounts of carbohydrates are eaten. Furthermore, the use of GL to differentiate the acute impact on blood glucose and insulin responses induced by mixed meals is supported. This is relevant for epidemiological studies investigating the role of carbohydrates in non-communicable chronic diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JG conceived the study, participated in its design and coordination, and helped draft the manuscript.
