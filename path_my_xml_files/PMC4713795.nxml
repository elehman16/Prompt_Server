neglect in patients with chronic stroke. [Subjects] The subjects of this study included 30
patients with chronic unilateral neglect. [Methods] The subjects were randomly divided
into either the experimental group (EG) or control group (CG). All subjects received a
standard rehabilitation program. In addition to the standard rehabilitation, the EG
subjects received mental practice (5 days a week for 4 weeks) for 10 minutes. To compare
two groups, line bisection test (LBT) and star cancellation test (SCT) were conducted.
[Results] Both groups showed significant improvement in the LBT and SCT. There were
statistically significant differences in the changes in LBT, but there were no significant
differences in the changes in the SCT between both groups. [Conclusion] This study
demonstrated that mental practice may be a valuable additional rehabilitation method in
the chronic stage of neglect.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Mental practice</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Unilateral neglect</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Unilateral neglect is defined as a failure to attend, respond, or orient toward meaningful
stimuli provided in the opposite side of a brain lesion<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Spontaneous recovery of it is observed in a considerable number of
cases within the next few weeks<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>; However, some studies indicate that
unilateral neglect can be observed in several months after stroke<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the last two decades, several studies have investigated specific approaches to the
rehabilitation of unilateral neglect. Classically, constraint-induced movement therapy and
limb activation techniques with repeated movement of neglect side limbs are reported to be
helpful to reduction of the symptoms of unilateral neglect and improvement of functional
ability. However, unfortunately, these classical rehabilitative approaches required the
patients with stroke to move their extremities actively<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In stroke rehabilitation, mental practice has been used to improve physical function and
movement using motor and visual representation without actually executing any physical
activity so that it can be applied to the patient with low motor function. Mental practice
has been widely used because of its convenience, cost effectiveness, and safety<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The imagery of neglect side limb movement
is increasing the awareness of neglect side space and the body&#x02019;s image of the neglect side
limbs as well as facilitating the ability to learn motor tasks<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Several studies concluded some evidence on the effectiveness of the
mental practice in reduction of unilateral neglect<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, controversies on the most effective period and methods of
treatment phase exist in previous studies.</p><p>The effects of mental practice on patients with unilateral neglect have been reported
extensively, but only few clinical studies have been carried out which varied in design and
methods in their clinical setting<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, the this study was designed to investigate the effects of mental practice on
patients with unilateral neglect based on existing studies<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty patients with unilateral neglect after stroke were recruited to participate in this
study. The inclusion criteria for participation were as follows: (1) left hemiparesis with
onset duration of &#x0003e; 6 months; (2) patient with unilateral neglect (&#x0003e; 6.3&#x02005;mm deviation
of the true center of the line in the line bisection test)<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>; (3) cognition (&#x0003e; 23 points in the Korean version of Mini-Mental
Status Examination)<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>; (4) no hemianopsia
or apraxia; and (5) imagination ability (an average score &#x0003c; 3 in the Vividness of
Movement Imagery Questionnaire)<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. All
subjects provided written informed consent before participation in the study according to
the code of ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki, version 2004).
Eligible subjects were randomly assigned to experimental group (EG) or control group (CG)
based on a computer-generated randomization program by a research assistant under the blind
condition.</p><p>During the study period, all subjects followed a daily treatment schedule of a standard
rehabilitation program. In addition with the standard rehabilitation, EG subjects received
mental practice for additional 10 minutes (5 days a week for 4 weeks).</p><p>During mental practice, EG subjects mentally practiced positioning and movement of the left
upper limb intensively as possible in a repetitive fashion. EG subjects sat comfortably and
leaned back against the back rest with the feet on the floor and imagined the scene while
listening to the voice of the researcher for 10 minutes with the eyes closed. The contents
of mental practice were to pick up a baseball, a pencil, and a coin in the center of a body
using the left hand respectively, and then moved them into a basket lying on the left side.
Verbal feedback provided by the subjects assured correct execution of the imagery tasks.
Each task was repeated up to 10 times per session. In the beginning of each task, a break
time was given to patients in order to induce relaxation and concentrate internally on the
left arm.</p><p>The author referred to the instructions of previous studies on the mental practice<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. An example of the instruction for mental
practice is as follows: &#x0201c;Try to imagine how your left hand grasp the baseball lying in front
of you. Extend your left arm, then the elbow straightens. Feel the muscle tension in your
arm. Feel how the fingers press around the baseball and hold it. Move the baseball into a
basket lying on the left side. Feel how the elbow is moving and forearm is getting up
towards a basket. Feel the muscle tension in your arm needed to hold your arm. Feel the
tension in the hand and the fingers so that the baseball won&#x02019;t fall. Now release the
baseball and then feel the relaxation in the finger&#x0201d;</p><p>All subjects were assessed before and immediately after the 4 weeks intervention. For line
bisection test (LBT), the overall number of omissions of the 18 lines and the average
deviation score (mm) from the objective midline were determined<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The center of each bar was positioned at eye level
aligned to the patient&#x02019;s body sagittal plane. In five consecutive trials, subjects pointed
to the estimated center position using either a pencil or a stick. In star cancellation test
(SCT), target detection task is also presented to patients on an A4 sheet of paper. The test
comprises 52 darkened large stars, 10 short words, and 13 randomly laid out letters, which
are all spread around 56 filled small stars. Subjects were instructed to cross out all
targets, which are subdivided into 6 sections with 27 on each side<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The number of found stars was counted as scores in this
study. All clinical measures were administered by the blinded assessor.</p><p>All data analyses were performed using SPSS version 20.0 Using Shapiro-Wilk test, normal
distribution of the variables was not found, therefore, non-parametric tests were used. The
&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare difference between group means
and changes in values, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to test differences in
continuous variables within groups. Statistical significance was accepted for values of p
&#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>After applying the inclusion criteria, 30 subjects fulfilled the inclusion criteria and

with stroke. The results of this study indicate that the mental practice may have
therapeutic benefits for unilateral neglect and is consistent with the results of previous
studies<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Perceiving neglect as an attentional disorder<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>, mental practice can be assumed to facilitate a directing of
attention towards the neglected side of the body, objects, and space which does not
automatically imply that attention can also be better directed toward the left side of
objects.</p><p>Although the effects of mental practice on unilateral neglect in patients with stroke have
been confirmed, the effects were a little bit different depending on the clinical
measures<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The result of this study
showed that no significant difference between the groups was found in the SCT, but there was
statistically significant difference between two groups in the LBT. From this puzzling
result, it can be conceivable that the LBT and SCT test are qualitatively different tasks
that evoke different spatial processing mechanism. The LBT requires the subjects to focus on
the horizontal extent of one single specific object. On the other hand, the SCT requires the
subjects to scan randomly structured multiple object arrays. Therefore, attention in SCT is
more related to visuospatial exploration of different and successive locations on the
display<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Several studies have found that stroke patients often orient their bodies and heads toward
the side of their lesion even when there is no evidence of unilateral neglect<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. These findings suggest that focus on remediation of gaze and
scanning alone is unlikely to be the most effective way to improve visual attention in
patients with stroke. Mental practice may represent an alternative approach or also a
contribution to the conventional rehabilitation. Also the combination of mental practice and
conventional occupational therapy may generally be the most promising approach.</p><p>Limitation of this study includes: First, in this study, the effects of mental practice on
unilateral neglect were not measureable by all employed neglect tests. One reason might be
due to the fact that some neuropsychological tests such as the copying and drawing tasks are
less sensitive than SCT and that the scoring of these tasks is also less objective<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Second, this study used a written
examination only for the assessment of unilateral neglect. Since there are many cases of
unilateral neglect clinically in the patient&#x02019;s daily life in spite of normal performance in
the written examination<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>, Azouvi et
al.<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that behavioral
assessment showed higher sensitivity when it was together with a written examination, rather
than when a written examination was used alone.</p><p>The long-term follow-up effects of mental practice were not identified by this study.
Therefore, further controlled studies with lager sample sizes and longer interventions are
needed to clarify the clinical benefits of mental practice as a rehabilitation approach for
stroke patients with unilateral neglect.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Heilman</surname><given-names>KM</given-names></name><name><surname>Watson</surname><given-names>RT</given-names></name><name><surname>Valenstein</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Neglect and related disorders</article-title>.
