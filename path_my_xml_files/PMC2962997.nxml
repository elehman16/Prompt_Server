This study compared EC T and imipramine (IMN) prescribed as the first line of treatment in major depression, Drug-naive, consenting, DSM-IV major depression patients (n=28), were randomized to receive either bilateral ECTs or IMN (225 mg/d) for four weeks. Severity of depression was scored at twice weekly intervals. Subjective side effects were scored at second and fourth week. Patients had significant reductions in depression scores over time but there were no differences between the two treatment groups. The rate of antidepressant response did not significantly differ between the two groups. ECT group had significantly fewer side effects. IMN offered therapeutic response comparable to ECT without compromising on the speed of antidepressant response, but caused more side effects.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Major depression</kwd><kwd>ECT</kwd><kwd>imipramine</kwd><kwd>therapeutic efficacy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></article>
