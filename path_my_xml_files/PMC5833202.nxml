In a recent study, we observed major strength impairments in shoulder external rotation and abduction (~30%) in a population of patients with pronounced and long-lasting SIS. However, the current rehabilitation of such strength impairments may be inadequate, with novel rehabilitation programmes including exercise therapy only improving external rotation strength by 4&#x02013;13%.</p><p id="Par2">As these previous studies are the basis of current practice, this suggests that the strengthening component could be inadequate in the rehabilitation of these patients, and it seems likely that more emphasis should be placed on intensifying this part of the rehabilitation.</p><p id="Par3">The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of a programme consisting of progressive home-based resistance training using an elastic band, aimed at improving shoulder external rotation and abduction strength, added to usual care and initiated shortly after diagnosis has been established.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par4">A pragmatic randomised controlled superiority trial will be conducted, including 200 patients with pronounced and long-lasting SIS, diagnosed using predefined criteria. Participants will be randomised to receive either an add-on intervention of progressive home-based resistance training using an elastic band in addition to usual care or usual care alone in a 1:1 allocation ratio. The randomisation sequence is computer generated, with permuted blocks of random sizes. The primary outcome will be change in Shoulder Pain And Disability Index (SPADI) score from baseline to 16 weeks follow-up. Outcome assessors are blinded to group allocation.

Nearly half of these incidents are categorised as subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], a painful, and often long lasting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], condition affecting patient function and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In Denmark, the incidence of SIS reported in primary care is approximately 8 per 1000 inhabitants per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Further, with an average yearly cost per incident case of shoulder disorder of &#x020ac;4000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], as reported in Sweden, the societal costs related to SIS are noteworthy. However, most of the costs (74%) are related to a sub-group of patients (12%) with high pain intensity and more pronounced and long-lasting disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In this sub-group, sick leave from paid work accounts for more than half (61%) of the costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">The latest systematic review on the efficacy of exercise therapy in the treatment of SIS suggests that an exercise intervention improves patient-reported function and pain in patients with long-lasting SIS (&#x02265;&#x02009;3 months), to a degree equivalent to surgery followed by post-operative rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In addition, an intervention including specific exercises significantly reduced the amount of operations in patients on the waiting list for surgery for SIS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Consistent with these studies, the Danish national clinical guidelines for treatment of SIS recommends an exercise intervention lasting at least 3 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, it is unknown which specific components of the heterogeneous exercise interventions are associated with a better outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and, though not demonstrated in patients with long-lasting SIS, patient adherence to the prescribed exercise interventions is also likely to moderate the effects of such interventions.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Mechanisms</title><p id="Par23">Resistance training, aimed at strengthening the rotator cuff muscles and scapula stabilising muscles, is an important component of most novel exercise interventions for long-lasting SIS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This seems relevant as patients with SIS have significant force impairments in both the glenohumeral and the scapulothoracic joint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, these force impairments are most pronounced in the glenohumeral joint, with a 33% deficit in external rotation force and a 29% deficit in abduction force compared to only 8% and 18% force deficit in protraction and retraction of the scapula, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This suggests that specific training of the glenohumeral muscles is especially relevant. Such specific resistance training of the, often degenerated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], rotator cuff muscles and tendons also seems relevant as this training modality is known to improve muscle and tendon health through various pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Need for a trial</title><p id="Par24">It is uncertain if the novel exercise intervention programmes, aimed at patients with long-lasting SIS, are focusing sufficiently on strengthening exercises. Accordingly, changes in muscle force are only tested in a few randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including resistance training in the rehabilitation of patients with SIS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In these studies, maximum force in external rotation increased by only 4&#x02013;15% in average from baseline to follow-up in patients doing strengthening exercises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], which is far from restoring the 33% impairment in external rotation force previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Though strength gain may not be the primary aim of the intervention, the sparse effect on this objective outcome points towards a possible gap in the rehabilitation of patients with long-lasting SIS. This suggests that the exercise dose received by patients might have been too small, either because the prescribed resistance training programmes were too mild, or simply due to lack of adherence to the prescribed programmes. The trial described in this protocol will aim to investigate the effectiveness of adding a simple shoulder strengthening exercise programme to usual care in patients with long-lasting SIS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Existing knowledge</title><p id="Par25">To further ensure that we do not initiate a redundant trial, we have performed a systematic literature review. On January 26, 2016, we performed a systematic literature search on controlled trials investigating the effect of resistance training in patients with SIS. We searched Medline via PubMed (86 hits) and Embase via OVID (38 hits) using search strings for condition (shoulder impingement) and intervention (resistance training). We also searched <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> for registered (finalised, ongoing or planned) trials. We only identified one trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] in which the effect of resistance training was isolated as the active part of the intervention. Additionally, in a recent systematic review, only one study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] investigating the effect of an exercise intervention in patients with persistent SIS was identified, and in that study the exercise intervention was compared to surgery. In conclusion, the existing evidence regarding the effect of resistance training in patients with persistent SIS is very limited and we therefore consider this to provide a clear-cut ethical, scientific and economic justification for the trial described in this protocol.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Dose selection</title><p id="Par26">As previously stated, the exercise dose received by patients might have been too small in previous studies, either because the prescribed resistance training programmes were too mild or simply due to lack of adherence to the prescribed programmes. In the study by Lombardi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], patients allocated to an intervention consisting of supervised strengthening exercises only increased 9% in external rotation strength (derived from Lombardi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]), which was not significantly different from the waiting list control group. As exercise sessions were supervised, this absence of effect is likely a consequence of the prescribed dose being too small, with exercises for flexion, extension, internal and external rotation performed twice a week in 8 weeks with 2 &#x000d7; 8 repetitions at 50% and 70% of 6RM, respectively. One way to efficiently increase the exercise dose in rehabilitation is to include home-based exercises, as was done in a study by Bennell et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In that study, an intervention consisting of manual therapy and home exercises was found superior to placebo in improving abduction strength (significant 15% increase), but not external rotation strength (non-significant 4% increase), pain scores or patient-reported function at the end of treatment. The limited gains in shoulder strength observed in the study by Bennell et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] might also be a consequence of an insufficient exercise dose received by the patients. However, it is difficult to determine whether the sparse improvements in shoulder strength are due to the programme being too mild or because of low adherence, as the amount of external resistance applied to exercises is not described. Nevertheless, exclusion of non-adherent patients from the analyses did not alter the results, indicating that the sparse improvements in shoulder strength were not only due to low adherence.</p><p id="Par27">In the current study, we aim to increase the received dose of strengthening exercises aimed at the rotator cuff muscles in patients with long-lasting SIS without aggravating their symptoms and with minimal risk of adverse events. To achieve this, the intervention will start with exercises using low relative resistance but high volume (number of sets per session and frequency of sessions). This approach is also relevant, as resistance training with low intensity/resistance, high frequency and approximately 3&#x02013;4 sets per muscle group is associated with the highest gains in muscle strength in untrained individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. All sets are to be continued to failure, as this maximises the gain in local muscle endurance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, the low resistance will minimise pain during exercises and protect the muscle from overload injuries, ensuring that all patients are able to complete the programme.</p><p id="Par28">The focus of exercises is on isometric holds and slow dynamic strengthening with a long time under tension (TUT). A high TUT is achieved through exercises with a low contraction velocity and the inclusion of an isometric component to increase the exercise stimulus without increasing external resistance; this in turn reduces the peak load on the involved, and possibly damaged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], muscles and tendons. Thus, exercises become safer and less painful, which again will allow patients to actually adhere to the exercise intervention. Furthermore, the isometric part will be performed with the shoulder in approximately 30&#x02013;45 degrees of scaption, the position in which the compression forces on the supraspinatus muscle and tendon are lowest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Exercises will mainly focus on external rotation and abduction, functions in which both supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles are highly active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Possible effect modifiers</title><p id="Par29">Patients with long-lasting SIS have lower mechanical pressure pain thresholds (PPT), both at the shoulder region and in other anatomical regions (such as the tibialis anterior), which may reflect an increased manifestation of peripheral and central pain sensitisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Pain sensitisation modulates the patients&#x02019; pain experience and, furthermore, the presence of hyperalgesia or referred pain before decompression surgery significantly worsens the outcome after 3 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], while more pain catastrophizing is related to persistence of symptoms in patients with long-lasting SIS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. It therefore seems likely that manifestations of peripheral and central pain sensitisation, and peripheral adaptations to long-lasting pain, could also affect the outcome of an exercise intervention. This could be either through an alteration in adherence to the intervention due to pain sensitisation, or through other mechanisms related to central pain sensitisation and peripheral adaptations.</p><p id="Par30">The effect of scapula function on treatment outcome in patients with SIS is often debated, and one could argue that the increased emphasis on rotator cuff muscles, as is proposed in the current trial, would neglect an important aspect of the rehabilitation. Accordingly, it has been suggested that rotator cuff emphasis should only be after scapula control is achieved, as insufficient dynamic stability of the scapula could cause abnormal shoulder kinematics and impingement symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Assuming this, the effect of the add-on intervention in the current study, focusing mainly on strengthening exercises for the rotator cuff, could be modified be the presence of scapula dyskinesis. However, Mulligan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] recently found that treatment outcome was not significantly different between patients randomised to scapula stabilisation first, or rotator cuff strengthening first, questioning the importance of maintaining a scapula focus in the beginning of rehabilitation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Explanation for choice of comparators</title><p id="Par31">This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of adding a simple shoulder strengthening exercise programme to usual care in patients with long-lasting SIS. Therefore, the relevant control condition is usual care, which is to be compared to the intervention condition involving an add-on exercise programme and usual care.</p><p id="Par32">This is relevant because usual care for patients that are covered by the Danish National Guidelines for Treatment of SIS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and hence have a medically justified need for general rehabilitation, is referral to general rehabilitation under the Danish health act &#x000a7; 140. Such rehabilitation is likely based on the most novel evidence from previously mentioned RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], where only limited gains in muscle strength are found. It therefore seems unlikely that the current treatment addresses the issue of glenohumeral muscle strength to a sufficient degree.</p><p id="Par33">Furthermore, direct monitoring of adherence to the add-on intervention makes it possible to conduct secondary analysis, investigating the relationship between exercise adherence and changes in both strength and patient-reported function.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Objectives</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Primary research question</title><p id="Par34">Based on the literature reviewed in the &#x0201c;Background&#x0201d; section, we asked the following research question:</p><p id="Par35">Is a 16-week simple home-based shoulder strengthening exercise programme, in addition to usual care, superior to usual care alone for improving patient-reported shoulder function 16 weeks after baseline, measured using the Shoulder Pain And Disability Index (SPADI), in patients with persistent (&#x0003e;&#x02009;3 months) subacromial impingement syndrome referred to further examination at a hospital?</p><p id="Par36">The research question was framed using the PICOT model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] with the following options for each element:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par37"><bold><underline>P</underline></bold>opulation: Patients with persistent SIS (&#x0003e;&#x02009;3 months)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par38"><bold><underline>I</underline></bold>ntervention: 16-week simple home-based shoulder strengthening exercise programme added to usual care</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par39"><bold><underline>C</underline></bold>ontrol: Usual care</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par40"><bold><underline>O</underline></bold>utcome: Patient-reported shoulder function</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par41"><bold><underline>T</underline></bold>ime frame: 16 weeks after baseline</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Primary objective</title><p id="Par42">The primary objective is therefore to investigate the effectiveness of adding a 16-week simple home-based shoulder strengthening exercise programme to usual care, compared to usual care alone, on changes in patient-reported shoulder function (SPADI score) from baseline to end of treatment (16 weeks) in patients with SIS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Primary research hypothesis</title><p id="Par43">Our hypothesis is that a 16-week simple home-based shoulder strengthening exercise programme, in addition to usual care, is superior to usual care alone for improving patient-reported shoulder function 16 weeks after baseline, measured using the SPADI, in patients with persistent (&#x0003e;&#x02009;3 months) subacromial impingement syndrome referred to further examination at a hospital.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Secondary objectives</title><p id="Par44">

In the previously described studies that include unsupervised resistance training in rehabilitation of SIS patients, monitoring adherence is either done using a log-book filled in by the patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] or not described at all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Using only patient-reported measures of adherence may limit the possibility of detecting which exercise dose is actually received by the patient. Accordingly, in a recent systematic review, the authors did not identify a single measure of patient-reported adherence to unsupervised home-based rehabilitation exercises to be sufficiently investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Furthermore, findings from one previous study revealed that the dose of exercises reported in exercise diaries were 2.3 times higher than that collected through a system which monitored the exact TUT, being the total time a muscle resists weight during each set [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. This clearly underlines the relevance of collecting objective data on exercise adherence. In addition, it seems unlikely that patients are always able to &#x02018;take&#x02019; precisely the exercise dose prescribed. This issue was unfolded in a recent study, revealing that, just 2 weeks after initial instructions, only 7 out of 29 young healthy individuals were able to use the correct TUT, when performing shoulder exercises with an elastic band [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p id="Par59">In the SExSI-Trial, adherence to the add-on progressive high volume resistance training intervention will be captured using the BandCizer<sup>&#x000a9;</sup>. The BandCizer<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> is a small device which is mounted on the elastic band during exercises to measure the TUT, number of repetitions and total work load for all exercises performed. Exactly TUT is a promising objective measure of exercise adherence, for which the BandCizer<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> is specifically developed and validated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. By directly monitoring the actual TUT for the prescribed exercises a more precise and objective distinction between adherent and less adherent patients will be possible.</p><p id="Par60">In both the intervention group and the control group, the time spent on exercises related to usual care will be monitored by self-report, using a text-message based system (SMS-track<sup>&#x000a9;</sup>). Each week all participants will receive a text-message question regarding the time spent on exercises performed for their shoulder disorder. Participants in the intervention group will be instructed not to include the time spent on the add-on intervention in this report.</p><p id="Par61">In the intervention group, face-to-face adherence reminders will be given by the investigator administering the intervention at the initial intervention instruction and at each subsequent intervention appointment (week 0, 2, 5, 10 and 16). The reminders will focus on (1) the importance of performing all prescribed exercises and on correct execution of exercises; (2) emphasising that the intervention is an add-on to usual care, and should not be a substitution for this; and (3) counteracting important barriers to ongoing engagement with home exercises, as identified by Littlewood et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], namely the simplicity of the intervention (lack of potential effectiveness), lack of an early appreciable symptom response, when symptoms are reduced to a certain point, and a lack of self-efficacy.</p><p id="Par62">Intervention adherence will further be enhanced by supplying a leaflet with the programme to stick on the fridge, and via the proactive follow-up intervention appointments, aspects known&#x000a0;to improve patients adherence to a home-based exercise programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].

The negative effect that any dropouts will have on the statistical power will, to some degree, be reduced by the use of multiple imputation.

Therefore, we aim at having a high power of 95% to verify an effect equal to or higher than the MCID of 10 points on SPADI, at a 5% significance level.

If the intervention is found effective in improving patient-reported shoulder function, the intervention will be easily implemented as an addition to usual care.</p><p id="Par126">The current trial is planned and designed to maximise the usefulness of the trial results by focusing on features that have recently been suggested as important when considering the usefulness of clinical research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. We further believe that the research question raised in this trial satisfies the FINER-criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], as it is considered both Feasible, Interesting, Novel, Ethical and Relevant (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab6"><label>Table 6</label><caption><p>Features to consider in appraising whether clinical research is useful (retrieved from Ioannides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>])</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>Question to ask</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Problem base</td><td>Is there a health problem that is big/important enough to fix?</td></tr><tr><td>Context placement</td><td>Has prior evidence been systematically assessed to inform (the need for) new studies?</td></tr><tr><td>Information gain</td><td>Is the proposed study large and long enough to be sufficiently informative?</td></tr><tr><td>Pragmatism</td><td>Does the research reflect real life?

Accordingly, the treatment of shoulder impingement syndrome is a problem that is worthwhile to address, based on the extent of the problem and the substantial societal costs related to the disorder. Furthermore, the systematic literature review, as is presented in the Background section, clearly indicates that knowledge is lacking with regards to the effect of strengthening exercises in the rehabilitation of patients with long-lasting SIS. The SExSI-Trial will provide relevant insight into this area, contributing to fill this gap.</p><p id="Par128">Secondly, a focus on information gain, pragmatism and patient centeredness is secured through methodological considerations. The trial has been accordingly designed to optimise the information gained from the study by implementing multiple follow-up time-points and a close monitoring of intervention adherence. This makes it possible to conduct relevant dose-response analyses, which in turn will guide future research. The pragmatism of the trial is improved by the use of broad eligibility criteria, a consecutive sampling strategy and usual care as the comparator, aspects that will improve the generalisability of the trial results. Moreover, the choice of SPADI as the primary outcome is in line with the fact that pain and loss of function are the main complaints associated with SIS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. This improves the patient centeredness of the trial, as the goal of the intervention is meaningful to the patients.</p><p id="Par129">Finally, the pre-registration at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> and publication of this trial protocol, including intervention descriptions based on the TIDieR framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], greatly improves the transparency of the trial conduct and results. Collectively, all of these efforts are likely to improve the usefulness of the trial results, and hence the relevance of the trial itself.</p><sec id="Sec36"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par130">Aside from the above, this trial has some methodological strengths and limitations which must be taken into account when interpreting the study findings.</p><sec id="Sec37"><title>Strengths</title><p id="Par131">The blinding of participants, data analysts, outcome assessor and usual care providers greatly decreases the risk of bias in the current trial, supporting the internal validity of study findings. The external validity is further improved by the use of consecutive sampling, thereby improving the generalisability of the results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par132">Given the nature of the intervention, the intervention providers could not be blinded, which increases the risk of bias in the trial. Furthermore, the use of a single centre study design, and the fact that the intervention is provided in a setting outside the normal usual care, decreases the external validity of the study, as study findings might not be generalisable to other settings. It is not within the scope of this study to conduct cost-effectiveness analyses or to conduct qualitative work to evaluate patient acceptability and experience of the home-based exercise programme. While the objective monitoring of adherence will show to what degree patients have accepted and managed to perform the intervention as prescribed, qualitative work could be conducted in order to investigate patient experiences with the intervention and reasons for adherence and non-adherence in order to improve implementation of the intervention. Cost-effectiveness analyses could also be performed in order to inform policy-makers and support implementation. The current study will, nevertheless, provide level-one evidence regarding the effectiveness of the add-on intervention.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Trial status</title><sec id="Sec40"><title>Protocol version</title><p id="Par133">Issue date: 10 May 2017, Protocol amendment 01, Author MC.</p><sec id="Sec41"><title>Revision chronology</title><p id="Par134">Version 1, 25.02.2016 Original.</p><p id="Par135">Version 2, 10.05.2017 Amendment 1.
