Impacted or semi-impacted third molars in the mandible may have several consequences. These include pericoronitis, regional pain, abscess, trismus, distal caries, periodontal pocket of the second molar, development of follicular cysts, and crowding of lower incisors. As a result, their removal is often necessary, and their surgical removal is the most frequently undertaken oral surgical procedure.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>One of the most critical steps in disimpaction is cutting the bone or osteotomy, for which many techniques are used, and if they are used injudiciously, they can be dangerous.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] However, rotary cutting instruments are potentially injurious because they produce excessively high temperatures during cutting of the bone, which can produce marginal osteonecrosis and impair regeneration and healing.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Horton <italic>et al</italic>. (1970) were the first to propose the clinical application of ultrasonics in oral surgery and found its results superior than conventional methods of osteotomies.

Postoperative pain is in response to manipulation of tissues and aggressiveness of surgery such as slippage of rotatory burr on other hand the reason which can be attributed to reduced pain in piezosurgery group is ultrasonic vibrations allow a selective and defined cutting action, leading to a higher level of precision and safety and less tissue damage than using common rotating instruments (burs).[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Sortino <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Piersanti <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Mantovani <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Barone <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] in their study found a significant difference in facial swelling in postoperative period with piezosurgery group showing less facial swelling than rotatory group.
