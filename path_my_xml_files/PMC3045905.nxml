In classical homeopathy, the treatment consists of two main elements: the case history and the prescription of an individually selected homeopathic remedy. Previous data suggest that individualized homeopathic Q-potencies were not inferior to the antidepressant fluoxetine in a sample of patients with moderate to severe depression. However, the question remains whether individualized homeopathic Q-potencies and/or the type of the homeopathic case history have a specific therapeutical effect in acute depression as this has not yet been investigated. The study aims to assess the two components of individualized homeopathic treatment for acute depression, i.e., to investigate the specific effect of individualized Q-potencies versus placebo and to investigate the effect of different approaches to the homeopathic case history.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A randomized, partially double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-armed trial using a 2 &#x000d7; 2 factorial design with a six-week study duration per patient will be performed. 228 patients diagnosed with major depression (moderate episode) by a psychiatrist will be included. The primary endpoint is the total score on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale after six weeks. Secondary end points are: Hamilton Depression Rating Scale total score after two and four weeks; response and remission rates, Beck Depression inventory total score, quality of life and safety at two, four and six weeks. Statistical analyses will be by intention-to-treat. The main endpoint will be analysed by a two-factorial analysis of covariance. Within this model generalized estimation equations will be used to estimate differences between verum and placebo, and between both types of case history.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>For the first time this study evaluates both the specific effect of homeopathic medicines and of a homeopathic case taking in patients with depression.

The estimated global burden of disease from major depression, measured as "disability adjusted life years" (DALY), is rising globally, making depression the leading cause of DALYs in middle and high income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The overall prevalence of depressive disorders in five European countries was 8.56%, with a higher prevalence in urban Ireland (12.3%) and urban United Kingdom (UK, 17.1%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The prevalence can be higher in some age groups. For instance, in Berlin, Germany, the prevalence of lifetime depression in 2008 was almost 20% for women between 18 and 29 years old, 25% for women between 40 and 59 years old and, among men, 12% and 15% for the same age groups, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In the same year, depression was the main reason for work incapacity and for early retirement among women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This might be in spite of current treatments, which do not seem to have any effect on reducing the number of disabled persons per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>According to the S3-Guidelines from the German Society for Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Neurology, an antidepressant treatment is indicated to patients presenting a moderate episode of major depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Although antidepressants are the standard pharmacotherapy for major depression, with a significant difference to placebo, the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the UK stresses that the severity of depression at which antidepressants show consistent benefits over placebo is poorly defined, emphasizing that, in general, the more severe the symptoms, the greater the benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In moderate depression, for instance, there is evidence suggesting that there is a statistically important difference favouring Serotonin Selective Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) over placebo on reducing depression symptoms as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), but the size of this difference is unlikely to be of clinical importance (SMD = -0.28; 95% CI, -0.48 to -0.08) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] A recent patient-level meta-analysis confirms these guidelines and previous data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], indicating small antidepressant benefits for patients with mild (SMD -0.11; 95% CI -0.18 to 0.41) or moderate depressive episodes (SMD -0.17; 95% CI-0.08 to 0.43 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]). Whereas, for patients with severe depression, the difference was with a SMD of 0.47 (95% CI, 0.22 to 0.71), which is very close to 0.50, i.e., a medium effect size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The patient's discontentment with antidepressants is a reason cited for the search for other treatment options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In Ireland, for instance, individuals with a history of depression were much more likely to seek complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) than those who were not depressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Depression is also one of the most commonly treated complaints at the outpatient clinics of homeopathic hospitals in the UK National Health Service [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Homeopathy is based on the 'principle of similars', whereby substances that cause symptoms in healthy individuals are used to stimulate healing in patients who have similar symptoms when ill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These substances are usually administered in extremely high dilutions, making homoeopathy a controversial and strongly debated system. When a single homoeopathic remedy is selected based on a patient's total symptom picture, it is called 'classical' homoeopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>In classical homeopathy (addressed in this protocol) the treatment consists of two main elements: the case history and the prescription of an individually selected homeopathic remedy. The homeopathic case history aims to ascertain the totality of signs and symptoms of each patient, enabling the selection of an individualized homeopathic medicine. In addition it attempts to understand the patient's background, environment and daily routine. In some recent approaches the patient might fill in a questionnaire prior to the medical consultation, to improve the efficiency of obtaining the case history [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Homeopathic medicines are produced through sequential agitated dilutions in Decimal (D), Centesimal (C) or Quinquagintamillesimal (Q or LM) potencies. In this study we will use Q-Potencies which are prepared by grinding the raw material (C1 until C3), followed by consecutive 1:50.000 agitated dilutions. Therefore a Q1 corresponds to a 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-10 </sup>fraction of the raw material (Q2 = 2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-15</sup>, Q3 = 1.25 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-20</sup>, Q4 = 6.25 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-24</sup>, etc.). To date, there is no clear evidence that homopethic medicines are superior to placebo.</p><p>Results from a multi-center observational study with 3981 patients treated with classical homeopathy indicate clinically relevant improvements in the mental aspects of quality of life, after two and eight years of treatment observation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, it is not clear whether these results can be attributed to the homeopathic treatment itself, or are due to other factors or just placebo effects since the study had no control group. However, according to a recent trial from Brazil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], classical homeopathy (i.e., the "whole packet": a thorough case history + homeopathic medicines) seems to be, at least, as effective as conventional standard pharmacotherapy. Data from this randomized, controlled, double-blind trial indicated that individualized homeopathic Q-potencies were non-inferior to the antidepressant fluoxetine in a sample of patients with moderate to severe depression. Interestingly responder rates (defined as a decrease of at least 50% from baseline on the Montgomery &#x00026; &#x000c5;sberg depression rating scale) of both the homeopathic medicine and fluoxetine groups were higher (homeopathy 84.6%; fluoxetine 82.8%) than those usually found for antidepressants in trials (43-75%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. One might speculate that this higher response rate could be due to the more extensive homeopathic case history in the study that compared homeopathic medicines with fluoxetine. However, neither the specific effect of individualized homeopathic Q-potencies, nor the specific effect of the homeopathic consultation has been investigated for patients with depression.</p><sec><title>Aims</title><p>The primary objective of this study is to assess the two main components contributing to the individualized homeopathic acute phase (6 weeks) treatment of depression (moderate episode), i.e., to investigate the specific effect of individualized Q-potencies versus placebo and to investigate the effect of different forms of taking a homeopathic case history (case history type I and II).</p><p>Secondary objectives will be to investigate short term effects (after two and four weeks), including differences between individualized Q-potencies and placebo as well as between the different techniques of homeopathic case history, and to assess the effect of individualized Q-potencies together with either form of case history. A safety evaluation will also be performed.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>A randomized, partially double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-armed trial using a 2 &#x000d7; 2 factorial design with a six week study duration per patient will be performed to test two different hypotheses:</p><p>H<sub>0</sub>: homeopathic medicines = placebo (null hypothesis) vs. H<sub>1</sub>: homeopathic medicines &#x02260; placebo (alternative hypothesis)</p><p>H<sub>0</sub>: homeopathic case history type I = case history type II (null hypothesis) vs.H<sub>1</sub>: homeopathic case history type I &#x02260; case history type II (alternative hypothesis)</p><p>To test these hypotheses, patients will be randomized to one of four groups illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Flow chart of the study groups</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-12-43-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>We will include male and female patients aged between 18 and 65 years diagnosed with moderately severe (HAM-D 17 to 24) major depression by a psychiatrist, patients must not be currently taking antidepressants or anxiolytic drugs (with the exception of Lorazepam as rescue medication, maximal dose 1.5 mg/day).

Only patients who withdraw their consent to use their personal data can be excluded from the analysis.</p><p>To indicate, whether or not the randomisation process leads to prognostically balanced treatment groups, all baseline parameters will be compared by two sided Chi-square-tests (if nominally scaled) or Kruskal-Wallis-tests (if ordinally or continuously scaled). The respective p-values are descriptive in nature, not confirmative.</p><p>The primary endpoint will be analysed by a two-factorial analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), modeling time (3 levels: weeks 2, 4 and 6) as a within-group-factor, type of case history (2 levels: types I and II), type of medicine (2 levels: verum and placebo), and their respective interaction as between-group factors, and baseline value and patient's expectation as linear covariates. Within this model generalized estimation equations (GEE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] will be used to estimate the 6-week differences between verum and placebo, and between both types of case history. Two-sided p-values and confidence intervals for both hypotheses will be adjusted by the Bonferoni-Holm procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. As no interim analyses are planned there is no need for further multiple adjustments. The multiple level of significance is set at &#x003b1; = 0.05 (two-sided).</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>For this study we assumed that the verum treatment is better than placebo by 2.7 &#x000b1; 6.0 (mean &#x000b1; standard deviation) HAM-D score points after 6 weeks (corresponding to a SMD = 0.45), that type II case history is better than type I by 2.7 &#x000b1; 6.0 score points (SMD = 0.45), and that both effects do not interact. If so, a Bonferoni-adjusted F-Test (multiple significance level &#x003b1; = 0.05, two-sided) has a power of 83.5% to detect the difference between verum and placebo and a power of 85.0% to detect the difference in case history taking, if 68 patients are included in groups 1 and 3, and 34 patients are included in groups 2 and 4. This leads to a total number of 228 patients, if one allows for a 10%drop-out rate per group.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Regulatory and Ethical approval</title><sec><title>Regulatory approval</title><p>Bundesinstitut f&#x000fc;r Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte (BfArM), EudraCT Nr: 2009-017458-11, Submission-Nr.: 4036175.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>Ethics Committee, Berlin, Landesamt f&#x000fc;r Gesundheit und Soziales (LaGeSo): ZS EK 15 099/10.

The protocol is in accordance with the EMEA (European Medicines Agency) Guidelines, which recommends placebo-controlled studies and the duration of six weeks for trials investigating medicines for depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], considering that during antidepressant pharmacotherapy, one must reckon with a delay of several weeks until sufficient antidepressant effects can be seen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>It is the first trial on classical homeopathy after the 15<sup>th </sup>amendment to the German Medicines Act (Arzneimittelgesetz, AMG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The study includes all relevant aspects of the CONSORT guidelines for reporting randomized homeopathic trials with parallel groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. For ethical reasons, individuals with a previous suicide attempt or a C-SSRS score of 4 or 5 will be excluded and the occurrence of suicide ideation (with the same C-SSRS severity) will determine the premature termination of the patient's participation in the study. Depression severity will be limited to a maximum HAM-D score of 24, because for more severe depression a treatment with antidepressant is recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The need of individual prescriptions in classical homeopathy has been considered as 'a severe obstacle for any double-blind trial' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].
