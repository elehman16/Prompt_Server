<italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria kills over one million children annually in sub-Saharan Africa <xref rid="pone.0004708-Snow1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> where it is considered both a cause and a consequence of poverty <xref rid="pone.0004708-Gallup1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In the last decade several malaria vaccine candidates have progressed to clinical evaluation <xref rid="pone.0004708-Ballou1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. RTS,S/AS02, a pre-erythrocytic stage <italic>falciparum</italic> malaria vaccine, showed reductions of 35&#x00025; for clinical disease and 49&#x00025; for severe disease over an 18 months follow up period, in one to four year old Mozambican children <xref rid="pone.0004708-Alonso1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004708-Alonso2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, confirming the feasibility of malaria vaccines and their potential to impact the burden of disease in infants.</p><p>A second promising <italic>P. falciparum</italic> vaccine target is the blood stage antigen merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1) <xref rid="pone.0004708-Diggs1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004708-Heppner1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. This abundant merozoite membrane surface protein undergoes a series of processing steps, with the final cleavage of the C-terminal p42-kDa portion of the molecule into p33-kDa and p19-kDa molecules required for erythrocyte invasion <xref rid="pone.0004708-Blackman1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Monoclonal antibodies that specifically interfere with this cleavage can inhibit parasite invasion <xref rid="pone.0004708-Blackman2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Epidemiologic studies have shown that antibodies directed against this part of MSP-1 are associated with protection <xref rid="pone.0004708-Corran1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004708-Okech1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004708-Egan1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. <italic>Aotus</italic> monkeys vaccinated with MSP-1<sub>42</sub> have been protected from <italic>P. falciparum</italic> challenge <xref rid="pone.0004708-Stowers1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004708-Darko1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and antibodies derived from such animals have exhibited <italic>in vitro</italic> growth inhibition activity <xref rid="pone.0004708-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. A previous study of MSP1 and MSP2 recombinant proteins combination malaria vaccine candidate (Combination B) showed a significant reduction in parasite density in the vaccinated group but no significant effect on clinical episodes <xref rid="pone.0004708-Genton1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. However, multiple inoculations with subinfective doses of whole cell infected cryopreserved erythrocuytes followed by immediate antimalarial treatment conferred T cell mediated protection against infection in a challenge study <xref rid="pone.0004708-Pombo1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>MSP-1<sub>42</sub> from the 3D7 clone of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> was expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. The final product, designated falciparum malaria protein 1 (FMP1) <xref rid="pone.0004708-Angov1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, has been formulated with GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals' (GSK) proprietary Adjuvant System AS02. Earlier studies showed the FMP1/AS02 formulation to be safe and immunogenic in rhesus monkeys <xref rid="pone.0004708-Pichyangkul1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and in adult humans in the United States <xref rid="pone.0004708-Ockenhouse1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, Kenya <xref rid="pone.0004708-Stoute1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, and Mali <xref rid="pone.0004708-Thera1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Subsequently, a Phase Ib dose-escalating trial demonstrated its safety and immunogenicity in 12 to 47 month old Kenyan children <xref rid="pone.0004708-Withers1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The 50 &#x000b5;g dose gave a 16-fold rise in the geometric mean titre (GMT) of anti-MSP-1<sub>42</sub> antibodies from baseline to one month after a third vaccination. These encouraging results led to the present proof-of-concept efficacy trial in the same population, which is the first to evaluate monovalent MSP-1<sub>42</sub> for efficacy in a field setting.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and the supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004708.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004708.s002">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Study site</title><p>The study was conducted at the KEMRI-&#x0201c;Walter Reed Project&#x0201d; (WRP) Kombewa Clinic (KC) in the Kombewa Division of Kisumu District of Nyanza Province in western Kenya, an area of hyperendemic malaria transmission with peaks during the long rains (March&#x02013;June) and short rains (November&#x02013;December). The study population, almost exclusively of the Luo tribe, predominantly Seme sub-tribe, was drawn from one mile radius catchment areas around each of 13 field stations.

During the census, the families with children aged 12&#x02013;47 months were identified and homesteads located in relation to the field stations. At the time of the study initiation, parents/guardians were invited to come to the KC for briefing and those who gave consent were later requested to bring their children to the KC for eligibility screening. Children were excluded according to the same criteria used in the previous paediatric Phase Ib study <xref rid="pone.0004708-Stoute1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, except for the slight modifications of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of &#x02265;45 IU/L and absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) for one-year olds of &#x0003c;4.0&#x000d7;10<sup>3</sup>/mm<sup>3</sup>, for two-year olds of &#x0003c;3.0&#x000d7;10<sup>3</sup>/mm<sup>3</sup>, and for three-year olds of &#x0003c;2.0&#x000d7;10<sup>3</sup>/mm<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>Groups that approved the study protocol were: Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) Scientific Steering Committee and Ethical Review Committee, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) Scientific Review Committee, US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC), Human Subjects Research Review Board (HSRRB), and the PATH Human Subject Protection Committee (HSPC). The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed the protocol. The study was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation Guideline for Good Clinical Practice. Pharmaceutical Product Development, Inc. (PPD) and the US Army Medical Materiel Development Activity (USAMMDA) monitored the study. An independent Local Medical Monitor (LMM) and a data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) closely reviewed the trial's progress.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Procedures</title><p>Before recruiting study participants, representatives of the study team met with local chiefs and community leaders to describe the study. Field workers then visited individual homesteads known to have potential study participants and invited the parents or guardians to visit the clinic for recruitment briefings. At each briefing session parents/guardians received a copy of the informed consent form (ICF). Groups watched a videotape detailing (in the Luo language) the study and information on the ICF, which was followed by a public question and answer session. Parents/guardians were then invited for private individual discussions with a study physician assistant or study nurse, after which they were invited to sign (or thumb print if illiterate) the ICF. For each illiterate parent/guardian, an impartial member of the community countersigned as a witness.</p><p>During the screening visits, within 45 days before the first immunisation, the children had a detailed clinical history, physical examination, and blood sampling for haematology and biochemistry evaluations. The children were randomised on day 0 and received the vaccine on days 0, 29 (&#x000b1;9) and 57 (&#x000b1;9). After each vaccination the children were evaluated for solicited adverse events (AEs) on days 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6. The unsolicited AE follow-up periods ran for 30 days (vaccination days and the subsequent 29 days). Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported throughout the duration of the study. During the efficacy follow-up period, all SAEs were reported within 24 hours of occurrence. In the event that a child was treated outside the WRP KC or the New Nyanza Provincial General Hospital copies of all available clinical records of the encounter were obtained, reviewed and maintained in the subject's record. When a study subject was admitted to NNPGH, a member of the clinical team visited the subject at least once daily and reported to the principal investigator (PI) or his designee. The PI remained in contact with the paediatrician or any other medical specialist who provided care to the subject to ensure that the locally appropriate medical care was provided.</p><p>During the follow-up period, clinical malaria cases were tracked and parasite densities and immunogenicity measured. Surveillance was performed on a biweekly basis through monthly field worker home visits and monthly clinic visits (window period: &#x000b1;7 days) (i.e., the clinic and home visits were staggered 2 weeks apart hence the child was seen twice per month). During the home visits to the children field workers documented axillary temperatures, solicited history of fever in the previous 24 hours and of any concomitant medications taken, and reminded parents/guardians of future appointments and the necessity of bringing sick children to the KC. Children with a fever or history of fever in the past 24 hours were taken to the KC for evaluation, including malaria blood films (MBFs) and complete blood counts (CBCs). Out-migrations, absences from Kombewa Division, and antimalarial drugs usage were documented.</p><p>Clinic and home visits were staggered so that each child was evaluated (active detection) about every fortnight. During the clinic visits, an interim history and an axillary temperature were obtained, a history-directed clinical examination was performed, and blood was drawn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004708-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0004708-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004708.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Schematic of trial profile.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0004708.g001"/></fig><p>Clinical malaria was also identified by passive detection (when ill children presented to the KC or to field stations). Blood samples for CBC and MBF were obtained whenever an ill child presented to the clinic. At study start, parents were advised to seek medical attention for the children exclusively at the KC whenever possible Children requiring inpatient care were admitted to the NNPGH. Uncomplicated malaria was treated with a 6 dose course of artemether/lumefantrine (Coartem&#x000ae;) and quinine in case of severe malaria.</p><sec id="s2c1"><title>Laboratory procedures</title><p>Two microscopists independently read Giemsa-stained thin and thick malaria blood films (MBFs) and quantified them according to a standard operating procedure.

The AS02 Adjuvant System, manufactured by GSK Biologicals, contains an oil-in-water emulsion and components also described elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0004708-Ockenhouse1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. A vial containing the lyophilised 60 &#x000b5;g FMP1 pellet was reconstituted in 0.6 mL of AS02 and, after mixing, a syringe containing 0.5 mL was prepared for injection.

The comparator group received the licensed rabies vaccine <italic>Rabipur</italic>&#x000ae; (manufactured in India by Chiron Behring Vaccines Pvt, Ltd) supplied in single dose vials containing lyophilised antigen with 1.0 mL of diluent (sterile water) for injection.</p></sec><sec id="s2d2"><title>Vaccine administration</title><p>After confirming eligibility, staff drew blood for laboratory tests. The pharmacy team confirmed individual assignments to vaccine groups and then prepared the appropriate vaccine. Because the vaccines differed in volume and appearance, the pharmacy team masked the barrel of the syringe, labeled the syringe with each individual's unique randomisation code and study ID number, and passed the syringe through a small service hatch into the vaccination room.</p><p>A vaccine administration team confirmed each child's identity, study number, and randomisation code before administering vaccine. A nurse administered the vaccine by slow intramuscular injection into the left anterolateral thigh. Vaccinations were performed on a 0, 1, and 2 month schedule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004708-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The nurses administering the vaccine were not involved in the post-vaccination assessments.</p></sec><sec id="s2d3"><title>Post-vaccination procedures</title><p>Children were observed for 60 minutes after each vaccination. Parents/guardians were instructed to return with children to the KC immediately for any new symptoms. The study team evaluated the children on days 1, 2, 3, and 6 after each vaccination to collect solicited (pain, swelling, fever, irritability/fussiness, loss of appetite, and drowsiness) and unsolicited AEs. If a parent and child did not appear for a scheduled clinic visit, a clinician or nurse visited them on the same day to measure vital signs and collect information on any AEs that occurred during the previous 24 hours. Transportation was provided for the participants to KC, where AEs were evaluated, monitored, and clinically managed until resolution.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective was to evaluate the vaccine efficacy (VE) against first clinical episodes of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria over a six month period commencing 14 days after a third vaccination.

The logrank statistic and corresponding <italic>p</italic>-value was calculated to test the null hypothesis of no difference in the distribution of time to clinical malaria between the FMP1/AS02 and rabies vaccine groups. A Cox proportional hazards model with an indicator variable for vaccine group was fit to the data and an estimate of the hazard ratio along with its corresponding 95&#x00025; confidence interval was computed. VE was defined as one minus the hazard ratio. Additional Cox models explored the effects of age, sex, bed net use as reported at baseline, nearest field station, and haemoglobin genotype on vaccine efficacy. Kaplan-Meier curves for time to clinical malaria were generated by vaccine group. An alternative estimate of VE based on cumulative incidence rates was calculated as well. The primary data analysis was conducted with the according-to-protocol cohort; however, a similar analysis based on the intention-to-treat cohort was also performed to assess the robustness of the analysis based on the according-to-protocol cohort.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0004708-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004708.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Malaria case definitions and vaccine efficacy in the according-to-protocol group.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0004708-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0004708.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td colspan="9" align="left" rowspan="1">Clinical Malaria</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4" align="left" rowspan="1">

These codes were assigned to participants in the order in which they presented to the clinic on the day of first vaccination. The code was then supplied to the study drug manager and the site pharmacist, who were responsible for randomising the study participants. Randomisation was performed within blocks of eight. Each randomisation assignment was sealed in a unique, tamper-evident envelope, which was opened at the time a subject presented for the first vaccination. At the end of every vaccination day, the randomisation list was secured in a locked safe accessible only to the study drug manager, the pharmacist, and the pharmacist's assistants. The only other person in Kenya who had access to the randomisation code at the study site was the LMM for use in case emergency unblinding became necessary for safety purposes.

Children, parents, investigators, lab personnel and all staff performing follow-up evaluations were blinded as to vaccine assignment. Because the color and volumes of the reconstituted FMP1/AS02 and comparator vaccines differed, the barrel of the syringe was covered with opaque tape to mask its contents and labeled with the subject identification number and randomisation code. Children, parents, and the staff performing follow-up evaluations were all blinded. Vaccinations were carried out simultaneously in four separate consultation rooms, which were connected to a central pharmacy (the vaccine preparation room) by small, closable service hatches. On vaccination days, the prepared syringe was handed through a service hatch to a vaccinator for vaccine administration. For each subject, an identification number, a randomisation code from a chart, and a randomisation code on the syringe were recorded on a vaccination form. Following vaccine administration, children were assessed and follow-up visits conducted by a group of clinicians who had not been involved in the vaccinations.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were recorded on case report forms that underwent 100&#x00025; verification by a quality assurance team before double data entry into a <italic>SQL Server 2000</italic>&#x000ae; database.

A Cox proportional hazards model (SAS Proc PHREG) was used to estimate the hazard ratio along with its corresponding 95&#x00025; confidence interval: VE is one minus the hazard ratio. Similar analyses were performed for other case definitions. Additional Cox models explored the effects of age, sex, baseline bednet use, field station location, and haemoglobin genotype on VE. Kaplan-Meier curves displayed time to event. An alternative estimate of VE based on cumulative incidence rates, excluding time periods when the subject was not at risk for contracting a new case of malaria, was calculated using Poisson regression.

The agreement between the according-to-protocol and the intention-to-treat efficacy analyses strengthens these findings. This corroborates the observation of no significant effect on clinical episodes in the combination B study <xref rid="pone.0004708-Genton1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>The reasons for the lack of efficacy are unclear. The study had adequate power to detect VE of clinical importance. In malaria-na&#x000ef;ve adults in the United States, FMP1/AS02 induced high titre, functional antibodies that recognised <italic>P. falciparum</italic> merozoites by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) and exhibited <italic>in vitro</italic> growth inhibitory activity <xref rid="pone.0004708-Ockenhouse1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Concurrent potency and stability testing of the final product showed no change over time. VE was not associated with age.</p><p>Active and passive case detection was intense and sustained, so that undetected cases of clinical malaria would be unlikely. It is also unlikely that the frequent active follow-up and aggressive treatment of malaria pursued as part of the study design prevented the detection of VE, because majority of the proportions of endpoint cases in both groups resulted from passive case detection alone (77&#x00025; and 72&#x00025; in FMP1/AS02 and <italic>Rabipur</italic>&#x000ae; recipients, respectively). The parasite reduction effect reported with MSP combination B vaccine candidate <xref rid="pone.0004708-Genton1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> as a possible surrogate for protection was not seen in our study.</p><p>Although FMP1/AS02 elicited a greater MSP-1<sub>42</sub>&#x02013;specific immune response than did the comparator vaccine, this response was not a surrogate marker of protection. This is underscored by the results of the (albeit unscheduled and statistically insignificant) analysis for VE as a function of age; the youngest children, although mounting the highest antibody responses, showed no difference in protection from their older counterparts. Similarly, there was no association between peak (day 85) antibody response and time to first case of malaria (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.33). The absence of relationship between MSP-1<sub>42</sub>&#x02013;specific antibody levels and VE observed here contrasts with the positive correlation of anti-MSP-1<sub>42</sub> antibodies with protection described in epidemiologic studies based on the Camp/FUP allele of MSP-1<sub>42</sub>

Owing to the high multiplicity of infection and the diversity of MSP-1<sub>42</sub> phenotypes in Kenya (unpublished data), immunity conferred by the study vaccine may be directed to a minor parasite population. Additionally, the isotype <xref rid="pone.0004708-Shi1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004708-Braga1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> or the sub-domain-specificity of the response may correlate best with protective immunity <xref rid="pone.0004708-Egan1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004708-Darko1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.

In any case, it is clear that a malaria vaccine that targets only children who do not use bednets is an unsupportable strategy.</p><p>FMP1/AS02 had a good safety profile and, as expected, was more reactogenic than the comparator <xref rid="pone.0004708-Ockenhouse1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0004708-Withers1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Despite this greater reactogenicity, dropout rates were low and similar in both groups; no dropout was attributed to an AE.</p><p>Haemoglobin levels were similar in both groups, rising throughout the study. Although more cases of low haemoglobin occurred in the FMP1/AS02 group, no case was judged causally related to vaccination and all resolved spontaneously. This observation led to an exploratory analysis to determine if there was a significant disproportionate drop in haemoglobin between groups. Fourteen children in the comparator group and 15 in the FMP1/AS02 group had an observed decrease from baseline of &#x02265;3 grams of Hb at least once during the study. There was no significant difference in the risk of haemoglobin level decline to less than 8 g/dL, the cut-off value at enrolment.

There was a 20-fold increase from day 0 to day 85 in the FMP1/AS02 recipients, whereas the comparator group experienced a slight (11&#x00025;) decrease during the same period. Although the antibody response waned after day 85, it remained well above both baseline and comparator for the duration of the follow-up period. Diminishment of malaria exposure during the dry season, or early case detection and treatment associated with the execution of the trial, might have contributed to the gradual decline in antibodies observed in the comparator group.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Generalizability</title><p>The study population was chosen to represent the target population for a malaria vaccine: at risk, malaria-experienced children living in an area of intense malaria transmission.

No previous Phase IIb study of the FMP1 antigen has been conducted in the field and especially in an area of holoendemic malaria transmission. However, all the previous Phase I field studies evaluated the safety and immunogenicity and as with our data presented found FMP1/AS02 to be safe and highly immunogenic <xref rid="pone.0004708-Stoute1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0004708-Withers1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.

We therefore propose that future MSP-1<sub>42</sub> vaccine development efforts should focus on other antigen constructs and formulations.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004708.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT Checklist</p><p>(0.04 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0004708.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004708.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol</p><p>(1.43 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0004708.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the children and parents of Kombewa Division who participated in the study, as well as the greater Kombewa community for their cooperation and goodwill during this and previous activities that US Army Medical Research Unit-Kenya has undertaken there since 1996.</p><p>The authors are grateful for the dedication and enthusiasm of the &#x0201c;WRP&#x0201d; Kombewa Clinic staff.
