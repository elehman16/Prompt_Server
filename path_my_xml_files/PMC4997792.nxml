Schools are ideally placed to promote physical activity; however, many do not provide children with sufficient in-school activity or ensure they have the skills and motivation to be active beyond the school setting. The aim of this project is to modify, scale up and evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention previously shown to be efficacious in improving children&#x02019;s physical activity, fundamental movement skills and cardiorespiratory fitness. The &#x02018;Internet-based Professional Learning to help teachers support Activity in Youth&#x02019; (<italic>iPLAY</italic>) study will focus largely on online delivery to enhance translational capacity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The intervention will be implemented at school and teacher levels, and will include six components: (i) quality physical education and school sport, (ii) classroom movement breaks, (iii) physically active homework, (iv) active playgrounds, (v) community physical activity links and (vi) parent/caregiver engagement. Experienced physical education teachers will deliver professional learning workshops and follow-up, individualized mentoring to primary teachers (i.e., Kindergarten &#x02013; Year 6). These activities will be supported by online learning and resources. Teachers will then deliver the <italic>iPLAY</italic> intervention components in their schools. We will evaluate <italic>iPLAY</italic> in two complementary studies in primary schools across New South Wales (NSW), Australia. A cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT), involving a representative sample of 20 schools within NSW (1:1 allocation at the school level to intervention and attention control conditions), will assess effectiveness and cost-effectiveness at 12 and 24&#x000a0;months. Students&#x02019; cardiorespiratory fitness will be the primary outcome in this trial. Key secondary outcomes will include students&#x02019; moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (via accelerometers), fundamental movement skill proficiency, enjoyment of physical education and sport, cognitive control, performance on standardized tests of numeracy and literacy, and cost-effectiveness. A scale-up implementation study guided by the RE-AIM framework will evaluate the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of the intervention when delivered in 160 primary schools in urban and regional areas of NSW.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This project will provide the evidence and a framework for government to guide physical activity promotion throughout NSW primary schools and a potential model for adoption in other states and countries.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=370583">ACTRN12616000731493</ext-link>).

Among children, the health benefits of physical activity are extensive and include improved physical fitness and bone health as well as reduced risk of obesity and cardiometabolic precursors of diseases such as type II diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Physical activity may also improve psychological well-being and prevent mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Recent evidence also indicates that, compared with their less active peers, physically active children can exert better cognitive control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], are more engaged with school [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and perform better on standardized tests of academic achievement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The International Society for Physical Activity and Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] considers schools to be among the seven &#x0201c;best investments&#x0201d; for evidence-based physical activity promotion. Unfortunately, many schools are failing to provide children with sufficient opportunities to be active at school and do not equip them with the necessary skills and motivation to be active beyond the school setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In systematic reviews, multi-component, flexible models were deemed more effective than single component models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Similarly, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend schools deliver comprehensive school physical activity programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] that involve coordination across five components: (i) quality physical education (PE), (ii) activity during the school day, (iii) activity before and after school, (iv) staff involvement and (v) family and community involvement.</p><p>Despite convincing evidence of their effectiveness, few studies have implemented and evaluated comprehensive school physical activity programs. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] Instead, most interventions have focused on one component of the school day (e.g., PE or recess/lunch breaks) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and have neglected to address the multiple opportunities for physical activity promotion that exist within and beyond the school setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Among interventions that embraced a multi-component approach, few objectively measured effects on children&#x02019;s physical activity (e.g., via accelerometers) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>SCORES</italic> intervention was a comprehensive, multi-component physical activity and fundamental movement skills program for primary schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A socio-ecological model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] provided the framework for the 12-month intervention, which consisted of components designed to engage teachers, students, parents and community sport organizations. Implementation strategies included: (i) professional learning and mentoring for teachers, (ii) feedback for teachers based on the quality of their PE and school sport, (iii) lesson resources for teachers, (iv) physical activity equipment, (v) school physical activity policy review and recommendations, (vi) training student leaders, (vii) parent engagement via newsletters, homework and information sessions, and (viii) engagement with local community sport. Our efficacy study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] showed significant intervention effects at 12&#x000a0;months for cardiorespiratory fitness (5.4 laps; 95&#x000a0;% CI, 2.3 to 8.6), daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (12.7 mins/day; 5.0 to 20.5), and overall movement skill competency (4.9 units; -0.04 to 9.8). In addition, <italic>SCORES</italic> was delivered with a high degree of fidelity and teachers and students reported high satisfaction with the program.</p><p>There is a considerable gap between successful interventions like <italic>SCORES</italic>, and widespread dissemination in real world contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This is crucial, as to improve health of populations, interventions that have been effective in research settings must be delivered more broadly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and with less lag time between evidence generation and implementation. Indeed, there has been a proliferation of school-based physical activity intervention efficacy trials in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], yet these studies have made little impact on policy and practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>In our project we will scale up and evaluate the effectiveness of a modified version of the <italic>SCORES</italic> intervention. The modified intervention centres around online delivery of professional learning to teachers. This customized, web-based delivery system was initially developed for a school-based physical activity intervention also led by our research team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Teachers will deliver the intervention to students and parents and engage with community sport and recreation organizations. The modified intervention will be known as <italic>iPLAY</italic> (<italic>I</italic>nternet-based <italic>P</italic>rofessional <italic>L</italic>earning to help teachers to support <italic>A</italic>ctivity in <italic>Y</italic>outh) and will be among the first comprehensive school-based physical activity interventions with a large proportion of the program delivered online. A web-based delivery system is attractive as it may support scaling up and sustainability, and recent evidence indicates that online professional learning for teachers can be as effective as face-to-face training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims and hypotheses</title><p>We will conduct two complementary studies involving primary schools across New South Wales (NSW), Australia.

Key secondary outcomes will include objectively-measured moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, fundamental movement skills, cognitive control and student performance on standardized tests of numeracy and literacy. We hypothesize that:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>compared with the control condition, the <italic>iPLAY</italic> intervention will produce positive effects on children&#x02019;s outcomes in the short-term (post-intervention, 12&#x000a0;months after baseline, primary endpoint for the trial),</p></list-item><list-item><p>these benefits will be maintained 12&#x000a0;months after the end of the intervention (24&#x000a0;months after baseline), and</p></list-item><list-item><p>the intervention will represent value-for-money.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The aim of the second study will be to evaluate the intervention&#x02019;s wide-scale implementation (scale up).

However, only the student cohorts in Years 3 and 4 at baseline will complete outcome assessments (i.e., students in Years 3 and 4 at baseline, students in Years 4 and 5 at post-intervention [12&#x000a0;months], students in Years 5 and 6 at maintenance [24&#x000a0;months]). These students will be available for assessment at all time-points (c.f. most Year 5 and 6 students will leave the school by 24&#x000a0;months), and will have the cognitive ability to complete the questionnaires (c.f., Years 1 and 2). In addition, these years represent the ideal period to develop fundamental movement skill competency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], which may help prevent the decline in physical activity typically observed during the transition from childhood to adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recruitment, selection and randomization for both investigations</title><p>All government-funded NSW primary schools (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1,600) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] will be invited to participate in the project. All schools will be eligible to participate in the scale-up implementation study, but those designated as &#x02018;Schools for Specific Purposes&#x02019; (i.e., for students who require intensive levels of support) will not be eligible for the cluster RCT. Schools that participated in the original <italic>SCORES</italic> efficacy study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] will be eligible for the scale-up implementation study, but will be excluded from the cluster RCT.</p><p>Schools will be recruited via presentations at conferences and meetings (e.g., regional meetings of the NSW Primary Principals Association) and advertisements sent by the NSW Department of Education and the Australian Council for Health, Physical Education and Recreation. We will also advertise via the NSW Department of Education Twitter feeds and Facebook pages. We aim to recruit a total of 180 schools (&#x0003e;10&#x000a0;% of the total number of NSW government-funded primary schools). From the schools that express interest prior to May 2016, we will use a computer-generated algorithm to randomly select 90 to form Cohort 1. Recruitment will continue through to March 2017 at which point we will randomly select 90 schools to form Cohort 2.</p><p>From within each cohort, we will select 10 schools to participate in the cluster RCT; the other 80 schools will participate in the scale-up implementation study. Selecting schools for the cluster RCT will involve a four-step approach. The aims of this process are to ensure that schools in the cluster RCT are: (i) broadly representative of schools in NSW and (ii) assigned to trial arms such that most school-level covariates (e.g., socioeconomic status [SES], geographic location) are balanced, thereby increasing the likelihood that children in the two conditions are similar on the outcome variables at baseline. The four steps are:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p><italic>Stratification:</italic> All schools that express interest in the study and are among the 90 selected to participate in each cohort will be stratified according to SES and geographic location. Given the number of schools is small, the stratification process will require relatively coarse groupings. The Index of Community Socio-educational Advantage (ICSEA) will serve as the SES variable. This index includes information regarding parental SES and Indigenous representation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The index has a median of 1000 and ranges Australia-wide from 300 to 1300 indicating heavy negative skew [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. NSW has a similar distribution ranging from 582 to 1202 with a median of 1003. We will split the sample into a higher SES stratum (ICSEA&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;=1003) and a lower SES stratum &#x0003e;1003. These strata will be further split by geographic distribution using the Australian Bureau of Statistics remoteness index by postcode. The index has 12 categories but this will be reduced to two: urban (less remote) and provincial (more remote). This process will produce four strata: (i) urban-higher SES, (ii) urban-lower SES, (iii) provincial-higher SES, and (iv) provincial-lower SES.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Match-pairing:</italic> We will employ a Euclidian distance minimization strategy to create pairs of similar schools from within strata. The variables used in this minimization process will be: (i) ICSEA, (ii) school size (number of students enrolled), (iii) average scores on national standardized test of numeracy and literacy that are completed by all NSW children (see outcomes section for further details) and (iv) school participation (or not) in a state-wide physical activity and nutrition program, known as Live Life Well at School [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], that took place from 2008 to 2015.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Pair selection:</italic> Once schools have been matched using the minimization procedure, we will select the two or three most similar pairs of schools from within each stratum to participate in the cluster RCT.

To begin, an <italic>iPLAY</italic> mentor will facilitate one 2-h face-to-face workshop or two 1-h workshops on separate days at each school. After the initial workshop, teachers will complete eight online modules designed to reinforce and extend knowledge and skills gained in the initial workshop. During the workshop, mentors will encourage teachers to complete the online modules in small groups approximately once per month (e.g., at stage meetings). This collaborative approach is intended to foster development of an <italic>iPLAY</italic> community of practice within each school [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, modules can also be completed independently.</p><p>At the end of the face-to-face workshop, each teacher will create an individualized learning plan. The learning plan will describe when each teacher intends to complete each of eight modules. The website/app will suggest to teachers that the learning plan accommodates at least one week between modules. This one-week interval will allow teachers time to implement and reflect on each teaching strategy. Upon completion of each module, the website/app will prompt teachers to reflect on their learning plan and adjust target dates, as required. Teachers will also have the ability to modify this learning plan at any time &#x02013; i.e., without prompting. During the intervention, teachers will be prompted via a notification on their smartphone and/or an email when a new module is due for completion (according to each teacher&#x02019;s self-selected, individualized learning plan).</p><p>Online learning activities will include brief instructional videos and engaging tasks that allow teachers to understand the rationale behind each teaching strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Each module will be designed to take 30&#x000a0;min to complete, but teachers will be able to stop and start mid-module. Each module will include an action plan task in which teachers will set implementation goals for their PE and sport lessons. At the beginning of each online module, teachers will reflect on their progress towards goals set in the action plan from the previous module. In addition to the website, professional learning will also be available via a smartphone app on both iOS and Android platforms. In our recent professional learning trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], 109 of 110 NSW teachers owned a smartphone with one of these two operating systems. Thus, we expect most teachers in the proposed study will be able to access the app.</p><p>An <italic>iPLAY</italic> mentor will be assigned to each school and will observe one 30-min PE or sport lesson delivered by each consenting classroom teacher. Mentors will then meet individually with each teacher for 30&#x000a0;min to promote and guide self-reflection and provide feedback concerning the observed lesson. Feedback from mentors will be guided by an online observation checklist that prompts mentors to discuss the SAAFE (Supportive, Active Autonomous, Fair and Enjoyable) teaching principles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], which are based on self-determination theory tenets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].

Afterwards, the pair will use a SAAFE checklist hosted on the project website/app as the basis for a 30-min peer discussion activity. As in the <italic>iPLAY</italic> mentoring session, classroom teachers will answer reflective questions on the website/app during the peer discussion activity.</p><p>The final training component for teachers will involve a 30-min small group discussion led by one of their school&#x02019;s <italic>iPLAY</italic> leaders. During this meeting teachers will use the website/app to answer reflective questions regarding their implementation of <italic>iPLAY</italic> components. These meetings will likely take place during regularly scheduled &#x02018;Stage Meetings&#x02019; involving teachers from (i) Early Stage 1 and Stage 1 &#x02013; Kindergarten, Years 1 and 2, (ii) Stage 2 &#x02013; Years 3 and 4 and (iii) Stage 3 &#x02013; Years 5 and 6.</p><p>Teachers who join a school after the <italic>iPLAY</italic> intervention has started and/or miss the face-to-face workshop will be able to complete an online version of that component.

The <italic>iPLAY</italic> smartphone app will provide reminders for teachers to implement strategies from their action plan. Teachers will be able to choose the interval for these reminders. The website and smartphone app will allow teachers to download resources (e.g., lesson plans, activity descriptions, and classroom movement break videos) that support intervention implementation. Also, when teachers set their action plan in each module, the web-based platform will identify resources that are specifically relevant to the skills/activities that the teacher has planned for the coming weeks.

We have developed an activity tracking system that provides this information instantaneously to teachers at the end of a lesson. The system utilizes inexpensive pedometers ($20USD) (SmartLAB Move ANT+ pedometer, HMM, Dossenheim, Germany) that communicate wirelessly with a smartphone app. Each school will be provided with one activity tracking system which includes 25 pedometers, a smartphone pre-loaded with the app, and a carrying case that includes a charging station. Mentors will demonstrate the system to teachers in the school-based workshops and provide clarification as required when they observe each teacher&#x02019;s lesson. An instructional video will form part of one of the online modules. A complete user manual will be available in the resource section of the website. In the action plans that teachers complete during online learning modules, they will be asked to indicate how many times they plan to use the physical activity monitoring system in their upcoming lessons.

A Markov model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>] consisting of health states associated with different levels of physical activities/movement skill competency will be used to accrue costs and benefits over the time horizon.

A web-based delivery system is attractive as it may support scaling-up and sustainability. However, little, if any, evidence exists regarding the effectiveness of comprehensive primary school-based physical activity interventions delivered using online methods. Using two concurrent studies, and guided by the RE-AIM framework, our project will help provide evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of teacher professional learning delivered largely via the Internet to address the issue of physical inactivity among primary school-aged children.</p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BMI, body mass index; BOSTES, Board of Studies, Teaching and Educational Standards; iPLAY, Internet-based Professional Learning to help teacher support Activity in Youth; MVPA, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity; NAPLAN, National Assessment Program &#x02013; Numeracy and Literacy; PE, Physical Education; RCT, randomized controlled trial; RE-AIM, Reach Effectiveness &#x02013; Adoption Implementation Maintenance; SCORES, Supporting Children&#x02019;s Outcomes using Rewards, Exercise and Skills; SES, socioeconomic status; WHO, World Health Organization</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>None.</p><sec id="FPar22"><title>Funding</title><p>This project is funded by a Partnership Project Grant from the National Health and Medical Research Council (APP1114281) and a grant from the New South Wales Department of Education&#x02019;s School Sport Unit.
