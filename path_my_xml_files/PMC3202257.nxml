The patients of <italic>Kaphaja Kasa</italic> had been selected by the random sampling method. They were randomly divided into two groups - Group A and Group B. In Group A, test drug <italic>Pippali Churna</italic> was administered. Group B was a standard control group and <italic>Vasa Churna</italic> was given to this group. The dose of both the drugs was 4 g B.I.D. The result was assessed after three weeks of drug administration with the help of a specially prepared proforma.

The management, that is, the treatment in Ayurveda includes both <italic>Shamana</italic> and <italic>Shodhana</italic> procedures.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Both these treatment modalities have been covered under the title of <italic>Bheshaja</italic>, which has been described in detail in all classical texts. Although Ayurveda claims, on the one hand, that every <italic>Dravya</italic> can be used as medicine, on the other hand, it points toward the concept of <italic>Abheshaja</italic> by describing <italic>Dhatupradushana</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] or <italic>Kopana</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] <italic>Dravya</italic>. The concept of <italic>Abheshaja</italic> is an untouched field of Ayurveda. The word <italic>Abheshaja</italic> is available only in <italic>Charaka Samhita</italic> in <italic>Brihattrayi</italic>. None of the <italic>Laghutrayi</italic> texts mention this word. None of the scholars or authors of the modern era have elaborately described this subject in their books. In <italic>Caraka Samhita</italic> also, <italic>Abheshaja</italic> has not been explained in detail. Acharya Charaka has defined <italic>Abheshaja</italic> as things that are opposite in action to those of <italic>Bheshaja</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Commentator Chakrapani explains that it is responsible for the diseases produced in the body.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>All the things of the universe are made by <italic>Panchamahabhuta</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] hence, every substance can be used as medicine with proper <italic>Yukti</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] According to this principle, <italic>Abheshaja</italic> also is not a separate entity. Similar to how any <italic>Dravya</italic> works as a <italic>Bheshaja</italic>, it can work as an <italic>Abheshaja</italic> too. Some of the <italic>Dravyas</italic> are <italic>Ahitatama</italic> or hazardous by nature and some can create untoward effects because of different reasons. There are many factors that require attention before medication and they are <italic>Desha, Matra, Kala, Bala</italic>, and so on.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] On account of the ignorance of one of these factors, the drug could not achieve the state that removes the disease, but also can cause extra harmful effects. Therefore, mainly two divisions can be observed in the Ayurvedic classics, which are, <italic>Bhesaja</italic> and <italic>Abheshaja</italic>, as far as treatment modality is concerned. The concept of <italic>Abheshaja</italic> can be compared to the adverse drug reaction (ADR) of modern medicinal science.</p><p><italic>Pippali</italic> is a drug that has been used most as an ingredient in around 324 formulations described in various available texts. It also has been used as a spice or a food ingredient routinely. However, in <italic>Charaka Samhita Vimanasthana</italic>, the instruction regarding the use of <italic>Pippali</italic> is that it should not be consumed in certain conditions. <italic>Pippali</italic> is described as a drug used to tackle emergencies. However, it should not be taken for a long duration as it causes aggravation of the <italic>Doshas</italic>.</p><p>Depending on the frequency of usage, <italic>Pippali</italic> is both useful and harmful. When properly used, it produces good results instantaneously, otherwise, it becomes responsible for the accumulation of <italic>Doshas</italic>. When <italic>Pippali</italic> is used continuously, it aggravates <italic>Kapha</italic>, owing to its heaviness, as also the <italic>Prakledi</italic> (deliquescent) properties; it aggravates <italic>Pitta</italic> owing to its hot property. It does not alleviate <italic>Vata</italic>, because it is not adequately unctuous or hot. However, it intensifies the action of the drugs to which it is added. Therefore, <italic>Pippali</italic> should not be used in excess.</p><p>On the other hand, <italic>Pippali</italic> has been mentioned as <italic>Rasayana</italic> in <italic>Cikitsasthana</italic>, where it is indicated to be consumed for a year along with different <italic>Anupanas</italic>.</p><p>The mentioned references prove that the drug <italic>Pippali</italic> is not <italic>Abheshaja</italic> by nature, however, it might turn into <italic>Abheshaja</italic> due to its accessory factors like <italic>Kala, Bala</italic>, and the like. Hence, this study has been carried out as an attempt to assess the factors or the conditions wherein one drug causes adverse effects. First, the drug was tested on albino rats in an experimental study. When it was observed to be nontoxic or safe, a clinical trial has been undertaken.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>Aims and Objectives</title><p>

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>It has been mentioned in the classics that <italic>Pippali</italic> should not to be used for long durations in continuous use. Here the drug has been used for 21 days, which might not be sufficient to consider it as long duration usage.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Pippali</italic> has properties like <italic>Tikshna</italic>, and so on. It is mentioned as an <italic>Apatabhadra</italic>, that is,. an emergency medicine. Hence, <italic>Pippali</italic> can be taken as the <italic>Bhesaja</italic> having <italic>Tikshna Virya</italic> or <italic>Pravara Bala Bheshaja</italic>. A maximum number of patients had <italic>Madhyama Atura Bala</italic> with <italic>Madhyama</italic> and <italic>Pravara Vyadhi Bala</italic>. Considering the <italic>Madhyama Atura Bala, Madhyama</italic> or <italic>Pravara Vyadhibala</italic> and <italic>Pravara Bheshaja Bala</italic>, it can be said that ratio of three <italic>Bala</italic> was maintained. Hence, there are minimum chances of ADRs. On the other hand, patients with <italic>Madhyama Vyadhi Bala</italic> and <italic>Madhyama Atura Bala</italic> have also not shown adverse effects, although the <italic>Bheshaja Bala</italic> must be <italic>Madhyama</italic>. The reason behind the drug not being able to attain the stage that causes a reaction may be because of accessory factors like:</p><p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p><italic>Bheshaja Kala:</italic> The administration period of the drug was after meals. Hence, the <italic>Tikshnata</italic> of the <italic>Bheshaja</italic> might be less as compared to the <italic>Bheshaja</italic> given on an empty stomach.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Dosha:</italic> The chief <italic>Dosha</italic> on which <italic>Pippali</italic> was administered was <italic>Kapha</italic>, which has almost the opposite properties of <italic>Pippali</italic>.

A good percentage of patients were given medication in <italic>Hemanta Ritu</italic>. In all these seasons, the substances in <italic>Katu Rasa, Tikshna</italic>, and <italic>Laghu Guna</italic> with <italic>Ushnata</italic> are accepted as <italic>Pathya</italic>.

</p><p>Adverse events observed in two patients in Group A: Two of the <italic>Pippali</italic>-treated group patients had developed <italic>Urodaha</italic> (chest burning) during the treatment. The symptom obtained during the treatment was mild in nature and not severe. The details of the patients are given in the clinical observations. By dechallenge and rechallenge, the causality of the reaction due to the drug had turned positive. Both the patients had <italic>Pittavata Prakritti</italic>. Both the patients were taking <italic>Katu Rasa</italic>-and <italic>Ushna Guna</italic>-dominant <italic>Ahara</italic>. All these factors were significant in evolving dominance over <italic>Pitta Dosha</italic> in both the patients. Therefore, they might not be able to tolerate the drugs that were <italic>Agneya</italic> by nature. Although the drug was administered in <italic>Kaphaja Kasa</italic> in the <italic>Vasanta Ritu</italic>, that is, <italic>Kapha Prakopa Kala</italic>, the drug was able to produce only a mild reaction apart from alleviating the <italic>Kapha Dosha</italic>.</p><p>Both the patients had the habit of <italic>Adhyashana</italic> and <italic>Vishamashana</italic>, which was suggestive of the chance of some sort of <italic>Agnidusti</italic> in the patients. On the other hand, both the patients had <italic>Vishamagni</italic>, which again was suggestive of improper <italic>Pachana</italic> of the drug.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>As all the <italic>Dravyas</italic> found on the earth are <italic>Panachabhautika, Abheshaja</italic> is not a separate entity, but there are multiple factors that are responsible for converting <italic>Bheshaja</italic> into <italic>Abheshaja</italic>.
