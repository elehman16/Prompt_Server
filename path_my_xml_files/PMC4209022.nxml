However, the average sleep duration in the Western world has steadily declined over the past decade
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In the National Health Interview Survey 2004 to 2007, more than one third of the North American adult population was noted to have an abnormal duration of sleep, defined as too short (&#x0003c;7 to 8&#x000a0;hours per night) or too long (&#x0003e;8&#x000a0;hours per night)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Previous laboratory and epidemiologic studies showed that inadequate sleep patterns, in terms of both quality and quantity, are associated with an increased frequency of cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], as well as independently associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, such as stroke and myocardial infarction
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A meta-analysis of 16 prospective cohort studies reported a significant association between sleep of short duration (&#x02264;5 to 6&#x000a0;hours per night) and long duration (&#x0003e;8 to 9&#x000a0;hours per night) and an increased risk of all cause-mortality
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore, insufficient or poor-quality sleep is a common risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality, and represents a potentially important population-based modifiable target for CVD prevention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Inadequate sleep and hypertension</title><p>A number of epidemiologic studies have reported an association between inadequate sleep, in terms of duration and quality, and an increased risk of hypertension
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A cross-sectional study among healthy adolescents reported an association between actigraphy-defined low sleep efficiency (an objective measure of sleep quality, defined as the percentage of time in bed estimated to be asleep) and prehypertension, after adjusting for known confounding factors (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.5 to 8.0)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, in a substudy of 578 adults from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study, actigraphy-measured shorter sleep duration and lower sleep maintenance (a component of sleep quality defined as the percentage of time between initial sleep onset and final waking that is spent sleeping), were noted in a cross-sectional analysis to be associated with significantly higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures, after adjusting for confounders such as age and antihypertensive medications. In a longitudinal analysis of this cohort, shorter average sleep duration also predicted significantly increased odds of incident hypertension over 5&#x000a0;years (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.78)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In addition, a longitudinal analysis of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of &#x0003e;4,500 US adults, reported a significantly increased risk of hypertension in individuals sleeping &#x02264;5&#x000a0;hours per night compared with those sleeping for 7 to 8&#x000a0;hours per night, after adjusting for various potential confounders (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.71)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Mechanism underlying the association between poor sleep and hypertension</title><p>The mechanism underlying the association between insufficient or poor-quality sleep and hypertension is proposed to be multifactorial, including increased sympathetic nervous system activity and increased prevalence of intermediate risk factors, such as poor diet, reduced physical activity, increased weight, and smoking
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Laboratory studies have noted significantly increased sympathetic activity and blood pressure in individuals in a sleep-restricted condition, compared with individuals in a sleep-recovery condition
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Increased urinary excretion of noradrenaline, indicating increased sympathetic activity, has also been reported after a night of sleep deprivation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system can lead to vasoconstriction as well as fluid retention, which can lead to hypertension through volume overload
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Blood pressure and heart rate typically exhibit diurnal variation. During sleep, a nocturnal dip occurs in both blood pressure and heart rate, which remain low until the time of awakening. Reduced sleep duration can result in longer exposure to enhanced sympathetic activity and increased average 24-hour blood pressure and heart rate. In this way, habitual sleep restriction can lead to prolonged enhanced sympathetic nervous system activity, the development of hypertension, and subsequently, an increased risk of stroke and other CVD
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Poor sleep and other cardiovascular risk factors</title><p>The mechanism underlying the association between poor sleep and other key risk factors for CVD, such as diabetes mellitus and obesity, is thought to be due to sleep-related disruption in metabolic, endocrine, and immune functions. Insufficient sleep has been associated with elevated evening cortisol concentrations, which can result in reduced sensitivity to insulin; increased levels of growth hormone, which can cause a transient insulin resistance; and increased sympathetic nervous system activity, which can inhibit insulin secretion from the pancreas
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Thus, sleep-induced disruption of the endocrine and autonomic systems could explain the observed association between inadequate sleep and increased occurrence of diabetes mellitus.</p><p>Curtailed sleep has also been associated with reduced levels of leptin, a hormone released by adipocytes, which promotes satiety, and increased levels of ghrelin, a hormone secreted by the stomach and pancreas that stimulates appetite, as well as an increase in subjective feelings of hunger. Thus, this provides a possible mechanism for the observed association between inadequate sleep and obesity
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system, with resultant hypertension, is thought to be the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism linking insufficient sleep with diabetes, obesity, and CVD
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In turn, these factors also contribute to an increase in blood pressure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Current educational interventions to modify traditional cardiovascular risk factors</title><p>Currently, stroke and other CVDs are the leading causes of mortality in Europe and North America. Existing interventions to tackle the huge burden of CVD in the population include education on lifestyle modification, as well as the use of primary and secondary preventive therapies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Educational interventions typically consist of advice and information on modifiable risk factors, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and dietary practices. Although factors such as poor diet and lack of physical activity clearly play a central role, another possible contributor to the current epidemic of CVD, mediated through hypertension and the metabolic syndrome, is insufficient or poor-quality sleep
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Modifiability of poor sleep and the potential role of a sleep intervention in CVD prevention</title><p>Insufficient or poor sleep quality is a modifiable risk factor for CVD and could potentially be improved through the use of a simple, low-cost, multicomponent intervention aimed at improving sleep quality and quantity. Three previous randomized controlled trials investigating the efficacy of an intervention to improve sleep in participants with insomnia reported significant improvements in sleep efficiency, sleep latency and wakefulness after sleep onset (measures of sleep quality), as well as improvements in mental health and energy
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Improving sleep quality has been suggested as a therapeutic target for the modification and prevention of cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

The randomization schedule is constructed by using a computer-generated list of pseudo-random numbers. A centrally administered, computer-generated randomization scheme is being used to assign individual participants randomly in a 1:1 ratio, to either the intervention or control groups. Once a participant is deemed eligible for trial entry and has provided written informed consent, a researcher assigns a unique study-identification number to the participant and contacts the online sleep intervention (Sleepio) team with the participant's name, their assigned participant number, and contact details (Email address and telephone number). The Sleepio team then assigns the participant to the next available randomization number on the list, corresponding to a particular treatment assignment (Sleepio intervention or control). Participants randomized to Sleepio receive a code via Email to access the online sleep intervention. The Sleepio team holds the central record of all participants who have been randomized, along with the corresponding randomization numbers and treatment-group assignments. All investigators at the HRB-CRFG, including the statistician, are blinded to participant treatment-group assignment. At the end of the trial, treatment assignments will be compared with the randomization list, to detect any incorrect assignments, and following completion of statistical analyses, all investigators and trial personnel will be unblinded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Blinding</title><p>Trial participants, investigators, data collectors, statistician, and outcome assessors are blinded to study-group assignment. Members of the Sleepio team assigning participants to treatment groups are not blinded. Participant consent forms and information leaflets state that a behavioral lifestyle intervention is being compared with a control, and describe the intervention as general education on cardiovascular risk factors. It is also mentioned that aspects of the intervention are delivered via online web sessions, as well as through face-to-face sessions. Cardiology research nurses deliver the usual care intervention (that is, the cardiovascular education intervention) to participants in both treatment arms.</p><p>All laboratory measurements are carried out in a blinded fashion. Laboratory samples, with the exception of HbA1c serum levels, are frozen and then stored, and will be analyzed at the end of the trial. Serum HbA1c levels are measured on the day of collection. Blood pressure measurements are recorded in a blinded fashion by using a 24-hour automated blood pressure monitor, thus avoiding observer bias. All other study measurements, including BMI and questionnaire scores, are interpreted and entered into the study database in a blinded fashion by a trained researcher. Because of the nature of the intervention, a requirement for breaking the blinding to access the randomization schedule for a particular participant during the trial is not anticipated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Study interventions</title><sec id="Sec20"><title>Components of the sleep intervention</title><p>The sleep intervention (Sleepio) is a multicomponent online intervention consisting of sleep information and sleep-hygiene education, along with behavioral and cognitive components.

These sessions are self-delivered at a convenient time for each participant, over an 8-week period. The program comprises a fully automated media-rich web application, driven dynamically by baseline, adherence, performance, and progress data. At the start of each session, the Prof conducts a progress review with the participant, explores the diary data submitted during the week, the participant&#x02019;s current sleep status and pattern, and progress achieved against goals previously set. Underlying algorithms feed the delivery of information and provide support and advice in a personally tailored manner. The content of the cognitive behavioral therapy component of the intervention is consistent with the literature, and covers behavioral (for example, sleep restriction, stimulus control) and cognitive (for example, putting the day to rest, thought restructuring, imagery, articulatory suppression, paradoxical intention, mindfulness) strategies, as well as additional relaxation strategies (progressive muscle relaxation and autogenic training) and advice on lifestyle and bedroom factors (sleep hygiene). The intervention is based on a previously validated manual

Participants access an online daily sleep diary throughout the online sleep intervention, which is completed each morning on rising. Participants are able to set automated mobile text message and/or Email prompts as reminders, to further promote adherence. Members of the Sleepio team also contact participants who are not adhering to the intervention by using standardized Emails and phone follow-up, further to encourage adherence to the intervention.</p><p>To reduce losses to follow-up, participants who fail to return for a follow-up visit are contacted by phone and/or mail to arrange an alternative convenient appointment.. The cost of transport to and from the study site is reimbursed on request, further to encourage adherence to the follow-up procedures. If participants are unable to make a final follow-up visit to the study site, a home visit with the participant is arranged, where possible, to obtain final outcome data. If the participant refuses or is unable to attend for any further follow-up visits, we attempt to establish the reason for nonattendance. We believe these measures will help ensure a high adherence rate of &#x0003e;85% and a low loss-to-follow-up rate of &#x0003c;5%, thus maximizing the ability of the trial to detect a true treatment effect.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Components of the control intervention</title><p>The control intervention consists of advice and education on modifying cardiovascular risk factors and adopting a healthier lifestyle.

These fixed intervals eliminate the transition periods in the morning and evening when blood pressure changes rapidly, resulting in daytime and night-time blood pressure levels that are within 1 to 2&#x000a0;mm Hg of the awake and asleep levels.

However, participants receiving up to two antihypertensive agents at the time of entry into the trial are eligible for inclusion, provided that no recent (within the previous 8&#x000a0;weeks) changes occurred in type or dose of antihypertensive medications and there are no planned change to antihypertensive medication over the next 8&#x000a0;weeks (during the trial). Note: in patients with mild hypertension and no history of CVD, current guidelines recommend an initial period of lifestyle intervention, consistent with our approach. Treating clinicians will be permitted to use clinical judgment in initiating and dose-adjusting antihypertensive therapies for both study groups during the 8-week trial, where appropriate. Participants who are stable on cardiovascular preventive therapies (no change in previous 3&#x000a0;months), such as lipid-lowering agents, antithrombotic therapies, oral hypoglycemic agents, and insulin will continue their usual treatment. Participants not taking these agents will be encouraged to avoid initiation of treatment with these agents, until the 8-week trial period has been completed. However, treating clinicians will be permitted to use usual clinical judgment in initiating and dose-adjusting such medications, where appropriate. Initiation and/or dose adjusting of cointerventions will be recorded and measured and accounted for using sensitivity analysis. Participant adherence to the intervention will also be measured, and adjusted for using sensitivity analysis. For example, we will analyze the data for evidence of a dose/response relation between degree of reduction in SBP and number of online sleep sessions completed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Sample-size calculation</title><p>The primary outcome is the mean difference in SBP reduction over the 8-week period between the two study groups.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The minimum effect size is based on previous randomized controlled trials reporting a reduction in CVD with reductions in SBP of 5&#x000a0;mm Hg or greater, and the reduction in blood pressure with lifestyle interventions observed in previous trials

We will adjust for covariates associated with the intervention and the outcome as appropriate (for example, age, baseline SBP, baseline DBP, baseline SCI score). The selection of explanatory variables for inclusion in the final model will be based on clinical plausibility and variable selection routines, the LASSO, and regression trees. It will be assumed that missing data are missing at random and therefore accounted for in the mixed model. The validity of this assumption will be investigated by looking at the missing data patterns and by modeling the probability of missing data based on the explanatory variables available. The sensitivity of the missing value-generating mechanism to the choice of variables for inclusion and the final conclusions will be assessed by using multiple imputations via chained equations and predictive mean matching. Model checking will be performed by using suitable model diagnostics and residual plots.

This could result in the differential use of co-interventions between the two study groups, or use of a sleep intervention in the control group, resulting in bias toward the null. The screening questionnaire for sleep quality is another potential source of unblinding. To minimize the risk of unblinding, it is being administered as a routine baseline screen, along with questionnaires to measure depression, anxiety, and cognitive function.</p><p>A second potential limitation is volunteer bias. Individuals who participate in studies are often more healthy than those who refuse to provide consent. Thus, the actual sample of individuals included in the trial may not be representative of the relevant population, limiting the generalizability of the results. Furthermore, study volunteers are often well-motivated, highly adherent individuals who are likely to benefit from such an intervention. This would also affect the external validity of the results. However, this is a proof-of-concept, phase II study, and such a population will maximize the chances of detecting the true treatment effect, before testing the effectiveness of this intervention in a wider population.</p><p>A third potential limitation in this study is the primary outcome measure of reduction in mean 24-hour systolic blood pressure, which is a surrogate outcome measure. As this is a pilot study, a clinical outcome would not be feasible, as a relatively long follow-up period would be required to demonstrate a treatment effect. Reduction in blood pressure has been shown to be predictive of significant reductions in major vascular events. Thus, we believe that reduction of systolic blood pressure is an appropriate outcome measure for this study.</p><p>A fourth potential limitation of this study is the risk of nonadherence to the intervention, which is a particular challenge in trials evaluating behavioral interventions. However, a number of measures are being implemented to maximize adherence (see earlier). To determine the influence of adherence on the estimated treatment effect, a sensitivity analysis will be performed.</p><p>A fifth potential limitation is that patients with undiagnosed OSA may be included in this study, which could undermine our ability to detect a true treatment effect, given that such patients may not be expected to improve with the intervention. Thus, we have excluded patients with a known diagnosis of treated OSA, to minimize this potential limitation. Finally, our results could be subject to attention bias, due to differences in the level of attention provided to the two treatment groups. However, given that this is a phase II, proof-of-concept study, with the aim of maximizing the chances of detecting a true treatment effect, we elected not to use an attention placebo in the control arm. If a significant treatment effect is observed in this pilot study, a larger-scale phase III trial will be performed, with the inclusion of an attention placebo in the control arm, to demonstrate the effectiveness of this intervention in a broader population of patients for primary and secondary prevention of CVD.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec48"><title>Trial status</title><p>Ongoing, participant recruitment under way.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>ApoA1</term><def><p>Apolipoprotein A1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Apo B</term><def><p>Apolipoprotein B</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BAI</term><def><p>Beck Anxiety Inventory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BDI</term><def><p>Beck Depression Inventory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CVD</term><def><p>Cardiovascular disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DBP</term><def><p>Diastolic blood pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>eGFR</term><def><p>Estimated glomerular filtration rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GUH</term><def><p>Galway University Hospital</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HRB-CRFG</term><def><p>Health Research Board-Clinical Research Facility Galway</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ISI</term><def><p>Insomnia Severity Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HDL-C</term><def><p>High-density lipoprotein cholesterol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LDL-C</term><def><p>Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OSA</term><def><p>Obstructive sleep apnea</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PSQI</term><def><p>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SOL</term><def><p>Sleep-onset latency</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SBP</term><def><p>Systolic blood pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCI</term><def><p>Sleep condition indicator</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p>Standard deviation.
