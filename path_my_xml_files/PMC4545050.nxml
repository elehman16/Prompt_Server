Mindfulness in Motion (MIM) is a Mindfulness Based Intervention (MBI) offered as a modified, less time intensive method (compared to Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction), delivered onsite, during work, and intends to enable busy working adults to experience the benefits of mindfulness. It teaches mindful awareness principles, rehearses mindfulness as a group, emphasizes the use of gentle yoga stretches, and utilizes relaxing music in the background of both the group sessions and individual mindfulness practice. MIM is delivered in a group format, for 1 hr/week/8 weeks. CDs and a DVD are provided to facilitate individual practice. The yoga movement is emphasized in the protocol to facilitate a quieting of the mind. The music is included for participants to associate the relaxed state experienced in the group session with their individual practice. To determine the intervention feasibility/efficacy we conducted a randomized wait-list control group in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). ICUs represent a high-stress work environment where personnel experience chronic exposure to catastrophic situations as they care for seriously injured/ill patients. Despite high levels of work-related stress, few interventions have been developed and delivered onsite for such environments. The intervention is delivered on site in the ICU, during work hours, with participants receiving time release to attend sessions. The intervention is well received with 97% retention rate. Work engagement and resiliency increase significantly in the intervention group, compared to the wait-list control group, while participant respiration rates decrease significantly pre-post in 6/8 of the weekly sessions. Participants value institutional support, relaxing music, and the instructor as pivotal to program success. This provides evidence that MIM is feasible, well accepted, and can be effectively implemented in a chronically high-stress work environment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-generated"><kwd>Behavior</kwd><kwd>Issue 101</kwd><kwd>Mindfulness</kwd><kwd>resiliency</kwd><kwd>work-engagement</kwd><kwd>stress-reduction</kwd><kwd>workplace</kwd><kwd>non-reactivity</kwd><kwd>Intensive-care</kwd><kwd>chronic stress</kwd><kwd>work environment</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><fig id="Fig_52359" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><alternatives><media id="Video_52359" xlink:href="jove-101-52359.mp4" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" position="anchor"/><graphic xlink:href="jove-101-52359-thumb"/></alternatives></fig><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)<sup>1-3</sup> is a stress reduction intervention that can be used to retrain the mind to change its usual responses to stressful situations. It has substantial research-based evidence for its efficacy in a variety of medical, social, educational, intercultural, and work-site settings<sup>4-6</sup>. MBSR teaches non-reactive awareness of one&#x02019;s affective response to external events and is presented as the key to changing one&#x02019;s internal experience of stress. Mindfulness is characterized by non-judgmental, sustained moment-to-moment awareness of physical sensations, perceptions, affective states, thoughts and imagery. MBSR is a time-intensive structured mind-body program (traditionally an 8 week, 26 hr group intensive program) that utilizes mindfulness meditation and yoga postures to help manage a variety of adverse health issues, including stress. There are 35 years of empirical research illustrating the health benefits of this valuable approach. However, the required time commitment of traditional MBSR may negatively influence its applicability for personnel working in a chronically high stress work environment who may not have the time or energy to address their stress outside of work hours, but who could greatly utilize the benefits it affords.</p><p>The deleterious effects of chronically high stress work environments have been investigated<sup>7-8</sup> but interventions to mediate this stress have been more recent<sup>9-13</sup> as the impact of stress on personal physical and mental health has become more clearly established<sup>14-15</sup>. Effects of chronically high stress work environments also extend to the institutions that have to incur the costs of dealing with employee absenteeism and high turnover of expert personnel, such as highly trained nurses<sup>16</sup>. Interventions at the level of the organization (including mindfulness interventions) have been effective at reducing stress for personnel in various work environments, such as fire fighters, police officers, and prison guards<sup>17-19</sup>. But the actuality and severity of the situation for nurses in particular have been recognized by many as shown by the number of publications on the topic of nursing stress in recent years<sup>20-28</sup>. However, there are very few reports on pragmatic Mindfulness Based Interventions (MBIs) that have been successfully implemented during the workday, onsite, as part of an institutional initiative to combat stress and its impact in an attempt to transform organizational culture.</p><p>Mindfulness has been found useful as an intervention that increases attention<sup>29-30</sup> and has been associated with changes in brain structure and function. For example the changes in gray matter brain density<sup>31</sup> impacts cognition, while changes in the amygdala<sup>32</sup> impact emotional reactivity. This may explain some of the positive benefits associated with stress reduction worksite interventions that teach non-reactivity for personnel who work in a chronic high stress work environment. Additionally, MBIs may impact the parasympathetic nervous system&#x02019;s tone, as the immune, autonomic, and endocrine systems all play a role in stress reactivity<sup>33</sup>, and have also been shown to decrease anxiety<sup>34</sup>. Each of these outcomes (especially increased ability to attend and increased parasympathetic tone) are valuable for personnel working in high stress work environments that are expected to provide compassionate care to those whom they serve while concurrently being highly focused on medical needs and changes. Although individuals who initiate their own personal stress reduction strategies may be able to lessen their individual experience of stress<sup>17</sup>, systematic organization approaches are more effective. Workplace interventions can positively impact symptoms of stress (high blood pressure is one example) and demonstrate changes in psychological symptoms of stress<sup>35</sup>, and simply introducing stress reduction programming may shift the organizational climate, which has been shown to be an important factor for ICU nurses&#x02019; intention to retain or leave their job<sup>36</sup>.</p><p>Turnover in high-stress jobs is of major concern for employers, including nursing turnover, due to the high cost to the institution<sup>16</sup>. Although there is variation in how studies calculate the cost of nurse turnover, estimates range approximately between $10,000-88,000 per nurse, suggesting that nurse turnover is a concern, and costly for health care organizations<sup>16</sup>. In addition to this, research shows that patient satisfaction is less in hospitals with more dissatisfied nurses&#x02014;a finding that may indicate a stressed, dissatisfied workforce may impact patient care<sup>37</sup>.</p><p>MIM is offered as a modified, less time intensive method to be delivered in the work place, and intends to enable busy working adults to experience the benefits of mindfulness. MIM teaches mindful awareness principles, rehearses mindfulness as a group, emphasizes the use of gentle yoga stretches, utilizes unique relaxing music in the background of group sessions/ individual practice, and requires daily individual mindfulness practice. The weekly session&#x02019;s content and structure follow that of the traditional MBSR, with an increased emphasis on bodily relaxation with the soft background music preceding the discussion of mindful awareness of cognitive habits. Participants receive three daily practice CDs (with 20 min practice tracks) and one yoga DVD with the background music and similar meditations as the ones practiced as a group, to be utilized for individual practice. These tools facilitate the ease of daily practice, increasing its feasibility. Development of this protocol is based on previous studies that suggest the efficacy of mindfulness interventions do not correlate with the length of time spent on the group didactic practice<sup>30,38-39</sup>, and yield similar results to the longer traditional MBSR. Non-reactive awareness of one&#x02019;s affective response to external events is presented as the key to changing one&#x02019;s internal experience of stress. MIM is specifically designed to be implemented in the workplace, during work hours, without the need to change clothes and can be done seated at a desk or standing. MIM is to be delivered onsite, during work hours for personnel exposed to stress and who are at high risk of developing burnout and could utilize the intervention to stay engaged and present in their work.</p><p>Mindfulness is the mental ability to enhance self-awareness of present internal and external experiences in a non-judgmental way. Mindfulness encourages people to become aware of how they are reacting to events as those events occur. It allows for a space of focused attention and awareness, in which the subject becomes able to watch his/her reaction to various events. Through attending to one&#x02019;s own reactions, in a non- judgmental manner, one is able to reflect on the nature of the stressful event, and then able to evaluate if it is possible to reframe the event to lessen the perception of it being considered stressful<sup>1-4</sup>. MBIs that occur in a group setting utilize group discussion of these realizations, which can result in community building amongst participants<sup>1,2</sup>. Such an experience may be a helpful worksite outcome. The self-reflection and awareness, and the shared experience of the emerging self-awareness, may contribute to a climate/culture change in a highly stressed work environment. Bishop<sup>40</sup> generated a functional definition of mindfulness for researchers concerning the role and essential elements of an MBI. Two critical components were determined to be (1) self-regulation of attention and (2) the adoption of an orientation toward one&#x02019;s experiences in the present moment<sup>40</sup>. MIM, the onsite MBI protocol described in this manuscript was constructed to retain the essential elements of mindfulness, as it was conceived and has developed in traditional MBSR<sup>1-2</sup>, while adapting it in a pragmatic way for working adults. It utilizes the operational definition of mindfulness, yet, differs in the worksite location of the intervention, and the weekly time commitment of the group meeting and individual &#x0201c;homework&#x0201d; suggestion (<bold>Table 1</bold>).</p><table-wrap orientation="portrait" id="d36e235" position="float"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Length of Intervention</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intervention Location</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group Meeting Duration</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Format of Group Weekly Meeting</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Daily Homework</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">MBSR</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 weeks</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Typically a location other than a work site</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.5 - 3 hr/week, plus one full day &#x0201c;retreat&#x0201d;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Standard MBSR program, Yoga movement is often done from the floor</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">45 min - 1 hr of mindfulness meditation</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">MIM</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 weeks</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Always on site location (worksite for a work study)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 hr/week, plus one 2 hr &#x0201c;retreat&#x0201d;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Modified MBI specific for onsite delivery, Yoga movement is done standing or seated, music in background</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">20 min of mindfulness meditation via CD/DVD, music in background</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>
<bold>Table 1. Comparison of traditional MBSR as compared to MIM.</bold>
</p><p>MIM is part of an organizational initiative to improve the resiliency and work engagement of employees and will be particularly important as it uses a &#x0201d;real-world&#x0201c; setting to address a critical problem experienced by many institutions dealing with chronically high stress work environments around the world.</p><p>The MIM protocol was developed by the first author to expose individuals who might benefit the most to mindfulness. As a trained yoga instructor (Yoga Alliance Certified) and attendee at an MBSR 9 day training for Health Professionals, she delivered MIM in this study, but has additionally designed a train-the-trainer program (for others with previous yoga/mindfulness training) in order to scale its delivery. Representative results of using MIM in a high stress environment (ICU) are presented in this manuscript, while biologic correlates to psychological outcomes associated with MIM will be forthcoming. This research provides an evidence-based approach for translation to practice at the level of the organization with the goal to improve work engagement in a specific population with potential application to employees working in other high stress environments, such as police officers, lawyers, fire fighters, <italic>etc.</italic></p></sec><sec><title>Protocol</title><p>Institutional Review Board approval was obtained from The Ohio State University for this study and all participants signed an informed consent form.</p><sec><title>1.

Ask the participants to cross their arms over their chest, then, to cross their arms the opposite way and notice whether or not this feels uncomfortable, or unusual, as it is different than their typical habit of which arm is typically on top. Ask the participants to relax their feet, their legs, drop their weight into the chair, relax shoulders down, relax the muscles of the face. Mindfully relax all the muscles of their body.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Week 2: Ask the participants to settle into their chairs. Instruct the participants to close their eyes and begin a body scan, thereby tensing and relaxing each part of the body. Ask the participants to bring attention to their feet, legs, buttocks, stomach, chest, shoulders, lips, open and close the lower jaw, relaxing it.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Week 3: Ask the participants to become aware of their breathing by concentrating on the rise and fall of their chest. For just a few minutes, allow the mind-chatter to become quiet. Instruct the participants to tense each part of the body (the lower body, the torso, the neck and shoulders, the head) and then release the tension as each body part relaxes.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Week 4: Pass out an orange and a small piece of dark chocolate. Instruct the participants to eat both of these with all five of their senses. For example, ensure that the participants hear the orange peel come off the orange, the wrapper off the chocolate. Direct the subjects to taste each of these 2 food items, smell each the orange and the chocolate, notice the difference and to notice the surface of the chocolate as opposed to the surface of the orange. Instruct the participants to take 3 min in silence to eat each of these 2 food items, noticing the experience, and the potential enhanced enjoyment of food, involved in mindful eating.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Week 5: Lead participants through yoga poses appropriate for the worksite, that can be performed without changing clothes or taking off one&#x02019;s shoes<sup>38</sup> (balancing poses such as tree pose, eagle pose and chair pose). Ask the participants to notice the factors that are helpful to physically balance their body in these poses.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Week 6: Guide the participants through a self-massage as an example of a pleasurable break from stress. Instruct the participants to use all ten finger tips to begin massaging their head and scalp, moving down the back of the neck. Use the left hand to massage the right side of the neck, down the upper arm, to the elbow, ending at the palm of the hand and the fingers. Repeat using the right hand to massage the left side of the body.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Week 7: Ask participants to bring to mind the list of stressful items present in life. Instruct the participants to stand up. From a standing position, ask the participants to shift their weight to the right foot to represent the factors(<italic>e.g.,</italic> people, situations, <italic>etc.</italic>) in their lives that cannot be changed, while tipping their torso to the left to represent the factors that are stressful yet are in part amendable to change. Ask participants to recognize that we all have both unchangeable and modifiable features present in our lives. Then ask the participants to rotate their shoulders in circles, followed by arms and hands moving in circles, ending by shaking out hands and participants return to seated position.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Week 8: Display an image of a mountain for the group.

Averaging the pool of participant breath counts revealed a decrease in the breath count between the beginning and the end of each weekly session. Individual participants associate the somatic experience of relaxation/clarity with the quantification of their own breath count difference; comparing respiration rates before each weekly session to those obtained at the end of each weekly session. <bold>Figure 1</bold> shows the decrease in the 30 sec breath count as statistically significant for most time points (6/8 of the weekly session averages). There was also a decrease in the average number of breaths at the beginning of the 8 week program, between the 1st session (week 1) and the last session (week 8). <bold>Figure 1</bold> shows participant&#x02019;s average pre-session respiration rate as 8.17 breaths/30 sec at week 1, as compared to 6.61/30 sec at week 8. A similar pattern was seen in the average number of breaths at the end of the session from 5.03/30 sec at week 1 to 3.63/30 sec at week 8; however these were not statistically significant.</p><p>An associated goal of this intervention was that the personnel under chronic high stress in their work environment would increase the ability to remain resilient in the face of the stressful environment. <bold>Figure 2</bold> shows that on the Connor-Davidson Resiliency Scale<sup>41</sup> the scores were significantly different between pre- and post- 8 week intervention for the MIM group (112.9%, p = 0.0230, t = 2.397), with no change in the wait-list control group (101.7%, p = 0.7330, t = 0.3345), indicating that this intervention increased resiliency.</p><p>The organization that committed to funding this initiative was interested in creating a more resilient work force in spite of the stressful nature of the job responsibilities. <bold>Figure 3</bold> shows that in the ICU personnel, the total work engagement average score indicated via the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale<sup>43 </sup>was significantly increased between pre- and post- 8-week intervention in the MIM group (111.3%, p = 0.0128, t = 2.802). There was no change in the wait-list control group (104.5%, p = 0.1349, t = 1.587). Most of the change was induced by an increase in the vigor subscale. Vigor average score increased between pre and post-8 week intervention in the MIM group (117.9%, p = 0.0331, t = 2.331) with no change in the wait-list group (101.8%, p = 0.5624, t = 0.5934). Dedication and absorption subscales scores were not significantly different in any groups.</p><p>Given that the focus of this study was to develop a MBI that could pragmatically be delivered onsite, it was important to determine which component parts of the intervention mattered to the participants. <bold>Table 2</bold> shows participant rating of the component parts of MIM. On a scale from 1 to 10 (with 1 being the least valuable, and 10 being the most valuable), participants rated the usefulness of the various aspects of MIM. The highest scores were for the trained instructor (M = 8.67 &#x000b1; 0.71), music (M = 8.1 &#x000b1; 2.2), breathing awareness (M = 7.9 &#x000b1; 1.3), meditation (M = 7.5 &#x000b1; 1.5), yoga stretches (M = 7.1 &#x000b1; 2.0), mindful eating (M = 6.8 &#x000b1; 1.7). This was congruent with qualitative comments made by the participants during the 8 week program. The first author was the instructor in this study, but has developed an extensive train the trainer program that has been successfully delivered in other locations. Participants value the evidenced-based nature of MIM, and appreciated the combination of the relaxing music played in the background and pragmatic practice tools provided. Regarding the satisfaction with the environmental constraints, the highest satisfaction was with the intervention location being onsite (7.8 &#x000b1; 1.8), weekly sessions (7.7 &#x000b1; 1.3), and duration of the intervention (6.5 &#x000b1; 2.7), while time of the weekly session had the lowest satisfaction rating (4.8 &#x000b1; 3.4). This low score proved surprising as the timing of the weekly session was chosen based upon staff recommendation. The importance of institutional support had a very high score at 8.1 &#x000b1; 1.8 as well as the importance of patient care coverage (7.9 &#x000b1; 1.9). It was very important to the ICU personnel to know that their patients were well cared for while they attended MIM.</p><p><graphic xlink:href="jove-101-52359-0.jpg" position="float" orientation="portrait"/><bold>Figure 1.

Participant rating of MIM components.</bold> Rating on a 1 - 10 scale with 10 being most valued (n = 34). The institutional support was highly valued by the participants as this is what enabled them to receive time release to attend MIM. Other shift nurses were paid to come in an hour before their normal start time so that the MBI participant&#x02019;s patients were cared for by experienced nurses. The music that was played in the background of both the group sessions and on each of the individual CD tracks for individual practice was also very highly rated. Participants emphasized hearing the music played in the background of their individual practice reminded them of how relaxed they felt at the end of each weekly group session. The onsite location of the weekly sessions was also highly valued by participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The rationale for developing the MIM protocol was to deliver a pragmatic onsite MBI to introduce mindfulness to working adults, within the context of a chronically high stress work environment, who may not have the time, nor inclination, to sign up for a mindfulness course outside of work hours, yet could significantly benefit from the resources it provides. Mindfulness research has consistently validated the contribution that mindfulness can offer towards emotion regulation<sup>20</sup> and the value of remaining present, rather than worrying about the past, or thinking about the future<sup>4</sup>. For personnel, working in a high stress environment that concurrently demands high attention to detail, and extreme presence of mind to changing circumstances (such as an ICU patient&#x02019;s health status), the resources of emotion regulation and resiliency seem critical. But very few empirical studies have examined the benefit of providing mindfulness interventions in the workplace.</p><p>Yet workplace delivery, if institutional support can be garnered, is prudent as typical adults spend increasing amounts of time on the job. Attaining institutional support for both the cost of the intervention, and for the time coverage provided for the employees to attend the intervention, is critical to the success of this protocol. Participants need to feel supported by the organization, and providing the opportunity for an employee to attend a stress reduction intervention at their job is one way to accomplish this. Another critical feature is obtaining quality data pre and post intervention to demonstrate that the organizational investment was worthwhile. Subsequently presenting this data to policy and decision makers will ensure continued success of the intervention within various other units of the organization.</p><p>Modifications, easily made to MIM are critical as they show the employees that the intervention addresses their specific stresses and concerns, applied to their unique environmental stresses. Shortening the length of the weekly meetings from the traditional 2.5 - 3 hr MBSR weekly meeting, to 1 hr at shift change, was a seminal modification for this specific population of ICU personnel. Efforts were made before the intervention took place to accommodate the greatest amount of potential participants before choosing the time/location of the weekly one hour group meeting. Recent research that reviewed empirical mindfulness research interventions with nurses, notes that of the 13 studies included, only 2 studies were modified in terms of intervention length, and that most mindfulness interventions to date follow the traditional MBSR format and duration<sup>25</sup>. This provides the motivation to detail an onsite MBI that proves effective in increasing resilience and work engagement, specifically vigor in one&#x02019;s work, so that other professions, and work sites can adapt it for their own needs.</p><p>A limitation of this protocol, delivered on-site at the worksite is the absolute necessity of institutional support. Without replacement nursing personnel being paid to cover the hour of participation in the intervention, study participants would have had to attend on their own family/personal time, lessening the sense that the organization is committed to the health and wellness of their employees. Another limitation is that a conveniently located conference room needs to be available for the intervention to occur.</p><p>The protocol described herein is highly adaptable to other environments. This research successfully illustrates the feasibility and effectiveness of implementation of MIM within the confines of the unique constraints of emergency situations, shift work, personnel coverage, space limitations, and many institutional regulations characteristics of this environment. Assessment of the specific stresses within the ICU proved to be a critical step in the protocol as the participants were appreciative of learning specific tools to interrupt common habitual reactions to stress, revealed to the ICU personnel during MIM. The stress assessment phase of information gathering enabled this to occur. Teaching specifics on how to cultivate more adaptive ways of responding to these stressors becomes a critical piece of the didactic portion of MIM. The breath counts conducted at the beginning and end of each weekly session gives participants a way to quantify a physical index of their stress level as they become increasingly aware that respiration rates are both reflective of stress levels, and can serve as an avenue that can be utilized to calm one self. Institutional support plays a critical role throughout the development and implementation of an onsite MBI, as time release and adequate coverage is a necessary feature for the ICU personnel to be present to the weekly group meeting. Each feature of the MIM protocol described is at once important, yet flexible, able to meet the needs of other chronically high stressed work environments.</p><p>Additional research studies utilizing MIM, and development of other MBIs appropriate for the workplace will help to further policy change enabling mindfulness programs to be delivered routinely<sup>25</sup>. The largest study thus far of mindfulness in the workplace<sup>13</sup> compared a MBI, delivered both online and in person. The control conditions included a therapeutic yoga group and also a group that did not receive any intervention. The 239 employees that were participants in the mind&#x02013;body interventions showed significantly greater improvements in their perceived stress, the quality of their sleep, and heart rate variability. These are important findings as it indicates that the mind/body interventions helped the employees be more flexible in their stress responses. There were no differences between employee outcomes for those who attended in-person or online<sup>13</sup>. Some work environments that have unique constraints, (shift work in particular), may be best suited for an online delivery model to accommodate fluctuating work schedules. Thus, intervention length and location of MBI delivery are critical factors to consider for specific work environments, as well as method of delivery, <italic>e.g.,</italic> in-person versus online delivery. Development of a pragmatic MBI that proves effective in a high stress, low control environment, such as the ICU, can effectively be delivered in other high stress work environments that require personnel to display high attention to detail, such as fire fighters, or police officers. The significance of implementing a pragmatic protocol that includes a holistic mind/body approach that considers modifications appropriate for the specific environment (intervention length /location) allows participation from employees that may never elect to participate in a longer, less convenient stress-reduction intervention. Additionally, increasing resilience and work engagement, and especially vigor in a population of personnel working in a high stress environment not only improves the lives of individuals, but potentially the lives that they touch through their work.</p></sec><sec><title>Disclosures</title><p>Subsequent to the completion of this research conducted at the Ohio State University, Dr. Klatt has served as a consultant to Mindful Management, LLC, to whom The Ohio State University has licensed the rights of the individual practice CD/DVD, and all other authors have nothing to disclose.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge the following entities at the Ohio State University: Stress, Trauma, and Resilience (STAR) Program, Health System Administration, Critical Care Nursing, and the Faculty Associates Program through the Women&#x02019;s Place, for their critical institutional and financial contributions to this project.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="B0"><element-citation publication-type="journal" publisher-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kabat-Zinn</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>An outpatient program in behavioral medicine for chronic pain patients based on the practice of mindfulness meditation: theoretical considerations and preliminary results</article-title><source>Gen Hosp Psychiatry</source><year>1982</year><volume>4</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>33</fpage><lpage>47</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7042457</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B1"><element-citation publication-type="book" publisher-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kabat-Zinn</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Hanh</surname><given-names>TN</given-names></name></person-group><source>Full catastrophe living: Using the wisdom of your body and mind to face stress</source><year>1990</year><publisher-name>Delacourt</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><element-citation publication-type="journal" publisher-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ludwig</surname><given-names>DS</given-names></name><name><surname>Kabat-Zinn</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Mindfulness in medicine</article-title><source>JAMA</source><year>2008</year><volume>300</volume><issue>11</issue><fpage>1350</fpage><lpage>1352</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18799450</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><element-citation publication-type="journal" publisher-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>KW</given-names></name><name><surname>Ryan</surname><given-names>RM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The benefits of being present: mindfulness and its role in psychological well-being</article-title><source>J Pers Soc Psychol</source><year>2003</year><volume>84</volume><issue>4</issue><fpage>822</fpage><lpage>848</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12703651</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B4"><element-citation publication-type="journal" publisher-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Grossman</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Niemann</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Schmidt</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Walach</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Mindfulness-based stress reduction and health benefits.
