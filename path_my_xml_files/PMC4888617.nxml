Intra-articular&#x000a0;(IA) injection of hyaluronic acid (HA) which is a glycosaminoglycan chain that occurs naturally within the knee joint, or viscosupplementation, is a widely used treatment for relief of OA pain in the knee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In addition to the mechanical effect of HA lubricating the joint and protecting the cartilage from mechanical degradation, IA-HA treatment is believed to exert its therapeutic effect by providing chondroprotection and anti-inflammatory effect, stimulating endogenous proteoglycan and HA synthesis, limiting subchondral bone changes, and reducing the action of joint nociceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, recent OA treatment guidelines by American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) cast doubt on the utility of this therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This stands in contrast to the fact that many clinicians have found HA to be a valuable treatment option for those OA patients with cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and metabolic comorbidities which render use of many systemic drugs unsuitable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Further analysis of clinical trial data should provide clinicians with more clarity on the utility of IA - HA over the discrepancy between guidelines and clinical practice.</p><p>Gel-200 (Gel-One<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Seikagaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) is a sterile, transparent, and viscoelastic hydrogel composed of a cross-linked hyaluronate, a derivative of a highly purified hyaluronate product. It was approved by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2011 for the treatment of OA pain in the knee. The safety and effectiveness of a single Gel-200 injection was demonstrated in a 13-week pivotal multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted in the US that recruited 379 OA patients. Analyses of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) visual analog scale (VAS) pain and physical function subscores, Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials and Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OMERACT&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;OARSI) strict responders, and physician global assessments of disease activity in the initial RCT demonstrated statistically significant improvements in patients treated with a single injection of Gel-200 compared with a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) control. At 13&#x000a0;weeks, 6.39&#x000a0;mm of treatment difference demonstrated a statistical significance in a 100-mm VAS WOMAC pain subscore (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.037), and from 3&#x000a0;weeks through 13&#x000a0;weeks, 7.10&#x000a0;mm of treatment difference was shown (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.005). Improvements in WOMAC pain subscore were evident as early as 3&#x000a0;weeks following injection with more than 40&#x000a0;% improvement from baseline and continued through 13&#x000a0;weeks. Adverse events (AEs) were not significantly different between the treatment groups, and no unanticipated treatment-related serious AEs were reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Patients who completed the 13-week RCT were eligible to enroll in the open-label extension (OLE). Patients were eligible for treatment with Gel-200 at any point while enrolled in the extension once they met the eligibility criteria. Retreatment with Gel-200 was shown to be safe for 13&#x000a0;weeks post retreatment by comparing AE data between treatment groups (retreatment with Gel-200 and initial treatment with Gel-200 following PBS), although the previous analysis did not provide in-depth examination of comparability between the two groups. In addition, a previously published analysis demonstrated that repeat treatment with Gel-200 for 13&#x000a0;weeks following retreatment relieved symptomatic OA as effectively as the initial injection with a favorable safety profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. For 13&#x000a0;weeks post retreatment, more than 30&#x000a0;mm improvement from baseline in WOMAC pain subscores persisted. The amount of pain relief provided by retreatment was greater than that reported over 13&#x000a0;weeks post initial treatment.</p><p>We report the results of additional analyses of the RCT and OLE data conducted to provide further evidence of the safety of a repeat injection of Gel-200.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p>Both the RCT, SI-6606/01, and the OLE, Gel/1132, were approved by a central institutional review board. The RCT was conducted from August 2006 to December 2007 (last patient visit) at 28 sites in the US, and the OLE was conducted from March 2007 to May 2008 (last patient visit) at 23 of those sites in accordance with good clinical practices. A signed consent form approved by the institutional review board was obtained for each patient. These trials were registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (identification numbers NTC 00449696 and NTC&#x000a0;00450112, respectively). Patients were eligible for enrolment in the 13&#x000a0;week RCT if they had pain &#x0003e;4&#x000a0;weeks, Kellgren-Lawrence grade 1&#x02013;3 by X-ray, and WOMAC pain subscore &#x02265;40&#x000a0;mm. Patients were instructed to use only those medications during the trial for OA they were receiving prior to enrolment, as well as not to use any medications for symptomatic pain relief within the 24&#x000a0;h prior to each evaluation visit. Patients were randomized to Gel-200 or PBS in 2:1 ratio and followed up to 13&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>All patients who completed the 13-week RCT were eligible to enroll in OLE following an informed consent to the extension and retreatment study. Patients who enrolled in the extension study did not receive a Gel-200 injection unless and until their WOMAC pain score again met eligibility for entry into the RCT, ie, &#x02265;40&#x000a0;mm on VAS in the treated and &#x02264;20&#x000a0;mm in the contralateral knee, at any time after enrollment or at evaluations at 3, 6, 9, and 13&#x000a0;weeks in the extension phase. After meeting these criteria, patients received a single injection of Gel-200 (30&#x000a0;mg cross-linked hyaluronate in 3.0&#x000a0;mL) in the treated knee at Week 0 of the retreatment phase and returned for evaluations at Weeks 1, 3, 6, 9, and 13 following reinjection. Patients who did not meet the pain criteria through Week 13 of the OLE did not receive another injection. All patients remained blinded to the initial treatment received during the RCT. Patients were again instructed to use only allowed medications and not initiate use of any new analgesic or anti-inflammatory agents during the study, as well as to not use any medications for symptomatic pain relief within the 24&#x000a0;h prior to each evaluation visit.</p><p>The safety and effectiveness in the 13-week RCT were assessed retrospectively by the population who received a second Gel-200 injection (Retreatment Group A) and who did not receive a second Gel-200 injection (Non-retreatment Group B)</p><p>The safety of retreatment with Gel-200 was assessed by comparing the rates of AEs and device-related AEs reported in the retreatment study through Week 4 in those patients receiving a second Gel-200 injection (Retreatment Group A) to the rates among patients receiving their first Gel-200 injection (ie, PBS patients from the RCT, PBS&#x02013;Gel Group C).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Statistical analyses</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Analysis populations</title><p>Data were analyzed by performing comparisons within 2 separate safety populations, diagramed in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

Consistent with the findings of this meta-analysis, a recent consensus statement issued by experts in Europe also confirmed the safety and effectiveness of viscosupplementation in clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], in contrast to consensus statements in the US by AAOS and Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, reports in the literature regarding the safety and effectiveness of viscosupplementation in patients with knee OA have been mixed. In a comprehensive meta-analysis of 89 trials that compared viscosupplementation with sham or a nonintervention control in adults with knee OA, Rutjes et al. reported that viscosupplementation was associated with a small, clinically irrelevant benefit and an increased risk of serious AEs and local AEs; however, the authors also noted that trial quality was generally low and safety data were often poorly reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Another publication countered that viscosupplementation is safe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Thus, safety data continue to be analyzed for viscosupplementation products, and this issue has become more germane as safety of alternative treatments for knee OA is being debated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Multiple single-injection viscosupplementation products are approved in the US for which the safety of a repeat injection has been examined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. For two of these products, follow-up occurred for at least 4&#x000a0;weeks after the reinjection, and 4&#x000a0;weeks of safety data were used as evidence for safety of a repeat injection. Thus, although a previously published analysis of the OLE study had demonstrated safety of a repeat injection of Gel-200 up to 13&#x000a0;weeks following retreatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], the current analysis examined safety data over 4&#x000a0;weeks following reinjection. The incidences of all AEs and device-related AEs were similar between patients receiving retreatment with Gel-200 and those receiving an initial injection. These results, consistent with the meta-analysis by Strand et al., indicate that retreatment with Gel-200 is generally safe and well tolerated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Additionally, when comparing reported AE rates of a repeat injection of Gel-200 over 13&#x000a0;weeks, AE rates at 4&#x000a0;weeks were much lower than those over 13&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. No acute AE that may raise a concern on safety of Gel-200 was identified.</p><p>The retreatment population rate in this study was lower than those reported in retreatment studies for similar products. Fewer patients who completed the pivotal Gel-200 RCT received retreatment in the Gel/1132 study. For example, in trials for approved viscosupplementation products Synvisc-One<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, MONOVISC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, and EUFLEXXA<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, reinjection rates of 63, 65, and 74&#x000a0;%, respectively, were reported, compared with a 53&#x000a0;% reinjection rate for Gel-200 in the OLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It was therefore important to determine that the Retreatment Group A was appropriate to include in this safety evaluation, representing the overall Gel-200 treatment population in the pivotal RCT. Overall, the patients retreated with Gel-200 in the OLE were similar to those who were not reinjected. There were no significant differences in demographics, baseline characteristics, or safety events reported in the pivotal RCT study for those who did and did not receive a second Gel-200 injection in the following OLE. These results show that the Retreatment Group A was an appropriate sample with which to examine the safety of retreatment with Gel-200. Moveover, patients who were not reinjected also did not appear to have any specific safety concerns about Gel-200 that would have precluded reinjection. Upper respiratory infections were reported by &#x02265;5&#x000a0;% in patients with Gel-One in the 13-week RCT, also in patients receiving PBS, with a similar incidence (4.7&#x000a0;%). In both treatment groups, all cases were judged as not related to treatment by investigators. Nonretreatment patients also did not appear to have any concerns regarding effectiveness; patients in Nonretreatment Group B experienced greater OA pain relief following Gel-200 during the RCT than patients in Retreatment Group A. Additionally, those patients who did not consent to enter the OLE had better effectiveness results at Week 13 in the pivotal study. The high pain-relieving effect experienced by patients who received Gel-200 injection in Nonretreatment Group B may have contributed to their decision not to enter the retreatment study (data not shown), as it is plausible that for many of these patients, no retreatment was needed at the time that it was provided in the OLE study. Such potential evidence of long-lasting effectiveness of Gel-200 is consistent with the reporting of a recent network meta-analysis by Bannuru et al., which showed that HA injections were more effective in pain relief than other pharmacologic interventions once the effect of PBS injection serving as an active control was accounted for during the network meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In the case of Gel-200, the potential evidence for long-lasting analgesic effect of Gel-200 in the RCT is corroborated by the finding from a previous animal study which showed that Gel-200 remained in the joint even 28&#x000a0;days after injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. There was no specific feature in patients who received the second Gel-200 injection. Patient demographic between patients who received the second Gel-200 injection and those who did not receive the second Gel-200 injection, were similar except for pain scores. However, these results also demonstrate internal consistency with previous findings from the same trial that those receiving an initial injection of Gel-200 had a longer time before meeting the threshold condition for retreatment eligibility than patients receiving PBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, these additional analyses of retreatment from the OLE have confirmed the safety of Gel-200 following single and repeat injections in both pivotal and retreatment trials.
