The main needs of these patients involve monitoring of risk factors and review of drug prescriptions, which could be satisfactorily done in primary care facilities. The goal of this protocol is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of telemedicine services to support the transition of patients with stable chronic coronary artery disease from the tertiary to the primary level of care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>We designed a randomized non-inferiority protocol that will include 280 patients with stable coronary artery disease (for at least 12&#x000a0;months). Patients will be selected from the Ischemic Heart Disease Clinic in a tertiary care hospital in southern Brazil. Enrolled participants will be randomized into one of two groups: 12&#x000a0;months of follow-up at the same clinic; or 12&#x000a0;months of follow-up at a primary care facility with clinical support from a telemedicine platform including a toll-free line for physicians (intervention group). In the intervention group, decisions to refer patients to tertiary care during follow-up will be made jointly by primary physicians and medical teleconsultants. The groups will be compared in terms of the primary outcome&#x02014;maintenance of baseline functional class 1 or 2 after 12&#x000a0;months. Secondary outcomes include control of risk factors and instability of the disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We intend to determine the effectiveness of using telemedicine to qualify the transition of patients with chronic coronary disease from the tertiary to the primary level of care. This should facilitate the access of patients to the healthcare system, since care will be provided closer to their homes, and provide more opportunities for treatment of severe cases at tertiary care hospitals that are often overcrowded.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov # <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02489565">NCT02489565</ext-link> &#x02013; trial registration date May 13, 2015</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Coronary artery disease</kwd><kwd>Telemedicine</kwd><kwd>Randomized clinical trial</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>MCTI/CNPq/MS - SCTIE/DECIT</institution></funding-source><award-id>401463/2013-3</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Counsel of Technological and Scientific Development (CNPq) - IATS</institution></funding-source><award-id>573826/2008-0</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Coordena&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Aperfei&#x000e7;oamento de Pessoal de N&#x000ed;vel Superior (Capes)</institution></funding-source><award-id>1269817</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Counsel of Technological and Scientific Development (CNPq)</institution></funding-source><award-id>311564/2013-5</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Polanczyk</surname><given-names>Carisi Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003810</institution-id><institution>Hospital de Cl&#x000ed;nicas de Porto Alegre</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GPPG140206</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Coronary artery disease (CAD) is characterized by a wide range of clinical presentations. In many patients, CAD remains stable for long periods, with fairly steady symptoms over time, whereas in others the presence of multiple cardiovascular events entails the need for revascularization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. With a greater number of diagnoses and increased survival following treatment of acute ischemic CAD, the number of patients experiencing stable angina has increased progressively worldwide. In Brazil, 18 thousand new cases of CAD and 900 thousand new cases of angina pectoris are expected every year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>The Brazilian public health care system&#x02014;the Unified Health System (SUS)&#x02014;was designed to provide universal, comprehensive healthcare to all Brazilian citizens. However, complex technologies, financial resources, and qualified personnel are currently concentrated in large cities, with marked regional inequality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In Porto Alegre, state capital of Rio Grande do Sul, only about 50&#x000a0;% of CAD patients treated in a specialized outpatient clinic at a tertiary care university hospital (Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, HCPA) live in the city. The other 50&#x000a0;% are referred from other cities in the state Rio Grande do Sul. Some patients travel as much as 8&#x000a0;h to reach the hospital. This situation also causes overcrowding of the tertiary clinic and restricts access, making it difficult to book urgent appointments and prioritize the most severe cases. The performance of specialized tests and exams is often delayed.</p><p>Nevertheless, many of the patients seeking care in Porto Alegre could be managed in their city of origin within the context of primary care, defined as &#x0201c;that aspect of a health services system that assures (&#x02026;) comprehensiveness of care in the sense that only rare or unusual manifestations of ill health are referred elsewhere, and coordination of care such that all facets of care (wherever received) are integrated&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. SUS is based on a logic of referral and counter-referral, according to which less technologically dense services may refer patients for care at greater complexity facilities, namely, hospitals and specialized clinics; and these complex services can refer the patient back for follow-up at primary care facilities that are closer to the patient&#x02019;s home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Because of structural limitations, including health care professionals who feel unprepared or unsupported to treat situations they deem as complex, the referral and counter-referral system is often bypassed.</p><p>In this context, telemedicine provides a useful tool for diagnostic and therapeutic support as well as continuing health education. Telehealth appointments involving workers, health professionals, and managers can be used to clarify doubts about clinical procedures and health actions and answer questions regarding the work process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>This article describes a protocol designed to evaluate the use of telemedicine to support the counter-referral of stable CAD patients treated in a tertiary outpatient clinic to primary care facilities, with remote assistance for routine follow-up and decision-making regarding the need for care at the tertiary clinic in the presence of clinical instability. This initiative is intended to facilitate the access to tertiary services for patients with more severe conditions, reduce delays in booking appointments and tests, and ensure delivery of quality care to counter-referred patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This randomized non-inferiority trial was designed to compare two groups: CAD patients meeting outpatient clinic discharge criteria, counter-referred from tertiary to primary care for follow-up with telemedicine monitoring (intervention group); and CAD patients meeting outpatient clinic discharge criteria with follow-up at the original tertiary care outpatient clinic (control group).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study population and sample size</title><p>The study population will be selected among patients from the Ischemic Heart Disease outpatient clinic at HCPA, a tertiary care university hospital in South Brazil.

This was based on the rate of patients with increase in angina to a higher CCS reported by a previous study for the control group receiving optimal treatment for CAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. An additional 10&#x000a0;% margin was added to account for losses to follow-up.

At the HCPA Ischemic Cardiopathy Clinic, in the city of Porto Alegre, more than 50&#x000a0;% patients come from other cities, located as far as 8&#x000a0;h away. These patients face stressful trips and risk of road accidents, among others. Only two new patients are evaluated at the clinic every week. The large patient volume also compromises the ability to provide urgent appointments, prioritize more severe cases, and perform test such as echocardiograms and myocardial scintigraphy. However, many of the patients seen at the clinic have been stable for long periods, requiring only monitoring of risk factors and re-evaluation of prescribed medicines. These activities can be satisfactorily performed at a Basic Health Unit/Family Health Program, with prompt referral to the tertiary hospital only in the presence of instability.</p><p>It is believed that the mechanisms facilitating patient referral and counter-referral are fundamental to assure the principle of comprehensiveness, suitability of care for the patient, and rational use of resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Telehealth centers can help improve the effectiveness of counter-referral and management of stable chronic cases, thus preventing the overcrowding of specialized services and ensuring good quality follow-up near the patient&#x02019;s home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A previous protocol carried out by our telehealth program (Telessa&#x000fa;deRS/UFRGS) showed that referral to a higher level of care was avoided in one out of every two cases following discussion with telehealth specialists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>The main risk for participants of the present protocol is violation of data confidentiality. All possible measures will be taken by investigators to prevent this. A single patient identification number will be used. Direct benefits are not expected either. However, the information obtained will serve to improve the management of patients with stable CAD. The results of this work will also provide important information on the best way to allocate technological resources in this area.</p><p>It is expected that the quality of follow-up and monitoring of ischemic cardiopathy will be similar in the tertiary clinic and with the primary care/telemedicine scheme. If that is confirmed, stable patients will in the future have access to treatment close to their homes, while opening space for more severe patients who have no choice but to be treated in a tertiary hospital.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>SUS, Unified Health System from Brazil; HCPA, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre; CAD, Coronary Artery Disease; AMI, Acute Myocardial Infarction; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; CCS, Canadian Cardiovascular Society; Telessa&#x000fa;deRS, Telehealth center from Rio Grande do Sul; UFRGS, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul; LDL, Low Density Lipoprotein; IQR, inter-quartile range; WMA, World Medical Association; CAAE, Certificate of Presentation for Ethical Consideration</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors received partial support from the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&#x000ed;fico e Tecnol&#x000f3;gico - CNPq (IATS 573826/2008&#x02013;0 and scholarship 311564/2013&#x02013;5 to CAP) and Coordena&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Aperfei&#x000e7;oamento de Pessoal de N&#x000ed;vel Superior&#x02014;Capes (scholarship 1269817 to JDLB).</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>The project is funded by a grant from the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology (MCTI/CNPq/MS - SCTIE/DECIT Grant/Funding Number: 401463/2013&#x02013;3) and Hospital das Cl&#x000ed;nicas de Porto Alegre/UFRGS.
