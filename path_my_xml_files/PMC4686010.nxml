It predominantly occurs in fifth to seventh decades of life [<xref rid="pone.0142789.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0142789.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and is estimated to affect 1 in 10 people over a lifetime [<xref rid="pone.0142789.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], cost a quarter of a billion dollars per year in the United States [<xref rid="pone.0142789.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0142789.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and lead many to consult a physician or other health care practitioner [<xref rid="pone.0142789.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142789.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Commonly recommended non-surgical treatments include ice, oral medication, stretching, orthoses, physical therapy, night splints, extracorporeal shock wave therapy and steroid injections [<xref rid="pone.0142789.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In-shoe orthoses, either pre-fabricated or custom made [<xref rid="pone.0142789.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] are generally favoured before the use of more invasive treatments like steroid injections [<xref rid="pone.0142789.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142789.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, the effectiveness of other common treatment approaches, including sandals shaped like orthoses, is not yet known [<xref rid="pone.0142789.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Footwear companies are increasingly incorporating aspects of foot orthoses within readily available foot wear and directly marketing to the general public without evidence of efficacy or physician consultation. An example of this is the use of contoured slip-on sandals to manage a myriad of lower limb ailments, including plantar heel pain [<xref rid="pone.0142789.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0142789.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Conceivably a contoured sandal, which is quicker and easier to slip on than an orthosis in a closed in shoe, that has the properties of in-shoe foot orthosis might confer advantages such as reducing first step pain and would be better tolerated in hot environments where closed-in footwear with orthoses is uncomfortable.</p><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a readily available contoured sandal in the management of plantar heel pain by comparing it to a non-contoured flat flip-flop and a contoured shoe insert. We hypothesised that the contoured sandal would be more efficacious than the non-contoured flat flip-flop, and similar to a contoured shoe insert.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>A randomized clinical trial evaluated the outcome after wearing contoured sandals compared to wearing flat flip-flops or contoured shoe inserts (over-the-counter, pre-fabricated full-length foot orthoses) over 12 weeks in patients with heel pain.

The contoured sandal was a commercially available one (Vionics International, San Fransisco, USA) that has a design that approximates that of the foot-bed of a prefabricated in-shoe foot orthosis.

By the very nature of the devices, the participant and research assistant providing the devices were not blinded.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Primary outcomes were the participants&#x02019; self-reported level of improvement on a 15-point Global Rating of Change (GROC) scale (1 = a very great deal worse, 8 = no change, 15 = a very great deal better) [<xref rid="pone.0142789.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and the 20-item Lower Extremity Function Scale (LEFS) [<xref rid="pone.0142789.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The GROC scale was dichotomised so that quite a bit better, a great deal better or a very great deal better represented a beneficial improvement/outcome, and moderately better or less on the scale (i.e., &#x0003c;13) represented no benefit. The LEFS seeks participant ratings on a 5-point scale (0 = extreme difficulty, 4 = no difficulty) across 20 common weight bearing activities and activities of daily living, such that a total score of 0 indicates maximum difficulty and 80 indicates no difficulty with these activities [<xref rid="pone.0142789.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The minimal detectable change and minimal clinical important difference are both 9 points [<xref rid="pone.0142789.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Secondary outcomes were the 11-point pain numerical rating scale (NRS; 0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain imaginable) of worst level of heel pain in the preceding week, and the 29-item foot and ankle ability measure [<xref rid="pone.0142789.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The foot and ankle ability measure is similar to the LEFS in that it has 21-items of activities of daily living, but it also explores higher order sport activities in a further 8-items [<xref rid="pone.0142789.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The scores are represented as a percentage for both the activities of daily living and sports subscales, with minimal detectable change of 5&#x000b7;7 and 12&#x000b7;3 respectively, and minimal clinical important difference of 8 and 9 respectively [<xref rid="pone.0142789.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>We also measured foot posture at baseline and 12 weeks. There is some conjecture as to the relationship between posture and plantar heel pain [<xref rid="pone.0142789.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and some evidence that foot orthoses control the amount of foot pronation [<xref rid="pone.0142789.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We used the Foot Posture Index as a means of describing the foot posture in our participants with a view to evaluating if there was any change in foot posture with wearing the devices. The Foot Posture Index is a scale consisting of standardised ratings of visual observation of the foot [<xref rid="pone.0142789.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The summation of the ratings is used to score the foot as normal (0 to 5), pronated (6 to 9)/supinated (-1 to -4) or highly pronated (10+)/supinated (-5 to -12).</p><p>A research assistant who was blinded to group allocation collected data at baseline, 4, 8 and 12 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary hypothesis was that after 12-weeks of wearing the devices, the contoured sandal would outperform the flat flip-flops, but not the contoured shoe inserts. A total sample size of 150 participants was estimated to detect a 30% advantage on the dichotomised GROC scale for the contoured sandal over the flat flip-flop, assuming a 25% success rate in the latter, with 90% power, 5% type 1 error (one sided) using an online sample size calculator (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~rollin/stats/ssize/b2.html">http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~rollin/stats/ssize/b2.html</ext-link>), and approximately a 10% drop out.</p><p>All analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. The descriptive statistics were presented by number (%), mean (SD) or median (inter quartile range, IQR). Any missing values at week 12 measurements were replaced by the observed measurements at week 8.</p><p>To compare the proportions for categorical data in flat flip flop and orthosis groups, with sandal group as reference, logistic regression models were used. The odds ratios along with the 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the odds ratios were obtained, with the robust estimation of standard errors. Analyses were adjusted for baseline measure, except for the GROC measure. Numbers needed to treat and 95% CI were also calculated.</p><p>To compare continuous outcome variables, two approaches were used, first as continuous variables and second as categorical variables defined by the minimal clinical important difference at an individual participant level. The non-parametric quartile regression method was used for the continuous data, with the baseline measure for individual outcome variables as the adjustment factor. The regression coefficient estimates and their 95% confidence interval were presented. The quartile regression method was used to draw inference at the median levels of the outcome measures, due to the high skewness in the outcome variables. The categorical data was evaluated with logistic regression models as above. Analyses were conducted using STATA 12 (Texas, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec013"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 150 participants with plantar heel pain were enrolled and followed up between June 1 2012 and June 28 2013, 34 participants at the research site in Melbourne and 116 at the Queensland site. The random allocation of devices resulted in 49 participants (33%) receiving a contoured sandal (40 participants (34%) in Queensland and 9 participants (27%) in Melbourne), 50 (33%) receiving a flat flip-flop (37 participants (32%) in Queensland and 13 participants (38%) in Melbourne) and 51 (34%) receiving a contoured shoe insert (39 participants (34%) in Queensland and 12 participants (35%) in Melbourne).</p><p>
<xref rid="pone.0142789.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> summarizes recruitment, participation, and attrition. The most common reasons for exclusion of participants with suspected heel pain were recent other treatment for heel pain (36%), co-morbidities (15%), incorrect pain area (13%), unable to contact or withdrew interest (13%), and unwilling to be randomized and/or use trial devices (12%). First step pain levels too low (&#x02264;3/10 NRS), unable to travel to the research site, heel trauma, foot and ankle surgery, high athletic activity levels (&#x0003e;90min/day, 5days/week), and short pain duration (&#x0003c;4 weeks) made up the remaining 11% of excluded participants. One participant in the flat flip-flop group received a contoured sandal incorrectly. Intention to treat analysis was performed.</p><p>The trial was completed in October 2013, with 137 participants (91%) submitting primary outcomes at 12 weeks. 13 participants (9%) were lost to follow up (unable to contact n = 10, personal issues n = 1, increase in pain n = 2). Patients were deemed to have been lost to follow-up if they did not provide GROC scores. Patients who discontinued treatment had the opportunity to provide follow-up data.

For every 4 patients with plantar heel pain wearing a contoured sandal, one more would be expected to be quite a bit better, a great deal better or a very great deal better than if they wore a flat flip-flop. The contoured shoe insert used in this study is similar to prefabricated in-shoe foot orthoses that have been shown to be of benefit over 3 months [<xref rid="pone.0142789.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This supports a recommendation that the consulting physician can confidently recommend either a contoured sandal or contoured shoe insert as one of the first strategies in managing plantar heel pain. A self-evident advantage of a slip on contoured sandal over an orthosis in a closed shoe is that the patient can quickly don the sandals first thing in the morning or after prolonged sitting and avoid experiencing pain.</p><p>That the contoured sandals performed better than the flat flip-flops and similarly to contoured shoe inserts provides further support for the use of footwear with a contoured foot bed. Contoured footwear devices might exert their effect in a number of ways, most likely in a similar manner as in-shoe foot orthoses. A commonly promulgated mechanism is that the contoured device reduces rear-foot pronation [<xref rid="pone.0142789.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] though the relationship between plantar heel pain and abnormal pronation is undecided [<xref rid="pone.0142789.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Our cohort demonstrated normal foot posture as rated by the Foot Posture Index, both at baseline and at the end of the study, indicating that a pronated resting foot posture is not a feature of plantar heel pain in the studied participants and that it was not altered by wearing contoured sandals or contoured shoe inserts. Recently we demonstrated on a radiographic and anthropometric study that the contoured device raised the mid foot arch height more so than did a flat flip-flop and to a similar amount as a contoured shoe insert (orthosis) [<xref rid="pone.0142789.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Our data might reflect that there is a temporary effect on posture by the devices but that it does not remain so after a period of wearing. Another proposition is that in-shoe foot orthoses fill the space between the foot and footwear and thus provide a greater degree of plantar surface contact between the shoe and the foot. The increased contact area might distribute stress and or provide sensory input across the plantar soft tissues including the plantar fascia and thereby help relieve pain [<xref rid="pone.0142789.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142789.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>There are some limitations of this study that ought to be kept in mind when interpreting the results. We did not ask if first step pain had changed, but it would be reasonable to assume that the GROC score would be representative of any improvement or worsening of first step pain. Compliance to device wear was not evaluated and so we were unable to ascertain if compliance influenced the outcomes, but we did use an intention to treat analytic approach that by definition indicates our results apply to the decision to wear the device as much as if it was worn, how much or not at all. Another caveat on the interpretation of the results is that we were unable to blind the patients to the device they were allocated, so a placebo mechanism might explain the beneficial effects of the contoured sandal and contoured shoe insert over the flip-flop. However, a previous randomized placebo controlled trial reported orthoses, which were similar to the ones used in our trial, produced beneficial effects that were superior to placebo effects over 3 months [<xref rid="pone.0142789.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. That the contoured sandals produced similar outcomes to that of the contoured shoe insert studied herein implies that the contoured sandals produce effects beyond that of placebo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0142789.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Basic statistics for pain in the previous week and median difference.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0142789.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0142789.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Basic statistics on foot ankle ability measure&#x02014;activities of daily living subscale.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0142789.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0142789.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Basic statistics on foot ankle ability measure&#x02014;sport subscale (FAAM-Sport, median (IQR)), quantile regression coefficients (95% CI), categories of FAAM-Sport (n, %) based on the minimally clinical important difference (9 points), and the odds ratios (95% CI) for individual FAAM-Sport change categories.</title><p>The regression coefficients and the odds ratios are for flat flip-flop and shoe insert, with contoured sandal group as reference.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0142789.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0142789.s004"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>CONSORT-2010-Checklist-MS-Word.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0142789.s004.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0142789.s005"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Protocol_OFFPHtrial.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0142789.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0142789.s006"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>Ethics Approval OFFPH_20120207.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0142789.s006.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Kerry Mellifont and Carles Escalona contributed to study implementation and data collection.
