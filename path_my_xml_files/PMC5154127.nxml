Focus groups will provide qualitative data to contribute to the assessment of the acceptability of the intervention amongst patients, carers and rehabilitation professionals and the feasibility of delivering the planned intervention. The primary outcome measure is function assessed by the Barthel Index. Secondary outcomes measure the ability to perform activities of daily living, anxiety and depression, potential mediators of outcomes such as hip pain, self-efficacy and fear of falling, health utility, health service use, objectively assessed physical function and adverse events.

Occurrence of hip fracture is strongly associated with decreased bone mineral density, increased age, prior fragility fracture, low muscular strength levels, cognitive impairment, chronic disease, under-nutrition, frailty, poor physical functioning, vision problems and weight loss (especially muscle loss) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Mortality is high with 25% dying within the following 12 months. A review of the long-term disability associated with proximal femoral fracture found that 29% of patients did not regain their pre-fracture level of functioning after 1 year in terms of restrictions of activities of daily living [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Many people who were living independently before their fracture lose their independence afterwards, so it imposes a large health and social care cost burden on society amounting to &#x000a3;2.3 billion a year in the UK, equating to approximately &#x000a3;6 million a day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Tian et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] explored Torbay&#x02019;s (Devon) unique patient-level linked data set of National Health Service (NHS) and social care costs for older people in the 12 months before and after being admitted to hospital as a result of a fall. They found that the cost of hospital, community and social care cost services for each patient were almost four times as costly in the 12 months after admission, compared to the costs of the admission itself, and that the majority of costs occurred outside of the acute hospital setting. Particularly frail individuals may go onto have a further proximal femoral fracture resulting in additional disability and deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Three phases of recovery from proximal femoral fracture have been described and are useful for research purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The first phase is in the hospital, recovering from injury and surgery, and making safe to discharge. The second phase is rehabilitation either in an institution or at home. The final phase is the enduring stage where patients use their own previous health belief strategies to determine if and when they have recovered. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has issued guidelines for the management of hip fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. As well as prompt surgical treatment, the guidelines recommend that the associated medical needs are assessed promptly by a physician specialised in caring for this patient group, who can also identify goals for a programme of multidisciplinary rehabilitation. Such rehabilitation starts whilst in hospital during post-operative recovery and continues in the community following hospital discharge. It is delivered by a multidisciplinary team depending upon patients&#x02019; individual needs at different times during their recovery and on the availability and accessibility of services in different areas. Rehabilitation has the potential to maximise recovery, enhance quality of life and maintain independence, but whilst individual components of such programmes show promise, there is insufficient evidence of overall effectiveness or cost-effectiveness or of processes of change and potential psychological mediators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The aim of our study is to finalise a new rehabilitation intervention and to complete a feasibility study before a definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT). The design of the feasibility study is described here.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Developing a rehabilitation intervention</title><p>We have completed the first phase of this research project to develop a new multidisciplinary rehabilitation intervention within the Medical Research Council&#x02019;s (MRC) framework for complex intervention development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This was informed by a realist review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] of the rehabilitation literature, which differs from a traditional systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] in that it utilises a theory-driven approach and attempts to combine principles of conventional reviews as well as a philosophy of realism, thus adopting an explanatory rather than a judgemental approach to evidence synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It does not provide simple answers to complex problems but rather provides a flexible way of building an explanatory account of what works for whom under what circumstances, taking into account the heterogeneous nature of complex programmes or interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Hence, we used this approach to determine the mechanisms behind multidisciplinary rehabilitation and to establish which components were effective (or not effective) for specific patient groups and in which circumstances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In addition, we carried out a survey of current rehabilitation practice in the United Kingdom and focus groups of members of multidisciplinary teams and hip fracture patients to obtain their views about current rehabilitation programmes.</p><p>Mechanisms which the realist review highlighted as being important for successful outcomes included the following: tailoring the intervention to the patient; the regular practice of physical activities and activities of daily living; enhancement of psychological beliefs about recovery tasks, provision of motivation and a sense of ownership to engage in exercise; and co-ordinated provision of the multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study objectives</title><p>The objectives of this study are the following:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To assess the acceptability of, and compliance with, the rehabilitation programme amongst patients, carers and clinicians and the fidelity of its delivery and to identify any adverse events.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To assess the feasibility of a future definitive RCT by assessing the number of eligible patients, monitoring recruitment and retention rates, exploring the willingness of patient participants to be randomised and the willingness of patients and carers to complete process and outcome measures.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To produce means and standard deviations of the quantitative measures so that effect sizes can be calculated for planning the future RCT.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To explore how the intervention creates change in self-efficacy and fear of falling as potential mediators for improving function.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To explore the methodological issues for conducting an economic evaluation alongside a future RCT including identifying the most efficient way of measuring patient level costs and health benefits, programme costs and potential payer stakeholders.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To explore the feasibility and quality of data on service use extracted from patient electronic records compared with patient reported outcome measures.

BCUHB is the largest health board in Wales with a population of 692,000. Data collected will include type of fracture, type of surgery, length of stay in acute hospital, serious complications, mortality rates, repeat fractures, place of residence on admission, place of discharge from acute and community hospitals and serious illnesses requiring hospital re-admission. Audit figures returned to the National Hip Fracture Database give a conservative estimate that approximately 100 to 180 patients are admitted to each of these hospitals (a total of 300 to 540) in a 6-month period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Cohort study outcomes</title><p>From the cohort anonymised data set, we will record the following:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The number of patients aged over 65 years admitted with a proximal femoral fracture.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The number of patients who fulfil the inclusion criteria for the randomised feasibility study.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The number of deaths, serious complications such as falls and repeat fractures, serious illness requiring hospital re-admission and discharged to institutional care.

We will attempt to recruit 50 patients to this randomised feasibility study. The number of eligible patients, the recruitment and retention rates and the number who completed the outcome questionnaires will be recorded. It will be important to determine whether random allocation to either intervention arm is acceptable to patients, carers and clinicians providing the service. The feasibility study will also be an opportunity to test a package of process and outcome measures, including economic measures, for the main trial and to inform the effect size for a future sample size calculation. These patients will also be recruited to a triangulation study which aims to compare the quality of data collected about service use from patient-reported outcome measures compared with extracting the same information from patient electronic records.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Inclusion criteria for patient participants to feasibility study</title><p>We will aim to recruit older adults recovering on an orthopaedic ward with proximal femoral fracture who were previously living independently and who have recently received surgical treatment.

If eligible, the clinicians will approach the potential participant to see if they would be interested in taking part and willing to be seen by a researcher. The study team researchers supported by National Institute for Social care and Health Research (NISCHR) Clinical Research Centre (CRC) research professionals will then recruit patients following the study&#x02019;s informed consent process which has been reviewed and approved by the NHS research ethics committee (see Additional files <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).</p><p>It is possible that during the study some participants&#x02019; capacity may change. Consequently, at follow-up, the researcher will be asked to assess whether the participant no longer has capacity to give informed consent when arranging the follow-up visit. If the patient no longer has capacity, no follow-up data will be collected, but the baseline and any other data collected to this point will be used in the analysis.</p><p>The study is taking place in an area where there are two official national languages, Welsh and English. Consequently, participants will be given a choice of Welsh or English language patient information sheets and informed consent forms. Where validated outcome measures exist in the Welsh language, participants will have the option to complete them in that language.</p><p>The researcher will complete the outcome measures with the patient participant before randomisation. The patients&#x02019; general practitioner and treating consultants will be informed of their participation and a record made in their medical records.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Informed consent - carer participants</title><p>Carers for the purpose of this study are defined as people caring for a hip fracture patient recruited to the study by providing them with face to face support most days in a week including help with activities of daily living and/or physical care. They may be a relative or a friend. The study team researchers supported by the NISCHR CRC research professionals will identify and recruit carers following the study&#x02019;s informed consent process (similar to Additional files <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Carers will be asked to complete a carer burden questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] at baseline and at follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Patient participants who give their informed consent will complete baseline process and outcome measures before being individually randomised. The randomisation will be performed by dynamic allocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] to protect against subversion whilst ensuring that the trial maintains good balance to the allocation ratio of 1:1 both within each stratification variable and across the trial. Participants will be stratified by: (1) hospital and (2) gender.</p><p>Randomisation will be requested by the researcher who has taken informed consent and will be achieved by secure web access to the remote randomisation centre at the North Wales Organisation for Randomisation Trials in Health (NWORTH), Bangor University. This system will be set up, maintained and monitored independently of the trial statistician or other trial staff. The randomisation procedures will be aligned with NWORTH standard operating procedure 5.01 to ensure best practice. The key to the randomisation code will be held centrally by NWORTH.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Blinding</title><p>Collection of outcome measures, including physical function measures, and data analysis will be performed blind to treatment allocation. This is a pragmatic study comparing two rehabilitation interventions, so it will not be possible to blind participants or their clinicians to treatment group allocation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Withdrawal of participants</title><p>Participant withdrawal from the study will not affect their medical or social care, and this point will be emphasised in the patient information sheet and during the informed consent process. Similarly, withdrawal of carer participants will not affect the medical or social care of the hip fracture patient they are caring for.</p><p>Non-completion of the follow-up questionnaires or physical function tests will not constitute formal withdrawal from the trial, and unless the participant requests withdrawal of their data completely, it may be used to impute values for the analysis. The imputation of missing values will ensure that the dataset is utilised to its full power.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Expected duration of feasibility study</title><p>Participants will be recruited over a 9-month period and followed-up for 3 months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Interventions</title><p>An &#x02018;enhanced rehabilitation&#x02019; intervention will be compared with usual rehabilitation care. Usual care consists of a multi-disciplinary rehabilitation delivered by the acute hospital, community hospital and community services depending on patients&#x02019; individual needs at different times during their recovery and on the availability and accessibility of services in different areas. The multidisciplinary team delivering care and rehabilitation includes orthopaedic surgeons, orthogeriatricians, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, dieticians, pharmacists, general practitioners (GPs) and social workers. The settings for care include acute orthopaedic or orthogeriatric wards, rehabilitation units in community hospitals, rehabilitation beds in care homes, the patient&#x02019;s own home and care home settings all delivered by a variety of community teams in both health and social care services.</p><p>The main aim of the intervention is to enhance usual rehabilitation by increasing the amount and quality of patients&#x02019; practice of physical exercise and activities of daily living in order to improve their functional outcomes at the 3-month follow up.

Adverse event reporting information will be included in the training given to the therapy teams delivering the intervention and they will be given copies of the adverse event reporting forms (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>) and details of how to return them to the research team. Details of the adverse event reporting procedure will also be included in letters to the participants&#x02019; GP and consultant informing them of their participation in the study. The adverse event form will have two sections, the first is for the healthcare professional to complete and return to the study manager. The study manager will liaise with the chief investigator who will determine whether the adverse event is serious or not and whether it is related to the study. The chief investigator will complete the second part of the form. All serious adverse events, along with the chief investigator&#x02019;s assessment of whether it is related to the study, will be sent to the Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC) for a second opinion. The trial study manager will record the information on the study master file and inform the clinical trials unit manager. Study-related serious adverse events will be reported to the sponsor and to the academic school (Schools of Medical and Healthcare Sciences, College of Health and Behavioural Science) within 24 h of being determined as serious. They will also be reported to the DMEC chair and the research ethics committee.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Referral of vulnerable adults to protection agencies (protection of vulnerable adults referral)</title><p>Staff and researchers recruiting patients have been provided with statutory protection of vulnerable adults (POVA) training by the BCUHB within vulnerable adult protection framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] in accordance with Welsh Government guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].

If a treatment/intervention costs more than &#x000a3;20,000 to &#x000a3;30,000 per QALY, then it would not be considered cost effective.</p><p>The ICEpop CAPability measure for Older people (ICECAP-O) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] will be used to calculate a capability index score. An exploratory cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted to calculate a cost per unit change in ICECAP-O score.

Three focus groups (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6 to 8) will be carried out with members of the multidisciplinary rehabilitation teams. Focus groups will be based in each of the three main hospital sites across BCUHB. We will purposively sample a multidisciplinary group of staff who have been involved with delivering the intervention or come into contact with patients involved in the intervention. These staff will include physiotherapists, occupational therapists and their assistant staff and may also include orthogeriatricians, nurses and social workers based in community teams and on the hospital wards. In addition, three focus groups of hip fracture patients and their carers (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6 to 8) who participated in the enhanced rehabilitation programme intervention will be convened.</p><sec id="Sec41"><title>Patient focus group participants</title><p>All patient participants with capacity and their carers will be asked when initially consenting whether they also agree to be invited to a focus group later in their recovery.

We aim to recruit approximately eight participants to each of the focus groups and should more than eight of those invited wish to attend, we will purposively select [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] participants to cover a range of experiences of rehabilitation. We will ask patients if they would prefer to participate in the focus group through English or Welsh. If enough participants request it, we will run a completely Welsh group. Otherwise, we will run one or more bilingual groups using simultaneous translation to facilitate patient language choice. We will offer patients who move into residential care the alternative of having a telephone or face to face interview. They will be asked to reply within a week to indicate whether they would be willing to take part or not. Researchers will then contact them with details of date, time and location of the focus group being held nearest to their place of residence.

The topic guide will be modified in an iterative fashion after each focus group. The topic guide will contain open-ended questions regarding hip fracture patients and their carers&#x02019; experiences, perceptions and beliefs about the new rehabilitation programme.

The transcripts will be coded and grouped together into categories by the researchers who will have conducted the focus groups. These researchers will discuss, compare and name the categories which will be used to populate and refine the framework. Data that does not fit within the existing framework will be used to develop new sections of the framework that will be agreed amongst the researchers.

Transcript coding and categorising, development of the framework and themes will be reviewed and discussed by the researcher leading on analysis and other members of the team to ensure a rigorous analysis process. This will include appropriate methods for ensuring the findings are plausible and credible.

In this randomised feasibility study, we will use mixed methods to examine different aspects of this programme: its acceptability in focus groups; quality of life, functional ability, mental health, potential psychological mediators of outcome and health service use with patient completed outcome measures; objective measures of physical function; patients&#x02019; preference for the content of the programme in a discrete choice experiment; routinely collected information to measure health service use and process outcomes; and adverse event reporting. The criteria for judging the feasibility of a future RCT will be an eligibility rate of greater than 50% of those screened (lower bound of a 95% confidence interval (CI) would be 44%), recruitment rate greater than 25% of those eligible (lower bound of a 95% CI would be 18%), retention rate at 3-month follow-up greater than 75% (lower bound of a 95% CI would be 63%).</p><p>Phase II studies are primarily intended to test the feasibility and acceptability of the various trial methods prior to a larger definitive phase III randomised controlled trial. However, they also provide an opportunity to compare and contrast different methods such as patient-completed questionnaires with objective measures of physical function; collecting health resource data from routinely collected information with patients&#x02019; self-report; different process and outcome measures for self-efficacy, functional ability and quality of life; and different objective measures of physical function.</p><p>We have also described how we envisage our complex rehabilitation intervention works in a logic model whose starting point was the programme theories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], through to short-term and long-term goals, and finally, how these influence an individual&#x02019;s impairments, activity and participation according to World Health Organisation&#x02019;s ICF model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Some of the process outcomes to be measured can be used to start to explore this model such as the three measures of self-efficacy and participants&#x02019; engagement with the personal goal setting set out in the workbook and goal-setting diary. Rehabilitation therapy self-efficacy has been shown to be associated with functional recovery in a small US cohort study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and also from a systematic review in the related field of joint replacement surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The logic model will also be used to inform the framework developed for qualitative data analysis. This will add to its evaluation and also potentially provide valuable data on how to refine the model and the intervention for a future definitive RCT.</p><sec id="Sec62"><title>Trial sponsor</title><p>Bangor University: sponsor&#x02019;s reference 11/33/03.</p><p>Contact: Professor Bob Woods, Schools of Healthcare and Medical Sciences, Ardudwy, Normal Site, Holyhead Road, Bangor, LL57 2AS.

NHW is the chief investigator. CH is the study Research Fellow and Manager and made a significant contribution to drafting the main study protocol on which this paper is based. RhTE designed the economic evaluation, which is being carried out by JMC who also designed the discrete choice experiment. ZH has designed the statistical analysis plan. NUD and JR are the main researchers running the study in the three acute hospitals, supervised and assisted by CH. NUD, NHW and JMC conducted the realist review and developed the programme theories which informed the intervention design. VM has provided health psychology expertise particularly in the design of the intervention and psychological outcome measurement. JR developed and designed the intervention workbook and goal-setting diary, with advice from CH, VM, NHW, PL, CS, GA, SA, AL, BW, NUD and BCUHB physiotherapy and occupational therapy colleagues. JR and CH developed the logic model, with comments from other members of the team. KM and DH have designed the method for using routinely collected data for the triangulation sub-study. GA has provided clinical orthopaedic expertise. SA has provided orthogeriatric expertise. BW has provided clinical psychological expertise particularly advising about participants with cognitive impairment. CS has provided physiotherapy and rehabilitation expertise. PL has provided occupational therapy and rehabilitation expertise. NHW drafted the manuscript integrating written comments from CH, JR, NUD, JMC, RhTE, VM, AL, CS, PL and CW. All authors read and commented on drafts and approved the final manuscript.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This project was funded by the National Institute of Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme (project number 11/33/03).</p><sec id="FPar5"><title>Department of health disclaimer</title><p>The views and opinions expressed therein are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect those of the HTA programme, NIHR, NHS or the Department of Health.</p><p>This study is being supported by NISCHR-CRC who provides research support, identifies and recruits eligible participants, collects outcome measurements and confidentially search patient records for the anonymised cohort study as well as contribute to study management.
