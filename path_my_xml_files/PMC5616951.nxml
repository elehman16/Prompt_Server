<bold>Abstract</bold>
</p><p>
<bold>Importance</bold>: Excoriation (skin-picking) disorder (SPD) is a disabling, under-recognized condition in which individuals repeatedly pick at their skin, leading to noticeable tissue damage. To date there has been no clearly effective pharmacological or psychological treatment for SPD.</p><p>
<bold>Objective</bold>: To determine whether N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), an amino acid that appears to restore extracellular glutamate concentration in the nucleus accumbens, will be more effective than placebo in reducing compulsive picking behavior.</p><p>
<bold>Setting:</bold> Ambulatory care center.</p><p>
<bold>Participants</bold>: Sixty-six adults with SPD (59 [89.4%] women; mean age = 34.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;11.0 years).</p><p>Intervention: N-acetylcysteine (dosing range, 1200&#x02013;3000&#x02009;mg/d) or placebo was administered for 12 weeks.</p><p>
<bold>Main Outcome Measures</bold>: Participants were assessed using measures of skin picking severity and selected cognitive tasks. Outcomes were examined using a linear mixed-effects model.</p><p>
<bold>Results</bold>: Compared to placebo, NAC treatment was associated with significant improvements in Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale total score, Clinical Global Impression Severity, and Extra-Dimensional Set shifting performance. These effects were significant both in terms of treatment x time interactions and post hoc tests at one or more individual time points. At study endpoint, 47.1% of participants were &#x0201c;much or very much improved&#x0201d; on NAC compared to 19.2% on placebo (p=.031). There were no significant differences between active and placebo arms in terms of psychosocial functioning.</p><p>
<bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study found that NAC treatment resulted in demonstrated statistically significant reductions in skin picking symptoms along with improvement in set-shifting performance, and was also well tolerated. The glutamate system may prove a beneficial target in treating this and other compulsive behaviors.</p></body></article>
