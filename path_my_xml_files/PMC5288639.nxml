Safety, health and well-being of the person with dementia and others and desire for autonomy are often key issues. Decisions are often made contrary to the person with dementia&#x02019;s current or previous known wishes and evoke feelings of failure or guilt.<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Decisional conflict describes uncertainty about which course of action to take when the choice among competing actions involves risk, loss, regret or challenges to personal life values.<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Carers in many healthcare decision-making scenarios report decisional conflict, which is distressing and can lead to decisions being avoided.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Decision aids have improved knowledge, reduced decisional conflict and encouraged individuals to become more involved in making a range of health decisions.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref></p><p>We developed and tested the first decision aid (the DECIDE manual) designed to reduce decisional conflict in dementia family carers deciding about place of care, in line with the Medical Research Council (MRC) developing complex interventions guidance, 2008,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> through systematic review and qualitative interviews with people with dementia, their carers and healthcare professionals,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> and in this study, we tested its acceptability and feasibility.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s1"><title>Method</title><p>This study was approved by the North East &#x02013; Newcastle &#x00026; North Tyneside 2 National Research Ethics Service Committee (January 2015; REC Reference: 15/NE/0015). We recruited adult, current, unpaid, main family carers for people with moderate or severe dementia (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) &#x0003c;20) not currently living in residential care and carers of people with any severity of dementia where the carer was actively considering care home placement, from four London NHS memory clinics between May 2015 and January 2016. Carers were required to have English language skills sufficient to participate in interviews. Carers were only included if they had capacity to give informed consent. After giving written informed consent, carers were individually randomised by computer to intervention or treatment as usual.</p><p>The DECIDE manual (available from the authors on request) is a guided decision aid that participants read and complete with the support of a &#x02018;decision coach&#x02019; (K.L. in this study). This was completed immediately after baseline assessments, taking approximately 45 min. Participants keep the completed version. None of the memory clinics used specific, structured resources for discussing place of care decisions with carers of people with dementia; therefore, control participants were given the Alzheimer&#x02019;s Society factsheet &#x02018;Selecting a care home&#x02019; and advised to speak with their clinicians if they would like to discuss any issues raised further.</p><p>We collected sociodemographic details at baseline. All participants completed face-to-face assessments at baseline and 10 weeks later in a location convenient to them (own home or university buildings). Our main outcomes were acceptability and usefulness of the manual (rated on Likert scales) and the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS).<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Carers also completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> We performed an intention-to-treat analysis using last observation carried forward in place of missing data to test our hypotheses that the DECIDE manual would be acceptable and useful and that family carers who received the DECIDE manual intervention would report lower total decisional conflict scores. Those randomised to the intervention group also participated in an audio-recorded, semi-structured qualitative interview about their experiences of using the DECIDE manual at the 10-week follow-up visit. K.L. informally identified main themes from the interview responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Overall, 41 of 48 (85%) carers referred to the study completed baseline measures and were randomised. One control group carer was uncontactable after completing the baseline assessment; the other 40 (98%) participants completed the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Flow diagram of participant recruitment.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="bjporcpsych003509-g001"/></fig><p>Demographics of all participants are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, with our sample consisting predominantly of White British carers. All carers allocated to the intervention group rated the DECIDE manual as 4 (<italic>n</italic>=8) or 5 (<italic>n</italic>=12) on the 5-point Likert scale of relevance (mean 4.60, s.d.=0.503) indicating that they found it very relevant. On the 10-point Likert scale of manual usefulness, 1 carer rated the manual as 7, 6 carers rated it as 8, 1 rated it as 9 and 12 rated it as 10 (mean=9.20, s.d.=1.06), indicating that they found the manual useful or very useful. There was no significant difference in the mean DCS score between intervention and control groups at baseline (mean difference &#x02212;0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) &#x02212;9.61 to 7.83, <italic>t</italic>(39)=0.21, <italic>P</italic>=0.838). At 10-week follow-up, the intervention group had a significantly lower mean DCS score compared with control participants (24.72 compared with 36.68; mean difference &#x02212;11.96, 95% CI &#x02212;20.10 to &#x02212;3.83, <italic>t</italic>(39)=&#x02212;2.97, <italic>P</italic>=0.005); this remained significant after controlling for baseline scores (ANCOVA <italic>F</italic>(1,38)=12.38, <italic>P</italic>=0.001). At follow-up, there was no significance between group difference in anxiety (mean difference &#x02212;0.024, 95% CI &#x02212;2.94 to 2.89, <italic>P</italic>=0.987) or depression scores (mean difference 0.421, 95% CI &#x02212;2.23 to 3.10, <italic>P</italic>=0.750). In qualitative interviews, carers reported that the DECIDE manual did not remove all barriers to decision-making. Disagreements between the person with dementia and other family members trying to share decision-making were often unresolved, despite carers who took part in the trial being clearer about their own decision. There was still some confusion and lack of clarity for a number of carers regarding which healthcare professional or service they should contact about this decision.</p><table-wrap id="t1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Participant characteristics</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="3" valign="bottom" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="3" valign="bottom" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intervention arm</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control arm</th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<italic>n</italic>=20)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<italic>n</italic>=21)</th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>n</italic> (%)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>n</italic> (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody valign="bottom"><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (25)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 (48)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Female</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15 (75)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11 (52)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="4" valign="top" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">40&#x02013;54</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (25)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7 (33.3)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">55&#x02013;64</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7 (35)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7 (33.3)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">65&#x02013;74</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (25)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (19)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">75&#x02013;84</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (15)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (14.3)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" valign="top" colspan="1">Relationship to person with dementia</td><td align="left" rowspan="2" valign="top" colspan="1">Spouse or partner Child</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 (50)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7 (33)</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 (50)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14 (67)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" valign="top" colspan="1">Carer and person with dementia currently live together?</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11 (55)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 (48)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9 (45)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11 (52)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="6" valign="top" colspan="1">Ethnicity</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">White British</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16 (80)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13 (62)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Other White</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (15)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (14)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Asian</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (5)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (9)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">African-English</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 (0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (5)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Black Caribbean</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 (0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (5)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Other: Hispanic mixed</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 (0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (5)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Carers of people with dementia who were making decisions about where their relative should live in the future were willing to take part in the study; those that received the DECIDE intervention found it useful and relevant and reported less decisional conflict 10 weeks after receiving it, compared with the control group.

Dementia significantly increases the length of hospital admissions, often because of issues with the discharge process,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> and it would be interesting to establish if the DECIDE manual reduced time in hospital in people with dementia; a pragmatic, larger and blinded trial is now required to evaluate real-world effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s4"><title>Funding</title><p>This study was funded jointly by the University College London (UCL) Division of Psychiatry and the UCL IMPACT studentship award (October 2013).
