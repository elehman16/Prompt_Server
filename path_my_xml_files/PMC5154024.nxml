They are common and occur mostly in older adults and those taking medications that compromise skin integrity. Pretibial skin tears can develop into leg ulcers, which require lengthy, expensive treatment to heal. Traumatic injuries are the second most common type of wounds after pressure ulcers in care homes and are the commonest reason for older adults to require the attention of a community nurse. Common causes of skin tear injuries are bumping into furniture and other obstacles, using mobility aids, transfer to/from wheelchairs, getting in and out of bed and falls. No effective preventative measures currently exist but knee-length, protective socks are now available that contain impact-resistant Kevlar fibres (of the type used in stab-proof vests) and cushioning layers underneath.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">In this pilot parallel group, randomised controlled trial, 90 people at risk of skin-tear injury will be randomised with equal allocation to receive the intervention or usual care. They will be recruited from care homes and from the community via general practices and a research volunteer database. Pilot outcomes include recruitment, eligibility, attrition, ascertainment of injuries and completion of outcome measures. Acceptability of the intervention and of study participation will be explored using semi-structured interviews. The proposed primary outcome for the future definitive trial is skin tear-free days. Secondary outcomes are skin tear severity, health status, specific skin-tears quality of life, capability and fear of falling, measured at baseline and the end of the study and in the event of a skin tear.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The results of this study will be used to inform the development and design of a future randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a unique and innovative approach to skin tear prevention.</p><p id="Par4">Approval was granted by the NRES - Cornwall and Plymouth Research Ethics Committee (13/SW/013).

They often occur as a result of rubbing, an abrasion or a glancing blow to an arm or leg (i.e. from a fall or being struck or poked obliquely). The most commonly cited definition of skin tear is that of Payne and Martin: &#x0201c;A skin tear is a traumatic injury occurring principally on the extremities of older adults as a result of shearing or friction forces which separate the epidermis from the dermis (partial thickness wound) or which separate both the epidermis and the dermis from underlying structures (full-thickness wound)&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. These are common injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Some prevalence data comes from America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and more recently from Japan where point prevalence was 3.9% amongst 410 patients in long-term care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and Australia where two elderly care rehabilitation units reported 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A non-systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] reported skin tear incidence between 2.23% and 41.5% and prevalence between 6.6% and 23.5% in US care homes. In Pennsylvania, skin tear reporting became mandatory for healthcare facilities in 2004 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], where 88.2% of the 2,807 skin tears were in patients aged over 65&#x000a0;years. Fourteen percent of an American 120-bed nursing home population sustained a skin tear per month with an average of 2.67 tears per resident [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A recent wound point prevalence audit undertaken in North Devon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] in 16 care homes revealed 195 wounds amongst 115 of 458 residents (25%). Traumatic injuries were the second most common wound type (37, 19%) after pressure ulcers (87, 45%).</p><p id="Par7">Several changes occur in the skin that increase its susceptibility to traumatic injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. These changes are due to intrinsic ageing and cumulative extrinsic factors such as photoageing and polypharmacy. They include vascular atrophy and deterioration of the dermis as collagen and elastin fibres become more sparse and disordered, holding the skin layers together less tightly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Older patients may have also taken oral steroids that compromise skin integrity and tensile strength and cause wounds to heal more slowly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. They may also be less aware that an injury has occurred due to decreased pain perception and tactile sensitivity, including diabetic neuropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Fragile skin is most common in people aged over 75&#x000a0;years. There were 10 million people in this age group in the UK in 2012, estimated to increase to 17 million in 2032 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Skin tears are unpleasant and provoke anxiety. They can take a long time to heal and are prone to infections. Whilst arm injuries are more common, leg injuries may develop into leg ulcers, which may require lengthy, expensive treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Typical causes of injury leading to skin tears include wheelchair use, bumping into obstacles, transfers and falls. There are best practice guidelines for treatment and preventing infections and ulcers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Prevention includes staff education, regular assessment, ensuring clothing does not rub, removing obstacles and moisturising the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">The novel, knee-length protective socks have a leg section woven from Kevlar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and elasticated nylon using the &#x0201c;terry sandwich&#x0201d; method. This gives a flat, slightly ribbed and stretchy, outer woven base which provides a tough, cut and abrasion-resistant exterior. There is a mesh of loops on the inside to provide a cushioning and impact resistant inner layer. The stretchiness is sufficient to fit a range of leg diameters within each size without applying excess pressure, and the socks are held up with a light elastane soft top band. The foot of the socks is manufactured from cotton as laceration protection is not usually required for the feet. Compression hosiery could be worn underneath if required as the socks are not designed to offer any compression themselves. Patients requiring such hosiery are excluded from this study, however, as this may confound any protective effects.</p><p id="Par9">Apart from small-scale, uncontrolled testing during development, there has been no trial of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this unique and innovative approach to skin tear prevention. This study will test the feasibility of running such a trial by addressing areas of uncertainty within the study protocol.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Method/design</title><p id="Par10">The study is an open, parallel group, randomised controlled study in which participants are randomised to one of two groups; the intervention group will wear the protective socks on a daily basis for a period of 16&#x000a0;weeks whilst the participants in the control group will wear their usual clothing.

The research nurse will be responsible for adjudging the residents&#x02019; capacity to provide informed consent, and this will be achieved through discussion with the resident to determine whether or not the study information has been retained and understood. The research nurse will consider the guidance in the Mental Capacity Act 2005 Code of Practice when assessing mental capacity. Those who do wish to take part will be asked to give their formal consent by signing the consent form. The written informed consent process will be undertaken by the research nurse who will be trained in Good Clinical Practice and the informed consent process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Recruitment of patients from the community</title><p id="Par40">Study entry criteria remain the same for this group of participants except that they do not need to be resident in a care home.

Practices that decide to participate will be contacted by the research nurse to discuss the requirements of the study and the search criteria. GP staff will search for patients aged 65&#x000a0;years or older who have used oral steroids for more than a month in the prior 12&#x000a0;month period. Lists generated from the search will be screened for suitability by a doctor at each participating practice and unsuitable patients excluded, e.g. those with terminal illness, mental illness etc. A member of the practice staff will send suitable patients an invitation letter on GP headed paper, including a study reply form and reply-paid envelope. Patients are asked to return the reply form to the research team if interested in receiving more information about the study. Patients that respond to say that they are interested in receiving more information will be contacted by a member of the research team and an appointment made for the research nurses to meet with the patient. The GP may send one follow-up letter to all the patients originally invited with a sentence advising that the letter should be ignored if they have already responded. Patients who return the reply form to the research team will then undergo the recruitment process described below.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Participant identification via the NIHR Exeter Clinical Research Facility</title><p id="Par42">Potential participants may also be identified via the &#x0201c;Exeter 10000&#x0201d; research volunteer bank managed by the NIHR Exeter Clinical Research Facility (Exeter CRF). The volunteer bank database will be searched by authorised members of the Facility for volunteers aged 65&#x000a0;years and older who have used oral steroids for more than a month in the prior 12-month period. A member of the facility staff will send suitable volunteers an invitation letter on Exeter CRF headed paper, including a study reply form and reply-paid envelope. Volunteers will be asked to return the letter (including the reply form) to the Exeter 10000 team who will forward their name to the research team if interested in receiving more information about the study. Volunteers who return the reply form will then undergo the recruitment process described below.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Community recruitment process</title><p id="Par43">On receipt of a completed reply form, a research nurse will telephone the patient or volunteer using the contact details provided on the reply form, once the person has had at least 24&#x000a0;h to read the study information. The research nurse will ascertain potential eligibility by explaining the full study entry criteria to the person. If the research nurse is satisfied that the person is potentially eligible, and willing to take part, the research nurse will arrange a visit at which eligibility will be confirmed and informed consent obtained. Visits may be performed at persons&#x02019; homes or at a local community hospital or GP surgery if mutually convenient.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Informed consent, randomisation and baseline assessment of community participants</title><p id="Par44">At this initial visit, the research nurse will explain the study and demonstrate a pair of the protective socks.

Materials used in the manufacture of the socks are in conformity with all relevant and required standards including the ISO 10993 series evaluating biocompatibility of a medical device prior to a clinical study.</p><p id="Par47">The research nurse will carry a stock of protective socks and, before leaving the care home, the research nurse will visit those randomised to wear protective socks to provide socks of the correct size. The socks are available in a choice of grey or beige colour. The choice of colour will be recorded by the research nurse. Three pairs of socks will be provided to the care home for each participant in the intervention group. The participants will be able to keep these socks at the end of their participation in the study.</p><p id="Par48">The participants in the intervention group will be asked to wear the protective socks during their waking hours every day for a period of 16&#x000a0;weeks, starting from the morning following the day they sign consent, which will be designated as &#x0201c;Day 1.&#x0201d; Care home staff will be asked to encourage participants to wear the socks and to assist them to put the socks on, if necessary. However, it will be emphasised that if participants become unwilling to wear the socks or want to take them off, they will be free to make that choice. The participants should continue to wear their normal footwear during participation in the study.</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>Participant diary</title><p id="Par49">The participants in the intervention group will be given the first of 16 weekly diaries at this visit and will be asked by the research nurse to complete the diary on a daily basis. The participants will be asked to use the diary to record the extent to which they wear the socks each day and the reasons for removing them (if applicable), plus any negative or positive comments about wearing the socks. A new weekly diary will be provided to the participant each week.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Control group</title><p id="Par50">The participants in the control group will be managed as usual.

The research nurse will visit the resident or patient as soon as practicable (within 1 to 2 working days) of being contacted in order to collect the following:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par53">Date and approximate time of injury.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par54">Brief description of injury cause.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par55">Type of lower leg clothing and footwear worn at the time of injury (including whether protective socks were in place for participants in the intervention group).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par56">Size of injury (length, width and total area using a grid tracing method).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par57">Category of injury using the Payne-Martin and STAR classifications (as described in <xref rid="Sec41" ref-type="sec">Appendix</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par58">A photograph of the injury.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par59">Information relating to the initial management of the injury (dressing type, referral to external healthcare professional such as GP, district nurse and hospital emergency department).</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par60">The research nurse will inspect the wound for signs of infection and will also check that the injury has been noted in the care home records (in the case of care home participants). Injured participants will complete outcome measure questionnaires 7&#x000a0;days post-injury.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Primary outcome</title><p id="Par61">A useful way to express the primary outcome measure is the number of skin tear-free days. Each participant will enter the study with no unhealed skin tear injuries and will remain in the study (unless withdrawn prematurely) for 112&#x000a0;days (i.e. 16 full weeks). Therefore, each participant has the potential to experience 112 skin tear-free days. In the event of a skin tear injury, the number of days from the date of injury until the date it is healed will be subtracted from 112 to give the number of skin tear-free days. A healed injury is defined as one which has an absence of scab and full epithelial covering that does not require continuance of dressing for absorption of exudate (sometimes a dressing may be left on a healed but delicate wound for a few days after healing). The date of healing will be identified by the visiting research nurse via wound inspection during regular, approximately weekly, visits and in collaboration with care home staff as necessary. Participants who experience a skin tear injury in week 16, or who have an injury discovered at week 16, will continue to provide follow-up information beyond that date and skin tear-free days will be expressed as a proportion of the total follow-up time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><sec id="Sec24"><title>Skin tear assessments</title><p id="Par62">There is no universally accepted classification system for the assessment of skin tears.

Standard care will not be affected by a participant&#x02019;s decision to withdraw from the study. Data collected prior to withdrawal will be included in the study analysis unless a participant specifically requests that their data are removed from the database. If a participant is adjudged to have lost mental capacity during the 16-week study period, that participant will be withdrawn from the study. Data already collected with consent will be retained and used in the study. No further data will be collected or any other study procedures carried out on or in relation to the participant.

Missing data will be investigated and the proportion missing will be recorded but are expected to be minimal. Multiple imputation methods or any specific imputation methods recommended by the authors of the questionnaire will be used to obtain realistic estimates of scores for future planning of questionnaire usefulness. All the questionnaires concerning acceptability of the socks will be scored and summarised using appropriate measures of central tendency and dispersion. Data on lacerations will also be summarised in a similar way. Agreement on wound grading between research nurses and a blinded tissue viability expert (AK) will be assessed from anonymised photographs using weighted kappa. Numbers of eligible residents, recruitment, attrition and loss to follow-up (as per the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) diagram) will be reported as proportions, confidence intervals will be reported wherever appropriate. The main analysis will describe skin tear-free days and the incidence and severity of skin lacerations in each group.</p><p id="Par99">The pilot study will determine the feasibility of how the outcomes can be measured. These will be used to inform the sample size of the full-scale randomised controlled trial. In that trial, we intend to compare the incidence of skin damage between the two groups on an intention-to-treat basis and the size of any wounds by objective assessors (research nurses). The clustering effects of homes will be an issue in the analysis of a future definitive randomised controlled trial, and sample size inflation will need to be considered for a mixed effects model with &#x0201c;homes&#x0201d; as a random effect.</p><sec id="Sec35"><title>Economic evaluation</title><p id="Par100">The economic evaluation in the future definitive trial will estimate the additional NHS cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained by the use of these protective socks. QALY estimation will be based on the EuroQol descriptive system (EQ-5D-5L) collected at baseline and at 16&#x000a0;weeks for all participants, and at 7&#x000a0;days after a participant incurs a skin tear injury to the leg. In the pilot study, a note will be made of how many of the participants have difficulties understanding or completing EQ-5D-5L to assess whether there is a need to include proxy assessment in the design of the main trial.</p><p id="Par101">The study will collect data on the resources used by the care homes, GPs or healthcare professionals and the NHS in the management of skin tears. The primary source of these data will be the participants&#x02019; medical records of their normal procedures, visits from district or tissue viability nurses, visits to and from GP&#x02019;s and any care needs arising from adverse events. The pilot study will assess whether care home records and or participants&#x02019; medical notes are adequate to describe resource use in a costable format.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Qualitative interviews and focus groups</title><p id="Par102">Semi-structured qualitative interviews with ten participants from each arm of the study will be conducted at the end of the follow-up period by an independent researcher. These will include a range of participants with varying degrees of mobility across the areas. Experiences of using the protective socks, their acceptability and/or taking part in the study will be captured. The participants will be selected using purposive sampling informed by research nurse data on their clinical progress with regard to skin tears, perceived protection from knocks and falls, withdrawals, adverse events and any problems with the skin-tear and/or questionnaire data collection process. Interviews will be digitally recorded and transcribed with the main themes identified using content analysis.</p><p id="Par103">Two focus groups will be held to explore the usefulness of the protective socks. These will include professionals from the Tissue Viability Service and care home staff with experience of participants assigned to the intervention arm of the study. Holding two focus groups provides easy access for staff of care homes across the large geographical area of the pilot trial.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Quality control</title><p id="Par104">The research nurse will check completed case report forms for missing data or obvious errors before the forms are sent to the trials unit. Data will be monitored centrally for quality and completeness, and every effort will be made to recover data from incomplete forms where possible. The data manager at the trials unit will oversee data tracking and data entry and initiate processes to resolve data queries where necessary, and the trial manager will devise a monitoring plan specific to the study which will include both central monitoring strategies and study site visits if appropriate.</p><p id="Par105">Participating care homes will be required to permit the trial manager or deputy or representative of the sponsor to undertake study-related monitoring to ensure compliance with the approved study protocol and applicable standard operating procedures, providing direct access to source data and documents as requested. All study procedures will be conducted in compliance with the protocol and according to the principles of the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP). Procedures specifically conducted by the clinical trials unit (e.g. randomisation, data management, study management and study monitoring) will be conducted in compliance with the trials unit&#x02019;s standard operating procedures.</p><p id="Par106">A trial management team meets regularly to discuss the progress of the trial and address any issues that arise.

They also represent a considerable cost to the NHS. Existing measures to prevent skin tears have limited effectiveness in this susceptible population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This pilot trial and any future definitive trial arising from it will focus on this important area of healthcare. This pilot will address the uncertainties in planning a future definitive randomised controlled trial.</p><p id="Par109">The areas of uncertainty to be addressed are typical in a study of this nature, the feasibility of recruitment (of care homes, general practices and of individual participants), the suitability of outcome measure assessments and their timing and the distribution of variables (and therefore the number of participants needed in a full definitive trial of effectiveness). In particular, it will focus on the acceptability of the socks. Preliminary work and early patient and public involvement indicated that they might not be aesthetically pleasing to participants because of their current limited colour range (charcoal grey or tan) and perceived thickness. Doubts have also been raised about comfort and fitting as there are currently only four sizes available (small, medium, medium-wide and large). Other sizes and colours could be manufactured in the future. We also don&#x02019;t know whether the socks can be worn and tolerated during the different seasons of the year. We hope to tease these issues out in the qualitative interviews and the daily diaries.</p><p id="Par110">One possible weakness of the pilot study design is the potential for contamination because the socks are commercially available on the Internet. Participants and/or their relatives or carers will know of the existence of Dermatuff socks, having read about them in the study Participant Information Sheet. It would not be difficult to obtain some socks for themselves if they have originally been assigned to the control group and decide that they need some. In primary care recruitment, it is also possible that GPs may recommend Dermatuff socks to their patients in the control group, hence contaminating the sample. Any contamination that occurs in this pilot will be recorded, and the information will be used in the planning of a future trial. Cluster randomisation would not prevent this direct contamination, but it might minimise the &#x0201c;indirect contamination&#x0201d; caused by control group participants seeing intervention group participants wearing the socks, and altering their own behaviour to better protect their legs &#x02014; by perhaps being more careful how they move around or taking other protective measures &#x02014; such as wearing their own leg-wear more often.</p><p id="Par111">A particular strength of this trial is that it is taking place partly in care homes, which represent an under-researched population of older people. This is thought to be a difficult area for researchers to tackle because of perceived problems with access to residents and the prevalence of dementia in this population, which limits the number eligible to take part in research. Sadly, older people with dementia are at even greater risk of skin tears than those without it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, care home representatives involved in the planning of this trial have informed us that people with dementia are much more at risk of receiving skin tears. The Mental Capacity Act 2005 states that for people lacking capacity to consent, any research that they may be permitted to take part in must be connected with an impairing condition affecting such a person or its treatment. &#x0201c;Impairing condition&#x0201d; means a condition which is (or may be) attributable to, or which causes or contributes to (or may cause or contribute to), the impairment of, or disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain. It could be argued that increased skin tear prevalence amongst people with dementia is attributable to the condition, and that any efforts to reduce their incidence should be pursued. If this were the case, given the high prevalence of dementia in care homes, a future trial might be conducted entirely within the care home environment with appropriate consultation with carers, as the Mental Capacity Act 2005 requires.</p><p id="Par112">Dermatuff socks offer hope of some protection from skin tears when very few other measures have worked, and this pilot will go some way to indicating whether it is worth carrying out a full scale definitive trial in the future to determine their effectiveness and cost effectiveness.</p></sec><sec id="Sec40"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par113">The STOPCUTS trial has been designed as a pilot, parallel group randomised controlled trial of effectiveness.
