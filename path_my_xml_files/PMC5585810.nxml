INTRODUCTION</title><p>Laryngoscopy and intubation is an integral part of general anesthesia (GA) for cardiac surgeries. Direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation are detrimental stimuli which can produce negative responses in the cardiovascular, respiratory and other physiological systems (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and left ventricular dysfunction undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery are one of the most high-risk groups among patients undergoing cardiac surgery (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Hypertension, tachycardia and arrhythmia caused by endotracheal intubation can be deleterious in patients with low cardiovascular reserve. These hemodynamic changes may alter the balance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand and as a result, the incidence of ischemia in patients with CAD can be precipitated (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Induction methods of anesthesia for cardiovascular surgeries are usually based on considerations such as hemodynamic stability, effects on myocardial oxygen supply and demand and also minimizing the stress response to intubation. Thus, in order to induction of anesthesia and preparation of patient for laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation, anesthetic drugs are administrated in higher dosage than doses for maintaining anesthesia during surgery (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). That is why researchers are always inspired the production of drugs and methods to minimize hemodynamic changes occur during induction of anesthesia and laryngoscopy in patients (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>Propofol and etomidate are known anesthetic agents which are normally used for induction of anesthesia in cardiac surgeries, with different clinical features (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Etomidate, which is a hypnotic drug with unique properties, is the most commonly used anesthetic induction agent with minimal side effects on cardiovascular and respiratory functions (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). However, it has been shown that etomidate administration can inhibit adrenal gland function by blocking 11&#x003b2;-hydroxylase and 17&#x003b1;-hydroxylase enzymes. There is a relation between etomidate administration and adrenal insufficiency, which caused by reversible inhibition of cortisol synthesis (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Reduced cortisol and aldosterone level following to adrenal suppression almost started in less than 30 minutes after a single dose of etomidate and can last up to 72 hours (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). On the other hand, it has been shown that relative adrenal insufficiency in septic patients may induce morbidity and mortality (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Etomidate disadvantages include nausea and vomiting, pain on injection, myoclonic movement and hiccups (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>Propofol is an intravenous hypnotic agent, which commonly used for anesthesia induction due to rapid onset, short duration of action, anti-nausea and vomiting effect and feeling comfortable after surgery (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The most prominent effect of propofol is a decrease in arterial blood pressure during induction of anesthesia and is associated with a decrease in cardiac output, stroke volume, and systemic vascular resistance (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Furthermore, propofol induces severe vasodilation while the effects of myocardial depression are not exactly clear. Vasodilation occurs in both venous and arterial circulation, which leads to reduced preload and afterload (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). After induction dose of propofol, heart rate (HR) does not change significantly because propofol can inhibit baroreflex response, so tachycardia response to hypotension is reducing. Drop in blood pressure after administration of propofol can be due to the effects of vasodilator and reduced sympathetic activity (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>Diazepam is one of the drugs that have been used since half a century ago. It induces anesthesia with minimal cardiovascular effects like etomidate. Increase coronary blood flow and myocardial function, reduce myocardial oxygen consumption and blood pressure stability have been observed in cardiovascular patients following administration of diazepam (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>Considering the importance and influence of hemodynamic changes on the outcome of surgery and related mortalities and conflicting results of previous studies related to propofol and diazepam hemodynamic responses (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), this study was conducted to compare the hemodynamic responses of three sedatives for anesthetic induction with minimal hemodynamic changes in CABG surgery patients with low ejection fraction (EF).</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>2. METHODS</title><p>A double-blind randomized, clinical study was performed on 150 patients with CAD and left ventricular dysfunction (EF&#x02264;35%) scheduled for elective CABG surgery with Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The study was done from February 2014 to April 2015 in the cardiac surgery unit and the open heart intensive care unit (ICU) of a teaching hospital affiliated with Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran. Preliminary selection of patients was based on non-randomly and due to be eligible to enter the study units. Approval from the Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences ethics committee, as well as informed consents from patients was obtained.</p><p>Inclusion criteria of this clinical study included non-emergency CABG surgery, and having stable hemodynamic (systolic blood pressure &#x02265;90 mm Hg, the absence of dangerous dysrhythmias and HR between 60-100 beats in minutes). Patients with a history of chronic inflammatory diseases, endocarditis, adrenal insufficiency, sepsis, history of steroid use in the preceding six months, prolonged and difficult intubation (more than 30 seconds or more than 3 times), and combined cardiac valve surgery with CABG and Bentall surgery were excluded from this study. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria were randomly allocated to three groups A, B, and C (50 patients in each group) by the sealed envelope technique. Patient allocation was performed by a nurse who was unaware of the study groups, according to numbers generated by the computer-generated list for 150 patients.</p><p>In the operating room, Ringer lactate (5cc/kg) was infused via an intravenous line for all patients before induction of anesthesia and all patients underwent monitoring (temperature, invasive blood pressure (IBP) (left radial artery), central venous pressure (CVP), pulse oximetry, capnography and monitoring heart rhythm). Also, electrocardiogram, invasive arterial blood pressure, and pulse oximeter were applied for all patients and baseline systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and HR were measured and recorded for all of them.</p><p>All patients received midazolam (0.03 mg/kg) and fentanyl (2&#x000b5;g/kg) intravenously as premedication. One minute later, patients in group A were induced with propofol (1.5 mg/kg), Group B was induced with etomidate (0.2 mg/kg) and Group C was induced with diazepam (0.3 mg/kg). All drugs were administered at the same speed and within 60-90 seconds. Drugs already were prepared in equal volumes separately by anesthetist who was not involved in this study and all syringes were covered with masking tape to conceal any details of the product. Loss of eyelash reflex was considered as the endpoint of anesthesia induction and also bispectral index (BIS) score between 40 and 60 was considered adequate to ensure adequate anesthesia depth. Then all patients received succinylcholine 1.5mg/kg for muscle relaxation and to facilitate intubation. Tracheal intubation performed one minute after succinylcholine administration.</p><p>SBP, DBP, MAP and HR were measured and recorded immediately before laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation and one and three minutes after intubation. Laryngoscopy and anesthesia administration were done by an anesthesiologist who was blinded to the study groups. The duration of laryngoscopy and intubation were recorded for each patient.</p><p>If the blood pressure decreased to less than 20% of a patient&#x02019;s baseline, ephedrine (10 mg) was administered and and it was recorded in data collection sheet. In addition, demographic variables such as age and sex, Body Mass Index (BMI), history of drugs and disease (diabetes and hypertension) were recorded. This study registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials Database (IRCT2015082921669N2).</p><p><bold>Statistical analysis</bold></p><p>We used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to determine whether data were normally distributed. Statistical analysis of the data was performed by using the software 17 SPSS. Quantitative variables were analyzed by repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Bonferroni test. A <italic>P</italic> value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>3. RESULTS</title><p>During the study, 164 patients were initially evaluated.

DISCUSSION</title><p>The prevalence of patients with compromised left ventricular function undergoing CABG is increasing. It is believed that CABG is a safe and effective treatment for patients with severe compromised left ventricular function with CAD (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Cardiovascular stability is a crucial prerequisite for any anesthetic agent used for induction of anesthesia for patients undergoing CABG surgery, specifically for patients with poor cardiovascular reserve (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Several studies investigate the effects of a wide variety of induction agents in the patients CAD. We compared the hemodynamic responses to diazepam, propofol, and etomidate for anesthetic induction in these patients. The results of the present study showed more hemodynamic stability during anesthesia induction and intubation with using diazepam compared to propofol and etomidate.</p><p>In a study by Samuelson et al. aiming to examining the hemodynamic response to anesthesia induction by midazolam (0.2 mg/kg) or diazepam (0.5 mg/kg) in patients with ischemic heart disease. In patients who received midazolam, a significant but slight reduction was observed in systemic and pulmonary artery blood pressure, pulmonary hypertension, stroke index, and right and left ventricle stroke work index. While in patients receiving diazepam, only a significant decrease was observed in systemic blood pressure and a significant difference was seen between the two groups 5 minutes after drug administration. Following midazolam injection, HR increased but SBP and left ventricle stroke work index decreased. Both groups responded to the tracheal intubation through a temporary increase in BP, HR and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and hemodynamic parameters turned to their normal states in 2 to 5 minutes. This study suggests that, despite some differences, midazolam may be as appropriate as diazepam for rapid induction and maintaining stable hemodynamic status in patients with ischemic heart disease (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), which is in line with the results of our study. The only difference is that in our study maintaining hemodynamic parameters in diazepam group was more significant than others.</p><p>In a study by Reza et al. to compare the effect of diazepam and midazolam on patients with CAD, 45 patients who were candidate for cardiac catheterization received 0.2 mg/kg midazolam and 30 patients received 0.4mg/kg diazepam intravenously. It has been shown that the decrease in SVR, DBP and left ventricular stroke work index was more significant in the midazolam group, but both groups expressed same changes in HR, pulmonary artery pressure, SBP and DBP, cardiac output, cardiac index, stroke volume index, pulmonary artery resistance and right ventricular stroke work index. Both drugs were, ultimately, described as &#x0201c;safe&#x0201d; for use in patients with CAD (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>Findings of a study by Habibi et al. aiming to compare hemodynamic changes in patients under CABG with low EF during induction with etomidate or a combination of ketamine and thiopental, indicated no difference in MAP, DBP, SBP, and HR of patients before and immediately after (1, 2 and 3 minutes after) laryngoscopy among the two groups (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). In the present study, a reduction was observed in SBP, DBP, and MAP in all three studied groups of subjects after administration of hypnotic drugs, 1 minute before laryngoscopy as compared to before intervention. Blood pressure decreases following propofol administration may result from a reduction of SVR and cardiac output and effect of the drug on the sympathetic drive of heart; since propofol is a vasodilator drug degrading sympathetic activity (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Decreasing in blood pressure after intimidate administration, may originate from the effect of the drug on gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors which results from a lack of impact on sympathetic system and activity of baroreceptors (with minimum influence on cardiovascular activity) (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Diazepam can cause decrease MAP and SVR due to maintaining homeostatic reflexive mechanisms and these effects are resulted from suppression of sympathetic tonicity associated with GABA and nitric oxide (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>The HR of patients receiving propofol and etomidate was lower than that of those induced with diazepam and this could be the result of lack of control on the sympathetic system by diazepam as compared to other two drugs. Meanwhile, benzodiazepines maintain HR, left ventricular filling pressure, and cardiac output after anesthesia induction (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Moreover, diazepam has a nitroglycerine-like effect (preload reduction and increase of HR) and this is usually associated with filling pressure reduction and enhancement of cardiac output (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). MAP, SBP, and DBP in all studied groups increased 1 and 3 minutes after laryngoscopy and intubation and this may be considered as a consequence of pain and sympathetic stimulation resulting from laryngoscopy. So thatthe diazepam and propofol groups expressed the highest and the lowest amount of increase, respectively. In all groups, blood pressure decreased one minute after induction dose injection but this decrease in diazepam group was lower than others. While blood pressure in diazepam group went back to its initial value faster compared to other groups. After drug injection in diazepam group, HR increased one and three minutes after laryngoscopy and intubation, unlike other groups that initially HR dropped and then returned to initial values.</p><p>The reason for the return of BP, HR to baseline values may be due to pain and sympathetic stimulation caused by laryngoscopy and intubation. Furthermore, propofol led to the most significant increase in studied variables among 3 considered groups. In a study on examining the effect of etomidate and propofol on hemodynamic and endocrine responses in 60 candidate patients of CABG, Kaushal et al. showed that etomidate creates the better hemodynamic stability than propofol (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). This is consistent with results of our study in two groups (receiving propofol and etomidate).</p><p>In another clinical trial, evaluating hemodynamic effects of propofol and etomidate during rapid sequence tracheal intubation in non-surgery patients, it has been shown that changes in SBP, DBP, and HR in five minutes after tracheal intubation are lesser in etomidate group than propofol one and this is consistent with results of the present research (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Findings of another study on patients undergoing elective surgeries showed that patients, who receive the propofol-etomidate combinations during anesthesia induction, had more hemodynamic stability compared to patients who received propofol-ketamine combination (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). This is while the present study proved diazepam is more successful than other drugs in maintaining hemodynamic stability.</p><p>A limitation of this study was that even though two groups were given the same premedication with midazolam (0.03 mg/kg) and fentanyl (2&#x000b5;g/kg), the dosages per kilogram body weight may be unequally distributed between groups, and thus the dosing of these premedication drugs may be a confounding variable.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>5. CONCLUSION</title><p>The present study showed that in patients undergoing CABG surgery with low EF, diazepam is more favorable in terms of hemodynamic stability compared to propofol and etomidate and this drug can be used safely for induction of anesthesia in patients with impaired ventricular function in these patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>&#x02022; Conflict of interest:</bold> All authors declare no conflict of interest; no conflict of interest exists for any of the authors associated with the manuscript.
