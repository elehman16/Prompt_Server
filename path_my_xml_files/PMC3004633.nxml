Other approaches using gabapentin, namely when associated with peripheral analgesic block of TN trigger points with the local anesthetic ropivacaine (ROP), resulted in decreased pain and daily drug intake (reduced side effects). This study evaluates if the association between CBZ and the peripheral block with ROP reinforces the clinical value of CBZ. In this parallel, double-blinded study, idiopathic TN patients were randomized to receive during 4 weeks either CBZ (CBZ; n = 21) or CBZ associated with the peripheral analgesic block using ROP (CBZ + ROP; n = 24). The primary outcome measures were the following: i) pain intensity, evaluated by the numerical rating scale; ii) number of pain crises; and iii) number needed to treat. Evaluation points were at the beginning (day 1) and end (day 29) of treatment and after a follow-up of 5 months (month 6). Both protocols resulted in a decrease of pain intensity and number of pain crises, but only the association CBZ + ROP showed i) a significant stronger reduction in pain intensity at month 6 and ii) a significant decrease in the daily dose of CBZ given to patients (both at day 29 and month 6). In contrast, the daily dose in CBZ-only patients remained constant or even increased. The number needed to treat for the association CBZ + ROP over the CBZ protocol reduced from 5 at the end of the 4-week treatment to 3 after the 5-month follow-up. Data reinforce the use of CBZ as a primary tool to control pain in TN patients, as the association CBZ + ROP i) improves the clinical qualities of CBZ, ii) strongly reduces the daily dose of CBZ, and iii) reduces the potential side effects attributed to high doses of CBZ.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>trigeminal neuralgia</kwd><kwd>carbamazepine</kwd><kwd>ropivacaine</kwd><kwd>therapeutical association</kwd><kwd>pain intensity</kwd><kwd>daily dose</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuropathic pain is a form of pain caused by a lesion or disease of the peripheral or central nervous system.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-jpr-3-201">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-jpr-3-201">2</xref> It is a challenging condition to treat because of the following reasons: i) the heterogeneity of etiologies, symptoms, and underlying mechanisms; ii) poor response to conventional analgesics; and iii) the tendency for treatment being performed in a uniform fashion across the patient population.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-jpr-3-201">3</xref> Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) (annual incidence of 4&#x02013;5/100,000)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-jpr-3-201">4</xref> is a type of neuropathy characterized by periods of intense paroxystic pain, usually of short duration and triggered by innocuous stimuli, although resulting in excruciating pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-jpr-3-201">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-jpr-3-201">6</xref> A large number of cases of TN are idiopathic (primary or asymptomatic TN), usually with no detectable structural nerve lesion (includes the potential vascular compression of the fifth nerve in 15% of these patients) and a normal neurological evaluation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-jpr-3-201">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-jpr-3-201">8</xref> Like in other neuropathies, classic analgesics most frequently have no beneficial effects in controlling TN pain, even in secondary (symptomatic) TN, when it is associated with identifiable structural lesions, like a tumor or multiple sclerosis.

From the first day, the CBZ dose taken by each patient could increase gradually until 1200 mg/day if the pain intensity reached or kept an NRS score &#x02265;6, or gradually reduced if pain control was regained.

In what concerns the authors, firstly, the application of each protocol treatment to the patients was performed by a researcher who was blinded i) to the content of the peripheral injections (saline or ROP), which were prepared by another member of the Pain Unit; ii) to the NRS scores evaluation of pain intensity; and iii) to the number of daily pain crisis of each patient. Secondly, NRS scores and number of pain crisis were evaluated by a second researcher, who was blinded to the protocol assigned to each patient. Thirdly, the statistical evaluation of the data was performed by a third researcher, who was not a health service professional and was not aware of the clinical implications of protocols CBZ and CBZ + ROP. All these precautions resulted in a study blinded to the authors. In what concerns the patients, as already stated for the informed consent of the patients, they were not aware of which protocol was being applied to them, as all of them were taking i) oral CBZ and ii) an injection (saline or ROP).

Occasional cases occurred of diabetes mellitus type 2, stroke, epilepsy, depression, and cardiac or thyroid pathology. In what concerns concomitant drug therapies, the most common drugs used in addition to CBZ + ROP/CBZ were antihypertensors (18 of the 45 TN patients): three CBZ patients were taking anticoagulants, two antiarrhythmics or antihypothyroidism drugs, and one another anticonvulsivant, whereas 1 CBZ + ROP patient was taking an antidepressant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-jpr-3-201">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of CBZ + ROP and CBZ protocols in pain control</title><p>No differences were found between patients from protocol CBZ + ROP (NRS<sub>1</sub> = 9.1 &#x000b1; 1.1) and protocol CBZ (NRS<sub>1</sub> = 9.1 &#x000b1; 1.4) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.887) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-jpr-3-201">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-jpr-3-201">Table 2</xref>) in pain intensity at the beginning of the treatment (day 1).

However, CBZ often results in adverse side effects and intolerance, with these cases being solved by second-line AE or antidepressant drugs or, in case of prolonged intolerance, a surgical option. In order to improve the clinical outcome of CBZ therapy and reduce its unwanted effects, the present study evaluated the association of CBZ with the peripheral analgesic block of TN trigger points with the local anesthetic ROP. A similar approach has resulted in improved efficacy when using gabapentin in the treatment of TN.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-jpr-3-201">21</xref> The protocol associating CBZ + ROP resulted in a significant reduction in i) pain intensity, ii) the number of daily pain crises, and iii) the daily dose of CBZ intake, when compared with the traditional CBZ protocol in monotherapy.</p><sec><title>Methodological considerations</title><p>The rationale of the present study was to further increase the efficacy of first-line drug CBZ in controlling TN pain and, not less important, to reduce potentially the impact of the adverse side effects associated with the therapeutic doses usually used.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-jpr-3-201">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-jpr-3-201">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-jpr-3-201">35</xref> In order to eliminate the possibility that any beneficial effect could depend on the physical action of local administration of the analgesic ROP solution by clearing adhesions or inflammatory molecules from the vicinity of the nerve,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-jpr-3-201">25</xref> the protocol CBZ-only was accompanied with injection of saline to TN trigger points. Thus, the improvements observed in the different outcomes analyzed resulted exclusively from the pharmacological action of CBZ + ROP and CBZ and not by the manipulation and liquid introduction at trigger points. An additional advantage of saline administration to CBZ-only patients was the possibility of performing a treatment blinded to both patients and researchers (double-blinded study for the treatment).</p><p>The frequency of ROP injections applied subcutaneously to TN patients respected the guidelines for the practice of interventional techniques.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-jpr-3-201">25</xref> A patient should receive an injection at intervals not smaller than 1 week, which was the period chosen to mediate between each ROP (or saline) administration. The follow-up evaluation of patients treated with both protocols (month 6) was performed by phone interview, as they were trained since the beginning of this study to classify their pain according to a 0&#x02013;10 scale.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Clinical impact of the CBZ + ROP association</title><p>Because a 2-point decrease in the mean NRS scale (0&#x02013;10 scale) is considered the minimum clinical relevant difference in pain intensity when comparing the effect of two treatments,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-jpr-3-201">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-jpr-3-201">31</xref> both the CBZ + ROP and CBZ protocols were clinically effective in reducing pain after a 4-week therapy. In fact, they decreased pain intensity in 6.3 and 5.3 points (respectively) after the 4-week therapy. At the end of the treatment, the pain reduction obtained by CBZ + ROP was significantly stronger than that of CBZ. However, as NRS mean was only 1 point smaller after CBZ + ROP than CBZ (2.8 versus 3.8), it is questionable whether the statistical significant improvement of CBZ + ROP protocol reaches a really clinical importance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-jpr-3-201">31</xref> After a 5-month follow-up, however, the significant reduction in pain intensity obtained by CBZ + ROP patients reached the border of a 2-point difference of clinical significance when compared with the reduction obtained by CBZ patients (NRS of 2.0 versus 3.9). Two aspects must be considered when approaching the discussion of these data. Firstly, from the end of the treatment to 5 months later, the pain intensity in CBZ + ROP patients showed a further decrease (2.8 &#x02192; 2.0), whereas no changes were observed in CBZ-treated patients (3.8 &#x02192; 3.9); secondly, the same authors claiming that a 2-point scale decrease is the minimum clinical benefit following a pain treatment for a &#x02018;much better improvement&#x02019; also considered that a 1-point reduction in the NRS pain scale was felt as &#x02018;slightly better,&#x02019;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-jpr-3-201">29</xref> which can also be considered an improvement.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-jpr-3-201">31</xref> In fact, a 1-point reduction in pain intensity represented the minimal clinically important difference, as defended by the same authors. These data indicate that both at the end of the 4-week treatment (day 29) and after a follow-up 5 months later (month 6), the CBZ + ROP protocol reinforced the pain reduction resulting from the traditional CBZ-only protocol. This suggests that, as was previously demonstrated for the gabapentin and ROP association,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-jpr-3-201">21</xref> a potentiation or synergism between the AE and local analgesic effect occurs when CBZ and ROP are associated in the same protocol. Previous studies also indicated that combinations of CBZ + gabapentin or gabapentin + lamotrigine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-jpr-3-201">18</xref> can result in TN pain control.</p><p>When comparing CBZ + ROP protocol with the standard CBZ protocol, another indication of improvement in the clinical outcome is the NNT. The number of patients who must be treated by the CBZ + ROP protocol to generate one more success than would have resulted had all patients been given the comparison treatment (CBZ-only) was 5 after the 4-week treatment (day 29) and reduced to 3 after a 5-month follow-up (month 6). Again, this shows that data 5 months after the treatment are more robust in indicating an advantage of the combination of CBZ + ROP upon CBZ than immediately after the end of the treatment.</p><p>Another important therapeutical improvement in the combination of CBZ + ROP is the demonstration of a large decrease in the daily dose of CBZ intake, both at the end of the treatment (day 29) and, even further, after the 5-month follow-up. On the contrary, CBZ monotherapy observed a progressive increment in the daily CBZ dosage. The typical maintenance CBZ doses applied to TN patients seen in the literature range between 300&#x02013;800 mg/day,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-jpr-3-201">12</xref> 600&#x02013;800 mg/day,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-jpr-3-201">35</xref> 200&#x02013;1200 mg/day,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-jpr-3-201">7</xref> 400&#x02013;1200 mg/day,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-jpr-3-201">11</xref> or 600&#x02013;1200 mg/day.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-jpr-3-201">6</xref> In the present study, the CBZ + ROP proportioned pain control with a medium daily dose of 367 mg/day, which points clearly to the lower range of the clinical intervals referred to above; on the other hand, the CBZ monotherapy protocol resulted in a daily CBZ intake of around 800 mg/day, which is located in the middle/upper third of the typical dose range of CBZ applied to TN patients. These data show that the clinical result of TN treatment with CBZ + ROP is superior to CBZ monotherapy, because the much lower dose of CBZ needed following the CBZ + ROP protocol will decrease the potential presence/intensity of adverse side effects. The possibility of CBZ subtherapeutic treatment in the CBZ + ROP or CBZ-only protocols was excluded, as shown by the significant pain intensity decrease associated with these therapeutical approaches.</p></sec><sec><title>Potential mechanisms underlying the effect of CBZ + ROP association</title><p>CBZ is involved in i) the recruitment of endogenous descending antinociceptive mechanisms by inhibiting noradrenaline uptake (a mechanism in part related to the action of some antidepressants) and ii) in the suppression of spontaneous neuronal activity, stabilization of hyperexcited neural membranes, and/or reduction of propagation of synaptic impulses, due to CBZ modulation of voltage-gated sodium channels in a voltage- and frequency-dependent manner.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-jpr-3-201">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-jpr-3-201">36</xref> Importantly, low-dose ROP has an analgesic action based, at least partly, on common mechanisms because both CBZ and ROP act on voltage-gated sodium channels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-jpr-3-201">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-jpr-3-201">40</xref> by reducing ectopic neuronal activity without blocking nerve conduction.

This must have been achieved by i) the intense pain felt by patients arriving at the Pain Unit, which may have masked any putative CBZ side effects, and ii) the low/medium doses of CBZ that our team managed to achieve for sufficient pain control in CBZ + ROP and CBZ patients, respectively. Only one patient allocated to CBZ protocol was excluded from the study at day 1 due to an allergic reaction to CBZ.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>Some important limitations can be included in the present study. Firstly, the generalization of findings to all patients who do not tolerate drug therapy after CBZ should be made with caution because no comparisons were made with adverse effects of other drugs that can be an alternative to the main classic treatment. The exclusion criteria were extensive and 8.4% of TN patients arriving at the Pain Unit were withdrawn from the study, which indicates that the study should be confirmed in larger-scale (less homogeneous) studies. Secondly, although the effect of treatment on pain intensity and number of paroxysmal crises was still significantly different after 6 months of treatment with CBZ + ROP and CBZ, the follow-up period may not have been sufficient to determine the potentially long-term effects of the proposed treatment (unknown quiescent periods and pain-free intervals that can reach months or years). Thirdly, no plasma levels of CBZ were measured in order to correlate the oral dose given with that really present in circulation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>CBZ is established as the first-line drug choice for pain control in TN. However, when CBZ fails to reduce pain or the adverse side effects do not allow increasing CBZ dosage, second-line drugs like gabapentin may solve the problem. Recently, an improvement of this second alternative has been achieved by the association of gabapentin with the peripheral analgesic block of TN trigger points with ROP. The same approach has been the objective of the present study, in order to improve the clinical outcome of CBZ therapy. We demonstrate that the association of CBZ and peripheral administration of ROP (CBZ + ROP protocol) resulted in a clinically significant further improvement of the decrease in pain intensity already achieved by CBZ in monotherapy (CBZ protocol). This is accompanied with a clear decrease in the daily CBZ dosage needed for TN pain control, with a consequent potential reduction in the adverse side effects associated. Additionally, an NNT of 5 at the end of the treatment that reduces to 3 after a follow-up of 5 months indicates that in long-lasting treatments with CBZ, the advantages of its association with the peripheral block with ROP increase with time. However, large-scale CBZ + ROP studies are needed to evaluate the dimension of the improvement obtained by the association CBZ + ROP.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the Clinical Director of the Hospital Center of Alto Ave (Fafe Unit), the Chronic Pain Unit team of the same Hospital, and Dr. Ramalho Fontes, the Director of the Department of Neurology of Hospital S.
