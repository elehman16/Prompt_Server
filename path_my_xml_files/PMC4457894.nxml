Genome-wide analyses show that the consensus sequence of the TATA element is TATAWAWR (8 bp), whereas TATA-like elements carry one or two mismatches to this consensus. The fact that several functionally distinct TATA sequences have been identified indicates that these elements may function, at least to some extent, in a gene-specific manner. The purpose of the present study was to identify functional TATA sequences enriched in one particular core promoter and compare them with the TATA or TATA-like elements that serve as the pre-initiation complex (PIC) assembly sites on the yeast genome. For this purpose, we conducted a randomized screen of the TATA element in the <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter by using a novel reporter assay system and identified several hundreds of unique sequences that were tentatively classified into nine groups. The results indicated that the 7 bp TATA element (i.e., TATAWAD) and several sets of TATA-like sequences are preferred specifically by this promoter. Furthermore, we find that the most frequently isolated TATA-like sequence, i.e., TATTTAAA, is actually utilized as a functional core promoter element for the endogenous genes, e.g., <italic>ADE5</italic>,<italic>7</italic> and <italic>ADE6</italic>. Collectively, these results indicate that the sequence requirements for the functional TATA or TATA-like elements in one particular core promoter are not as stringent. However, the variation of these sequences differs significantly from that of the PIC assembly sites on the genome, presumably depending on promoter structures and reflecting the gene-specific function of these sequences.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by grants from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (grant number 23370077 to TK), the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (grant number 25118520 to TK), and the CREST program of the Japan Science and Technology Corporation to TK.

The core promoter region contains a variety of functionally distinct small DNA segments (termed &#x0201c;core promoter elements&#x0201d;) such as the TATA element, BRE<sup>u/d</sup>, Inr/sINR, TCT motif, DPE, MTE, bridge element, DCE, and XCPE1/2 (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]). Most of these elements are recognized by general transcription factors (GTFs), including TFIIB or TFIID [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, the effect of such variation in the core promoter elements on the transcriptional regulation of eukaryotic class II genes remains unclear.</p><p>The existence of functional compatibility between the UAS/enhancer and the core promoter in various organisms has been suggested [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In budding yeast, for instance, the UAS of <italic>RPS5</italic> can activate the <italic>ADH1</italic> or <italic>CUP1</italic> core promoter, whereas the UAS of the latter two genes cannot activate the <italic>RPS5</italic> core promoter [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, a recent genome-wide study demonstrated that the TCT motif-containing core promoter and the TATA-Inr-MTE-DPE-containing core promoter are activated by different sets of enhancers [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Caudal, a key regulator of the <italic>Hox</italic> genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, can activate the DPE-containing core promoter but cannot activate the BRE<sup>u</sup>-TATA-containing core promoter [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Similarly, Dorsal, a key regulator of the dorsal-ventral gene regulatory network in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, preferentially activates the DPE-containing core promoter over the TATA-containing core promoter [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The latter two observations might be accounted for by a recent finding that the DPE-containing core promoter is recognized not only by TBP-containing TFIID [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], but also by TRF2 (TBP-related factor 2)-containing complexes [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, recent studies show that transcription of the TCT motif-containing core promoter depends on TRF2 but not on TBP/TFIID [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129357.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, it is likely that the core transcriptional machinery recruited by a given transcriptional regulator could become fully competent only when it is recruited to the core promoter with an appropriate structure.</p><p>In budding yeast, no obvious sequence motifs in core promoter elements other than the TATA element (i.e., TATAWAWR) [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129357.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and/or the Inr element [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] have been identified [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129357.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Although TATA function appears to be highly conserved among eukaryotes, Inr function may differ between budding yeast and metazoans; for instance, it serves as a recognition site for the TAF1-TAF2-TBP sub-complex of TFIID in the latter [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], whereas it represents the preferred initiation site for pol II in the former [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129357.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129357.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Furthermore, there are no known TBP homologues in budding yeast, such as TRFs, although the UAS still shows core promoter specificity as mentioned above [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129357.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129357.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A recent genome-wide study using the ChIP-exo method demonstrated that nearly all TATA-less promoters (i.e., corresponding to approximately 90% of all class II genes in budding yeast) contain sequences with two or less mismatches to the TATA consensus (i.e., TATAWAWR) at the PIC assembly sites [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This result is consistent with our previous observation that multiple AT-rich sequences could function as a core promoter element individually in the TATA-less <italic>RPS5</italic> core promoter [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, yeast class II promoters can be divided into two subclasses: one includes promoters containing TATAWAWR and the other includes those containing similar but slightly different derivatives of TATAWAWR. These two subclasses may correspond to the SAGA- and TFIID-dominated promoters, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. These accumulating evidences suggest that budding yeast could provide a simple model system to investigate the core promoter specificity of the UAS/enhancer, since there are few types of core promoter elements (e.g., TATAWAWR and its variants) in this organism.</p><p>As reported previously (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]), transcriptional regulators could function selectively with specific TATA (or TATA-like) sequences. For instance, the <italic>HIS3</italic> core promoter contains two different types of TATA elements, namely, T<sub>C</sub> and T<sub>R</sub>, and only the latter can be activated by Gcn4p and Gal4p [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Intriguingly, three derivatives of T<sub>R</sub> can be activated by Gcn4p but not by Gal4p [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Similar functional discrimination between different TATA sequences by transcriptional regulators is observed in mammals [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129357.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], indicating that the regulatory system based on sequence-specific TATA function may be widely exploited among eukaryotes from yeast to mammals. In this regard, the <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter is particularly interesting as it contains two structurally similar but functionally distinct TATA elements: TATA&#x003b2; (A<underline>TATATA<italic>T</italic>A</underline>T) and TATA&#x003b1; (<underline>TATATA<italic>A</italic>A</underline>A) [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. These two TATA sequences differ only at one position (italicized base <italic>T</italic> vs. <italic>A</italic> as shown above) when comparing the underlined regions that match to the consensus TATAWAWR. However, how such a subtle difference is recognized properly by the core transcriptional machineries to execute two different functions remains obscure.</p><p>The original aim of the present study was to identify the sequence(s) that are functionally identical to TATA&#x003b2; or TATA&#x003b1; by a randomized screen, and delineate molecular determinant(s) between these two types of TATA elements. For this purpose, we developed a novel reporter assay system that measures the amounts of polyphosphate (polyP) accumulated in yeast cells. This method is simple and cost-effective, as it uses a spectrophotometer instead of an expensive NMR machine for the measurement [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129357.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, the original aim to isolate two functionally distinct TATA sequences was unsuccessful, since any functional differences between TATA&#x003b2; and TATA&#x003b1; could not be recapitulated at the reporter gene locus. However, we found that TATA&#x003b1; acquires Taf1p/TFIID-dependency at this locus, indicating that the recognition mode of this element by the core transcription machineries might be altered from a Taf1p-independent (e.g., SAGA) to a Taf1p-dependent (e.g., TFIID) manner. A similar screen was hitherto conducted only for the Taf1p-independent TATA element, i.e., T<sub>R</sub> of the <italic>HIS3</italic> promoter [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Therefore, we conducted a randomized screen to identify functional derivatives of the Taf1p-dependent TATA&#x003b1; element of the <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter. More than 600 independent sequences were isolated and classified tentatively into nine distinct groups. Comparison of these sequences with functional derivatives of T<sub>R</sub> [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and/or TATA or TATA-like elements identified as the PIC assembly sites in many other genes [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] indicated that functional sequences may vary significantly among genes, presumably depending on promoter structures. Furthermore, the high saturation level of our screen enabled, for the first time, the identification of a possible range of functionally competent sequences in one particular promoter. Finally, we showed that the TATTTAAA sequence isolated most frequently by the screen is used as a core promoter element for the endogenous genes. These results imply that the experimental approaches developed in this work may be effective to identify a large number of TATA or TATA-like sequences that can function specifically in a subset of genes in budding yeast, and to investigate the mechanisms underlying the gene-specific function of these sequences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Yeast strains</title><p>Standard techniques were used for yeast growth and transformation [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].

In addition, it contains several TATA or TATA-like elements, two of which, i.e. TATA&#x003b2; (TATATATA located at site #1 from -177 to -170; abbreviated as &#x003b2;/#1) and TATA&#x003b1; (TATATAAA located at site #2 from -123 to -116; abbreviated as &#x003b1;/#2), are principally responsible for transcription from multiple transcriptional start sites (TSSs) in the upstream or downstream region, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129357.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] (<xref rid="pone.0129357.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). These two TATA elements are thought to have different functions because only the upstream one is functional when the same TATA sequences are duplicated (i.e., &#x003b2;/#1-&#x003b2;/#2 or &#x003b1;/#1-&#x003b1;/#2) while both are functional when different TATA sequences are combined (i.e., &#x003b2;/#1-&#x003b1;/#2 or &#x003b1;/#1-&#x003b2;/#2) [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. To understand this functional difference, we sought to identify any other TATA or TATA-like sequence(s) that could function as TATA&#x003b2; or TATA&#x003b1; in the <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter by using a random screen based on the TB-staining method.</p><p>First, to determine whether TATA&#x003b2; or TATA&#x003b1; have different functions also at the reporter gene (<italic>VTC1</italic>) locus, the wild-type or mutated <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter (-400 bp&#x02014;+1 bp) was integrated in front of the <italic>VTC1</italic> coding region. The TSS(s) of the <italic>VTC1</italic> reporter gene were determined by primer extension analyses (<xref rid="pone.0129357.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). No differences between the function of TATA&#x003b2; and TATA&#x003b1; at the <italic>VTC1</italic> locus were detected, as the TSSs of &#x003b2;/#1-&#x003b2;/#2 (lane 14) or &#x003b1;/#1-&#x003b1;/#2 (lane 9) were the same as those of &#x003b2;/#1-&#x003b1;/#2 (lane 2 and 11). As the flanking sequences were slightly modified in the original study [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], we reconstructed the strains by exploiting the same sequences as the original ones (designated here as TATA&#x003b2;' and TATA&#x003b1;'). The results showed that the TSSs of &#x003b2;/#1-&#x003b2;'/#2 (lane 13) or &#x003b1;'/#1-&#x003b1;/#2 (lane 8) were the same as those of &#x003b2;/#1-&#x003b1;/#2 (lane 2 and 11), &#x003b1;'/#1-&#x003b2;'/#2 (lane 15), and &#x003b1;'/#1-&#x003b2;/#2 (lane 16), leading to the same conclusion that all four TATA elements (i.e., &#x003b2;, &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;', &#x003b1;') have an identical function at the <italic>VTC1</italic> locus, which is different from their function at the original <italic>CYC1</italic> locus. A previous study [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] showed that, when the <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter contains a single TATA at either site #1 or #2, position-specific and sequence-independent conventional TATA function is observed at the <italic>CYC1</italic> locus. This function was confirmed at the <italic>VTC1</italic> locus, as the TSSs of &#x003b2;/#1-mut/#2 (lane 3) or mut/#1-&#x003b1;/#2 (lane 5) were the same as those of [&#x003b1; or &#x003b1;']/#1-mut/#2 (lane 6, 7) and mut/#1-[&#x003b2; or &#x003b2;']/#2 (lane 10, 12), respectively. Therefore, we could recapitulate the sequence-independent function but not the sequence-dependent function of these two TATA elements at the <italic>VTC1</italic> locus. Furthermore, the functions of TATA&#x003b2; and TATA&#x003b1; were found to be TFIID-dependent at the <italic>VTC1</italic> locus (<xref rid="pone.0129357.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>), which is contrary to the previous assumption that the <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter is TFIID-independent [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129357.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129357.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129357.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In fact, we confirmed that the endogenous <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter is TFIID-independent even in the strains used in this study (data not shown). Thus, the chromosomal context and/or promoter structure outside the substituted region may alter the selectivity for the core transcriptional machineries (e.g., TFIID vs. SAGA), thereby generating the aforementioned discrepancies between the previous [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and current studies.

Therefore, despite its deviation from the original intention, we performed a random screen to identify functional core promoter element(s) that could substitute for TATA&#x003b1; in the <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter (mut/#1-&#x003b1;/#2-mut/#3-mut/#4) bearing nearly identical transcriptional activity to the wild-type (&#x003b2;/#1-&#x003b1;/#2-wt/#3-wt/#4 in <xref rid="pone.0129357.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129357.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>).</p><p>The <underline>TATATAAA</underline>ACT (TATA&#x003b1; is underlined) sequence was divided into nine frames (frame 1&#x02013;9), and four (N = A/C/G/T) or eight (W = A/T) nucleotides of each frame were randomized by PCR as shown in <xref rid="pone.0129357.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>.

The TB-staining method is quantitative enough to compare the strains processed in the same plate (i.e., under the same staining and washing conditions). However, this method could not provide an absolute value for the activity, and the results obtained at different experimental dates were difficult to compare. Therefore, the activity of each clone was evaluated by comparing it with those of the control strains processed in the same plate at the same time. In the screen, the clones showing more than the average (50%) activity of the WT and TATA mutant were judged as potentially active (<xref rid="pone.0129357.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>), and those that passed through the selection twice (<xref rid="pone.0129357.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>) were stored as active clones and subjected to the sequence analysis.

The color code for each clone is the same as that described in <xref rid="pone.0129357.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>. To compare the isolation frequency among the sequences, normalization is required since the chance to be isolated as an active clone is proportional to the numbers of each clone existing in each library. For this purpose, the expected number of a given clone carrying a specific sequence generated in each library was calculated and summed up across all frames (i.e., frames 1&#x02013;6 and 9). The actually isolated clone number carrying each sequence was divided by each expected clone number to determine the normalized isolation frequency (<xref rid="pone.0129357.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Table</xref>). This normalized value for each sequence is shown at the right side of the left panel with a black bar. The value of 1 (as indicated with a vertical thin line) represents 100% recovery; that is, the clones carrying a given sequence that exist in the library were all recovered as active clones by the screen. Note that some clones/sequences exceed the value of 1, indicating that there may be a certain bias to generate some specific clones/sequences more frequently than others during the randomization process.

As described above, TATAWAWR (consensus TATA) and TATAWAD were both shown to be active in the <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter. Thus, 28 sequences (614 clones) that matched TATAWAWR were first extracted, followed by 57 sequences (1,193 clones) that matched TATAWAD successively (class I and II in Fig <xref rid="pone.0129357.g005" ref-type="fig">5A</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129357.g005" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129357.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129357.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2B</xref> Fig). It was previously shown that the GA element (GAAAA) is a novel type of core promoter element that does not co-occur with the TATA element [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Thus, we next extracted 18 sequences (29 clones) that match GAAAA (class III in Fig <xref rid="pone.0129357.g005" ref-type="fig">5A</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129357.g005" ref-type="fig">5B</xref> and Nx9 in <xref rid="pone.0129357.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2C Fig</xref>) from the rest (2,974 clones). Our classification analyses searched for the sequence(s) within the region from -123 to -115 (9 bp: originally <underline>TATATAAA</underline>A) that included &#x0201c;N&#x0201d; (frame 1&#x02013;6) or &#x0201c;W&#x0201d; (frame 9) (<xref rid="pone.0129357.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>; TATA&#x003b1; is underlined). As the 5&#x02032;-upstream nucleotide adjacent to this region was &#x0201c;G&#x0201d; (<xref rid="pone.0129357.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>), we also searched for the sequences that matched GAAAA within the 1 bp-extended region (10 bp: <underline>G</underline>TATATAAAA) and extracted 25 sequences (54 clones) (G/Nx9 in <xref rid="pone.0129357.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2C Fig</xref>). The activities of these sequences were considerably weaker than those of TATAWAWR or TATAWAD (compare the heat maps in <xref rid="pone.0129357.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). In addition, the reproducible (i.e., isolated more than twice) clone numbers for these sequences were significantly smaller than those for the latter two TATA-containing sequences, suggesting that the GA element may not be functional in the <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter.</p><p>Next, we searched for the TATA-containing sequence(s) other than TATAWAWR and TATAWAD by using TATAN (N = A/G/C/T) as an initial probe and found that the sequences containing TATAW (W = A/T) were considerably more active than those containing TATAS (S = G/C) by examining the color profile and clone number in the heat map (data not shown). Furthermore, TATAWD (D = A/G/T) was found to be a better sequence motif than TATAW, since the sequences containing TATAWD were significantly more active than those containing TATAWC (data not shown), although the latter matched another less active sequence motif, i.e., TATATCWD (class VII), as described later. Based on the same reason, TATAWDW was a better motif than TATAWD when the heat maps of TATAWDW (W = A/T) and TATAWDS (S = G/C) were compared (data not shown). Finally, TATAWKW (K = G/T) was chosen as a sequence motif representing class IV, as TATAWAW was already included in TATAWAD (class II), and further extension was not informative (i.e., no differences were found for TATAWKWA, -C, -G or -T) (data not shown). We extracted 71 sequences (715 clones) that matched this motif (class IV in Fig <xref rid="pone.0129357.g005" ref-type="fig">5A</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129357.g005" ref-type="fig">5B</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129357.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A Fig</xref>) and found that class IV was less active than class I and II (<xref rid="pone.0129357.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129357.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2B</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129357.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A</xref> Figs).</p><p>After exclusion of the sequences belonging to class I&#x02013;IV from the total (4,781 clones), the top five most frequently isolated sequences among the remaining clones (2,230 clones) contained TTAAA (data not shown). Thus, we next searched for TTAAA-containing sequence(s) and found 945 clones containing TTAAAW (W = A/T), while no clones containing TTAAAS (S = G/C) were identified (data not shown). In addition, most of them (751 clones) had TTAAAW at the 3&#x02032;-end (i.e., further extension was not informative), indicating that TTAAAW is another sequence motif. In fact, 74 sequences (945 clones) that matched this motif (class V in Fig <xref rid="pone.0129357.g005" ref-type="fig">5A</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129357.g005" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129357.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3B Fig</xref>) were extracted, and class V was less active than class I and II, but more active than class IV (<xref rid="pone.0129357.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129357.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2B</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129357.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129357.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3B</xref> Figs).</p><p>No significant sequence features were detected in the remaining clones (1,285 clones) except that they were all W (= A/T)-rich. When 138 sequences (865 clones) that matched Wx6 (class VI) and then 135 sequences (332 clones) that matched Wx5 (class VII+VIII as described below) were extracted successively, we noticed that the latter class included a significant number of TATATC-containing sequences (data not shown). As most of these sequences could be represented as TATATCWD (D = A/G/T), the latter Wx5 class was divided into two subclasses, i.e., TATATCWD (22 sequences/115 clones) and Wx5* (= Wx5 other than TATATCWD; 113 sequences/217 clones) (class VII and VIII, respectively, in Fig <xref rid="pone.0129357.g005" ref-type="fig">5A</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129357.g005" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129357.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4B</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129357.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4C</xref> Fig). The remaining 80 sequences (88 clones) were classified as &#x0201c;others&#x0201d; (class IX in Fig <xref rid="pone.0129357.g005" ref-type="fig">5A</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129357.g005" ref-type="fig">5B</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129357.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4D Fig</xref>). It is likely that class IX is not functional, since most of the clones (73 clones) were isolated only once in the screen, presumably because of experimental noise. Collectively, we conclude that active sequences/clones could be classified into seven groups, namely, class I (TATAWAWR), II (TATAWAD), IV (TATAWKW), V (TTAAAW), VI (Wx6), VII (TATATCWD), and VIII (Wx5*) in the <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter. However, each class may include a certain number of false-positive clones (e.g., those isolated only once) since the TB-staining method is semi-quantitative and could not yield an absolute value for the activity. Consistent with this, even the same sequences (including the wild-type &#x0201c;TATATAAAA&#x0201d; sequence that was isolated most frequently in the screen) exhibited apparently varied activities (see color profiles in <xref rid="pone.0129357.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129357.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0129357.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref> Figs).</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Comparison of active sequences isolated by the screen with those identified as the PIC assembly sites throughout the genome</title><p>Recently, Rhee and Pugh determined the precise positions for a number of PICs (6,045) on the yeast genome by using a ChIP-exo method [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

First, we classified the &#x0201c;entire&#x0201d; set (5,946 sites) of the PIC assembly sites (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://downloads.yeastgenome.org/published_datasets/Rhee_2012_PMID_22258509/track_files/">http://downloads.yeastgenome.org/published_datasets/Rhee_2012_PMID_22258509/track_files/</ext-link>) into the same nine groups (class I&#x02013;IX) and found that the population sizes of classes II (TATAWAD, 4.2%), IV (TATAWKW, 4.8%), and V (TTAAAW, 3.3%) were significantly smaller than those of classes I (TATAWAWR, 15%), VI (Wx6, 33%), and VIII (Wx5*, 13%) (Fig <xref rid="pone.0129357.g005" ref-type="fig">5B</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129357.g005" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). A similar tendency was observed for the &#x0201c;isolatable&#x0201d; set (3,448 sites) when it was classified into the same nine groups (Fig <xref rid="pone.0129357.g005" ref-type="fig">5B</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129357.g005" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). In addition, a significant number of sites were classified into class IX (others, 22%[entire] or 14%[isolatable]), contrary to the screen, in which the number of active clones classified in this class was almost zero, indicating that class IX sequences are disfavored specifically by the <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter. By contrast, the clones/sequences in classes II, IV, and V appeared to be significantly active in the <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter (<xref rid="pone.0129357.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>) and thereby occupied the major fraction of the isolated clones in the screen (Fig <xref rid="pone.0129357.g005" ref-type="fig">5B</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129357.g005" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). Furthermore, the population size of the TATATCWD sequences (class VII) in the Wx5 sequences (class VII+VIII) was more than 50% (normalized value) for the screen but only 7% (= 57/809, entire) or 17% (= 57/332, isolatable) for the genome-wide analysis (Fig <xref rid="pone.0129357.g005" ref-type="fig">5B</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129357.g005" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>), indicating that the TATATCWD sequences are favored specifically by the <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter. Altogether, these results imply that the preferred sequence(s) vary among the genes, presumably depending on the promoter structure. Notably, the population size of class III (GAAAA) was smaller in both the screen (1.1%) and the genome-wide analysis (4.7%[entire] or 5.8%[isolatable]) than the size expected based on the previous notion that the GA element is found frequently in the core promoter region (37.3%) [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Thus, we speculate that this element must have a different function other than serving as the PIC assembly site.</p><p>There are two types of core promoters in budding yeast that are Taf1p-enriched or Taf1p-depleted [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

Among them, two promoters (i.e., <italic>ADE5</italic>,<italic>7</italic> and <italic>ADE6</italic>) were selected to determine whether the sequence &#x0201c;TATTTAAA&#x0201d; was functional (<xref rid="pone.0129357.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>). Northern blot analyses showed that the reporter gene (<italic>VTC1</italic>) fused to these promoters could be activated at similar levels to the endogenous genes under the adenine-starved condition (Fig <xref rid="pone.0129357.g006" ref-type="fig">6A</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129357.g006" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].

This method is semi-quantitative but simple, convenient, and inexpensive, since it uses only TB dye for visualization. This enables rough estimation of promoter activities without equipment, simply by judging the color with the naked eye (Fig <xref rid="pone.0129357.g001" ref-type="fig">1B</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129357.g001" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>). Several reporter assay systems using &#x003b2;-galactosidase (&#x003b2;-gal), luciferase (Luc), or GFP (or its derivatives) are well established in yeast [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. These methods require expensive measuring equipment such as fluorometers, luminometers or flow cytometers. The &#x003b2;-gal activity can be measured by spectrophotometer when colorimetric substrates (e.g., ONPG or X-gal) are used in the assay. However, the procedures for cell disruption/permeabilization and measurement of enzymatic activities within the linear range are time-consuming and laborious. Reagents for reducing such labors are commercially available; however, they are expensive compared to those needed for the TB assay. Another distinctive feature of the present method is that the target molecule for the measurement is not the protein itself (i.e., unlike &#x003b2;-gal, Luc, or GFP), but rather a biochemical product (i.e., polyP) accumulated endogenously in the cell by the action of the reporter gene (i.e., <italic>VTC1</italic>). Thus, this method has advantages over other methods in that it does not require any exogenous substrates or intense labor efforts to adjust the assay within the linear range (unlike &#x003b2;-gal or Luc), or expensive equipment (unlike Luc or GFP) for the measurement. However, this method is not adequate for following the dynamic behavior of target promoters because polyP is stable after the shutoff of <italic>VTC1</italic> expression [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], although it is useful to measure promoter activity in a steady state as shown in this study.</p><p>Recently, massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) systems have been developed owing to the advancement of next-generation sequencing technologies [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In these assay systems, promoter activities can be measured directly by sequencing cDNAs tagged individually with a specific barcode for identification. Such tagging system enables each promoter activity to be measured even in the mixed population, thereby greatly increasing the efficiency of the method to identify active promoter elements. Despite these advances, efforts to reveal the structure and function of the core promoter elements remain limited [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], as most studies have been focused on the functional properties of the UAS/enhancers [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Recently, a genome-wide approach using a STARR-seq (self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing) method [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] demonstrated that there are three types of enhancers in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, namely, those that can specifically activate a &#x0201c;housekeeping-type&#x0201d; core promoter containing the TCT motif (hkCP enhancer), those that activate a &#x0201c;developmental-type&#x0201d; core promoter containing TATA, Inr, MTE, and DPE (dCP enhancer), or those that activate both (shared enhancer) [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This has enabled the identification of core promoter element(s) that can be activated by a specific type of UAS/enhancer in a more systematic manner. Although the MRPA and/or STARR-seq methods would be ideal for such a purpose, they are unaffordable for most researchers. In this regard, the TB method still has competitive merits, especially in budding yeast, owing to its cost-effective and high-throughput features that may be enough for the analysis of organisms carrying a compact genome equipped with fewer regulatory <italic>cis</italic>-elements.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>TATAWAD is a functional TATA element motif for the <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter</title><p>A previous study demonstrated that the consensus TATA sequence is TATAWAWR (8 bp), in which the 8<sup>th</sup> position is confined to &#x0201c;R&#x0201d; (R = A/G) [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. By contrast, we showed that any base could function almost equally at the 8<sup>th</sup> position (Figs <xref rid="pone.0129357.g003" ref-type="fig">3C</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129357.g004" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>), indicating that the TATA element is 7 bp at least in the <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter. This assumption is consistent with a previous study showing that TATATAAN (N = A/G/C/T) are all functional at the TATA&#x003b1; site in the <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. We also showed that the base at the 7<sup>th</sup> position is critical for function but is not confined to &#x0201c;W&#x0201d; (W = A/T), as expected from the consensus TATA sequence. This position allowed &#x0201c;G&#x0201d;, but not &#x0201c;C&#x0201d;, to be fully active (<xref rid="pone.0129357.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>), implying that the 7<sup>th</sup> position should be assigned to &#x0201c;D&#x0201d; (D = A/G/T) at least in this promoter. Therefore, we conclude that the TATA sequence preferred by the <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter should be represented as &#x0201c;TATAWAD&#x0201d; (7 bp) rather than the consensus &#x0201c;TATAWAWR&#x0201d; (8 bp). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the &#x0201c;functional consensus TATA sequence&#x0201d; determined experimentally for one particular promoter, i.e., by using a functional screen to select for a large number of transcriptionally active clones from a randomized library. Of note, a similar randomized screen was conducted previously for the T<sub>R</sub> element of the <italic>HIS3</italic> promoter [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, functional consensus TATA sequence(s) could not be determined for this promoter, probably because a broader region containing the TATA element (16 bp) was replaced at once with the randomized sequence(s), contrary to our strategy in which the TATA element was divided into multiple small segments (frames 1&#x02013;8) for randomization (<xref rid="pone.0129357.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Promoter specificity of the TATA or TATA-like sequences that were isolated by the screen as the TATA&#x003b1; element of the <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter</title><p>The populations containing the sequences that matched either TATAWAWR (class I) or TATAWAD (class II) showed similar sizes in the screen for the active <italic>CYC1</italic>-TATA&#x003b1; element (class I+II = 35%) and the &#x0201c;isolatable&#x0201d; set of the PIC assembly sites (class I+II = 33%) (<xref rid="pone.0129357.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). However, the ratio of class II to I of the former (class II/I = 1.9) was significantly higher than that of the latter (class II/I = 0.28), indicating that TATAWAD is a less frequently utilized &#x0201c;functional TATA element motif&#x0201d; than TATAWAWR on the genome. Namely, the requirements for the 7<sup>th</sup> and/or 8<sup>th</sup> position(s) of the TATA element could be alleviated only for a limited number of genes. In this regard, it should be noted that the well-characterized TATA element of <italic>HIS3</italic> (T<sub>R</sub>: TATAAAGT) [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] matched TATAWAD but not TATAWAWR. Furthermore, the T<sub>R</sub> element remains active when &#x0201c;G&#x0201d; at the 7<sup>th</sup> position is mutated to &#x0201c;A&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;T&#x0201d;, but not when it is changed to &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129357.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. These observations suggest that both the <italic>HIS3</italic>-T<sub>R</sub> and <italic>CYC1</italic>-TATA&#x003b1; elements might belong to the same TATA element subfamily for which TATAWAD could represent a &#x0201c;functional consensus TATA element motif&#x0201d;. Intriguingly, a detailed structural study of the TBP-TATA complex demonstrated that &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;G&#x0201d; at the 7<sup>th</sup> position could induce a Hoogsteen-type base pair instead of a conventional Watson-Crick-type base pair upon TBP binding [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Thus, TATAWAD might be a novel type of core promoter element carrying a different function from that of the consensus TATAWAWR.</p><p>This study also showed that the function of the <italic>CYC1</italic>-TATA&#x003b1; element became Taf1p-dependent when it was integrated at the <italic>VTC1</italic> locus (<xref rid="pone.0129357.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). Contrary to these findings, the function of the <italic>HIS3</italic>-T<sub>R</sub> element is known to be Taf1p-independent [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], arguing against the possibility that TATAWAD is a functional TATA element motif for Taf1p-dependent promoters. However, the region (TA<underline>TATAAAGT</underline>) containing the <italic>HIS3</italic>-T<sub>R</sub> element (underlined sequence) of the <italic>HIS3</italic> promoter matches both TATAWAD (TA<underline>TATAAAG</underline>T) and TATAWAWR (<underline>TATATAAA</underline>GT). The Taf1p-dependency of the <italic>HIS3</italic>-T<sub>R</sub> element was examined within the context of the original promoter [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], while mutational studies of the <italic>HIS3</italic>-T<sub>R</sub> element were conducted for the shorter TATA segment containing TATAAAGT (TATAWAD-matched sequence) but not TATATAAA (TATAWAWR-matched sequence) [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129357.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Therefore, it remains possible that the function of the <italic>HIS3</italic>-T<sub>R</sub> element itself (TATAAAGT) is Taf1p-dependent, and, if so, TATAWAD might be a functional TATA element motif for the Taf1p-dependent promoters. This assumption is consistent with the observation that the utilization ratio of TATAWAD to TATAWAWR at the PIC assembly site is significantly higher in the Taf1p-enriched promoters than in the Taf1p-depleted promoters (<xref rid="pone.0129357.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>). Further analyses are needed to test this possibility more directly.</p><p>Another remarkable observation of the present study is that TTAAAW-containing sequences (class V) could function as active core promoter elements in the <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter (<xref rid="pone.0129357.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129357.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0129357.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref> Figs). This motif also appeared to be gene-specific by comparison with the genome-wide data (<xref rid="pone.0129357.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). We paid special attention to the sequence &#x0201c;TAT<underline>T</underline>TAAAA&#x0201d; (1 bp mismatched from the wild-type &#x0201c;TATATAAAA&#x0201d;) because it was the most frequently isolated, not only in class V but also across the entire classes (class I&#x02013;IX) except the wild-type sequence itself (<xref rid="pone.0129357.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129357.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0129357.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref> Figs). Furthermore, this sequence was one of the most active sequences among the 23 specifically mutated <italic>CYC1</italic>-TATA&#x003b1; elements [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Notably, a similar but non-class V variant, &#x0201c;TAT<underline>TT</underline>AGT&#x0201d; (2 bp mismatch) of the <italic>HIS3</italic>-T<sub>R</sub> element, was shown to be as active as the wild-type [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and another variant, &#x0201c;TAT<underline>TT</underline>A<underline>A</underline>T&#x0201d; (termed R2; 3 bp mismatch), was isolated as one of the most active <italic>HIS3</italic>-T<sub>R</sub> elements by a randomized screen [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. These observations suggest that &#x0201c;TATTTARW&#x0201d; (R = A/G, W = A/T) provides a novel core promoter element motif that is shared by the <italic>HIS3</italic> (TATTTAGT, TATTTAAT) and <italic>CYC1</italic> (TATTTAAA<italic>A</italic>) promoters. However, as the sequences containing this motif were isolated less frequently by our screen (i.e., <underline>TATTTAAT</underline>A/class VI [10 clones/normalized value 0.73], T<underline>TATTTAAA</underline>/class VI [8 clones/normalized value 0.58], A<underline>TATTTAAA</underline>/class VI [4 clones/normalized value 0.29] and <underline>TATTTAGA</underline>A/class VI [2 clones/normalized value 0.15] other than <underline>TATTTAAA</underline>A/class V [118 clones/normalized value 1.07]), and the isolated clones appeared to be rather inactive except the &#x0201c;TATTTAAAA&#x0201d; sequence itself (<xref rid="pone.0129357.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129357.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref> Tables), we assume that &#x0201c;TTAAAW&#x0201d; (class V) is a more appropriate core promoter element motif than others, such as &#x0201c;TATTTARW&#x0201d;, at least for the <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter.

These observations suggest that these three <italic>ADE</italic> genes (i.e., <italic>ADE4</italic>, <italic>ADE5</italic>,<italic>7</italic>, and <italic>ADE6</italic>), which are involved in the early steps of the purine <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis pathway [<xref rid="pone.0129357.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], might be regulated coordinately in a &#x0201c;TATTTAAA&#x0201d; motif-dependent manner rather than in a &#x0201c;TTAAAW&#x0201d; motif-dependent manner. Our screen could isolate &#x0201c;TATTTAAA<underline>A</underline>&#x0201d; but not &#x0201c;TATTTAAA[<underline>C/G/T</underline>]&#x0201d;, as the latter was not included in the library, implying that the 9<sup>th</sup> position of the &#x0201c;TATTTAAA<underline>A</underline>&#x0201d; sequence may not be important for <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter activity, similar to the <italic>ADE</italic> promoters.

Therefore, it is likely that not only the sequence but also the length of the core promoter element(s) play a critical role in their gene-specific function, as evidenced by the relationship between TATTTAAA (8 bp) and TATTTAAAA (9 bp), or that between TATAWAD (7 bp) and TATAWAWR (8 bp).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec018"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present study, we identified a large number of sequences that could function as the <italic>CYC1</italic>-TATA&#x003b1; element by using a novel reporter assay system.

In addition, a similar screen may need to be conducted more extensively and systematically in a wide variety of promoters. Nevertheless, we believe that these experimental approaches could provide valuable information for understanding not only the structures of the core promoter element(s), but also the mechanisms underlying the functional compatibilities between the UAS and the core promoter.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec019"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0129357.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Transcription from the <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter at the <italic>VTC1</italic> locus is Taf1p-dependent.</title><p>

The normalized* value (e.g., TATATATA: 0.74, TATAAATG: 0.58) was calculated by dividing the total number of isolated clones (9 bp) containing a given sequence (8 bp) (e.g., TATATATA: 61+3+8+3+15+17 = 107, TATAAATG: 20) by the expected number of the clones containing the same 8 bp sequence that exist in the libraries (e.g., TATATATA: 75.625+13.75+13.75+13.75+13.75+13.75 = 144.375, TATAAATG: 34.375, as listed in <xref rid="pone.0129357.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Table</xref>), not by summing up the normalized value determined individually for each sequence (9 bp) as described in the legend of <xref rid="pone.0129357.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> (e.g., TATATATA: 61/75.625+3/13.75+8/13.75+3/13.75+15/13.75+17/13.75 = 4.15, TATAAATG: 20/34.375 = 0.58). The normalized value (e.g., TATATATA: 4.15, TATAAATG: 0.58) deviates significantly from the normalized* value that does not exceed 1.0 theoretically (e.g., TATATATA: 0.74, TATAAATG: 0.58), especially when target sequence(s) are generated from multiple libraries. We suppose that the normalized value is more appropriate for the purpose of <xref rid="pone.0129357.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129357.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0129357.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref> Figs than the normalized* value, since the integral of the values that have been normalized individually for each sequence is more informative for the comparison between several classes, each of which includes a huge number of sequences. On the contrary, the normalized* value is more appropriate for the purpose of this figure than the normalized value, since the latter is affected significantly by the number of isolated sequences (9 bp) included in each target sequence (8 bp). Such artificial effects derived from the library construction strategy need to be minimized for the comparison attempted here. Thus, we exploit the normalized* value in this figure, in which all isolated sequences (9 bp) containing the same 8 bp sequence were treated evenly and subjected as a set to the calculation for normalization.</p><p>(EPS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0129357.s006.eps"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0129357.s007"><label>S7 Fig</label><caption><title>Sequences of the <italic>ADE5</italic>,<italic>7</italic> (A) and <italic>ADE6</italic> (B) promoters.</title><p>The TATTTAAA sequence and its mutated derivative (mut: CGCCCGGG) are marked with a thick black line.
