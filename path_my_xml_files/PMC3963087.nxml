Since 2010, the number of male deaths related to drug misuse has begun to show a decline, but female deaths continue to rise. Heroin and morphine remain the substances most commonly involved in drug-poisoning deaths,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> with 83% of drug-induced deaths in the UK showing the presence of opioids.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In 2011, the highest mortality rate from drug misuse was in 30&#x02013;39-year-olds.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The UK government target, set in 1999 to reduce drug-related deaths by 20% by 2004, was not met.</p><p>Death from heroin/morphine misuse made up nearly half of male deaths from poisoning and more than a quarter of female deaths and increased between 2003 and 2004. It is estimated that as many as one million people take class A drugs each year, and a quarter of these will be &#x02018;problematic&#x02019; drug users.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> There is a lack of UK data on fatal and non-fatal poisonings and this has led to calls for collating standardised ambulance call-out statistics.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Typically, deaths attributed to opioid overdose are older, heroin-dependent men not in drug treatment at the time of death.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Risk of death from overdose is also increased by use of more than one drug, injecting behaviour, homelessness and changes in tolerance especially after periods in prison.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;12</xref> Research indicates that a high proportion of drug misusers who die will have attended an emergency department within the previous 12&#x02005;months.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>The Wales and UK Substance Misuse Strategies (2008&#x02013;2018) make reference to reducing harm by the introduction of naloxone protocols and guidelines.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>Naloxone is a very safe and effective antidote to opioid overdose. It has no abuse potential<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and virtually no side effects, though it may precipitate acute withdrawal symptoms in opioid-dependent individuals, if given in large doses.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> It is administered routinely by emergency personnel in the prehospital setting, and physicians in the A&#x00026;E department.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Naloxone is usually administered either intravenously or intramuscularly when intravenous access is not possible.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>In addition to engaging with service users themselves, the National Treatment Agency and Department of Health has identified carers as one of the key groups to be targeted to reduce the risks of opioid overdose.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Research has shown that a high proportion of overdoses are witnessed,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> yet medical help is often not sought or is sought too late. Witnesses at an overdose event are however, often willing to intervene so providing training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation, recognition of overdose and the use of naloxone by service users and carers, can improve chances of an individual surviving an opioid overdose.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Since the 1990s, interest has grown in providing &#x02018;Take-Home&#x02019; Naloxone (THN) to users, families and drug services.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23&#x02013;25</xref> A Welsh Government-supported initiative saw an introduction of THN in Wales through demonstration sites in 2009. National roll-out was achieved in October 2011. The THN initiative is consistent with the Welsh Assembly Government&#x02019;s 10-year strategy,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> which aims to take forward actions which focus on reducing the number of drug poisonings in Wales. Uptake of this innovative intervention is however, currently limited to those already accessing community-based substance misuse services.</p><p>Data from the Welsh Regional Confidential Review Panels into drug-related deaths (since 2006) have shown that the highest number of drug-related deaths is in individuals who have either never accessed substance-misuse treatment, or have dropped out of such treatment. Early release from incarceration is also linked with increased risk of fatal overdose.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Accessing these high-risk individuals requires an innovative approach that takes the intervention direct to the point of care.</p><p>Studies indicate that at least 50% of opiate users will have experienced a non-fatal overdose at some point in their lives,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and are at increased risk of suffering a fatal overdose, as 60% of those who died, had accessed A&#x00026;E services in the previous 12&#x02005;months.</p><p>This study builds on the review of 999 callers and A&#x00026;E attendees presenting with non-fatal self-poisoning in Wales,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> which was commissioned by the Welsh Assembly Government. This study highlighted that 999 calls relating to heroin poisoning were concentrated within urban centres in South Wales with Cardiff having the highest number (n=27), within the 3-month study period. In addition, the majority of such 999 calls tended to be from 16:00 until midnight and on Saturdays. This is when the majority of substance misuse treatment agencies are closed. While paramedics could signpost such individuals to community THN projects, it is likely that a number would not attend. In the intervening time interval, before acquiring THN, these individuals theoretically remain at high risk of further non-fatal and possibly fatal overdoses. Research would therefore suggest that providing THN in the prehospital setting provides a considerable opportunity to intervene and engage with this high-risk group at a time of high personal significance.</p><p>As THN kits are now widely distributed through community-based Drugs Services in Wales, it is not possible to conduct a randomised trial to test the effectiveness of this model of care; however, the 999 route offers a new model of care that is as yet untested. This study is therefore timely in order to develop this complex intervention and the methods for a definitive trial, if indicated, following the Medical Research Council Framework for the Development and Evaluation of complex interventions.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The rationale for employing a cluster randomised design is so that all paramedics will have the opportunity to participate in the trial in the intervention group, but we will be able to thoroughly test the trial methods, by retaining a comparator group for a significant portion of the trial period.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Aim</title><p>To assess the feasibility of carrying out a randomised controlled trial to determine the safety, clinical and cost-effectiveness of THN distribution by paramedics</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Objectives</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To assess acceptability of and compliance with a new intervention: paramedics supplying THN kits to 999 patients they attend for an opioid overdose.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To assess the feasibility of paramedic and patient recruitment and follow-up in order to determine whether a definitive trial is indicated.</p></list-item><list-item><p>If so, to provide data to inform trial planning.</p></list-item></list></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>Cluster randomised multiple interrupted time series feasibility study, with paramedics as the unit of clustering and randomisation stratified by station and shift.

These data will be used to determine an accurate estimate on the number of opioid-related 999 calls that occur during the study period. A simple data collection form (see online supplementary appendix 1) has been designed to support this and copies will be available on all ambulance vehicles operating in the area. A supply of uniquely coloured envelopes addressed to the study team will also be available on ambulance vehicles, to facilitate easy identification and submission of relevant clinical records. Data will be collated by the chief investigator (CI), who is based at the main ambulance station in the study area.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Standard care by paramedics treating opioid overdose</title><p>Standard paramedic care of patients suspected of opioid overdose includes managing airway, breathing and circulation problems in priority order. Naloxone will then be administered to effect, either intravenously, or intramuscularly if the intravenous route is not available. Patients who fail to demonstrate full recovery are always transferred to hospital for further assessment and/or treatment. Those who regain full consciousness at the scene may or may not choose to attend hospital. Those that choose not to attend hospital will be provided call back advice and administered an 800&#x02005;&#x003bc;g intramuscular dose of naloxone, aimed at preventing secondary opioid overdose onset.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Intervention</title><p>Following a 999 call and resuscitation for an opioid poisoning, paramedics trained to provide the intervention will offer THN kits to fully recovered, consenting patients. Paramedics will supply this intervention under the auspices of a patient group direction.

Patients who do not complete the training or consent process for whatever reason will not be supplied a THN kit. To improve adherence to the study protocol, paramedics will be provided with individually assigned THN kits, to promote a sense of value and ownership.

Of the 87 volunteer paramedics, we will select five to undertake &#x02018;research champion&#x02019; roles because of their interest and enthusiasm to support the project. Eighty-two paramedic clusters stratified by base station and shift will be randomly allocated to the trial arm; we shall group them for the purpose of training and analysis. Paramedics will be trained at the rate of four per week, following the sequence generated by the randomisation method. Paramedic training will be scheduled to take place over the first 20&#x02005;weeks of the study. After random allocation, the CI will be the sole custodian. IR will remain blind. Paramedics allocated to weekly training will not be revealed to trainers (research champions), until 1-week before training. This will maintain a practical level of concealment, while allowing for a level of planning to accommodate shift patterns and availability of trainers. Volunteer paramedics and a small number of &#x02018;research champions&#x02019; were enrolled by the CI. On commencement of the study, the CI and &#x02018;research champions&#x02019; will train the paramedics in the sequence identified by the randomisation. Consent was sought from the paramedics prior to their being randomly allocated to trial arms. All but the CI is blinded to allocation and sequence of paramedic training. Clinical practice will remain as standard for the prehospital management of opioid overdose. However, once paramedics have been trained to provide the intervention, they will offer fully recovered patients the opportunity to be given a brief training intervention and THN kit.</p></sec><sec id="s2l"><title>Monitoring</title><p>Data-monitoring functions will be undertaken by an independent statistician from the supporting Clinical Trials Unit (West Wales Organisation for Rigorous Trials in Health: WWORTH) at a local University, facilitated through the sponsoring organisation's Research and Development Forum.

For the duration of the study, this process will continue, with the only modification being that all opioid-related overdose records will be placed in brightly coloured envelopes by ambulance clinicians, to assist in their identification and relevance to the study. All relevant documentation and envelopes will be delivered to the CI and secured in a locked cabinet, in a locked office. Clinical records will be photocopied and then returned to the secure cabinets to ensure routine clinical audit processes continue.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to test the feasibility of the involvement of paramedics in the supply of THN during an emergency care episode where environmental and interpersonal challenges are even higher. Evidence about feasibility, clinical and cost-effectiveness of THN provision by paramedics is urgently needed to inform the development of policy and practice for this high-risk population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e205" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-004712.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The study team are grateful for the valued support of colleagues from Welsh Government and the Welsh Ambulance Services NHS Trust.
