(AD) in 1906, ranging initially from the elucidation of the biochemical stages leading
to neuronal death, to modern day pharmacological treatment and psychosocial intervention
strategies aimed at AD patients as well as their caregivers and family. In spite of
these advances, a cure or therapy able to halt the progress of the disease has yet to be
found. Therefore, symptom relief and management, as well as psychosocial support, still
constitute the best alternative for patients and their family.</p><p>Psychosocial interventions (PIs) for patients suffering from AD can be defined as a
concerted set of biomedical, psychological, social and educational interventions that
contribute toward enhancing or maintaining the state of health and quality of life of
patients and their caregivers. PIs are aimed at complementing pharmacological treatment
of AD and are being increasingly employed for this purpose. There is a wide range of
potential applications of PIs including: neuropsychological rehabilitation, cognitive
training, environmental changes, nutritional orientation, physical activity, and
psychological counseling and support for family members and caregivers. However, few
studies are available which assess the benefits derived from PIs,<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> in spite of the importance of PIs in as
far as they take into account not only the biological aspects of the person but also the
individual as a whole. PIs have the potential to make a significant impact on patients&#x02019;
and caregivers&#x02019; quality of life.</p><p>Quality of Life (QOL) is a topic that has been widely discussed and investigated recently
across numerous fields of knowledge. The World Health Organization Quality of Life Group
(WHOQOL Group) has become a reference concerning health-related Quality of Life,
defining it as &#x0201c;individuals&#x02019; perceptions of their position in life in the context of the
culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals,
expectations, standards and concerns.&#x0201d;<sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>
In dementia, the concept of QOL must encompass the integration of cognitive functioning,
daily-life activities, social interaction and psychological well-being.<sup><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Consequently, the QOL variable can be
included as a measure of effectiveness of therapeutic interventions in AD, along with
conventionally used parameters.</p><p>The objective of the present study was to determine whether participation of AD patients
at a multidisciplinary rehabilitation center influences their quality of life.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This research work was carried out at the Day Hospital Rehabilitation Center
(CRHD) of the Department and Institute of Psychiatry (IPq), Faculty of Medicine
(FMUSP), University of Sao Paulo. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were
used as efficacy measures in this research. Pre and post-intervention interviews
were conducted by a researcher who was blinded to patient assignment
(experimental or control). These interviews focused on patients&#x02019; quality of
life. The intervention comprised 24 sessions and was carried out between March
and July 2008, upon approval by the local Ethics Committee.</p><p>For this study, 19 individuals aged 65 and older, both men and women, diagnosed
with mild to moderate AD were selected to participate. These individuals were
assigned to one of two groups: experimental or control.</p><p>The criteria for inclusion in the research protocol were: AD diagnosis according
to parameters adopted by the National Institute for Communicative Disorders and
Stroke &#x02013; Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease and Related Disorders Association &#x02013;
NINCDS-ADRA;<sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> regular
use of specific AD pharmacological treatment for at least three months at the
same daily dosage; mild, sometimes moderate stage of AD; availability to
participate in the intervention during a 12-week period; agreement to take part
in the study by signing an informed consent form; Mini-Mental State Examination
(MMSE)<sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> score above
17.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedures</title><p>The experimental group participated in the intervention on twice weekly basis for
three consecutive months, from 9:00AM to 3:30PM. The activities available to AD
patients were: cognitive rehabilitation, computerized cognitive stimulation,
speech therapy, occupational therapy, art therapy, physical training,
physiotherapy, and cognitive stimulation through reading and logic games. Each
activity was offered once a week, and undertaken in group sessions of one and a
half hours. A psychological support group and psycho-educational workshops were
available to patients&#x02019; family members and caregivers twice a week, from 10:00AM
to 11:30AM. The purpose of these meetings was to explain the clinical course of
the disease and its implications, as well as to encourage the exchange of
personal accounts and experiences among group participants.</p><p>The control group of AD patients, which was not subject to any intervention,
attended the initial evaluation and a second evaluation after a three-month
interval, where those who showed interest could participate in the
above-mentioned activities after the research protocol was completed.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials</title><p>All patients and family members or caregivers were evaluated at the beginning and
upon completion of the program by an interviewer who was blinded to group
assignment. The MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination)<sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and GDS (Geriatric Depression Scale)<sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> were applied to assess the
cognitive parameters and the presence of depression symptoms. Quality of life
was assessed through the Quality of Life in AD evaluation scale
(QOL-AD),<sup><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> translated,
adapted and validated for use in Brazil by Novelli.<sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The
Brazilian version of the QdV-DA was used with patients, as well as with their
family members or caregivers, to obtain their perceptions regarding the quality
of life of the patient in their care. Interviewing patients and family members
or caregivers about patients&#x02019; QOL is relevant because they may have different
perceptions of this construct.</p><p>In order to assess qualitative and subjective aspects of the QOL concept, the
patients in the experimental group only were asked an open question before and
after the program. The question was: &#x0201c;How is your quality of life? Please
comment.&#x0201d; This question was chosen in order to restrict possible biases.</p></sec><sec><title>Qualitative analyses of the open question</title><p>The content of the answers to the open question was examined using the Collective
Subject Discourse (CSD)<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>
methodology. This methodology comprises a set of procedures for tabulating and
organizing the discourse data arising from the different accounts given by study
participants. The CSD is the sum of individual discourses and therefore
expresses the collective views of a group.</p><p>According to Teixeira and Lefevre,<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> CSD is a methodological tool intended for making social
representations more meaningful and explicit, thus enabling one to view a
certain social group &#x02013; in this case, elderly patients with AD &#x02013; as the author
and producer of a common discourse shared by its members. CSD thus aims to
rebuild &#x02013; from pieces of individual discourse &#x02013; as many summarized discourses as
deemed necessary to express a given thought or a social representation of a
phenomenon, much like a jigsaw puzzle.</p><p>The steps of the CSD methodology are:</p><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>1) Analysis of answers separately;</p></list-item><list-item><p>2) Selection of key statements in each discourse;</p></list-item><list-item><p>3) Identification of the central idea of each key statement;</p></list-item><list-item><p>4) Grouping of central ideas with similar, equivalent or
complementary meaning;</p></list-item><list-item><p>5) Building of CSD, which is the summary of a group&#x02019;s fundamental
ideas.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The question asked in the present study was devised to elicit the perceptions of
AD patients concerning their QOL, and to investigate whether it was possible for
these individuals, at their respective stage of the disease, to critically
self-assess their QOL. Therefore, this served as a further efficacy parameter of
the influence of a non-pharmacological intervention on patient QOL.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analyses for QOL-AD quantitative variables</title><p>Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were carried out to assess the normal distribution of
demographic, cognitive and QOL-AD variables. All variables presented normal
distribution so parametric tests were used. Student&#x02019;s t test was used to compare
experimental and control groups for demographic and cognitive variables. To
evaluate the intervention impact on QOL, Student&#x02019;s paired samples test was used
to compare pre to post-test QOL scores for each group separately. In addition,
delta scores were calculated (post-test score minus pre-test score) for the
QOL-AD variables, and experimental and control group deltas were compared using
Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The clinical and socio-demographic characteristics of the groups before intervention
are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>. The experimental group
comprised twelve individuals &#x02013; four men (33%) and eight women (67%) &#x02013; whose mean age

intervention (48.5 words per participant on average). Five central ideas were
established: QOL is excellent, good, average, poor, and QOL changed. The central
ideas for excellent and good QOL appeared in analyses both prior to and after
intervention. In the third central idea, QOL is reported as being average and
completely calm, indicating that the variable QOL can be interpreted in different
ways. In the fourth central idea, &#x0201c;Quality of life is not good&#x0201d;, the CSD indicates
patients&#x02019; dissatisfaction over their situation. In the fifth central idea, present
in the accounts of half the individuals undergoing intervention &#x02013; &#x0201c;Quality of life
has changed&#x0201d;, the CSD indicates that the QOL of AD sufferers was positively
influenced by the psychosocial intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study sought to investigate the effectiveness of a multi-professional
intervention of 24 sessions based on the view of the AD patient and that of their
family member or caregiver regarding the patient&#x02019;s QOL. The results from the QOL-AD
scale showed no significant differences between the experimental and the control
groups after participating in the program in terms of the perception of patients and
their caregivers. However, the qualitative analysis of the patients&#x02019; speech at the
beginning and end of the program using the CSD<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> methodology indicated positive changes in QOL perception
after the intervention, especially in the accounts of six patients classified as
&#x0201c;QOL has changed&#x0201d;.</p><p>A decrease in MMSE performance in both the control group &#x02013; which underwent no
psychosocial intervention &#x02013; and the experimental group was observed. This is in
keeping with the progressive nature of AD, and this information suggests that the
intervention did not succeed in stabilizing the decline in cognitive performance of
the participants.</p><p>Previous Brazilian papers related to rehabilitation of AD patients<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> found that a slight improvement or stabilization of
cognition and behavioral symptoms occurred. Bottino and colleagues<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> carried out a psychosocial
intervention similar to that described in this paper. The six patients with mild AD
who underwent weekly interventions for six months displayed stabilization or slight
improvement in cognitive performance and daily activities. Stabilization or
reduction of depression and anxiety levels was also observed. Abrisqueta-Gomez and
colleagues<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> demonstrated
cognitive enhancement, functional stabilization and improvement of behavioral
problems in three patients diagnosed with mild to moderate AD after twelve months of
psychosocial intervention. However, the reported benefits were not sustained
throughout the second year of intervention. For this reason, the absence of gains in
clinical parameters in the present study may have been due to the relatively short
duration of the intervention. An extended intervention may be needed to affect these
parameters. Another possibility is that these instruments are not sufficiently
sensitive to detect the changes that may have occurred.</p><p>Even though QOL is at present recognized as one of the core targets of healthcare
programs,<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> few research
studies have included this variable as a measure of effectiveness in therapeutic
interventions. A considerable number of papers have sought to identify which factors
constitute the QOL construct and how best to measure them. However, moves to use QOL
as an outcome measure of interventions remains incipient.</p><p>Aisen and colleagues,<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> for
instance, conducted a random, double-blind study which aimed to determine whether
treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs (Naproxen and Rofecoxib) would lessen
cognitive decline in AD patients. A total of 351 participants with mild to moderate
AD were recruited, and subsequently divided into three groups: placebo, Naproxen and
Rofecoxib. The QOL-AD was also used. The three groups showed a decline in QOL after
the treatment, an observation suggesting that QOL is a phenomenon connected to
aspects of life not necessarily addressed during pharmacological intervention.</p><p>Spector and colleagues<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> carried
out a cognitive intervention program in 201 AD patients. The program lasted for
seven weeks, and involved 45-minute sessions run twice a week (14 sessions). The
measured parameters included cognition, quality of life, communication, behavior,
global functioning, depression and anxiety. Participants were split into a control
group (N=115) and an experimental group (N=86). By the end of the intervention a
significant improvement in QOL-AD and cognition was observed in the experimental
group. Use of a larger sample and increased statistical power to detect changes may
explain the difference between the present results and the study of Spector and
colleagues.</p><p>Orrell and Spector<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> assessed the
effectiveness of a 16-week maintenance program following the cognitive stimulation
carried out by Spector<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and
colleagues in 2003. The group that participated in the maintenance program displayed
an improvement in cognitive functioning and an increase in MMSE score. Stabilization
of QOL measured by the QOL-AD scale was recorded. The group not undergoing
maintenance therapy demonstrated poorer QOL.</p><p>Nevertheless, another study by Longsdon and colleagues found improvement in QOL for
patients with AD<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. A total of 95
AD patients participated in a 12-week intervention. These interventions adopted
strategies seeking to lessen depression and anxiety symptoms in patients and
caregivers. The QOL-AD was included in the protocol. Depression symptoms of
caregivers were shown to be reduced. The reduction of depression and anxiety
symptoms in patients was associated with improvement in patients&#x02019; QOL reported by
their caregivers and with improvement in the QOL of the actual caregiver.</p><p>Overall it should be noted that research on QOL is incipient and uses different
methodological strategies. Nevertheless, according to Brodaty<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> who conducted a meta-analysis
study, it is possible to assert that psychosocial interventions potentially benefit
patients and their family in spite of methodological differences.</p><p>In the present paper, no significant statistical difference was observed between
groups regarding QOL measured by the QOL-AD. This outcome may be a consequence of
the small sample size in comparison with the research carried out by Longsdon and
colleagues<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> in 2005.
Alternatively, the outcome could have resulted from the shorter intervention period
vis-&#x000e0;-vis Orrell and Spector&#x02019;s<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> study in 2005, or may have stemmed from the fact that QOL is a
multidimensional phenomenon influenced by a variety of factors which were not
controlled in this study, such as loss of friends or family over the years. It is
also possible that the QOL-AD scale has been incapable of detecting subtle changes
in the QOL of participants. Quantitative scales may be unable to fully address
QOL-related questions, especially in small groups. The CSD methodology enabled
detection of changes in patients&#x02019; perceptions regarding their QOL.</p><p>Under one of the central ideas from the patients&#x02019; discourse before intervention &#x02013;
&#x0201c;Quality of Life is good&#x0201d; &#x02013; patients stated that their QOL was good although they
noticed they forgot things. This is evidence that individuals suffering from mild to
moderate AD remain discerning and exercise sound judgment regarding their present
situation. This information is in line with the views of Logsdon,<sup><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> who claimed that patients with a an MMSE score of 18 or higher
are capable of critically assessing their QOL, as well as being able to participate
in the framing of psychometric tools by giving their opinion on the domains used in
assessments.</p><p>Under another central idea before intervention &#x02013; &#x0201c;Quality of Life is terrible&#x0201d; &#x02013; one
patient declared that their QOL was terrible because they depended on the assistance
of someone else. Being ill is associated with the limitations imposed by the illness
and with the way the patient deals with their condition.</p><p>It is noteworthy that after the intervention, the average number of words used by
patients to express themselves spontaneously increased from 13.6 to 48.5. Half the
patients declared that their &#x0201c;Quality of Life has changed&#x0201d;, while CSD results
suggested that the psychosocial intervention positively affected the QOL of patients
by expanding their friendship networks and increasing their motivation, besides the
pleasure of attending the program. Finally, participants provided vital reports to
further the discussion and analysis of the QOL variable, which in turn is now one of
the core objectives of healthcare.</p><p>A few methodological limitations in the present research should be mentioned, namely
the small sample size and short duration of the intervention &#x02013; three months &#x02013;
compared to the parameters of previous studies (Abrizqueta-Gomes, 2004). In
addition, control group participants were not asked the open question about QOL.
Control group answers at post-test could potentially have been used as a comparison
parameter. Nevertheless, the results from this study suggest that QOL may change
after intervention. Despite the fact that the QOL-AD scale detected no significant
change in QOL, the CSD methodology enabled detec tion of changes in patients&#x02019;
perceptions regarding QOL. Therefore, qualitative data suggests that combining drug
treatment with psychosocial intervention may prove to be an effective strategy to
enhance the QOL of AD sufferers.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to all patients and their relatives who participated in this
