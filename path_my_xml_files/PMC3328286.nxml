Developments in bottle design have mostly focused on short-term infant behaviour; indeed, we have previously shown in a randomised trial that use of a feeding bottle with anti-vacuum features was associated with significantly less distressed vocalisation and a greater proportion of time spent awake and happy when compared to a conventional bottle without such features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. However, the possibility that feeding bottle design might affect infant milk intake and hence growth, or the risk of infection, has not previously been considered.</p><p>In this study, we compared two commonly used infant feeding bottles with different anti-vacuum designs. The first bottle has a one-way air valve, allowing air to flow into the bottle to replace milk when the infant sucks, and may be described as 'partial anti-vacuum', (Bottle A; Philips Avent, Glemsford, Suffolk, UK; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>) whilst the second has an internal venting system which allows air to flow continuously into the bottle when it is inverted, and can be described as 'complete anti-vacuum' (Bottle B; Dr Browns, Handi-Craft, Missouri, USA; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). We hypothesised that greater effort would be required to obtain milk from bottle A, and that this would result in (i) lower rates of milk intake and hence (ii) slower growth; and finally (iii) patterns of growth more similar to those of breast-fed infants.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Infant feeding bottles A and B, showing anti-vacuum features</bold>. a) Bottle A; b) Bottle B.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1756-0500-5-150-1"/></fig><p>The study also aimed to address secondary hypotheses related to infant behaviour and infection risk. Because of the complete venting design of bottle B, which prevents the build-up of any vacuum, we hypothesised that infants using this bottle would have less colic, be more settled, and that the reduced requirement for suction might prevent the build-up of negative pressure in the infant's mouth and pharynx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] which could in turn reduce the build up of fluid in the middle ear and reduce the incidence of ear infections. Conversely, related to the greater complexity of parts of bottle B, we hypothesised that mothers would award lower scores on a range of consumer characteristics, particularly those relating to assembly and cleaning, which might in turn be reflected in an increased risk of gastrointestinal infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Healthy term singleton infants (37 weeks completed gestation, birthweight &#x0003e; 2.5 kg) were recruited from the post-natal wards at 2 hospitals (The Hillingdon Hospital, Uxbridge, UK and Northwick Park Hospital, Harrow, UK) between June 2006 and November 2007. Exclusion criteria were: birthweight &#x0003c; 2.5 kg, gestational age &#x0003c; 37 weeks, any congenital malformation likely to affect growth, requirement for neonatal intensive care, or mother unable to speak English (necessary because of the questionnaires and diaries used). Ethical approval was granted by the Institute of Child Health Research Ethics Committee. The trial was registered with Clinical Trials.gov (NCT00325208).</p><p>Mothers were given an information sheet whilst they were in hospital and asked for permission to be contacted at home soon after discharge to determine if they wished to participate. No attempt was made to influence feeding mode - indeed all mothers were encouraged and supported to breast-feed. If the mother was exclusively bottle-feeding when contacted at home, she was asked for consent to be randomised to use either bottle A or B. If breast-feeding fully, she was recruited into the reference group. Mixed feeders were not recruited into the study, because of the potential for discouraging breastfeeding. The higher than anticipated rate of mixed feeding in the early post-natal period led to difficulties in recruiting sufficient exclusively bottle-fed infants from the post-natal wards, and some infants were also recruited via health centres and family doctors' surgeries.</p><sec><title>Randomisation</title><p>After checking eligibility and obtaining written informed consent, the research nurse telephoned the randomisation centre based at the MRC Clinical Trials Unit (CTU), London. Standardised questions were asked by the centre using an agreed database to confirm eligibility and the randomisation assignment was given. Randomisation of formula-fed infants was stratified by parity and by infant gender. Confirmation of enrolment and randomised assignment was sent by e-mail and fax to the study centre. Breast-fed infants were registered with the CTU at the point of enrolment and assigned a study number. If a breastfeeding mother later started using a bottle and consented to randomisation, the research nurse telephoned the CTU to obtain the randomised assignment. Confirmation of the assignment was sent by fax and e-mail to the study centre.</p><p>All formula-feeding mothers were offered a supply of free infant formula (Farley's First Milk (Heinz plc, Kendal, UK) packed in plain research tins without the company name or logos) until the infant was 6 months old, in an attempt to minimise any effect of different infant formulas on growth; however, many mothers wished to choose their own formula and this did not result in exclusion from the trial. Mothers were asked to use the randomised bottle for at least the first 4 weeks of the study. Beyond this time point they were encouraged to continue using the randomised bottle until they felt that their infant was ready to progress to a beaker or cup. Mothers were initially provided with 6 bottles and newborn teats. At the 4 week visit they were provided with the next size teat. We made no attempt to influence the method used for sterilisation of feeding equipment, although the need for good hygiene was emphasised at all times.</p><p>Exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months was recommended as per current guidelines from the UK Department of Health. However, if at any stage a breast-feeding mother expressed the intention of introducing a bottle to feed her infant expressed breast milk or infant formula, she was asked for permission to be randomised to use bottle A or bottle B. If she agreed, written informed consent was obtained. The mother was provided with a supply of bottles, but free formula milk was not provided as this might undermine continued breastfeeding.</p><p>All outcomes measures were recorded during home visits at enrolment, 2, 3 and 4 weeks and subsequently at 3 month follow-up. The primary outcome measure was infant weight gain from enrolment to 4 weeks. Secondary outcome measures related to (i) growth (length and head circumference gain, milk intake from enrolment to 2 weeks); (ii) infant behaviour at 2 weeks of age; (iii) infection (ear and gastrointestinal infections up to 3 months); (iv) mother's opinion of the bottle at 4 weeks; and (v) proportion breast-fed infants subsequently randomised to bottle A or B who were receiving any breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding at 3 months.</p><p>Baseline data were collected on social and demographic factors, and on the mother's pregnancy and delivery. Infant anthropometry was recorded at each home visit. Weight was obtained using digital scales with the infant naked. Length was measured using a rollameter and head circumference and mid upper arm circumference with a non-stretchable tape. Measurements were performed in triplicate and the mean value used for analyses. Weight, length and head circumference were converted to SD scores using UK90 reference data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Milk intake</title><p>Bottle-feeding mothers were asked to keep a diary each day between randomisation and the 2 week visit, recording the number of feeds, the weight of milk taken at each feed and the time taken for the feed. Scales were provided for the mother to weigh feeding bottles before and after each feed.</p></sec><sec><title>Infant behavior</title><p>At 2 weeks, mothers were asked to complete a validated infant behaviour diary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. recording the time spent in 6 different behavioural states (colic, crying, fussing, awake &#x00026; happy, feeding and asleep) over a 3 day period. Clear definitions for each state were provided; for example, the definition of 'fussing' was 'baby irritable and unsettled, may be vocalising but not continuously crying'; that for 'crying' was 'periods of prolonged, distressed vocalisation; and that for 'colic' was 'bouts of intense, unsoothable crying and other behaviour, possibly due to stomach or bowel pain'. Each 24 hour period was divided into 15 minute periods, and the parent was asked to record the infant's behavioural state for each period by shading the appropriate box on a grid. The mean number of minutes spent in each behavioural state over the 3 day reporting period was calculated for each infant by the research nurse. The behaviour diary has been extensively validated and used successfully by members of the collaborative team in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Ear and gastrointestinal infections</title><p>At each visit, questionnaires were used to record details of infant feeding history and general health including specifically the number of ear infections and gastrointestinal infections. A diagnosis of ear or chest infection was only accepted if it had been diagnosed by the family doctor and treated with antibiotics.</p></sec><sec><title>Mothers' opinions of bottle characteristics</title><p>At the 4 week visit, a questionnaire was used to assess mothers' opinions of the two bottles for four parameters: ease of assembly, cleaning, appearance and how comfortable the bottle was to hold. Each parameter was rated on an analogue scale with 1 as most favourable, 4 neutral and 7 as least favourable. Their scores were recoded into 3 categories for analysis (1-3, 4 and 5-7) representing 'above average', 'neutral' and 'below average'.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size and recruitment</title><p>A sample size of 76 infants per randomised group was planned to allow detection of 0.5SD difference in outcome measures between bottle groups for main study, allowing for an interim analysis when all infants completed 1 month in the study. We also aimed to recruit 76 breast-fed infants as a reference group.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The primary analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis, comparing data from the randomised bottle groups using Student's <italic>t</italic>-test or chi-square test (or non-parametric statistics as appropriate). Secondary analyses were performed where appropriate for subjects who remained on their assigned bottle at the time of measurement. Data from the breast-fed reference group were compared to those from the two formula groups by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Dunnett's post-hoc test was used to compare individual formula groups against the breast-fed group where the ANOVA was significant. General linear models were used to compare groups after adjusting for relevant confounding factors. Secondary analyses included only those infants who were still breast-feeding at the time of the outcome assessment.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Comparison of randomised groups</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>Changes in UK infant feeding practices, in particular the fact that more mothers were choosing to mix breast and bottle-feeding rather than exclusively bottle feeding early in the post-natal period, made the target sample size unachievable within the time-frame and budget for the study. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> shows the flow of subjects through the study. 31 infants were randomised to bottle A and 32 infants to bottle B. 29 infants randomised to bottle A and 25 randomised to bottle B were seen at 4 weeks; of these, 13 infants had changed bottle (6 from group A (5 to bottle B, one unknown) and 7 from group B (3 to bottle A, 3 to other brands, one not known)); 3 mothers using bottle A reported changing because the infant had colic, 5 bottle B mothers reported that the bottle leaked and 1 that they took too long to clean. Other mothers did not give a specific reason for changing bottle. Specific reasons given for changing bottleOne infant (randomised to bottle A) was recruited at 22 days, following the decision to increase the age-range for recruitment. However, in practice no other infants were recruited later than 15 days. Since this single infant was an outlier on initial inspection of the data (not surprising as his baseline data were recorded at the same time as 2 or 3 week data for other infants), the decision was taken to omit the infant from the analyses. The mother had also changed from the randomised bottle to use bottle B shortly after randomisation and would therefore have been excluded from any 'secondary' analysis on this basis. Twenty-six infants randomised to bottle B and 24 infants randomised to bottle B were seen for follow-up at 3 months.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Flow of subjects through study</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1756-0500-5-150-2"/></fig><p>Baseline characteristics of the two groups are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.

However, our ability to draw conclusions from the study, particularly relating to growth patterns and infections, was limited by the small sample size. Because of positive changes in infant feeding patterns in the UK, in particular the greater proportion of mothers choosing to combine breastfeeding and bottle feeding in the early post-natal period rather than exclusively bottle-feeding, we were unable to achieve our planned sample size, and the actual sample size, with 30 infants per group, would only allow us to detect a 0.7SD difference in outcome measures between randomised groups. We may therefore have missed a smaller effect of biological significance. We did not recruit mixed fed infants because of the potential for discouraging breast-feeding, and hence our pool of eligible infants was lower than had been anticipated based on previous data.</p><sec><title>Milk intake and growth</title><p>Our primary hypothesis was that feeding bottle design would influence infant milk intake and hence growth. This is an important issue in view of the increasing evidence that rapid growth in early infancy is associated with an increased later risk of cardiovascular disease and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], which has led to a greater focus on the factors influencing infant growth, in particular the type and composition of milk. Breast-fed infants have lower milk and nutrient intakes during the early post-natal period than infants who receive infant formula. It is likely that, due to the supply and demand nature of breast-feeding, these infants are able to regulate their intake more effectively and signal satiety. In contrast, bottle-fed infants have less opportunity to influence their milk intake and may therefore be effectively overfed. The possibility that the design of an infant feeding bottle might influence the availability of milk, and hence infant nutrient intake and growth, has not previously been investigated.</p><p>We hypothesised that milk would be more easily available to infants using the completely vented bottle B, resulting in greater milk intake and faster weight gain. Our study did not confirm this primary hypothesis, although our analyses were hampered by the small sample size, which resulted in some baseline imbalance in anthropometry; bottle A infants tended to be heavier at birth and remained so on average throughout the study. This imbalance is particularly problematic in a study focussing on early growth, since the potential for catch-up growth is related to size at birth. Nevertheless there were no consistent trends towards more rapid growth in infants using bottle B and the patterns of weight gain expressed in SD scores were remarkably similar in all three groups of infants.</p></sec><sec><title>Infant behaviour</title><p>We hypothesised that the complete venting design of Bottle B, which prevents the build-up of any vacuum inside the bottle, would result in a lower incidence of colic. Although the biological nature of excessive infant crying and colic is much debated, from a pragmatic perspective, these behaviours are well recognised to be a major area of concern for parents and to result in a substantial use of health service resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and it is important to identify simple aspects of infant care that might prevent or reduce them. We recorded infant behaviour at 2 weeks of age since, in a previous study, this was identified as a peak time for distressed behaviours in bottle-fed infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>In order to measure infant behaviour as objectively as possible without undue demands on the family, we used a 3 day diary which has previously been validated against concurrent audiorecordings of infant vocalisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Infant distress vocalisations - fussing, crying and colic - were clearly defined in the diaries and mothers appear to have no problem in understanding these definitions. Our results showed that the three distress vocalisations - fussing, crying and colic - together accounted for approximately 6.6% of the day - around 95 minutes. 'Fussing' was the single most common form of infant distress behaviour - accounting for 4.5% or 65 minutes per day - and was significantly influenced by bottle type; infants using bottle A were reported to fuss for on average 45 minutes per day less than those using bottle B. The difference was present throughout both the day and night, but slightly greater at night. This type of behaviour, often described by the mother as the infant being 'unsettled', can be extremely trying to parents as an underlying reason is frequently not apparent, and this finding is therefore likely to be of practical importance to mothers and carers.</p><p>In contrast to fussing, we found no significant differences between randomised groups in the duration of reported crying or colic. The proportion of infants reported to have at least one episode of colic during the 3 day period was around 30% in both bottle groups and the breast-fed group, with similar reported durations of colic in affected infants from all groups. In a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], we reported a lower duration of colic in infants using the partial anti-vacuum bottle A compared to those using a standard bottle with no anti-vacuum features; infants using bottle A in that study had values similar to a group of breast-fed reference infants. The lack of difference in reported colic between infants using the two feeding bottles in our current study - both of which have anti-vacuum features - may reflect the lack of power of our current study to detect differences in this relatively infrequent outcome. Alternatively, it may suggest that the complete venting design does not provide any greater advantage than the partial anti-vacuum design for this outcome. Nevertheless, the finding that the design of a feeding bottle has measurable effects on troublesome infant behaviours now in two different studies is important.</p><p>Compared to bottle-fed infants, breast-fed infants showed a trend towards shorter sleep times and greater feed times, with fussing times similar to those reported for infants using Bottle B and higher than for those using Bottle A. These differences are not unexpected, as breastfeeding mothers were feeding on demand and the diary was completed at an age (2 weeks) when breastfeeding is still being established. All differences between groups were more significant in secondary analyses, including infants who remained on their assigned bottle or who were still exclusively breast-feeding at the 2 week study visit.</p><sec><title>Infections</title><p>We aimed to test the hypothesis that the complete venting design of bottle B would result in a reduced incidence of ear infections. It has been suggested that the reduced requirement for suction with bottle B might prevent the build-up of negative pressure in the infant's mouth and pharynx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] which could in turn reduce the build up of fluid in the middle ear and influence the propensity to ear infections. In fact, the incidence of ear infections treated with antibiotics was low in our study compared to the recently reported figure of 44% for the prevalence of a first episode of acute otitis media in infants under 1 year of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. There were no consistent differences in the reported incidence of ear infections between randomised groups, nor between breast-fed and bottle-fed infants. However, the small sample size limits our ability to draw conclusions.</p><p>We also hypothesised that the greater complexity of parts in Bottle B might compromise cleaning, resulting in an increased incidence of gastroenteritis. However, whilst mothers using bottle A awarded significantly higher scores for 'cleaning' and 'assembly' characteristics, with 100% awarding the highest scores in these categories, this was not reflected in detectable differences in gastroenteritis between groups, although this analysis was also limited by the small sample size. Our limited (unpublished) data, with microbiological testing of bottles following normal cleaning and 'sterilisation' routines by mothers shows a significant rate of isolation of potentially enteropathogenic organisms from bottles of both types, but with an excess in Bottle B. Anecdotally, the research nurses who collected the bottles observed that mothers frequently failed to wash their hands before assembling the bottles that were provided for testing. It is possible that the subsequent use of hot water to reconstitute formula may re-sterilise these bottles so that the infant is not adversely affected. Nevertheless, these findings re-emphasise the importance of good hygiene and, in particular, hand-washing prior to assembling feeding bottles.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Due to the small sample size, we were unable to exclude effects of infant feeding bottle design on infant growth patterns or infection rates. However, our study showed that the design of an infant feeding bottle has effects on short-term infant behaviour, and influences parental opinions on aspects such as cleaning and assembly. These issues are likely to be of importance to parents and carers, and are therefore relevant for health professionals advising parents on the care of newborn infants.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>MF and AL have received research grants from the manufacturer of one of the feeding bottles used in this study and have performed advisory work for this company (Philips Avent).
