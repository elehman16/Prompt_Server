To achieve this, students should be engaged in learning activities that enhance deeper understanding of course content through skill development.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Pharmacology is a paraclinical subject, taught in the second professional of MBBS for three semesters of 6 months each. The content is mainly delivered through didactic lectures for large groups and tutorials for small groups. The lectures planned for larger groups (more than 100 students), which continue to be the most common instructional design, are mostly passive.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Lectures alone are poor means of transferring or acquiring information. Lectures also are less effective at skill development.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Students should be, therefore, encouraged to learn in small groups through peer and faculty interaction.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Tutorials are one such small group teaching&#x02013;learning strategy used in pharmacology. Although tutorials are designed to encourage teacher&#x02013;student interaction, critical thinking, and application of general concepts to problem-solving, they often end up being small lectures by the instructor.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] As a result, though students gain knowledge through these types of tutorials, they fail to develop skills to apply knowledge thus acquired to real-world clinical problems. This hinders the development of self-directed learning (SDL) process, and students await assistance. The students, therefore, learn superficially, lack motivation and are unable to adapt themselves to rapid changes in terms of both knowledge and technology.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Hence, there is a need to introduce innovative active teaching&#x02013;learning strategies.</p><p>To meet these challenges, SDL can be used.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] As defined by Knowles, &#x0201c;SDL is a process in which individuals take the initiative, with or without the help of others, in diagnosing their learning needs, formulating learning goals, identifying human and material resources for learning, choosing and implementing appropriate learning strategies and evaluating learning outcomes, that is, they take responsibility for, and control of, their own learning.&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The main characteristic of such learning is that students take some significant responsibility for their own learning over and above responding to instruction.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>One form of SDL is through student-led objective tutorial (SLOT) which enables students to learn using the recommended learning resources.</p><p>SLOT is one of the novel designs of tutorial to enhance interest among learners, provides opportunities for group learning, and facilitates SDL.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] In previous studies, SLOT has been judged to be superior as compared to conventional tutorials (CTs) and was also appreciated as the method of active learning by the students. Students also expressed that the mechanics of SLOT were a key to effective learning and mastering the techniques of answering the multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in the examination.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] However, published literature regarding effectiveness of SLOT to teach pharmacology is scarce.</p><p>In view of the beneficial features of SLOT and lack of similar studies in pharmacology, the present study was planned with the objectives to assess the effectiveness of SLOT over CTs in pharmacology.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><p>The present study was planned for 2<sup>nd</sup> professional MBBS students (<italic>n</italic> = 173) and was conducted in Department of Pharmacology. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee. After giving brief introduction on this new type of tutorial SLOT, informed consent was sought from all the students. Students were randomly divided into two groups, i.e., CT group and SLOT group, with the help of sealed envelopes. The randomization was in a 1:1 ratio, with 86 students in SLOT group and 87 students in CT group. The study module selected was drugs acting on CNS. All the students had prior knowledge about these topics as they were already dealt in lecture classes.</p><p>The chapters selected from the module were sedatives and hypnotics, antiepileptic drugs, opioid analgesics and antagonists, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antipyretic analgesics, and anti-Parkinsonian drugs. NSAIDs were included in this module so as to make the students understand the difference between peripherally acting analgesics (NSAIDs) and centrally acting analgesics (opioid analgesics). These topics were same for both the groups, and the students were notified about the topics for discussion 2 weeks before the session.</p><p>A workshop was conducted on constructing the MCQs for SLOT group. Followed by this, students in SLOT group were divided into seven subgroups, with 6&#x02013;7 students in each subgroup. These students remained in their respective groups till the end of the study. The main topic was divided into different subtopics [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Each subgroup was allotted one such subtopic for discussion. The students in their own subgroups worked together and prepared 4&#x02013;5 MCQs related to their subtopic. The objective of preparing each MCQ was stated by them, as an assignment in the form of a powerpoint presentation. They were asked to consult the faculty and revise their MCQs if required at least 3 days before the tutorials. The faculty also validated the MCQs.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow chart depicting the division of subgroups of medical undergraduate students along with their respective subtopics for conducting the student-led objective tutorial</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPharm-48-78-g001"/></fig><p>On the day of the tutorials, students of the SLOT batch assembled in the lecture room which was equipped with a computer and projection system. One member from subgroup 1 projected the first MCQ which was related to their subtopic. Subgroup 2 was expected to respond while other subgroups observed, and if the answer was incorrect, the question was passed on to subsequent subgroups. Irrespective of the nature of the response, the next slide displayed the correct answer. The third slide showed the objective for setting the question. This process was repeated until all the subgroups completed their presentations. All subgroups had equal chance of posing and answering questions. The tutor also intervened and assisted the proceedings. The interventions included explanations and suggestions on the MCQs presented, wherever appropriate. This was followed by discussion and the summary of the whole topic by the tutor. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows the overall scheme followed during the antiepileptic session.</p><p>Example of MCQ presented by students:</p><p>Slide 1: Which of the following is the advantage of fosphenytoin over phenytoin?</p><p>

</p><p>Slide 2: Can be given intravenously</p><p>Slide 3: Explanation - Fosphenytoin is a water-soluble prodrug of phenytoin and has been introduced to overcome the difficulties in intravenous administration of phenytoin.</p><p>In CT group, tutorials conducted were mainly dominated by the tutor who discussed the content in the form of various aspects of drugs (pharmacological actions, mechanism of action, uses, and adverse effects) without specific consideration to clinical application or clinical decision-making.</p><p>To assess the overall performance on the CNS module, a written test in the form of essay questions, short answer questions, and MCQs was conducted at the end of the module for both SLOT and CT groups. All the answer sheets were corrected by only one staff and the procedure was blinded. The scores of the students in the two methods were compared. A minimum of 50% of maximum allotted marks for the test was considered as passing score.</p><p>Feedback was obtained from the students regarding their experience with the innovative instructional design on a questionnaire with a rating scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Data were expressed as a mean &#x000b1; standard deviation. Mean scores at the end of the module test between the groups were analyzed using Mann&#x02013;Whitney U-test.

However, some students expressed that SLOT was time consuming and required a lot of prior preparation by the students. Few students were not satisfied with some of the members of their group who were not actively involved in framing MCQs and other activities, which increased the work burden of other students.</p><table-wrap id="T5" position="float"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Feedback of undergraduate medical students regarding student-led objective tutorial (assessed over a scale of 1-4)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPharm-48-78-g006"/></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of SLOT over CT in pharmacology. The results of the present study showed that there was no significant difference in the mean scores of the end of the module test. However, the overall passing percentage was significantly more in the SLOT group as compared to the CT group. This could be explained on the basis that not all the students from the SLOT group were actively involved in the sessions. This was also expressed by a few students who were burdened with the activity of framing the MCQs for the group. These students must have been able to understand the content in depth and to retain the same. Those students who were not actively involved might have scored less in the test which reduced the mean score of the entire group. These results might suggest that the mechanics of SLOT help the students to understand the course content in depth, to concentrate on the important aspects of the topic, and retain the course content for a longer period of time as suggested earlier.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Statistically significant gender difference was observed with mean scores being high in girls in both the SLOT and CT groups. However, the gender difference was not significant for pass percentage in SLOT and CT group. This could be attributed to improvement in the performance of female groups which is supported by a study involving problem-based learning tutorial where such gender difference was seen.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Students appreciated SLOT as a novel teaching&#x02013;learning method. Students expressed that they had a better understanding of the topic and they enjoyed working in a team. This increased their ability to learn independently as well as led to the success of the group. This correlates with the suggestion of a previous study that peer tutoring can be more appealing with a constructive educational opportunity for the students&#x02019; academic development.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] However, some students expressed that SLOT was time consuming and required a lot of prior preparation by the students. Such a response is expected with the implementation of any new teaching&#x02013;learning method, but students engaged in SDL undergo a transformation that begins usually with negative feelings and ends with confidence and skills for lifelong learning.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Introducing SLOT into the existing curriculum was one of the approaches followed to make teaching in pharmacology more student centered. This type of tutorial requires more contribution from the students to conduct it with their active involvement. Framing MCQs for a given topic requires the student to read the topic thoroughly and to understand the most important aspects about individual topic in a better way. Furthermore, discussing every option of the MCQs helps improve the reasoning skills of the students. As the students make the presentation using power point, this provides them an opportunity to improve their communication skills.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Such student-generated learning issues could serve as critical determinants for self-learning and improve their analytical skills.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] These characteristics of SLOT, challenge the Student&#x02019;s thinking, enabling them to master their subject, develop independence, and become problem solvers, critical thinkers, and lifelong learners which are essential for dealing with real-world clinical problems and patient care.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Communication skills are improved as the students interact with their teammates and the rest of the class while constructing and presenting the MCQs. By working in a group, students tend to gain qualities such as teamwork, leadership, professionalism, and cooperation.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>SLOT has certain advantages over CTs as a teaching method such as enhanced interest among learners, increased ability to learn independently, and helps them achieve the learning objectives.
