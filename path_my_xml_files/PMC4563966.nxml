The attenuation of perioperative pathophysiology that occurs during surgery through reduction of nociceptive input to the CNS and optimization of perioperative analgesia may decrease complications and facilitate recovery during the immediate postoperative period[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and after discharge from the hospital. Attenuation of postoperative pain, especially with certain types of analgesic regimens, may decrease perioperative morbidity and mortality.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Uncontrolled postoperative pain may activate the sympathetic nervous system and thereby contribute to morbidity or mortality. Sympathetic activation may increase myocardial oxygen consumption, which may be important in the development of myocardial ischemia and infarction,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and may decrease myocardial oxygen supply through coronary vasoconstriction and attenuation of local metabolic coronary vasodilation.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Postoperative pain relief is a growing concern for an anesthesiologist as an uneventful postoperative period makes surgery a comfortable proposition for surgical patients.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Spinal anesthesia was introduced into clinical practice by Karl August Bier in 1898.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Unlike spinal opioids, clonidine does not produce pruritis or respiratory depression. It also prolongs the necessary blockade[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and reduces the amount or concentration of local anesthetic required to produce postoperative analgesia.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Spinal anesthesia is popular and commonly used worldwide. The advantages of an awake patient, minimal drug cost and rapid patient turnover has made this a method of choice for many surgical procedures. These advantages are sometimes offset by relatively short duration of action and complain of postoperative pain. Intrathecal clonidine is being extensively evaluated in last 25 years as an alternative to neuraxial opioids for control of pain and has proven to be a potent analgesic. Dexmedetomidine is a new highly selective, an alpha 2 adrenergic receptor agonist. It has an alpha 2/alpha 1 selectivity ratio which is 8 times higher than that of clonidine. The present study is aimed at evaluating the efficacy of the use of intrathecal clonidine and dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant to hyperbaric bupivacaine in providing better intraoperative and postoperative analgesia and hemodynamic stability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This clinical study was conducted on 150 adult patients of American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) physical status 1 and 2 in the age group of 18 to 60 years of either sex posted for elective lower limb surgeries under spinal anesthesia after taking informed consent and ethical clearance at KVG Medical College, Sullia between December 2011 and December 2013.</p><p>Patients were randomly divided on an alternative basis into three groups of 50 each:</p><p>

It has the definitive advantage that profound nerve block can be produced in a large part of the body by the relatively simple injection of a small amount of local anesthetic.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] An ideal local anesthetic agent used in spinal anesthesia in lower limb surgeries should have rapid onset of action, intense analgesia, adequate motor blockade, long duration of action, adequate postoperative analgesia though for limited duration and minimal cardiovascular changes. Kalso <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and Post <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] showed that a 1:10 dose ratio between intrathecal dexmedetomidine and clonidine produced a similar effect in animal models. Asano <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] showed that the potency of epidurally administered alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists was well correlated with their binding affinity to spinal alpha 2-adrenoreceptors. The binding affinity of dexmedetomidine compared with clonidine is approximately 1:10. Thus, it hypothesized that 3 &#x003bc;g of intrathecal dexmedetomidine might be equipotent to 30 &#x003bc;g of intrathecal clonidine. Several studies have been done using different doses of clonidine (15&#x02013;300 &#x003bc;g) and dexmedetomidine in order to determine the most effective intrathecal administration with minimal side effects. In our study, 50 &#x003bc;g of clonidine and 5 &#x003bc;g of dexmedetomidine were used, as it was found that the incidence of side effects increased with larger doses. In this clinical study, 150 patients in age group between 18 and 60 years, posted for various elective lower limb surgeries belonging to ASA physical status I and II selected. Highest dose of intrathecal dexmedetomidine used in animal studies was 100 &#x003bc;g.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Konakci <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] reported white matter injury in rats when high dose epidural dexmedetomidine (6 &#x003bc;g/kg) was used alone.

In an another study conducted by Eid and Shafie,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] there was no significant difference observed in the time to reach T10 sensory block, 8.7 &#x000b1; 3.3 min for Group B (15 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine), 7.7 &#x000b1; 3.6 min for Group D1 (dexmedetomidine 10 &#x003bc;g) and 8 &#x000b1; 2.5 min for Group D2 (dexmedetomidine 15 &#x003bc;g) with <italic>P</italic> = 0.67.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>In the study conducted by Al-Mustafa <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] to reach Bromage 3 motor block was significantly shorter in dexmedetomidine group (5 &#x003bc;g) (13.0 &#x000b1; 3.4 min) compare to bupivacaine (12.5 mg) group (18 &#x000b1; 3.3 min).</p><p>In the study conducted by Gupta <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] the time to reach the Bromage scale 3 was 11.6 &#x000b1; 1.8 min in Group D (bupivacaine 12.5 mg plus dexmedetomidine 5 &#x003bc;g) which almost concur with control group (Group B) of present study. Two segments regression time was, 80 &#x000b1; 28 min in bupivacaine group, 101 &#x000b1; 37 min in clonidine group and 122 &#x000b1; 76 min in dexmedetomidine group. The result of our study in regard to regression to S1 dermatome was almost similar to the studies done by different authors [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T10">Table 10</xref>]. It is concluded that the difference in the regression time to reach S1 dermatome between the groups was significant. Sethi <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] used clonidine 1 &#x003bc;g/kg with 12.5 mg 0.5% bupivacaine and compared duration of analgesia the control group received an identical volume of saline mixed with 12.5 mg 0.5% bupivacaine. Author observed that duration of analgesia was significantly longer in clonidine group (223 min) than bupivacaine group (614 min). In a study conducted by Hala E A Eid <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] shown significant prolongation of the duration of spinal blockade by intrathecal administration of dexmedetomidine as an adjunct to hyperbaric bupivacaine. Patients in the groups that received dexmedetomidine had reduced postoperative pain scores and a longer analgesic duration than those who received spinal bupivacaine alone Eisenach <italic>et al</italic>., found that addition of a low dose of alpha 2-agonist to a high dose of local anesthetics does not further affect the near-maximal sympatholysis.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Strebel <italic>et al</italic>., observed that clonidine in the dose range 37.5&#x02013;150 &#x003bc;g did not cause a significant decrease in BP when added to 18 mg of bupivacaine compared with bupivacaine alone.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In contrast, Klimscha <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and D&#x02019;Angelo <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] in different studies observed that more than 150 &#x003bc;g of clonidine added to a low dose of bupivacaine (5 mg) yielded a greater decrease in BP than bupivacaine alone. In our study the addition of dexmedetomidine or clonidine to bupivacaine did cause statistically significant decrease in the BP when three groups were compared intra-operatively or postoperatively but incidence of hypotension and bradycardia were low.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Acute pain following surgical procedures is unique to the clinical practice of pain medicine. It is one of the few opportunities in which the cause of pain is known before its occurrence, the pain is reliably expected to occur, and can be annulled effectively.</p><p>Despite advances in the knowledge of pathophysiology, pharmacology and the development of more effective techniques for the management of perioperative analgesia, many patients continue to experience distressing pain in the postoperative period. It is shown that relief of pain with neuraxial blockade with a local anesthetic like bupivacaine alone is limited to the initial postoperative period. When a combination of local anesthetic and an alpha 2 adrenergic agonist like clonidine is used, pain relief can be extended well into the postoperative period. In conclusion, this study shows that the supplementation of bupivacaine spinal block with a low dose of intrathecal dexmedetomidine (5 &#x003bc;g) or clonidine (50 &#x003bc;g) produces a significantly shorter onset of motor and sensory block and a significantly longer sensory and motor block than bupivacaine alone. The 50 &#x003bc;g of clonidine or 5 &#x003bc;g dose provides maximum benefit and minimum side effects. These doses have an effect on sedation level, HR and MAP which does not however require any therapeutic intervention and hence can be advocated as an adjuvant to bupivacaine in spinal anesthesia for lower limb surgeries. This approach to pain therapy may hold promise, that favorable outcomes such as successful analgesia may be achieved with minimal side-effects.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><app-group><title>APPENDIX</title><app id="App1"><title>Appendix 1</title><p>Bromage scale</p><p>
