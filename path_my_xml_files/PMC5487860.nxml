A minority of participants (28%) had antidrug antibodies, which were transient and appeared not to affect pharmacokinetics. Adverse event profiles were similar in healthy and asthmatic subjects, without dose-related or administration route differences, systemic infusion-related reactions, or asthma symptom worsening.

IL-13 is a 17-kDa glycoprotein produced predominantly by activated T cells of the Th2 lineage, although it can also be produced by non-T cell populations such as mast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The function of IL-13 includes inducing eosinophilic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and promoting immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype switching to IgE in human B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Initially, IL-13 was supported as a drug target by virtue of the elevated levels of IL-13 found in the lungs and sputum of patients with asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A potential causal relationship was established in preclinical models by demonstrating that recombinant IL-13 challenge to the lungs induces an asthmatic phenotype, namely inducing airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), mucus production, and inflammatory cellular infiltration, including eosinophilia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Neutralization of IL-13 by either soluble IL-13 receptor (R) &#x003b1;2 fusion proteins or an anti-IL-13 antibody has been shown to modulate AHR, mucus production, and cellular infiltration in murine models of allergen-induced asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In humans, a variant of IL-13, R110Q, is associated with asthma and higher serum IL-13 levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Several therapeutic antibodies that neutralize IL-13 are currently being tested for the treatment of asthma, including dupilumab, lebrikizumab, and tralokinumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Several of these agents have demonstrated efficacy in phase 2 studies based on improvement in lung function as measured by forced expiratory volume in 1&#x000a0;s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and/or a reduction in exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">The receptor system for IL-13 is well described (reviewed in Ingram and Kraft 2012) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. IL-13 binds to two cell surface receptors, IL-13R&#x003b1;1 and IL-13R&#x003b1;2. IL-13R&#x003b1;1 interacts with IL-13 with a low affinity (<italic>K</italic>

IL-13R&#x003b1;2 binds IL-13 with high affinity (<italic>K</italic>
<sub>D</sub> ~0.6&#x02013;1.2&#x000a0;nM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The function of IL-13R&#x003b1;2 as a decoy receptor that negatively regulates IL-13 activation of IL-13R&#x003b1;1/IL-4R&#x003b1; has been demonstrated in several settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. There are also some reports that suggest IL-13R&#x003b1;2 may also function as a signaling receptor that induces transforming growth factor &#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) synthesis and fibrosis via the activator protein 1 (AP-1) pathway in macrophages and possibly other cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Thus, blocking of IL-13 function can be achieved with antibodies that either bind IL-4R&#x003b1; itself, as is the case with dupilumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], or that bind IL-13 directly. There are several anti-IL-13 antibodies that block the function of IL-13, either by preventing binding of IL-4R&#x003b1; to the IL-13/IL-13R&#x003b1;1 complex (as is the case with lebrikizumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and anrukinzumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]) or by interfering with binding to both IL-13R&#x003b1;1 and IL-13R&#x003b1;2 [as is the case with tralokinumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] as well as RPC4046 (previously known as ABT-308; AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, IL)]. These antibodies inhibit the formation of the high-affinity IL-13R&#x003b1;1/IL-4R&#x003b1; signaling complex and also prevent binding of IL-13 to IL-13R&#x003b1;2 receptor and any IL-13R&#x003b1;2-driven signaling. RPC4046 is a selective, humanized, recombinant monoclonal antibody against the IL-13 molecule that has a high affinity and potency for both human wild-type and variant IL-13 and blocks binding of IL-13 to both IL-13R&#x003b1;1 and IL-13R&#x003b1;2; this antibody was developed for the treatment of Th2-dependent diseases such as asthma and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE).</p><p id="Par9">We hypothesized that anti-IL-13 antibodies that block binding to both IL-13R&#x003b1;1 and IL-13R&#x003b1;2 would have superior efficacy compared with an antibody that blocks binding to IL-13R&#x003b1;1 alone. Herein, we describe testing this hypothesis in an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced murine asthma model, using surrogate anti-IL-13 antibodies to block binding of IL-13 to either IL-13R&#x003b1;1 alone or both IL-13R&#x003b1;1 and IL-13R&#x003b1;2. We assessed outcomes related to inhibition of the asthma phenotype such as AHR, mucus production, and lung inflammation, as well as IL-13-dependent acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase) production and gene expression. Subsequently, we performed a first-in-human, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-part dose-escalation study (NCT00986037) in which RPC4046 was administered to healthy volunteers and patients with mild to moderate controlled asthma to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of single escalating intravenous (IV) doses or multiple escalating subcutaneous (SC) doses. Finally, the gene transcription profile was evaluated in the first-in-human study. Some of the results of these studies have been previously reported in the form of abstracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Preclinical Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>OVA-Induced Asthma Model</title><p id="Par10">The asthma phenotype was induced as described in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] in female Balb/c mice (Taconic Biosciences, Hudson, NY, USA) aged 6&#x02013;8&#x000a0;weeks with the following modification.

We confirmed the IL-13 dependence of the OVA model with two neutralizing rat anti-mouse IL-13 antibodies that dose-dependently inhibited AHR as well as AMCase, an enzyme that is transcriptionally regulated by IL-13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, b). While both antibodies effectively reduced AHR and AMCase levels, the 51D9 antibody blocking IL-13 binding to both IL-13 receptors reduced these endpoints to levels comparable to that achieved by dexamethasone and was more effective than the 48D3 antibody, blocking binding of IL-13 to IL-13R&#x003b1;1. Surprisingly, while the 51D9 antibody was effective at inhibiting mucus hypersecretion, as measured by levels of murine mucin 5ac (Muc5ac) in the BALF, the 48D3 antibody had no effect on this endpoint (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c).

In contrast, there was preferential, strong normalization of lung gene expression in mice treated with 51D9. Thus, blockade of both IL-13Rs resulted in normalization of a unique lung gene expression pattern compared with blockade of IL-13R&#x003b1;1 alone.

RPC4046 also fully neutralized the bioactivity of the R110Q variant form of IL-13 and natural IL-13 prepared from human T cell culture with similar potency to wild-type recombinant IL-13. RPC4046 completely inhibited human IL-13 binding to both IL-13R&#x003b1;1 and IL-13R&#x003b1;2 as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with potencies of 352 and 631&#x000a0;pM, respectively.</p><p id="Par21">Before being evaluated in the first-in-human trial, RPC4046 was first evaluated in the murine model of asthma by pharmacologic administration of human IL-13 and measuring effects on the asthma phenotype.

However, one healthy volunteer in the RPC4046 0.3-mg/kg IV group experienced a serious AE of worsening foot bunion requiring hospitalization for bunionectomy; the event was assessed by the investigator as moderate in severity and not related to the study drug.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par29">In this manuscript, we describe the biochemical properties of the anti-IL-13 antibody RPC4046, which has high affinity for IL-13 and potently blocks both the wild-type and R110Q variants of IL-13, and describe the binding modality that results in blockade of IL-13 binding to both IL-13R&#x003b1;1 and IL-13R&#x003b1;2. A surrogate anti-mouse IL-13 antibody that matched these properties of RPC4046 demonstrated compelling efficacy in the preclinical model of ovalbumin-induced asthma with somewhat improved efficacy compared with an antibody that could only block binding to IL-13R&#x003b1;1, suggesting that IL-13R&#x003b1;2 may play a role in the pathogenesis of the asthma phenotype. RPC4046 was safe and well tolerated in a phase 1 study that included both healthy volunteers and patients with asthma; it also demonstrated dose-proportional pharmacokinetic properties and inhibition of IL-13-driven gene transcripts.</p><p id="Par30">We hypothesized that the asthma phenotype would be differentially ameliorated by antibodies that neutralized IL-13 effects on both its receptors, IL-13R&#x003b1;1 and IL-13R&#x003b1;2, versus blockade of IL-13R&#x003b1;1 alone. To test this concept, we generated rat anti-mouse IL-13 (mIL-13) antibodies that exhibit differential blockade of IL-13 to IL-13R&#x003b1;1 and IL-13R&#x003b1;2. Indeed, greater efficacy was seen in a murine asthma model when both receptors were blocked compared with blockade of only IL-13R&#x003b1;1. Both anti-mIL-13 antibodies inhibited AHR in a dose-dependent fashion; however, despite having comparable in vitro affinity and potency, as well as exposure in both lung and serum, blockade of both receptors demonstrated greater overall efficacy and in vivo potency based on inhibition of AHR and neutralization of the IL-13-dependent generation of AMCase activity. Additionally, blocking both receptors reduced mucus production, whereas blockade of IL-13R&#x003b1;1 alone had little or no such effect across equivalent doses. Both antibodies significantly inhibited BALF AMCase, a biomarker for IL-13 activity in the lungs. Finally, the normalization of an IL-13-dependent gene transcription profile was unique for blockade of both receptors compared with blockade of IL-13R&#x003b1;1 alone. These data demonstrate that an antibody that blocks IL-13 binding to both IL-13R&#x003b1;1 and IL-13R&#x003b1;2 confers greater in vivo efficacy than an antibody that blocks binding to IL-13R&#x003b1;1 alone; moreover, these data support a distinct role for IL-13R&#x003b1;2 in mucus hypersecretion in a murine model of asthma.</p><p id="Par31">Several explanations for the greater efficacy observed with the dual R&#x003b1;1/R&#x003b1;2 blocking antibody were explored. The simplest explanation was that this antibody had greater penetration into the target tissue, the lung, owing to inherent properties of the protein and this was explored by measuring the exposure of the antibody in both the serum and the BALF. A similar concentration of the two antibodies was observed in serum and the BALF, indicating that this was not the cause of the differential effect on the asthma phenotype. Both antibodies were the same isotype and therefore the differences could not be accounted for with differential Fc effector functions. This led us to explore additional potential explanations related to blocking IL-13 binding to one or both of its receptors, IL-13R&#x003b1;1 and IL-13R&#x003b1;2. It is well established that IL-13 binds to IL-13R&#x003b1;1 which then recruits the IL-4R&#x003b1;, triggering STAT3-dependent signaling. The role of IL-13R&#x003b1;2 is less clear. IL-13R&#x003b1;2 has been shown to function as a decoy receptor that binds and neutralizes IL-13 in vivo. In mice, the circulating levels of IL-13R&#x003b1;2 are quite high; this has been shown in many animal models, mostly through the use of IL-13R&#x003b1;2 knockout approaches, which lead to increased levels of IL-13 and exacerbation of IL-13-driven phenotypes including fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A direct role of IL-13R&#x003b1;2 has been demonstrated to promote the fibrotic phenotype in a bleomycin-induced model of lung fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. These authors demonstrated increased TGF-&#x003b2; production in macrophages that was dependent on IL-13R&#x003b1;2 through an AP-1-dependent mechanism. Blockade of IL-13R&#x003b1;2 in vivo with siRNA resulted in a reduction of TGF-&#x003b2; and fibrosis. We interrogated the murine asthma model for differential regulation of TGF-&#x003b2; and did not find any evidence of differential modulation of that pathway (data not shown). It is possible that blocking a potential IL-13R&#x003b1;2 signaling pathway in the OVA-induced asthma model is contributing to the enhanced efficacy, perhaps through regulation of goblet cell hyperplasia. However, it is also possible that blockade of IL-13 to IL-13R&#x003b1;2 preserves the decoy function of the circulating IL-13R&#x003b1;2 in the mice. Interestingly, the function of IL-13R&#x003b1;2 in human biology is much less well understood. While it may certainly serve as a decoy receptor, it is predominantly cell-associated, with little soluble IL-13R&#x003b1;2 present in the serum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Nonetheless, an antibody such as RPC4046 that blocks binding of IL-13 to IL-13R&#x003b1;2 will preserve the decoy function of this receptor. It has also been suggested that IL-13R&#x003b1;2 may play a role in the clearance of IL-13 by promoting cellular uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] which was supported by a dose-dependent increase in serum IL-13 levels in healthy subjects dosed with IMA-026 (type 2: R&#x003b1;1/&#x003b1;2 blocker), whereas accumulation of IL-13 was more modest in subjects dosed with anrukinzumab (type 3: blocks recruitment of IL-4R&#x003b1;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Although serum IL-13 levels were not measured in this phase 1 study herein, pharmacodynamic measurements of IL-13-induced gene signatures demonstrated neutralization of IL-13 pathway with RPC4046.</p><p id="Par32">These murine asthma nonclinical data led to the development of the selective, high-affinity humanized anti-IL-13 monoclonal antibody RPC4046, which blocks binding of both wild-type and variant human IL-13 to both IL-13R&#x003b1;1 and IL-13R&#x003b1;2. Similar to the data generated with the surrogate antibody 51D9, RPC4046 administered before challenge with human recombinant IL-13 in a murine model of asthma inhibited both AHR and IL-13-dependent gene expression in the BALF, including Muc5ac levels by 70.7% and AMCase activity by 54.2% (Supplemental Fig.&#x000a0;2). Thus, inhibiting IL-13 binding to both IL-13Rs with either 51D9 or RPC4046 effectively inhibited the asthma phenotype in rodent models. Furthermore, 90% inhibition of IL-13-induced AMCase could be seen at an RPC4046 exposure of 151&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL, indicating a high systemic exposure was needed to obtain full inhibition of IL-13 in the lung. Finally, the R110Q variant is associated with the prevalence of asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and has also been shown to associate with IL-13R&#x003b1;2 slower than wild type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. This raises the possibility that patients with this variant may be less able to neutralize pathogenic IL-13 with IL-13R&#x003b1;2 and could therefore benefit from an antibody that neutralizes the variant form of IL-13.</p><p id="Par33">In the first-in-human study, RPC4046 demonstrated a PK profile consistent with the low clearance and small volume of distribution of an IgG1 in healthy volunteers and in patients with mild to moderate controlled asthma. Following a single IV infusion or multiple SC injections over the tested dose range, the PK of RPC4046 appeared similar in healthy volunteers and asthma patients. The absolute bioavailability following SC administration was approximately 70%, and the mean terminal elimination half-life was similar (~16&#x02013;27&#x000a0;days) with either administration route. With a single IV infusion, the systemic exposure (AUC and <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub>) to RPC4046 increased in a dose-proportional manner over the range of 0.3 to 10&#x000a0;mg/kg for healthy volunteers; however, for patients with mild to moderate controlled asthma, AUC and<italic> C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> increased in a slightly more (30&#x02013;40%) than dose-proportional manner over the same 33-fold dose range. For asthma patients administered three weekly SC doses, RPC4046 PK was dose-proportional between the 0.3- and 3-mg/kg doses. The accumulation of RPC4046 was as expected given its half-life: about threefold following three weekly SC doses.</p><p id="Par34">Although 27.8% of participants had measurable ADAs following either IV or SC RPC4046 dosing, it is difficult to compare the relative immunogenicity of this agent to other biologics, as the assays utilized to measure the response vary greatly in sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], resulting in increased ability to detect low-titer ADAs. Importantly, the ADA response in this phase 1 study appeared primarily transient and without impact on the PK of RPC4046. Larger studies are needed to make firm conclusions regarding immunogenicity.</p><p id="Par35">Similar results were seen on IL-13-dependent gene transcription in the patients with mild to moderate asthma compared with data in the murine asthma model in that, in most asthma patients with measurable IL-13-dependent mRNA levels at baseline, those treated with RPC4046 experienced a decrease in IL-13-dependent gene transcription exemplified by MUC5AC and CLCA1 mRNA levels on day 2; this decrease was not seen in healthy volunteers. This IL-13 pharmacodynamic assessment suggests that the effects of RPC4046 on MUC5AC and CLCA1 may be specific to asthma patients, for example, being driven by an IL-13-dependent mechanism, whereas the mRNA detectable in healthy volunteers is driven by IL-13-independent processes. The limited study size did not permit a detailed exposure&#x02013;response relationship, but there was a trend toward more marked decreases in both markers at higher doses (Supplemental Fig.&#x000a0;3), with no patients showing MUC5AC or CLCA1 increases in the 10-mg dose group. These data are similar to what was observed in the murine asthma model in that 50% and 90% inhibition of AMCase was seen with RPC4046 at exposures of 10 and 151&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL, respectively (Supplemental Fig.&#x000a0;2); the <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> values for 0.3, 3, and 10&#x000a0;mg/kg IV in the asthma patients were 7, 68, and 292&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL, respectively. The paucity of placebo-treated samples precluded statistical comparisons of the effects of placebo versus RPC4046 in this study, which limits interpretation of the data. However, these data demonstrate that measuring mRNA levels in sputum may be a reasonable, less-invasive approach to assess local IL-13 inhibition within the lungs of asthma patients and warrants further investigation in a larger study.</p><p id="Par36">Finally, RPC4046 was shown to be well tolerated and safe in the first-in-human study when administered as a single dose up to 10&#x000a0;mg/kg IV in healthy volunteers and patients with mild to moderate controlled asthma or as multiple doses up to 3&#x000a0;mg/kg SC in patients with mild to moderate controlled asthma. The AE profile was similar in asthma patients and healthy volunteers. No dose-related increases or administration-specific trends in treatment-emergent AEs were observed. In each part of the study, the proportion of participants reporting a URTI or viral URTI was greater among those receiving RPC4046 compared with those receiving placebo. All of these events were of mild or moderate severity, and none were judged by the investigator to be possibly or probably related to the study drug. There was one report of infusion site pain; no AEs of systemic infusion-related reactions were reported. A review of events that could represent deterioration in asthma, as well as spirometry data, did not suggest a worsening of underlying disease in asthma patients. No participants discontinued the study drug because of a treatment-emergent AE. One patient receiving RPC4046 had a serious AE of worsening bunion and underwent bunionectomy; the event was considered not related to the study drug. No clinically significant trends were detected in other safety analyses, including vital signs, electrocardiogram variables, and laboratory measurements. Taken together, these data indicate that an antibody that neutralizes both IL-13 receptors may provide an improved benefit to human asthma and that further study is warranted.</p><p id="Par37">Besides asthma, the orphan indication of EoE may also be an indication of interest as an emerging worldwide disease that shares a common T helper cell type 2 pathway with asthma and is hypothesized to involve IL-13 in its pathogenesis. Like asthma, EoE is a chronic immune/allergic disease characterized clinically by esophageal dysfunction and histologically by eosinophil-predominant inflammation, with significant local upregulation of cytokines, including IL-13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Additionally, IL-13 treatment of primary esophageal epithelial cells has been shown to induce a transcript profile that overlaps with the EoE-specific esophageal transcriptome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Although blood levels of eosinophils, eotaxin-3, and IL-5 are elevated in EoE, their sensitivity and specificity are too low to be clinically helpful, and diagnosis requires endoscopy with biopsy analysis. Esophageal biopsies have revealed a 16-fold increase in esophageal IL-13 mRNA in EoE patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Likewise, the role of IL-13 in chronic tissue remodeling resulting in esophageal strictures is thought to involve IL-13R&#x003b1;2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Therefore, as with asthma, blockade of both IL-13 receptors would potentially be advantageous in this condition, as both inflammation and tissue remodeling are thought to have pathophysiologic consequences in this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Thus, the properties of RPC4046 in blocking binding of IL-13 to both of its receptors may also make it an effective treatment for EoE. In a recent phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial in adults with EoE (NCT02098473), RPC4046 met the primary endpoint of a statistically significant reduction in esophageal eosinophil counts in patients with active EoE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">Asthma, similar to many inflammatory disorders, is a heterogeneous disease. Perhaps the most important finding for the continued advancement of the anti-IL-13 class of antibodies was the ability to identify biomarkers of IL-13-driven disease that could identify the patients who would benefit from this class of treatment. Several markers have been reported to stratify patients, including periostin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], blood eosinophil level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and dipeptidyl peptidase IV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This approach was vital to those successful phase 2 studies with this class of agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, recently it was reported that lebrikizumab had mixed results in the pivotal phase 3 trials on the primary endpoint of reduction in exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The reason for failure of one of the trials is unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. It is important to note that several IL-13 pathway antagonists demonstrated efficacy when patients were stratified for IL-13 pathway markers, whereas prior trials with agents (anrukinzumab and AMG 317) that were not equipped with patient selection markers have failed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. It is critically important to understand the differences between these trials to determine whether the inability to reach the primary endpoint of reduced asthma exacerbations was due to operational challenges in the global trial setting or whether the IL-13 mechanism is not sufficiently robust in patients with asthma to confer efficacy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par39">In summary, RPC4046 is a novel anti-IL-13 monoclonal antibody that blocks IL-13 binding to both of its receptors, generating a unique transcriptional profile at the site of inflammation that may in turn result in improved efficacy in Th2-type allergic diseases such as asthma and EoE. RPC4046 was well tolerated when administered as a single dose up to 10&#x000a0;mg/kg IV in healthy volunteers and patients with asthma or as multiple doses up to 3&#x000a0;mg/kg SC in patients with asthma, and exhibited PK characteristics typical of an IgG1. There were no dose-related increases or administration-specific trends in treatment-emergent AEs. The PK, PD, tolerability, and safety observed support continued evaluation of RPC4046 in EoE.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec25"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
