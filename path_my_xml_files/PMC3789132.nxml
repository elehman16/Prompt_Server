Given that L-CHO ketogenic diets are known to affect brain function as evidenced by their ability to suppress seizure activity, it is reasonable to speculate whether L-CHO and high-carbohydrate (H-CHO) diets differ in their effects on cognitive function under other circumstances like dieting and weight loss.</p><p>One study in obese women (<italic>n</italic>=21) who consumed either a very-low-calorie ketogenic or non-ketogenic liquid formula diet for 28 days showed that attention and information processing did not differ as a function of diet; however, psychomotor and problem-solving performance were adversely affected in those consuming a ketogenic diet, primarily during the first week of dieting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> A more recent study in overweight and obese women (<italic>n</italic>=19) showed that those consuming an energy-restricted, L-CHO diet for 3 weeks performed worse on a memory-based task but better on an attention-vigilance task than those consuming an energy-restricted H-CHO diet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> To our knowledge, only one study has compared the effects of consuming an energy-restricted L-CHO or H-CHO diet on cognitive function in overweight and obese adults (<italic>n</italic>=106) for a period over 4 weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> In this study, participants were instructed to consume less than 20&#x02009;g of carbohydrate per day for the first 8 weeks.

A detailed description of the recruitment and screening procedures and assessments used in the parent study are available elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> Each volunteer completed a medical and psychological screen. Individuals reporting psychiatric conditions, pre-existing health problems (for example, chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke), use of prescription medications, regular alcohol, tobacco or other drug use were excluded from the study. The current study was a sub-study of the larger study and only involved the Philadelphia site. All participants at this site (<italic>n</italic>=106) were invited to participate in assessments of cognitive functioning before and after 1, 4, 12 and 26 weeks of treatment and 47 participants agreed to participate. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Temple University.</p><p>Participants were randomized to treatment conditions and consumed a self-selected diet while participating in a comprehensive behavioral weight control program.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> Group sessions varied between the two treatment conditions only in the type of diet plan that was prescribed. A detailed description of the diets has been previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> but is summarized below. Participants in the L-CHO condition were instructed to follow a diet that was restricted in carbohydrate and unlimited in fat and protein. Participants were provided with information on L-CHO diets as well as numerous suggestions for meal plans. Instruction was consistent with the four recommended phases described in <italic>Dr Atkins' New Diet Revolution</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> Participants in the H-CHO condition were encouraged to consume a diet consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> (that is, 30&#x00025; of calories from fat, 15&#x00025; from protein and 55&#x00025; from carbohydrate). Participants were instructed to make changes in dietary intake that included reducing fat and increasing the consumption of fruits, vegetables, breads and cereals. Suggested caloric intakes for men and women were set at 1500&#x02013;1800&#x02009;kcal&#x02009;d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 1200&#x02013;1500&#x02009;kcal&#x02009;d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively.</p><p>Participants in the current study completed five testing sessions in the laboratory. The week 1 assessment was based on a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> showing impairments in cognitive function 1 week after initiation of a L-CHO diet. A minimum of one 30&#x02009;min training session was required before the baseline assessment to familiarize participants with the computer tasks. Together with study staff each participant reviewed written instructions describing the procedures for completing the four computer-based performance tasks. Participants were given the opportunity to ask questions and to briefly practice each task in order to demonstrate that they understood how to complete the task. If a participant was unable to demonstrate comprehension of a particular task during the initial training session, (s)he would be given one additional opportunity to practice that particular task and demonstrate understanding (that is, there was a maximum of two training sessions).</p><p>On testing days, participants were instructed to consume lunch at noon from a list of suggested foods with known macronutrient compositions (consistent with the dietary prescriptions of the group to which they were randomized), eat a standard L-CHO snack (3&#x00025; CHO, 180 calories) 2&#x02009;h later, and to abstain from alcohol. Caffeinated beverages were allowed for regular consumers up until noon on testing days. Testing was conducted approximately 2&#x02009;h following consumption of the snack to ensure that all participants were in the same fed state. Upon arrival, participants were asked to provide a urine sample (to assess ketones) and to complete a check-in questionnaire (to assess adherence to the pre-session procedures) as well as a VAS questionnaire (to assess hunger, craving and anxiety).</p><p>The STIM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> Complete System (Compumedics Neuroscan) was used, and the assessment battery included: the color and food Stroop task (attention and information processing);<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> the Continuous Performance Task (CPT, attention and reaction time);<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> word recall (verbal short-term memory)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> and the Wisconsin card-sorting task (problem solving, set-shifting and cognitive flexibility).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> Test order was randomly administered, and the performance battery took approximately 30&#x02009;min to complete.</p><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Comparisons between treatment group means over time were conducted with PROC GLIMMIX in SAS v. 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). This procedure was designed for generalized linear mixed models, also called random coefficients or multilevel/hierarchical models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> To build the models, baseline (visit=0) was entered as a covariate to ensure equal starting values between groups. Next, time was coded as 1, 4, 12 and 24 (visit months) and entered as a continuous variable. Overall trends for time were evaluated using linear and up to third order polynomial terms, and differences in trajectories between treatment groups were tested with interaction terms with dummy (0/1) coding for treatment groups. To accommodate the dependence caused by repeated measures for each subject over visits, initial models were parameterized with random intercepts and slopes along with the covariance between the variance components. Lack of significant <italic>P</italic>-values for regression coefficients as well as confidence intervals including zero for variance/covariance components led to final or reduced models with only random intercepts and linear or curvilinear (quadratic) fixed time slopes. Differences between groups were based on the <italic>P</italic>-values from the &#x02018;fixed' effects using <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>=0.05 as level of statistical significance.

Compared with the H-CHO group, urinary ketones increased to a greater extent in the L-CHO group, particularly during the first week on the diet, and gradually declined over time, suggesting good adherence to L-CHO prescriptions, which increased carbohydrate intake over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Cognitive performance tasks</title><sec><title>Stroop</title><p>The dependent measure for this task was percentage of correct responses.

The main findings from this study are: (1) weight loss has neither a positive or negative effect on cognitive function and (2) L-CHO and H-CHO weight-loss diets have similar effects on cognitive performance. Although others have reported some improvement in executive/attention functioning and memory with weight loss,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> little improvement was observed in the current study. More specifically, with the exception of improved accuracy over time in both groups on the color Stroop task, assessing attention and information processing, there were no significant differences in performance over time or between groups on tasks assessing attention and reaction time (CPT), short-term memory (word recall) or problem solving (Wisconsin Card-Sorting Task).</p><p>In the most restrictive period of the current study (weeks 1&#x02013;12), participants in the L-CHO group consumed 20&#x02009;g of carbohydrate. Carbohydrate intake gradually increased by 5&#x02009;g per day per week, depending on the rate of weight loss, for the remainder of the study. To our knowledge, only one other study has investigated the effects of consuming 20&#x02013;40&#x02009;g of carbohydrate as part of an energy-restricted diet on cognitive function in humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> In this study, participants were randomized to either a H-CHO diet (that is, 46&#x00025; carbohydrate) or a L-CHO diet consisting of 9&#x02013;20&#x02009;g of carbohydrate per day for the first 8 weeks of the study and no more than 40&#x02009;g of carbohydrate per day for the remaining 44 weeks of the study. Although there were no differences in working memory between the groups at 8 weeks, there were greater improvements in the speed of processing in the H-CHO diet group compared with the L-CHO group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> There were, however, no differences in working memory or speed of processing between groups after 12 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> Those data along with findings from the current study suggest an overall minimal impact of L-CHO weight-loss diets prescribing 20&#x02009;g of carbohydrate per day or more on cognitive function. It is important to note that these findings are limited to relatively healthy, overweight and obese, middle-aged adults and to the cognitive processes assessed in these studies.</p><p>Other studies suggest that L-CHO diets restricting carbohydrate intake to less than 20&#x02009;g per day can affect performance in both positive and negative directions depending on the cognitive function assessed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> One non-randomized study, in which participants completely withdrew from carbohydrates for the first week of the study, consumed 5&#x02013;8&#x02009;g of carbohydrate during the second week, and consumed 10&#x02013;16&#x02009;g of carbohydrate during the final week of the study, showed that individuals consuming L-CHO diets displayed faster reaction times on the CPT than those consuming a H-CHO diet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> (that is, Dietary Guidelines for Americans).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> In contrast, performance on memory tasks was worse in the L-CHO group compared with the H-CHO group. In addition, participants consuming a H-CHO diet displayed a practice effect over time and consistently responded faster to non-food words compared with food words on the Stroop task, whereas those consuming a L-CHO diet did not show a consistent practice effect and displayed little difference in reaction time as a function of word type. In another randomized study that prescribed either a H-CHO diet (that is, 52&#x00025; carbohydrate) or a L-CHO diet consisting of 10&#x02009;g of carbohydrate a day, no differences in performance were observed between groups at any time on the Stroop task or another task requiring sustained attention (digit vigilance task) but participants consuming the L-CHO diet performed worse on a task requiring mental flexibility (trail making task) between baseline and week 1 on the diet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> These studies suggest that under conditions of more severe carbohydrate restriction, cognitive performance can either be enhanced or impaired depending on the type or complexity of the task.</p><p>This study had several strengths including a randomized design and dietary conditions (that is, self-selected foods, dietary prescriptions that followed popular weight-reducing diet strategies) that simulated a real-life setting. As such, the present findings can be more easily generalized to similar populations in the real world. In addition, all participants were given a standardized snack at a set time to ensure that they were all in the same metabolic state during testing. Further, weight loss was the same between groups so there was no confound of differential weight loss between the groups. Despite these strengths, the study has several weaknesses including a small sample size and a limited array of cognitive tasks. Larger sample sizes would allow for a greater diversity in participants (that is, ethnic background, age and so on) and a better ability to detect subtle differences in cognitive performance between groups. It is also possible that the testing parameters in this study were not stringent enough to tease out differences in cognitive performance or elicit differential responding between groups. Previous research has shown poorer performance on complex cognitive tasks but not on more basic cognitive tasks following L-CHO intake.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> A larger array of cognitive tasks would provide a better understanding of the types of mental functioning that can potentially be affected by diets with different macronutrient compositions. Although it is possible that the initial training session raised baseline performance, which might make it difficult to detect changes in subsequent performance, we do not feel that it made a significant impact because of the brevity of the training session.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, these findings suggest that individuals participating in a 6-month behavioral weight-loss program randomized to either a L-CHO (that is, <italic>Dr Atkins' New Diet Revolution</italic>) or a H-CHO (that is, Dietary Guidelines for Americans) diet experienced similar effects on cognitive performance. Performance on the color Stroop task improved over time in all participants but there were no differences in performance between groups. There were no differences in performance over time or between groups on any other task (that is, the food Stroop, CPT, Word recall or Wisconsin Card Sorting task).</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by NIH grant &#x00023; RO1 AT1103.</p></ack><notes><p>S Klein is a stockholder for Aspire Bariatrics, is on the Advisory Board and/or is a consultant for Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Vivus, Aspire Baratins and ExpressScripts, is a member of Merck's speakers bureau and receives endowments from Atkins Foundation Charitable Trust and the Kilo Foundation.
