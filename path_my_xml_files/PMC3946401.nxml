All patients requiring mechanical ventilation for at least 48 h, and included in a previous randomized controlled trial were eligible for this study, provided that at least one tracheal aspirate was available for &#x003b1;-amylase measurement. As part of the initial trial, pepsin was quantitatively measured in all tracheal aspirates during a 48-h period. All tracheal aspirates were frozen, allowing subsequent measurement of &#x003b1;-amylase for the purpose of the current study. Microaspiration was defined as the presence of at least one positive tracheal aspirate for pepsin (&#x0003e;200 ng.mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). Abundant microaspiration was defined as the presence of pepsin at significant level in &#x0003e;74% of tracheal aspirates.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Amylase was measured in 1055 tracheal aspirates, collected from 109 patients.

This procedure is associated with several complications, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and tracheal ischemic lesions <xref rid="pone.0090851-Touat1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Although the incidence of VAP has probably decreased in the United States <xref rid="pone.0090851-Dudeck1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, this infection is still common in other countries <xref rid="pone.0090851-Rosenthal1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090851-European1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In addition, VAP is associated with prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, and an overall attributable mortality of 13% <xref rid="pone.0090851-Melsen1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0090851-Jaillette1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Microaspiration of contaminated oropharyngeal and gastric secretions occur in a large proportion of intubated patients, and is a key factor in the pathogenesis of VAP <xref rid="pone.0090851-Metheny1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Diagnosis of microaspiration in intubated critically-ill patients is important, in order to evaluate the efficiency of preventive measures aiming at decreasing the incidence of microaspiration, and VAP <xref rid="pone.0090851-Nseir1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090851-Jaoude1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Therefore, to test the efficiency of a new device aiming at preventing microaspiration, and VAP, it would be easier to first perform preliminary studies to evaluate the efficiency of such a device in preventing microaspiration before conduction large multicenter studies to test its impact on VAP incidence.</p><p>Several markers have been used to diagnose microaspiration of contaminated oropharyngeal, and gastric secretions in intubated critically ill patients, including technetium 99 m <xref rid="pone.0090851-Heyland1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, blue dye <xref rid="pone.0090851-Beuret1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, bile acids <xref rid="pone.0090851-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, and pepsin <xref rid="pone.0090851-Metheny1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090851-Nseir2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. However, several limitations of these markers preclude their routine use for clinical or experimental studies. Technetium 99 m is the gold standard for diagnosing microaspiration <xref rid="pone.0090851-Heyland1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. However, radioactive effects of this marker, and the need to transport the patient to the radiology department are major limitations for its routine use <xref rid="pone.0090851-Nseir1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Blue dye is the most frequently used marker for aspiration <xref rid="pone.0090851-Beuret1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090851-Lucangelo1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. However, this marker is qualitative, and does not allow accurate quantification of the quantity of secretions aspirated in critically ill patients. Quantifying microaspirated secretions is important in this population, because the occurrence of lower respiratory infection is tightly correlated to the quantity of aspirated bacteria <xref rid="pone.0090851-Nseir3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. A pilot study, performed in 19 critically ill patients, found significantly higher concentration of bile acids in tracheal aspirates of patients with suspected VAP compared with those without VAP <xref rid="pone.0090851-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Further, the same group reported higher cocnentrations of bile acid in oropharyngeal secretions of patients with VAP compared with those without VAP <xref rid="pone.0090851-Tsai1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. However, further large studies are required to evaluate the accuracy of bile acids in diagnosing microaspiration and VAP. Pepsin was validated by several animal and human studies as an accurate marker of microaspiration of gastric content <xref rid="pone.0090851-Metheny1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090851-Metheny2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0090851-Jaillette2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. However, this marker has a short window of detection of approximately 2 hours. In addition, pepsin does not allow diagnosing microaspiration of oropharyngeal secretions. Therefore, an accurate and easy to measure marker for microaspiration is still needed in critically ill patients.</p><p>Recently, &#x003b1;-amylase concentration in tracheal secretions, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was reported to be a potentially interesting marker to diagnose microaspiration and bacterial pneumonia <xref rid="pone.0090851-Weiss1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090851-Filloux1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. This marker is easy to measure in routine, and is not expensive. Moreover, &#x003b1;-amylase does not present the above-discussed limitations of other markers of microaspiration. However, to our knowledge, no study has evaluated the accuracy of amylase in diagnosing microaspiration compared to any other marker for microaspiration. Therefore, we conducted this retrospective study to determine the accuracy of amylase in diagnosing microaspiration, compared with pepsin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethical Aspects</title><p>This retrospective study was performed in a single 10-bed medical ICU during an 11-month period.

Patients were excluded if they (a) were already enrolled in another trial, (b) had a contraindication for semirecumbent position, (c) had a contraindication for enteral nutrition, (d) had already undergone mechanical ventilation for &#x0003e;48 h at the time of screening for eligibility, (e) were admitted to the ICU with prior tracheostomy.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study Population</title><p>All study patients were intubated and mechanically ventilated for at least 48 hours. All tracheal tubes used in this study were high-volume low-pressure, and polyvinyl chloride-cuffed. Tracheal tube size was 7.5, and 8 in women and men; respectively. Tracheal cuff pressure was kept around 25 cmH<sub>2</sub>O using manual manometer or a pneumatic device.</p><p>Study patients received enteral nutrition according to a written protocol, including residual gastric volume measurement, and feeding interruption when gastric residual is &#x0003e;200 mL. Sucralfate was used for stress ulcer prophylaxis. Proton pump inhibitors were used to treat documented oesophagitis or gastric ulcer. Continuous subglottic suctioning was not utilized. Sedation was based on a written protocol including remifentanil and midazolam. Ramsay score was used to evaluate consciousness. The target Ramsay score was determined by the physicians. The bedside nurse adjusted sedative infusion to obtain target sedation level. A minimal positive end expiratory pressure of 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O was applied to all patients. In all patients, tracheal suctioning was routinely performed by nurses using an open tracheal suction system. This procedure was performed 8 times daily or more if clinically indicated. Patients remained in semirecumbent position. Head-of-bed elevation was measured and adjusted by nurses 8 times daily (Target 45&#x000b0;).

Briefly, polystyrene flat bottom microtiter plates were coated overnight at room temperature with 100 &#x000b5;l/well from each supernatant diluted two-fold in the coating buffer (PBS 0.1 M, pH 7.4). After wash steps, 100 &#x000b5;l of goat anti-pepsin antiserum (Interchim, Montlu&#x000e7;on, France) diluted at 1&#x02236;2000 in PBS 0.1 M, pH 7.4 were added per well and incubated for two hours at 37&#x000b0;C. After washing, 100 &#x000b5;l/well of conjugate solution (alkaline phosphatase-labelled rabbit anti-goat IgG antiserum diluted at 1&#x02236;2000 in PBS 0.1 M, pH 7.4) were added and incubated for 1 hour at 37&#x000b0;C. The phosphatase alkaline activity was revealed by using <italic>p-</italic>nitrophenylphosphate as substrate. The concentration of pepsin in the tracheal aspirates was calculated from a standard calibration curve. Pepsin (EC 3.4.23.1) standards (25&#x02013;400 ng/ml) were prepared by serial dilutions of a stock porcine gastric mucosa pepsin solution (100 &#x000b5;g/ml) (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in the coating buffer. The concentration of the stock solution used for standards was determined by means of the extinction coefficient of pepsin (E<sub>mM&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;</sub>51.3 at 278 nm). Pepsin was considered as positive at 200 ng/mL (25&#x000d7;8). Tracheal aspirates were very thick in several patients.

(2) Mean &#x003b1;-amylase level, and percentage of tracheal aspirates were significantly higher in patients with microaspiration, and in patients with abundant microaspiration compared with those with no microaspiration. (3) No significant difference was found in mean &#x003b1;-amylase level, and percentage of tracheal aspirates between patients with microaspiration and those with abundant microaspiration. (4) &#x003b1;-amylase was significantly correlated with pepsin, although this correlation was weak.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to evaluate accuracy of &#x003b1;-amylase in diagnosing microaspiration in a large number of tracheal aspirates of critically-ill patients. Recently, two observational studies suggested that &#x003b1;-amylase measurement could be helpful in diagnosing aspiration pneumonia <xref rid="pone.0090851-Weiss1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, and microaspiration <xref rid="pone.0090851-Filloux1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> in critically-ill patients. Weiss and colleagues measured &#x003b1;-amylase in 296 BAL specimen from 280 patients with at least one risk factor for aspiration <xref rid="pone.0090851-Weiss1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. BAL amylase concentration increased with number of preintubation risk factors for aspiration. In addition, BAL amylase was significantly higher in patients with bacterial pneumonia. However, the ability of amylase in predicting bacterial pneumonia was moderate (area under the receiver operator curve 0.67 [95% CI 0.65&#x02013;0.75]). Filloux and colleagues determined accuracy of &#x003b1;-amylase in diagnosing microaspiration in 26 patients intubated for &#x0003e;48 h (at high risk group), and 12 non intubated patients requiring BAL for different reasons (no microaspiration group) <xref rid="pone.0090851-Filloux1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Tracheal amylase was significantly lower in the control group compared with the intubated group, and amylase gradually increased from tracheal, to subglottic, and oral samples. Interestingly, the cut-off value for &#x003b1;-amylase to diagnose microaspiration found in our study (1685 UI.L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) was in line with that reported by these authors (1832 UI.L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), in spite of different definition used for microaspiration.</p><p>The advantages in using &#x003b1;-amylase as a marker for microaspiration, compared with other markers are that &#x003b1;-amylase measurement is rapid, easy to perform, and cheap. However, the main drawback in using this marker is that microaspiration of gastric contents is not detected by &#x003b1;-amylase. The gastropulmonary route for entry of bacteria into the lower respiratory tract could be important in some patients <xref rid="pone.0090851-Niederman1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The role of the stomach in microaspiration of contaminated secretions and subsequent VAP has been debated for a long period of time <xref rid="pone.0090851-Bonten1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. However, a prospective study using phenotyping of all bacterial strains isolated in oral, gastric, tracheal secretions, and BAL found both routes to be important in the pathogenesis of VAP <xref rid="pone.0090851-GarrousteOrgeas1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>Several factors could explain the poor performance of &#x003b1;-amylase in diagnosing microaspiration, and in differentiating abundant microaspiration from microaspiration. First, whilst &#x003b1;-amylase is a marker for microaspiration of oropharyngeal secretions, pepsin is a marker for microaspiration of gastric contents. In some patients, microaspiration of oropharyngeal secretions without microaspiration of gastric contents could have occurred. Second, the viscosity of oropharyngeal secretions and gastric contents is clearly different. Previous studies found viscosity to be an important factor influencing microaspiration of subglottic secretions through tracheal cuff <xref rid="pone.0090851-Winklmaier1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Third, the detection window is different between these two markers, up to 72 hours for &#x003b1;-amylase <xref rid="pone.0090851-Weiss1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> versus few hours for pepsin <xref rid="pone.0090851-Metheny1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Therefore, the use of pepsin as a gold standard in our study has probably negatively affected the accuracy of &#x003b1;-amylase in diagnosing microaspiration.</p><p>Whilst COPD was associated with significantly higher rates of abundant microaspiration, immunosuppression was associated with significantly lower rates of microaspiration. COPD was identified as a risk factor for altered interaction between breathing and deglutition, resulting in deglutition abnormalities, and a higher risk for aspiration in this population <xref rid="pone.0090851-Gross1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090851-Cvejic1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. We compared factors that might have influenced microaspiration between patients with immunosuppression and those without immunosuppression (data not shown). The only significant difference between the two groups was younger age in immunosuppressed patients compared with those without immunosuppression. Advanced age was previously identified as a risk factor for aspiration and subsequent pneumonia <xref rid="pone.0090851-Marik1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0090851-ElSolh1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. However, the association between COPD, immunosuppression, and microaspiration was only found in univariate analysis, and a cause-to-effect relationship could not be confirmed.</p><p>Our study has some limitations. First, it was a retrospective single-center study. However, all data were prospectively collected. Second, markers for microaspiration were not measured during the whole period of mechanical ventilation. However, these measurements were performed during 48 h, representing 25% of median total duration of mechanical ventilation in study patients. Third, whilst the definition of microaspiration as the presence of pepsin at significant level in at least one tracheal aspirate is probably accurate, this definition only applies to microaspiration of gastric contents. Therefore, if another gold standard had been used, a better accuracy of &#x003b1;-amylase in diagnosing microaspiration could have been found. Further, the cut-off of 1688 UI.L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> was based on the best sensitivity and specificity of &#x003b1;-amylase for diagnosing microaspiration in the same population. This might have artificially strengthened the results. However, we have repeated our analyses comparing % of tracheal aspirates positive for amylase between different study groups, using the cut-off reported by the above-discussed study <xref rid="pone.0090851-Filloux1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The same results were obtained (data not shown), confirming that our cut-off of 1688 UI.L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> is probably accurate. Fourth, we defined abundant microaspiration as the presence of pepsin in &#x0003e;74% of tracheal aspirates. Whilst this cut-off is the 75<sup>th</sup> quartiles of % of tracheal aspirate positive for pepsin in study patients, this level was not validated by other studies. However, it is important to differentiate microaspiration from abundant microaspiration, because the occurrence of VAP is tightly correlated to the quantity of aspirated bacteria <xref rid="pone.0090851-Nseir3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Compared with pepsin, the accuracy of &#x003b1;-amylase in diagnosing microaspiration is low. Further prospective studies should compare &#x003b1;-amylase with other markers specific for microaspiration of oropharyngeal secretions, such as technetium 99, in order to determine the accuracy of amylase in diagnosing microaspiration.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0090851-Esteban1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
