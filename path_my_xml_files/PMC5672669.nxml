Primary (28-day mortality) and secondary (vasopressor-, ventilation-, and renal replacement therapy-free days) outcomes, with lipid profile and adverse effects, were documented. Inflammatory biomarkers (interleukin [IL]-1, IL-6, tumor-necrosis-factor [TNF]-&#x003b1;, interferon [IFN], and C-reactive protein [CRP]), were also measured before (day 1 [D1]) and after start of trial drug (D4 and D7).</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Seventy-three septic shock patients with 36 and 37 included in the atorvastatin and placebo group, respectively.

Furthermore, escalating cost of intensive care with limited health insurance in developing countries is only aggravating the problem. These conditions continue to fuel search for new adjunctive therapies in septic shock to reduce mortality, cost of therapy, and length of stay.</p><p>Statins (hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties capable of attenuating inflammatory response in sepsis.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Their lipid-lowering capabilities have been well acknowledged specifically in patients at risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events. Pleiotropic properties of statins in the prevention and mitigation of sepsis have also been intensely investigated. In a meta-analysis of 26 observational studies on infection and sepsis, statins were associated with a significant decrease in mortality.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] However, in stark contrast to these observational studies, the meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on this issue did not report any survival benefit.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Despite superiority over observational studies, existing RCTs are also limited by profound variability. The variability exists in dose, duration, and type of statin, primary and secondary outcomes, severity of sepsis, prior statin use, and nonuniform quantification of adverse effects of statins. Furthermore, impact of statins in an exclusive cohort of septic shock has never been previously studied. To test the hypothesis that statins have survival benefit in septic shock, we conducted a prospective randomized double-blinded phase II trial with treatment (atorvastatin) and control (placebo) arm. The present study has used the older definitions of sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock as were prevalent at the time of conception, design, implementation, and completion of the study.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>P<sc>ATIENTS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>The study was conducted in a tertiary care referral hospital and academic institute in north of India.

Randomization was performed in 1:1 ratio using a computer-generated random number list (conducted by a person not involved in the study). Trial packs of drug were prepared by an independent pharmacy and contained atorvastatin or an equally matched placebo in size, shape, color, and weight. Allocation concealment was by sealed opaque envelopes. Participants, caregivers, investigators, and outcome assessors were all blinded to the study group assignment.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Study protocol and intervention</title><p>The patients were included in the study within 24 h of having met the inclusion criteria. Trial drug was administered through nasogastric tube after randomization and was continued daily for 7 days of ICU admission, discharge, or death whichever occurred earlier. Patients were treated with either 40 mg of atorvastatin or placebo. Patients received the first trial drug dose at the earliest opportunity (but not exceeding 24 h) of randomization. The trial drug was dissolved in 20 ml of distilled water before being given enterally.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Data collection</title><p>All patients' data were codified and stored using a study identification number on a single computer in a protected database. Basic demographic data included age, gender, coexisting medical conditions, concurrent medications, and severity scores (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II [APACHE-II] score and sequential organ failure assessment [SOFA] score). Life support measures and other ICU interventions, vasopressors (type, dose, and duration), invasive ventilation (ventilation support, PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio, and PaCO<sub>2</sub>), and renal replacement therapy (RRT) (modality &#x000b1; diuretics [dose]) were recorded. Physiological parameters of hemodynamics (heart rate and mean arterial pressure [mmHg], central venous oxygen saturation [%]) and lactate [mg/dL]), acid&#x02013;base status, urinary output, and fluid balance were also recorded. Baseline biochemical measurements including lipid profile, CK, liver function tests, complete blood count, renal function tests (serum creatinine [Scr], blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), arterial blood gas (pH, PaO<sub>2</sub>, PaCO<sub>2</sub>, Na+, K+, Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>), procalcitonin, and cultures were recorded. Blood samples were collected before (day 1 [D1]) and after (D4 and D7) starting of trial drug for the measurement of inflammatory biomarkers interleukin (IL)-1, 6, tumor-necrosis-factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;), interferon (IFN) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Lipid profiles (nonfasting, total cholesterol [TC], triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein [LDL] and very LDL) were measured on D1, D4, and D7 by enzymatic colorimetric method. BD Biosciences manufactured kits with catalog numbers for IL-1 (557953), IL-6 (555220), TNF (555212), IFN (555142), and CRP by nephelometry technique on the Siemens BN ProSpec machine were used for estimation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Drug discontinuation</title><p>Each patient was assessed on the day of randomization, before (D1) and after starting of trial drug (D4 and D7) and then subsequently on D14, D21, and D28 if they survived in the ICU. Trial drug was discontinued if drug-induced intolerance, hypersensitivity reaction, hepatitis, or rhabdomyolysis occurred. The definition in our study for suspected drug-induced intolerance such as hepatitis and rhabdomyolysis was as follows: Drug-induced hepatitis was considered if there was rise in serum ALT level to more than twice the initial value and drug-induced rhabdomyolysis was considered if after starting the trial drug, serum CK levels increased equal to 10 times the normal value. Trial drug was also discontinued in the case of gastrointestinal intolerance as suggested by a gastric residual volume &#x0003e;50% of enteral intake per feed or &#x0003e;500 ml in previous 24 h despite use of prokinetic medications.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Septic shock management</title><p>Septic shock management was similar in the two groups, except for the use of trial drug.

The test statistic used was the one-sided Z-test with unpooled variance. The significance level of the test was targeted at 0.05. We assumed a follow-up loss of about 10%, so finally the sample size for each group was 31.

The flow diagram of randomization of the study population is as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. Sixteen percent (20/124) prior statin users were excluded from the study. On account of sampling errors, four included patients had to be deleted from the final analysis. These sampling errors included those samples which were inadequate in volume or improperly collected, labeled, stored, transported, or misplaced. Finally, there were 36 and 37 patients in septic shock who were randomly allocated to receive atorvastatin or placebo, respectively. As D1 represents results from baseline (i.e., no trial drug treatment), then D4 represents a maximum of three possible doses and D7 represents a maximum of six possible doses. The atorvastatin and placebo group received a median of 4 (1&#x02013;7) and 3 (1&#x02013;7) doses of atorvastatin and placebo group, respectively, during the trial week.

Pleiotropic impact of statins, discordance between observational and randomized studies, variability among existing RCTs, and limited inclusion of septic shock patients was the stimulus for this RCT. The main findings from our study were that 40 mg of atorvastatin for 7 days at onset of septic shock did not decrease mortality or vasopressor-, ventilation-, RRT-free days. However, it did result in decreased levels of inflammatory biomarkers, IL-1, IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, IFN, and CRP levels without any detectable drug-related adverse effects or toxicities.</p><p>Atorvastatin is the most widely prescribed statin with well-established clinical safety profile even at variable strengths and duration of use. Previous studies of statins in sepsis have used both higher and lower doses of same or different statins for a longer duration than in our study. An unacceptably high mortality of 30%&#x02013;70% was observed in a retrospective audit of septic shock patients admitted to our ICU (not reported). Length of ICU stay was also observed to be very unpredictable. Fear of adverse drug effects or toxicities, multiple drug interactions, multiorgan dysfunction/failure in septic shock, nonavailability of therapeutic drug monitoring in our setting, and already available negative previous studies of statins in sepsis wherein smaller doses for longer duration had been used prompted us to use higher atorvastatin dose but for a shorter duration.</p><p>In spite of the profound variability seen in previous RCTs, mortality benefit of statins in sepsis has been universally rejected by all. A table of previous double-blinded RCTs of statins in sepsis is provided in the <inline-supplementary-material xlink:title="local_file" xlink:href="IJCCM-21-646_Suppl1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e469" content-type="local-data">Supplementary File</inline-supplementary-material>. Varying proportions (0%&#x02013;79%) of septic shock patients have been included in previous RCTs.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The present RCT, an exclusive cohort of septic shock patients using atorvastatin (higher dose albeit shorter course), is in concordance with previous RCTs.</p><p>Significant earlier hemodynamic stabilization at both lower dose and shorter duration of vasopressor was reportedly achieved with rosuvastatin in the study by El Gendy and Elsharnouby.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In contrast to this, we did not observe any significant difference in either hemodynamics or vasopressor dose or vasopressor-free days between statin and placebo group. The reasons for these differences could be multifactorial. Inclusion of nonseptic shock patients, severity of illness, source of sepsis, coexisting illness, fluid status, choice of antimicrobials, and timing of onset of sepsis and start of therapy may all be plausible explanations. A higher dose of noradrenaline &#x02265;0.7 (0.18&#x02013;1.12) was used specifically in 10 patients in the statin group on D7 in our study [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. Higher severity of illness and nonsurvival explains the higher vasopressor requirements in this select group of patients. Truwit <italic>et al</italic>. in their study on sepsis-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome had reported that rosuvastatin group had lesser free days of ventilation, cardiovascular, coagulation, and renal and hepatic failure.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] However, only renal and hepatic failure-free days were significantly lesser in the statin group. Similarly, in our study too, there were insignificantly lesser free days of vasopressor, ventilation, and RRT in the atorvastatin group.</p><p>Three out of seven RCTs done previously reported levels of IL-6[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and one reported both IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1;[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] to assess the impact of statins. Novack <italic>et al</italic>. in a single-center RCT reported significant reduction in IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; after 72 h of 40 mg simvastatin in patients of suspected or documented bacterial infection not in severe sepsis.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Similarly, Kruger <italic>et al</italic>. in single-center study in 2011 reported a decreasing trend in IL-6 over time albeit insignificantly.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] However, the same author in a multicenter study from 21 ICUs in 2013 reported no difference in IL-6 levels between study and placebo group.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Our study has utilized a more comprehensive inflammatory panel of IL-1, IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, IFN, and CRP to assess the impact of statins in septic shock. It is unclear why the atorvastatin group had a somewhat higher IL-6 levels upon enrollment even though the groups were otherwise equally matched [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>]. Given the small sample size, a chance occurrence is a plausible explanation. Biomarker levels, comparable at baseline, reduced significantly in all by D7 in the atorvastatin group. These variations are suggestive of the impact of atorvastatin on inflammatory biomarkers in septic shock in spite of being used for a brief period of 1 week. Potential sustenance of this effect cannot be discussed as biomarker estimations were not performed beyond the trial week. However, the positive effects in biomarkers were not replicated in laboratory or physiological parameters both during the trial week [Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>] and during the latter 3 weeks of observation (table not shown). Plausible reason for this discordance could be that the drug dose was just enough to alter inflammatory biomarker levels but of inadequate duration to produce any clinically meaningful effect on physiological or laboratory parameters.</p><p>In the absence of plasma statin levels, Patel <italic>et al</italic>. suggested reduction in plasma lipids as indicative of treatment compliance, absorption of statins, and surrogate marker of their pleiotropic effects.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Two previous RCTs studied the effect of statins on lipid profile with differing results. The study by Patel <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] reported significant reduction in lipid profile (TC and LDL) after 40 mg of atorvastatin on D4, while Kruger <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] reported no difference with use of 20 mg atorvastatin. In our study, we observed insignificant difference between groups at baseline or over time [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>] somewhat similar to Kruger <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] However, our study in no-way explains a different effect with differing doses and duration of statins in septic shock. In the absence of plasma statin levels, the next best ideal parameter to assess the impact of statins (lipid profile vs. inflammatory biomarkers) is not yet clear.</p><p>Similar to previous RCTs, we did not observe any significant elevation of ALT or CK levels in the study population. In none of the patients, trial drug was withdrawn on account of rise in ALT or CK. Furthermore, no deterioration in renal profile was observed with atorvastatin. Large RCT of rosuvastatin in cardiac surgery patients reported adverse renal impact.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] However, cardiac surgery and septic shock patients are dissimilar cohort and the insult in either cannot be equated. Although the difference in class, dose, cohort, and ethnicity can plausibly explain the discordance, caution is still advisable as ours is a small study.</p><p>Conflicting results exist for the time course of pleiotropic and lipid-lowering effects. Animal studies report that pleiotropic effects occur earlier and independent of lipid-lowering effects.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] However, an editorial on acute effects of statins commented that that the two could occur simultaneously making it difficult to assess the relative contribution.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In our study, the effects of inflammation occurred while no changes were seen in the lipid profile [Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>]. Type, dose, route, timing, and duration of statin use along with severity of illness, drug&#x02013;drug interaction, and genetic makeup of the patient have important implications in acute effect of statins. Intracellular statin concentrations, kinetics, and role of specific drug transporters are poorly understood as of now.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Oral application may not be the best option in septic shock, but as of now intravenous formulation is not available.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Benefit of intravenous statins in septic shock needs to be explored.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. Small sample size, single-center, absence of plasma atorvastatin levels, and short duration of trial drug are its major limitations. The 5-year audit of our unit revealed that the minimum mortality in our septic shock patients was approximately 30%. Whether or not introduction of statins in our septic shock management protocol would reduce the mortality was the question. The minimum absolute mortality difference between the statin and placebo group that we desired was 30% between groups. To achieve this, a sample size of 28&#x02013;28 was enough to achieve 80% power with 95% confidence. However, keeping a fall-out rate of 10%&#x02013;15%, we estimated the sample size of 30 in each group. Hence, the actual sample size of 36 and 37 in the drug and placebo group is larger than actually required. The sample size of our study may look small but is actually not too small to justify the mortality difference. Source of sepsis has a strong impact on prognosis. Larger sample size with subgroup analysis would have helped differentiate the impact of therapy versus disease groups. Patients were received mostly during the postresuscitation phase of septic shock resulting in lower baseline lactate levels. Furthermore, the time of onset of sepsis, septic shock, fluid resuscitation, and admission to ICU did not necessarily occur simultaneously. Lactate is a sensitive, albeit nonspecific, stand-alone indicator of cellular or metabolic stress rather than shock. Higher mortality in our study is worrisome. Some of the reasons for this high mortality are as follows: delayed inter- or intra-hospital transfer of critically ill patients to our ICU from either nonexistent or poor quality ICUs, multisite colonization, inappropriate antimicrobial use, higher prevalence of multidrug resistance, inadequately staffed ICU with nurse&#x02013;patient ratio of &#x02265;1:2 or 1:3 on most occasions, nonavailability of round the clock respiratory physiotherapist, inadequate microbiological surveillance, inclusion of only septic shock patients, and nonavailability of advanced cardiovascular support systems like extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. These reasons may make our findings not generalizable to other ICUs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSIONS</sc></title><p>In statin na&#x000ef;ve septic shock patients, atorvastatin of 40 mg/day for 7 days does impact the levels of IL-1, IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, IFN, and CRP. However, these alterations did not confer any mortality or secondary benefit though no adverse effects were seen either. Hence, as of now, evidence from our and previous RCTs questions the utility of oral atorvastatin in septic shock. However, the possibility of a future large study using intravenous statins exists.</p><sec id="sec2-20"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>We received financial support for the research from Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Raebareli Road, Lucknow - 226 014, Uttar Pradesh, India.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-21" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We acknowledge the support provided to us in statistical analysis by the Department of Biostatistics &#x00026; Health Informatics, and Department of Immunology in estimation of inflammatory biomarkers.
