This is because the disease's impact on functioning and the average age at onset occur during what would typically be an individual's peak working years. While the direct costs of RA are notable (estimated to be as high as US $5.5 billion), the indirect costs of RA associated with paid and unpaid (household) work are generally estimated to be significantly higher due to high levels of disability (estimated to be as high as US $10.2 billion) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>There has been a lot of research published about the impact of RA on a person's ability to carry out paid work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Patients with arthritis have higher unemployment rates than those with other chronic diseases and have more time lost from work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Ability to work tends to decline as duration of RA, physical disability, and age increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Physical functioning, as measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire &#x02013; Disability Index (HAQ-DI), has been associated with the ability to work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] but does not fully address the impact of RA on one's ability to perform work-related tasks, whether related to paid work or household tasks.</p><p>Research on unpaid work outcomes has not been as prevalent, although the importance of understanding this area has been noted. Mittendorf and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] reported that, during a clinical trial treatment period of up to 3 years, the percentage of patients with long-standing and severe RA receiving personal help ranged from 40.8% at baseline to 48.7% at study end. Patients received the greatest degree of personal help for household tasks, followed by help for personal care. With the exception of child care, the majority of personal help was provided free of charge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Verstappen and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] reported on the household productivity costs of a sample in The Netherlands using the Utrecht RA Cohort. The cohort consisted of patients with RA at all stages of the disease. Household productivity losses were defined as housekeeping tasks that had to be carried out by formal (paid) or informal (unpaid) caregivers if the patient was unable to perform the tasks because of RA. Some form of household help was needed by 51% of patients, including 12% who required formal assistance and 15% who required private help. Females tended to require more help than males, as did those individuals with greater disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. While these reports provide documentation of the burden of RA on paid and unpaid work, a challenge lies in how best to measure these outcomes and to report the impact of RA interventions in reducing the work limitations due to the disease.</p><p>Traditionally, productivity has been assessed in the workplace. However, there is an increasing awareness of the potential impact of RA on productivity within the home. Workplace productivity is often described in terms of efficiency and output of the workplace. Worker productivity, or work productivity as it is most commonly called, is a critical part of that broader measure of workplace productivity. It is the component that is directly affected by an illness and potentially amenable to health-related interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Worker productivity is generally subdivided into two distinct states: absenteeism and presenteeism. Absenteeism, or absence from work, is generally defined as work days missed due to health problems, and presenteeism refers to reduced performance or productivity due to health reasons while at work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>A plethora of measures have been used in various settings to specifically measure the impact of RA on work absence and work productivity. Escorpizo and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] recently reviewed the measures of work productivity and their relevance to RA. The authors note that there is not yet a gold standard measure for assessing productivity in RA, but the importance of measuring it is agreed upon. The challenge is how to appropriately measure the time, resources, or units of lost effort associated with RA.</p><p>Most existing measures attempt to capture lost paid work days and some measure of the impact of working with symptoms. However, current measures tend to ignore productivity issues within the home and participation in social activities. A notable proportion of people with RA drop out of the workforce due to their disability, and yet they still need to do work around the house or someone has to do it for them; therefore, the impact of the condition on unpaid work also warrants consideration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Consequently, a survey that would measure both absenteeism and work productivity in RA patients was developed for use in clinical trials. The survey, the RA-specific Work Productivity Survey (WPS-RA), was designed to estimate the productivity limitations associated with RA on paid jobs outside the home, on unpaid work within the home, and on other social activities during the preceding month. The questionnaire was developed by reviewing the RA literature as well as that of other chronic conditions in which work productivity has been previously explored, documented, and captured (for example, migraine headache and depression). Since the questionnaire was intended to be relevant for all patients, specific aspects of work were not addressed (for example, we did not ask about the ability to lift heavy objects). The goal was to obtain an estimate of the amount of time the respondent missed work or other activities or was less functional at work or other activities due to their RA. The survey items were framed based around work outside the home (paid work) as well as inside the home (unpaid work) and other activities that might be limited due to RA and/or its treatment. Items were selected based on the desire not to overburden patients with too many questions but to efficiently capture information that might be of use to health care professionals and payers in making treatment decisions regarding RA interventions. The actual concepts captured by the items created are fairly straightforward. It was presumed that the patients would not have major problems with these concepts, which generally focus on quantitative issues (for example, days of work missed and days of social activities missed).</p><p>The objective of this paper was to evaluate the disciminant validity (that is, the ability to differentiate between patients with different RA symptom severity), responsiveness to clinically meaningful changes, and reliability of the WPS-RA. The survey was intended to capture the patient's perspective of aspects of work (within and outside the home) that are difficult and that change over time due to disease progression or to clinical interventions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Subjects and study design</title><p>Subjects for this study were enrolled in the FAST 4WARD (efficacy and safety of certolizumab pegol monotherapy every 4 weeks dosage in rheumatoid arthritis) study, a 24-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of certolizumab pegol 400 mg or placebo, conducted at 36 sites in three countries (Austria, the Czech Republic, and the US) from June 2003 to July 2004. Institutional review boards or ethics committees approved the protocol at each center. All patients gave written consent, and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Certolizumab pegol is the only PEGylated anti-tumor necrosis factor for the treatment of RA. It has been studied in three phase III trials, showing efficacy as a combination therapy to methotrexate and monotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive lyophilized subcutaneous certolizumab pegol 400 mg or placebo (sorbitol) every 4 weeks (q4w) from baseline to week 20. Patients who completed the study or withdrew on or after week 12 were eligible and encouraged to enter an open-label study of certolizumab pegol 400 mg q4w (unless withdrawn due to non-compliance or possible treatment-related adverse events). Patients who withdrew after taking at least one study dose were asked to return for an early-withdrawal visit.</p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (ACR20) response at week 24 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Secondary endpoints included physical functioning, assessed using the HAQ-DI, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), assessed using the Short Form 36 health survey (SF-36) and the WPS-RA. Efficacy assessments (ACR and HAQ-DI) were conducted at weeks 0, 1, 2, and 4 and then q4w until the end of the study or withdrawal; the SF-36 was administered at weeks 0, 4, and 12 and at the end of the study or withdrawal; and the WPS-RA was administered at weeks 0 and 4 and then q4w until the end of the study or withdrawal.</p></sec><sec><title>Questionnaires</title><p>The WPS-RA is a disease-specific questionnaire assessing the impact of RA on productivity within and outside the home and daily activities during the preceding month. It is self-reported by the patient, is interviewer-administered, and has a 1-month recall period (Additional data file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).</p><p>One item of the WPS-RA addresses current labor market participation (that is, 'are you currently employed outside the home?'). This is a strong indicator of work ability because not working implies complete loss of paid productivity. There are also normative and comparative data available on employment status. Two items capture self-reported work absences due to arthritis, and two items capture the same concept but applied to non-paid work. These are separated into full and partial days (that is, days of work missed and days with productivity reduced by at least half). Additional items capture the respondent's estimate of the extent to which arthritis has interfered with the patient's work productivity (paid and non-paid) on a scale of 0 to 10 (0 = 'no interference' and 10 = 'complete interference'), the number of days in the last month outside help was hired because of arthritis, and the number of days in the last month family, social, or leisure activities were missed because of arthritis.</p><p>The HAQ-DI is a patient-reported questionnaire that provides an assessment of the impact of the disease on physical function and disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The HAQ-DI contains 20 items divided into 8 domains that measure dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and common daily activities. Patients are required to indicate the degree of difficulty they have experienced in each domain in the past week on a 4-point scale that ranges from 0 (without difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). The highest score in each category is then summed (0 to 24) and divided by the number of categories scored to give a disability index that ranges from 0 to 3. HAQ-DI scores of 0 to 1 generally represent mild to moderate functional difficulty, 1 to 2 represent moderate to severe functional difficulty, and 2 to 3 indicate severe to very severe functional limitations or disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>In this study, a meaningful improvement from baseline in physical functioning was assessed using a minimum clinically important difference (MCID) for a change in the HAQ-DI score. An MCID in the HAQ-DI score has been reported to be 0.22 on the 0-to-3 scale in general samples of RA patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>The SF-36 is a widely used generic HRQoL instrument that evaluates eight health domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional, and mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The eight domains are summarized in two component summaries: the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Scores for the SF-36 range between 0 and 100, with higher scores indicating a better HRQoL.</p><p>The ACR 20/50/70 response assesses the treatment of symptoms and signs in subjects with active RA. Based on the ACR Core Set of Response Criteria for Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials, a subject is defined as an ACR 20/50/70 responder if there is an improvement (that is, reduction) of at least 20%/50%/70%, respectively, from baseline in the number of tender and swollen joints and in at least three of the five core set measures (Patient's and Physician's Global Assessments of Disease Activity &#x02013; Visual Analog Scale [VAS], Patient's Assessment of Arthritis Pain &#x02013; VAS, an acute-phase reactant [C-reactive protein was used], and physical functioning based on the HAQ-DI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Data handling and statistical analysis</title><p>The assessment of the psychometric properties (discriminant validity, responsiveness, and reliability) of the WPS-RA was performed on the overall modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population (that is, randomly assigned patients, who had taken at least one dose of study drug), regardless of the randomization group.</p></sec><sec><title>Discriminant validity</title><p>The discriminant validity of the WPS-RA was assessed using the known-groups validation method. Patients with lower physical functioning or with lower HRQoL were expected <italic>a priori </italic>to have a reduced productivity within and outside the home compared with patients with a higher physical functioning or HRQoL, respectively.</p><p>For this purpose, the HAQ-DI and the SF-36 scores were considered as categorical variables and the known groups were formed using as cutoff points the baseline first and third quartile scores in HAQ-DI and SF-36 in the overall population. More specifically, we compared those patients with scores in the lowest 25th percentile to those with scores in the highest 25th percentile of the population. Based on her/his physical functioning score at baseline, a subject was considered as having either a 'best' (HAQ-DI score &#x02264; first quartile) or 'worst' (HAQ-DI score &#x02265; third quartile) physical functioning. Subjects with a 'best' HRQoL were those with a baseline SF-36 score &#x02265; third quartile, whereas those with a score &#x02264; first quartile were considered as having a 'worst' HRQoL.</p><p>The discriminant validity of the WPS-RA was assessed at baseline on observed data on all randomly assigned subjects (that is, the overall mITT population). To test the validity of productivity at paid work, the HAQ-DI and SF-36 cutoff points were computed only on the subjects employed outside the home, whereas for productivity within the home, the HAQ-DI and SF-36 thresholds were computed on all subjects. Secondary analyses were conducted using the eight SF-36 domain scores to confirm these analyses.</p><p>A non-parametric bootstrap-t method was used to compare the mean responses to the WPS-RA questions between the groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This method was favored because of the highly skewed distribution of the WPS-RA scores. Bootstrap analyses were performed with 4,000 replications. A variance-stabilizing transformation was used in order to adjust for dependence graphically observed between bootstrap values and the corresponding standard error.</p></sec><sec><title>Responsiveness to clinical changes and reliability</title><p>The responsiveness to clinical changes of the WPS-RA was assessed at week 24 on the overall mITT population and was tested against two meaningful clinical changes in patients: the ACR20 and the physical functioning (HAQ-DI) response.</p><p>According to the primary analysis of the FAST 4WARD study, a patient was considered an ACR20 'responder' if he/she met the criteria of ACR20 improvement from baseline at week 24. Any patient who withdrew from the study at any time during the study for any reason or who did not meet criteria for ACR20 response at week 24 was considered a non-responder. Patients reporting a decrease from weeks 0 to 24 in the HAQ-DI score of at least 0.22, in absolute value, were considered HAQ-DI 'responders'. Any patient who did not fulfill this criteria or who withdrew from the study at any time during the study for any reason was considered a HAQ-DI non-responder.</p><p>Changes in WPS-RA responses from weeks 0 to 24 were compared between responders and non-responders (to ACR20 or HAQ-DI) using a non-parametric bootstrap-t method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. When the WPS-RA response of a subject was missing at week 24, the last available observation was carried forward provided that the ACR20 (or HAQ-DI) response status was known for week 24. Patients with an unknown response status were not considered in the analyses.</p><p>In addition, the standardized response mean (SRM) was computed for each WPS-RA question. The SRM is computed by dividing the mean change in score between two visits by the standard deviation of that change. The SRM is the most widely used measure of size, indicating whether a change was large relative to the variability of the measurements. Standard thresholds for the SRM (absolute values) have been proposed in order to interpret the size of the effects: 'small' between 0.2 and 0.5, 'moderate' from 0.5 to 0.8, and 'large' greater than 0.8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Reliability of the WPS-RA was tested in conjunction with the responsiveness by comparing the changes in WPS-RA responses in patients achieving an ACR20 response (or an HAQ-DI response) with the change in responses in patients not achieving an ACR20 response (or not achieving an HAQ-DI response) at week 24. The statistical analyses were performed using the SAS version 8.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>At baseline, 220 patients with active RA were randomly assigned to certolizumab pegol 400 mg (n = 111) or placebo (n = 109), with 76 (68.5%) and 28 (25.7%) patients in each group, respectively, completing treatment at week 24.</p></sec><sec><title>Completion rates of the WPS-RA at baseline</title><p>At baseline, all subjects completed the survey. Out of nine questions, six were answered by all of the subjects. For the other three questions, the percentage of missing responses was small, ranging from 0.45% to 1.82%, suggesting that patients had no difficulties with the items or their responses.</p></sec><sec><title>Demographic and clinical characteristics</title><p>Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics of the randomly assigned patients are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. The mean age (range) of the population at baseline was 53.8 (21 to 80) years.

In so doing, we sought to demonstrate that the WPS-RA could efficiently evaluate both the impact of the disease and clinical interventions on work outcomes in patients with RA. To this end, the discriminant validity, the responsiveness to clinical changes, and the reliability of the survey were evaluated in subjects enrolled in a clinical trial for the treatment of active RA.</p><p>OMERACT (Outcome Measures in Rheumatology) is an international, informal network of clinicians and scientists interested in outcome measurement across the spectrum of rheumatology intervention studies. OMERACT meetings 6 and 7 have highlighted the importance to patients of consideration of the impact of RA on paid and unpaid work outcomes as they represent an important component of the health and well-being of RA patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in RA have long been included in RA trials as they capture the patient's perspective of the disease process and the impact of treatments on the disease. Well-accepted PRO measures used in RA clinical trials include the HAQ-DI (which measures functional disability), the SF-36 (a generic HRQoL measure), and various pain assessments. The impact of RA on work outcomes is not currently a core component of RA clinical trials. We have thus taken initial steps to create an assessment for use in clinical trials, designed to efficiently capture the impact of RA and its treatment on work outcomes, broadly defined to include both paid and unpaid work. During the recent OMERACT 9 meeting, based on the available filter evidence (truth, discrimination, and feasibility) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], the WPS-RA was one of six instruments identified by the OMERACT Worker Productivity group as a possible candidate for assessing productivity changes in RA. OMERACT 9 proceedings are expected to be published this year and will fully describe the findings from the latest meeting.</p><p>In capturing work absences due to arthritis, we considered both full and partial days (that is, days of work missed and days with productivity reduced by at least half). Kessler and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] have used the term 'work cut back and work loss days', whereas others have used the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) approach of disability days and partial days in bed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Still others have used work loss days and days worked but with productivity reduced by half or more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Similar subjective assessments of perceived effectiveness (or lack thereof) in performing work activities have been taken in other chronic disease states such as migraine headache and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Responses tend to be based on the patient's estimate of completely missed work days and of days that they worked but their productivity was reduced. Previous assessments have asked patients to estimate their productivity at work when working with symptoms and asked the patients to estimate their productivity on a scale of 0 to 100. However, it was felt that asking respondents to estimate the days in which they were less than 50% productive allowed for easier responses that were as meaningful. Lerner and Lee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] have noted that respondents generally underestimate time lost, so this would be a more conservative estimate of work productivity.</p><p>The discriminant validity of the WPS-RA was evaluated relative to a standard measure of physical functioning (HAQ-DI) and a validated generic HRQoL measure (SF-36). Subjects with lower physical functioning or HRQoL scores tended to have statistically greater productivity losses due to RA within and outside the home compared with subjects with higher scores; 83 of the 88 validation evaluations of the WPS-RA were statistically significant, showing that the survey has properties supportive of discriminant validity.</p><p>The known groups used to assess discriminant validity were constructed using the first and third quartiles of the instrument scores at baseline. If clinically meaningful thresholds instead of the first and third quartiles were used for physical disability or HRQoL, this would have led to a comparison of unbalanced groups for the validity analysis. However, recognized clinical thresholds were considered to assess the responsiveness of the WPS-RA, in support of the discriminant validity.</p><p>The responsiveness of the WPS-RA was tested against two meaningful clinical changes: the ACR20 and the HAQ-DI responses. At week 24, both ACR20 and HAQ-DI responders reported significant reductions in lost productivity within and outside the home, whereas non-responders reported mainly a worsening in their productivity. The effect size for productivity changes in ACR20 or HAQ-DI responders was moderate to large for six of eight WPS-RA questions (SRM = 0.48 to 1.12). In non-responders, the magnitude of change was negligible (SRM &#x0003c; 0.1) or small (SRM &#x0003c; 0.3). These results demonstrate the responsiveness of the survey, given the differences in effect size seen for responders and non-responders and the similarities in responsiveness for both criteria (ACR and HAQ).</p><p>The WPS-RA is interviewer-administered, is based on patient self-report, and has a 1-month recall period. The limitations of self-report data have been acknowledged, but previous work comparing self-report data to 'objective' data from work records and diaries supports the value of self-report data as being efficient, reasonably accurate, and often the only means by which such information can be collected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Health-related work productivity questionnaires vary in the length of recall time, and there is no consensus regarding the ideal reporting period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. A 1-month recall is considered sufficient to be likely to capture events and does not overly burden respondents with too great a frequency of question-asking (as a daily diary might).</p><p>We will be undertaking future work to develop a self-administered version of the WPS-RA and to assess the utility of the instrument outside clinical trials and consequently assess criterion validity. Given the nature of the questions and the relatively good completion rates in the trial, we would expect no major differences between the self-administered and interviewer-administered versions. Criterion validity was not assessed at this point since such an assessment explores the relationship between self-report and objective productivity measures and thus determines whether responses are related substantially to actual output. This type of assessment would be more appropriate within specific workplace studies. The clinical relevance and generalizability of WPS-RA results outside of clinical trials will be assessed by defining norms for the MCID of each of the questions of the instrument.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The WPS-RA survey was found to be a valid instrument, able to discriminate between patients with different RA symptom severity, and responsive to recognized clinical changes. The survey can capture the impact of active RA and its treatment on important aspects of patients' work, both within and outside the home, and it can be used in clinical trials for the treatment of RA.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ACR: American College of Rheumatology; ACR20: American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria; FAST 4WARD: efficacy and safety of certolizumab pegol monotherapy every 4 weeks dosage in rheumatoid arthritis; HAQ-DI: Health Assessment Questionnaire &#x02013; Disability Index; HRQoL: health-related quality of life; MCID: minimum clinically important difference; MCS: Mental Component Summary (of the Short Form-36 health survey); mITT: modified intent-to-treat; NHIS: National Health Interview Survey; OMERACT: Outcome Measures in Rheumatology; PCS: Physical Component Summary (of the Short Form-36 health survey); PRO: patient-reported outcome; q4w: every 4 weeks; RA: rheumatoid arthritis; SF-36: Short Form-36 health survey; SRM: standardized response mean; WPS-RA: Work Productivity Survey &#x02013; Rheumatoid Arthritis.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>This paper was funded by UCB Pharma, which sponsored the clinical trial in which the data were collected.
