The negatively exponential profile and lack of any peaks in the frequency spectra of cyclic variation in gastric intraluminal pressure that were consistent with reported physiological frequencies of contractile activity profile suggests that the principal source of this variation is stochastic likely resulting from the effects of external events occasioned by normal daily activities on intra-abdominal pressure.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anzctr.org.au/TrialSearch.aspx?searchTxt=ACTRN12615000596505&#x00026;isBasic=True">ACTRN12615000596505</ext-link>

Latterly it has been demonstrated that the rates of absorption and excretion of the probe sugars vary significantly with time from dosage [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A body of evidence indicates that there are segmental differences in permeability of the mucosa to lactulose and mannitol [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, little work has been done to directly assess whether the osmolarities of these two sugars or the presence of substances such as aspirin and ascorbic acid, which are used in a recently developed LM test that is adapted to assess gut health, influence gut segment transit times.</p><p>The lack of work in this field is largely due to the lack of suitable techniques. Several methods have been used to assess gut segment transit times notably radiographic techniques, dosage with metabolizable markers that can be detected in the breath tests [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and gamma scintigraphy [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Thus gastric transit time can be determined indirectly by quantifying carbon dioxide in expired air after consumption of <sup>13</sup>C labelled octanoic acid [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and small intestinal transit time similarly from excretion of <sup>13</sup>C labelled glycosyl ureides [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However these methods do not directly assess the physical passage of the gut contents [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Again, whilst the use of scintigraphy may be well suited to the sequential determination of small intestinal [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], large intestinal and whole gut [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] transit times of pharmaceuticals, the technique requires dosage with isotopes such as Technetium 99 m [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Recent developments in wireless telemetry have made it possible to assess compartmental and total residence times by identifying changes in ambient luminal pH and pressure recorded during the transit of a wireless motility capsule (WMC) [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These capsules have recently become commercially available (SmartPill Corporation, Buffalo, NY, USA), are approved for use in determination of these parameters by the American and European Neurogastroenterology and Motility Societies [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and have minimal harmful effects [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The use of the WMC to check compartmental transit times in relation to passage of permeability probes is thus convenient and non-invasive [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Some technical difficulties remain, thus for example the WMC may empty relatively promptly from the stomach if ingested during the intermeal interval i.e. phase III of the migrating motor complex cycle (MMC) compared with that ingested during the postprandial period [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Hence the manufacturers advise that concurrent administration of a small amount of nutrient with the WMC may prevent this occurring. Given that no mechanisms operate within the human small or large intestine to selectively retain either solid or liquid matter [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], it is likely that the WMC will transit at a similar rate to other particulate matter and in synchrony with the liquid phase, especially during the inter meal interval. This hypothesis is supported by data showing strong correlation between the gastric emptying of a radiolabelled meal and that of the WMC [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and between colonic transit times determined using radio opaque markers and those determined using the WMC [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Hence it appears that transit times derived directly from the transit of the WMC may be as clinically relevant as those derived indirectly by other clinically accepted methods [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>The purposes of the current work were firstly to identify whether the doses of lactulose and mannitol that are used in the LM test of intestinal permeability had any effect on the transit times of a proprietary WMC, the SmartPill. Secondly to determine whether a 600 mg dose of soluble aspirin that is used to promote intestinal permeability in a recent modification of the LM test designed to assess gut health [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] had any effect on Smartpill transit times. Thirdly to determine whether ascorbic acid (a weak organic acid) or blackcurrant extract, substances that have been shown to promote gastrointestinal wellbeing; by ameliorating oxidative damage to the mucosa [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and by influencing the growth of beneficial groups of microflora [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] respectively, had any effect on Smartpill transit times. These comparisons were necessary as any alteration in the timings of the peaks in absorption of the sugar probes could influence assessments of gut permeability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Method</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>Ethics approval was obtained for the study from the Massey University Human Ethics Committee: Southern A 12/42.

Again subjects were restricted to those with a body mass index (BMI) of &#x0003c; 35 kg m<sup>-1 2</sup> so as to avoid any attenuation of the WMC signal by overlying abdominal adipose tissue and interference with detection by the data logger [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].

The randomization procedure for the order in which each subject received the various treatments was generated by a computer program. On the evening prior to each experimental session, each participant was required to consume a plain meal that was low in fat and fibre and to subsequently fast overnight. Upon arrival at the Human Nutrition Unit (Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand) each participant was given 250 ml of water to drink immediately. Fifteen minutes later they were fitted with a data-logger which was attached to a lanyard and maintained in close proximity to the stomach. They then swallowed the activated and calibrated WMC with 250 ml of one of five treatment solutions that also contained 5 g of glucose. Hence the five treatment solutions were water (placebo); 10 g lactulose (Duphalac&#x000ae;, Solvay Pharmaceuticals, NSW, Australia) and 5 g mannitol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) mixture; 600 mg aspirin (Disprin&#x000ae;; Reckitt Benckiser Healthcare, UK), 500 mg ascorbic acid (Hawkins Watts, New Zealand) and a blackcurrant extract containing 1167 mg total anthocyanins (Just the Berries Ltd, New Zealand).

It is noteworthy that the retention times of the WMCs was likely to have been somewhat greater than the maximum residence times of the ingested liquid as residual particulate solids of greater than 1mm in linear dimension are known to exit the stomach after concurrently ingested liquid [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] on commencement of phase III of the MMC cycle [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>The times at which the intragastric pHs stabilized after the initial exponential decline were determined by visual inspection of a plot of Log pH vs time (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). This enabled the half times (T&#x000bd;) of the exponential intragastric decline in pH for each of the five treatments to be determined. The mean T&#x000bd; values following each of the five treatments in the six participants required transformation in the Johnson algorithm of the Minitab 16 statistical package [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] to render them amenable to parametric analysis.

The variations in pH during the four quartiles within each of the five treatments were compared by doubly repeated measures ANOVA.</p><p>Colonic transit times were determined from the time of the commencement of the fall in pH approximately by 1.3 pH units that marked the commencement of colonic fermentation until the time when the temperature dipped sharply below body temperature as a result of expulsion of the WMC [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].

Hence it is likely that the glucose that was added to each drink in our study did not abolish phase III of the MMC cycle. Apart from the ascorbic acid drink; there were no differences between the gastric residence times of the various drinks used in our study. In this respect it is noteworthy that the ascorbic acid drink had the lowest pH (<xref rid="pone.0143690.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and induced the lowest intra gastric pH. Given that the lactulose and mannitol solution contained the same concentration of the two sugars that are used in the improved Lactulose Mannitol test for intestinal permeability [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], it is evident that the dose levels of the sugars will not influence transit times.</p><p>The mean small bowel transit times over all treatments was 4.63 h, a value that is well within the overall range (3&#x02013;6 h) reported by other workers [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] for healthy individuals, as was that of the lactulose mannitol solution (4.64 &#x000b1; 0.68 h). Both values were close to the mean transit time determined on meta-analysis [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] of 201 gamma scintigraphic assays of the passage of various pharmaceutical dosage forms in healthy human subjects. The lack of any significant differences between the overall transit times of the various solutions through the small intestine indicates that lactulose and mannitol did not alter the transit of digesta through the SI during phase III of the MMC cycle. Hence, whilst the administration of lactulose has been reported to accelerate small intestinal transit [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], this did not occur with the concentrations that were used in the study and thus would be unlikely to occur with the standardized test of intestinal permeability [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The overall pattern of rise in ambient pH in consecutive quartiles of total small intestinal transit time following ingestion of the placebo fits in with reports that the capacity for the buffering in chyme increases distally along the small intestine [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Hence the lower pH in the proximal small intestine likely resulted from chyme having recently exited the stomach; whilst the higher pHs in the later quartiles presumably result from admixture with alkaline pancreatic and brush border secretions. This pattern of increase in intraluminal pH, and hence of buffering, appears robust as similar patterns of pH were obtained with all five drinks.</p><p>The mean overall colonic transit time (53.59 h) was within the range reported for healthy individuals, i.e. between 24&#x02013;60 h [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The differences in lumen pH during the initial half of the total colonic transit time from those in the later half supports the hypothesis that increasing absorption of SCFAs generated by fermentation progressively lowers the pH of the colonic content [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>The spectral density profile of pressure recordings taken whilst the WMC was in the cavity of the stomach, did not peak at or around the known frequencies of antral slow wave associated contractions [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The regular exponential form of the spectral density curve that was found in this study is thus likely to result from a series of random fluctuations in extraneous pressure over a wide range of frequencies rather than physiological events associated with the lumen. Hence the use of the motility index to detect peristalsis (calculated from the software as log<sub>e</sub>(sum of amplitude x number of contractions + 1)/time) may be inappropriate in ambulant or mobile subjects. We suggest that the use of the capsule to detect and analyse gastrointestinal motility may lack fidelity and needs further investigation [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p>The similarity of the gastric residence time to that reported during phase III MMC [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] indicates that the dose of glucose was insufficient to terminate this activity. Hence, under the conditions of the standardized lactulose mannitol test [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], none of the agents in the drinks is likely to influence transit time through a particular segment of gut. The finding also raises questions as to whether glucose-mediated negative feedback to gastric and other on flow [<xref rid="pone.0143690.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] operates efficiently during phase III MMC.</p><p>Together the data indicate that the administration of the solutions in the expanded lactulose mannitol test does not change the temporal characteristics of transit through any particular segment. Hence, it is likely that the administration of any of these solutions will not result in significant delay or hurry of the passage of chyme and thus will not displace the peak time of excretion so as to influence the absorption of lactulose or mannitol at a given time after dosage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0143690.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 Checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0143690.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0143690.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Study protocol submitted to Massey University Human Ethics Committee.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0143690.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0143690.s003"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>Information sheet given to participants.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0143690.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0143690.s004"><label>S4 File</label><caption><title>Food Avoidance list.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0143690.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0143690.s005"><label>S5 File</label><caption><title>Instruction sheet and guidelines for use of the Smartpill data logger.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0143690.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0143690.s006"><label>S6 File</label><caption><title>Documentation/Card.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0143690.s006.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0143690.s007"><label>S7 File</label><caption><title>SOP for fecal sample collection.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0143690.s007.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0143690.s008"><label>S8 File</label><caption><title>Data Set.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0143690.s008.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0143690.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
