Cognitive performances and mood may be impaired by hypohydration and improved by water supplementation. Two surveys conducted in China demonstrated that a large proportion of adults and children drank less fluid than the amounts recommended by the Chinese Nutrition Society. The association between hypohydration and cognitive performance has not been reported in China. The purpose of this study is to explore the effect of water supplementation on cognitive performances and mood among male college students in Cangzhou, China. <italic>Methods and Analysis</italic>: A randomized controlled trial is designed to test the hypothesis. A total of 68 male college students aged 18&#x02013;25 years will be recruited and randomly assigned into water-supplementation group (WS group, <italic>n</italic> = 34) and no water-supplementation group (NW group, <italic>n</italic> = 34) after an overnight fasting, i.e., without eating foods and drinking fluid for 12 h. The first morning urine will be collected to determine urine osmolality on the water supplementation day. Cognitive performances and mood will be performed before water supplementation by researchers with questionnaire. Subjects in the WS group will drink 400 mL purified water within 5 min, while those in NW group will not drink any fluid. One hour later, urine will be collected and urine osmolality, cognitive performances and mood will be measured again. Mixed model of repeated measures ANOVA will be used to investigate the effect of water supplementation on cognitive performances. The study would provide information about the benefit of water supplementation on cognitive performances. <italic>Ethics and Dissemination</italic>: The study protocol is reviewed and approved by the Ethical Review Committee of the Chinese Nutrition Society.

Introduction</title><p>Water is the main component of human body and is crucial for human survival. Water has functions of participating in metabolism, modulating normal osmotic pressure and maintaining electrolyte balance [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-14-00966" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In addition, heat generated in the process of metabolism can be absorbed by water so as to avoid rapid increase in body temperature and there is also an important way to maintain a constant body temperature through evaporating sweat from skin surface [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-14-00966" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Furthermore, water accounts for about 75% of brain mass. It is indicated that hypohydration induced by deficiency of total body water [<xref rid="B3-ijerph-14-00966" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] may impair cognitive performances and mood, water supplementation may improve cognitive performances and mood. </p><p>A few studies found the associations between hypohydration and cognitive performances. Cian et al. indicated that heat stress and exercise-induced hypohydration impaired perceptive discrimination, psycho-motor skills, and short-term memory and had adverse effect on fatigue [<xref rid="B4-ijerph-14-00966" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijerph-14-00966" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Lieberman et al. revealed that military exercise in heat had adverse effect on cognitive performances and mood [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-14-00966" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Baker et al. demonstrated that vigilance-related attention was impaired by hypohydration after a basketball game in the heat [<xref rid="B7-ijerph-14-00966" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. D&#x02019;anci et al. showed that digit span performance, vigilance attention, choice reaction decrements resulting from mild hypohydration induced by exercise and fluid restriction [<xref rid="B8-ijerph-14-00966" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Ganio et al. showed that the mild hypohydration induced by combination of exercise and diuretics impaired vigilance and working memory, and increased tension/anxiety and fatigue [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-14-00966" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Armstrong et al. also reported that hypohydration in females can increased perception of task difficulty and degraded mood [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-14-00966" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, some studies obtained inconsistent results. Sharma et al., Bandelow et al. and Ely et al. showed that no statistically significant change in cognitive performances was observed under hypohydration induce by heat stress and exercise [<xref rid="B11-ijerph-14-00966" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijerph-14-00966" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijerph-14-00966" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In most studies, a state of hypohydration was induced through heat stress, physical activity, or diuretics, and so on. However, heat stress and physical activity themselves may have impacts on cognitive performances. Hypohydration state in free-living life was studied less, which need further studies.</p><p>Another important issue is whether water supplementation have beneficial effects of on cognitive performances. Rogers et al. showed that cognitive performances improved depending on thirst after water supplementation [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-14-00966" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Edmonds et al. also revealed that subjective thirst moderated the positive effect of water supplementation on speed of responding [<xref rid="B15-ijerph-14-00966" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In another study of Edmonds et al., it was reported that water supplementation had effect on cognitive performances, no matter with either expectancies or mood [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-14-00966" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-ijerph-14-00966" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-ijerph-14-00966" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Fadda et al. suggested a beneficial effect of water supplementation on short-term memory. Benefer et al. reported that water intake were associated with post-exercise cognitive performance (short-term memory) [<xref rid="B19-ijerph-14-00966" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, paradoxically, Neave et al. and Benton et al. demonstrated that water supplementation had no effect on cognitive performances. Backes et al. demonstrated that there was a lack of facilitation of cognition in the 500 mL water supplementation condition other than in the 150 mL condition [<xref rid="B20-ijerph-14-00966" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Different amount of water supplementation, different types of cognitive performances and different duration after water supplementation may cause conflict results, which need more studies with appropriate study design.</p><p>In China, there are no studies about the effects of hypohydration state and water supplementation on cognitive performances. Only two surveys about fluid intake were conducted. In 2009, Ma et al. conducted a fluid intake survey among 1483 adults from four cities in China, it was found that approximately 32% of the subjects drank less water than the 1200 mL/day recommended by the Chinese Nutrition Society [<xref rid="B21-ijerph-14-00966" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In another survey among 5868 primary and middle school students from the same four cities [<xref rid="B22-ijerph-14-00966" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], it was reported that nearly two-thirds of the subjects drank less than the recommended amount. The results of two above-mentioned surveys imply that large proportion of Chinese residents may be in a hypohydration state, and their cognitive may be impaired. One hypothesis is that hypohydration state will impair cognitive performances and mood. Another hypothesis is that water supplementation will improve hydration state, cognitive performances and mood. The objectives of this study are, firstly, to evaluate the effect of water supplementation on cognitive performances, secondly, to explore its effect on mood among college students, and finally, to raise the awareness of keeping adequate hydration state and promote water-related education in China.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-ijerph-14-00966"><title>2.

Discussion</title><p>Adequate hydration is crucial for human survival and homeostasis, including maintaining brain function. Hypohydration caused by a deficiency of total body water, may impair cognitive performances and mood. However, the related studies did not get consistent conclusion. There are some reasons for the inconsistency. For example, hypohydration was induced by heat stress, fluid restriction, exercise, diuretics, or combinations of above methods in these studies. However, the above methods of inducing hypohydration themselves may affect cognitive performances. Tomporowski et al. reported that short-term memory performance improved after exercise, due to the metabolic arousal caused by strenuous physical activity [<xref rid="B35-ijerph-14-00966" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]; Trezza et al. pointed that heat stress may impair cognitive performances due to the unpleasant sensation [<xref rid="B36-ijerph-14-00966" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Different cognitive testing methods, different amount of water supplementation and different degree of hypohydration, and other confounding factors may also cause inconsistent results. It is important to make the related results of different studies comparable and further study is needed to verify the interaction with a good study design. In our study, a randomized controlled design will be used to evaluate the effect of water supplementation on cognitive performances and mood. </p><p>The biggest challenge we will face with is the adherence of subjects and quality control. In the study, subjects will be asked to be fast without food and water for 12 h. What is more difficult, subjects will not be allowed to urinate after sleep until the next morning. Therefore, the principles and requirements of the study will be fully explained and anyone who fails needs to let researchers known. In order to enhance adherence, the researchers will meet and communicate with subjects every day in order to find problems and handle them timely. The reasons and time for drop-out will also be recorded in detail. To better control the quality of the study, each measurement will be monitored and managed by trained researchers. Two large surveys of drinking water among adults and school children from four cities in China has been conducted by our team, which provides useful experience and technical support for the assessment of fluid intake in our study. Anthropometric indexes, such as heights, weights and waist circumferences, will be measured twice by trained researchers to ensure the stability and reliability of data. Physiological indexes, such as blood pressure, blood glucose, urine osmolality, urine sodium concentration, urine specific gravity, will be determined by professional nurse and lab technicians with abundant clinical experience in hospital. In addition, urine will be immediately tested after collection, in order to reduce the effect of long time storage on results. Questionnaire of cognitive performances has been used in previous studies by our team and the process in this study will be conducted under professional researchers under standard procedure.</p><p>The present study design has both strengths and weaknesses. In terms of strength, first, the possible confounding factors are considered relatively comprehensive. Age, BMI, hunger, satiety, sleepiness, blood pressure, blood glucose, body area and fluid intake will be measured and included as covariates to make a more accurate conclusion. Second, a randomized controlled design will be used to reduce bias. Third, hypohydration state will be induced by the simple method of fluid restriction, which are meaningful to explain its effect on cognitive performance more clearly. Fourth, subjects will be fasted for 12 h in order to eliminate the influence of dietary on the test. In most previous studies, the group without water supplementation was subjectively considered as hypohydration group, which may be not consistent with the actual hydration state. In our study, urine osmolality will be measured in order to objectively evaluate the changes of hydration state. In terms of weakness, gender differences will not be explored in our study. In addition, the effect of long-term water supplementation on cognitive performance will not be studied. The mechanism will also not be explored.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-ijerph-14-00966"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>In summary, it is the first time the effect of water supplementation on cognitive performances and mood among college students in China is evaluated. The study should provide more useful information on the beneficial of water, which is helpful for the education related to drinking water. It can raise residents&#x02019; attention to drinking water and maintain a good hydration state among the Chinese population. </p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank the Danone Institute China for funding the project.
