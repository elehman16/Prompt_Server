In about 10% of the patients, surgery is considered after 6 weeks because of persistent pain or progressive neurologic deficit. Although discectomy at the short term produces better pain relief than conventional therapy, its advantage for pain relief after 10 years is not evident.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Epidural steroid injection has been one of the &#x0201c;gold standards&#x0201d; in the management of chronic low back pain and sciatica for over 40 years. Controversy, however, continues regarding its efficacy, with conflicting conclusions found in two systematic reviews.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] A small but definite beneficial effect in chronic sciatica can be noted,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] believed to derive mainly from a reduction in inflammation and edema of injured and irritated spinal nerve roots.</p><p>A major problem with all those studies was that the commonly used injection techniques did not guarantee that medication actually reached the desired target nerve.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Many patients with chronic sciatica and low back pain showed filling defects on epidurography due to the presence of scar tissue, which &#x0201c;shields&#x0201d; the affected nerve from the injectate. More direct application of medication, e.g., via a catheter introduced 10 cm into the epidural space via the sacral hiatus has not resulted in a more favorable outcome in terms of pain relief.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Therefore, a transforaminal targeted approach has been advocated for injection of the medication to the affected nerve root.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Clonidine, an &#x003b1;-2 adrenergic agonist, has been traditionally used as an antihypertensive agent. The large expression of &#x003b1;-2 receptors in the central nervous system, i.e., loecuscoeruleus and dorsal horn of the spinal cord, has eventually focused the interest of this drug on centrally mediated sedation and analgesia.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] It, however, has its own set of side-effects, i.e., hypotension, bradycardia, sedation, etc.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Recently, there is more emphasis on the use of low doses of clonidine due to a remarkable decrease in the incidence of these side-effects.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>The present study was designed to compare the analgesic efficacy of methylprednisolone (a long-acting steroid compound) with or without low doses of clonidine for the treatment of sciatica via transforaminal sleeve root injection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>After obtaining approval from the institutional ethics committee, this prospective, randomized, double-blinded study was conducted at the Pain Clinic under the Department of Anaesthesiology, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College Hospital, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, India, over a period of 2 years, i.e., from April 2010 to March 2012.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>The study was conducted on 180 patients of either sex, with age ranging from 18 years to 55 years, with body weight between 40 and 70kg, ASA grade I or II, suffering from sciatica due to disc herniation [lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging scan documenting a herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP) at not more than two levels, i.e., L3-L4, L4-L5 or L5-S1] and symptomatic for more than 6 weeks. The exclusion criteria were a large HNP with severe central or foraminal stenosis on magnetic resonance imaging, progressive neurologic deficits, cauda-equina syndrome, blood coagulation disorder, valvular heart diseases, hypotension, emotional instability, known history of allergy to local anesthetics, corticosteroids or clonidine or received prior epidural steroid injection or lumbar surgery. Apart from the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbosacral spine, all the patients were advised to get their complete hemogram, renal function tests, blood sugar and coagulation profile reported.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Randomization</title><p>After taking a written informed consent, the patients were randomly allocated into one of the three groups of 60 patients each using a computer-generated randomization schedule. Patients belonging to group I received methylprednisolone 60 mg as transforaminal injection, while those of group II received methylprednisolone 60 mg and clonidine 0.5 mcg/kg and those of group III received methylprednisolone 60 mg and clonidine 1 mcg/kg. The total volume of injected medication in each group was kept constant at 1.5 mL with the addition of normal saline.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Pre-procedure assessment</title><p>All the patients were assessed at least 1 week prior to the procedure and a standard treatment protocol was advised to them, i.e., combination of oral tramadol 37.5 mg + paracetamol 325 mg and gabapentin 300 mg three times a day. The patients were given a pain diary to note down the global pain scale scores twice a week (Monday and Thursday) beginning 7 days before the day of treatment up to 6 weeks after treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Technique</title><p>The procedure was performed with the patient in the prone position on an X-ray translucent table. Fluoroscopy was used to identify and mark the essential bony landmarks. No sedation was given. Baseline pulse rate, blood pressure and respiratory rate were recorded before undertaking the procedure.</p><p>Lumbar transforaminal approach was performed by placing the needle in the neural foramen, ventral to the nerve root. The needle was directed in an oblique approach toward a target point on the upper margin of an imaginary triangle, the &#x0201c;safe triangle,&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] with the three sides corresponding to the horizontal base or the pedicle, the outer vertical border of the intervertebral foramen and the connecting diagonal nerve root and dorsal ganglion. The image was adjusted until the superior articulating process was visualized between the anterior and the posterior edge of the vertebral body and the base of the articulating process was in line with the pedicle above.</p><p>After sterile preparation, draping and anesthetising the skin and the overlying tissues with 2% lidocaine, a 12-cm-long, 22-gauge spinal needle was inserted just above the superior articulating process and directed toward the base of the pedicle, and advanced slowly until the bone was contacted just below the pedicle. The needle was then slightly withdrawn and redirected inferiorly into the targeted spinal nerve canal. Advancement was made under lateral and anteroposterior (AP) views to provide a 3-dimensional spatial representation. The AP view was taken to verify that the needle was not medial to the 6-o clock position of the pedicle; on the lateral view, the needle was positioned just below the pedicle in the ventral aspect of the intervertebral foramen.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>The first sacral (S1) foramen was best seen by directing the X-ray beam in a cephalocaudad direction so that the anterior and posterior foramina align, appearing as a small radioluscent circle just below the oval S1 pedicle.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The needle was inserted slightly lateral and inferior to the S1 pedicle and advanced slowly through the posterior foramen to the medial edge of the pedicle and the appropriate depth was gauged by first striking the posterior sacral bone just above the posterior S1 foramen before directing the needle tip into the S1 neural canal.</p><p>Non-ionic contrast dye (iohexol) 0.5-1 mL was injected very slowly (at about 1 mL in 20 s) and the dye pattern was assessed. If leg paraethesias were noted as the needle approached the neural foramen, the needle was withdrawn slightly and the dye was injected. A positive image of the nerve root on fluoroscopy indicated that the needle had penetrated the epiradicular membrane. After an adequate dye pattern was observed, 1.5 mL of the mixture prepared was injected (maximum volume of 2 mL of injectate is necessary to preserve selectivity of single nerve block). The injection was given at two levels depending upon the level of disc herniation.</p><p>All patients were observed for any change in pulse rate, blood pressure and respiratory depression throughout the procedure. The level of sedation was assessed using a four-point scale;[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] 1 = responds readily to name spoken in a normal tone, 2 = lethargic response to a name spoken in a normal tone, 3 = responds only after name is called loudly and 4 = responds only after mild prodding or shaking.</p><p>The patients were discharged from the recovery room after they were fully awake and oriented (sedation scale = 1) and no adverse effects noted for 6 h after the injection of the drugs under study. The subjects were allowed to take oral tramadol 37.5 mg and paracetamol 325 mg combination as and when required during the study period with a minimum interval of 6 h between two doses. Gabapentin 300 mg three times a day, however, continued as in the pre-treatment period. An overall improvement in the patients&#x02019; condition was assessed in the follow-up visits at 1, 2, 4, 6 and 12 weeks after injection, the basis being a reduction of scores on global pain scale.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Sample size and statistical analysis</title><p>Sample size was calculated based on a pilot study conducted on 15 patients for an improvement of at least 60% in visual analogue scale (VAS).

The level of disc herniation was, however, reconfirmed before transforaminal block with the help of an MRI. MRI was also performed to exclude severe canal stenosis, infective cause of radicular pain and massive disc protrusion, wherein the patients were excluded from the study.</p><p>The modern era of treatment of sciatica initially focused primarily on surgery. However, in recent years, numerous studies have shown that a disc herniation may decrease in size or disappear in the course of a few months, no matter whether it is contained, extruded or migrated or of a small or large size.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Saal and Saal[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] also emphasized the effectiveness of conservative management of disc herniation. Fifty-eight patients on treatment with analgesics, anti-inflammatory medication (NSAIDs), epidural injection of steroids, at a low back school or by exercises were followed for a mean period of 31 months. Only 10% of the patients required surgery due to failure of resolution of symptoms. Majority of patients with lumbar radicular pain who avoid an operation for at least 1 year after receiving a nerve root injection will continue to avoid operative intervention for a minimum of 5 years.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>The lumbar transforaminal injection technique using fluoroscopic control ensures the corticosteroid preparation to be delivered precisely to the target site, i.e., the ventral aspect of the lumbar nerve root as well as the dorsal root ganglion, and the efficacy of radio-guided transforaminal epidural corticosteroid injections is higher than that obtained with blindly performed interspinous injections.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Furman <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] emphasized the need for contrast injection apart from flouroscopic guidance in lumbosacral transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI). They observed that a flash or blood aspiration to predict an intravascular injection is not sensitive and, therefore, a negative flash or aspiration is not reliable. Thus, procedures without contrast confirmation may instill medications intravascularly and therefore not into the desired epidural location.</p><p>The efficacy of transforaminal steroid injection has been emphasized in a number of studies, clearly proving the adequacy of this method. One of the earliest studies comparing the efficacy of epidural, perineural, single shot steroid injection with the conventional interlaminar epidural steroid injection in patients with lumbar radicular pain syndromes was performed by Kraemer <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] who found that patients with perineural selective nerve root steroid injections showed significantly better results than conventional epidural steroid injections.</p><p>TFESI is a relatively simple, effective and low-risk alternative to surgical decompression for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation in selected cases. The procedure significantly alleviates the severity of sciatica due to a herniated disc and improves the patient's daily activity, reducing the need for surgical decompression.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>The steroid used in this study, methylprednisolone acetate (MPA), is a long-acting steroid compound manufactured as an injectable preparation. MPA temporarily blocks nociceptive C-fiber transmission.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Also, ectopic discharge from injured nerves appears to be suppressed by stabilization of axonal membranes by steroids, and this has been shown to correlate with their local anesthetic effect.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Epidural injection of MPA seems to be associated with little risk of serious neurological damage. Even after a single accidental subarachnoid injection, the possibility of a serious complication is probably very low.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Epidural administration of clonidine was shown to produce post-operative analgesia as early as 1989 by Eisenach <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] the mechanism being activation of alfa-2 adrenoceptors found concentrated near sites of peripheral nerve injury or inflammation. Clonidine has been shown to produce analgesia when given as perineural injection. This analgesia is further enhanced in cases of persistent neuritis.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</p><p>One of the inclusion criteria of patients in this study was that they were suffering from the radicular pain for at least 6 weeks, making the condition persistent in nature. Hence, anticipation of efficacy of clonidine in our patients can be further justified.</p><p>Clonidine has been used as targeted injection in sciatica with methylprednisolone and hyaluronidase after diagnostic epiduroscopy. Adhesions unreported in MRI were mechanically mobilized under direct vision, and this targeted medication resulted in substantial and prolonged pain relief.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</p><p>Burgher <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] have used clonidine in transforaminal injections along with lidocaine and compared its efficacy with lidocaine and steroid group in their study on 26 patients who underwent up to three lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESIs) with 2% lidocaine and either triamcinolone (40 mg) or clonidine (200 or 400 &#x003bc;g) for acute lumbar radicular pain treatment. Their prime objective was to find an effective alternative to steroids for transforaminal injections. Both groups showed statistically significant improvements at 2 weeks and 1 month post-enrollment, but the steroid group noted greater improvement.</p><p>A deduction can thus be made from these studies that clonidine as an adjuvant to steroid would provide better pain relief than steroid alone.</p><p>An analysis of complications associated with fluoroscopically guided lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injections shows that there are no major complications reported and that the minor complications found also resolve without sequalae.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</p><p>Injury to the nerve root with the sharp tip of the spinal needle is a potential complication of TFESI.[<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] Huston <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] reported increased radicular pain in 8.8% of the patients while Manchikanti <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] reported increased radicular pain in 1% and Botwin <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] in 0.6% of the patients after TFESI. Some authors have proposed a retrodiscal[<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] or retroneural[<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] approach as an alternative to the conventional sub-pedicular safe triangle approach to minimize the risk of this complication.</p><p>The question regarding use of corticosteroids is due to the potential for their adverse/side-effects. These may be due to their local action or systemic effects. Although the different preparations of steroids used for epidural injections, e.g. methylprednisolone acetate (used in this study), triamcinolone acetonide, betamethasone acetate and phosphate, have not been found to cause any serious complications after TFESI, accidental injections of particulate matter of steroids into the artery of Adamkeiwicz, the major supplier of the anterior spinal artery in the thoracolumbar region of the spinal cord[<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] that may arise in a minority of patients near the lower lumbar vertebrae,[<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] can lead to a catastrophic outcome, i.e., paraplegia resulting from profound spinal cord infarction as a result of interruption of blood flow.[<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] A non-particulate preparation of steroid, i.e., dexamethasone sodium phosphate, was found to be safer as compared with other steroids,[<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] but this preparation is not available in the Indian market yet.</p><p>Systemic side-effects of corticosteroids were extremely rare after TFESI as the doses of steroids used was very small (20-40 mg) compared with conventional interlaminar epidural injections. A temporary elevation of blood sugar levels in an insulin-dependent diabetic has been reported by Botwin <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] A small number of patients have also complained of flushing of face after TFESI,[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] which was presumed to be an IgE-mediated reaction in response to steroids. Patients with congestive heart failure should be aware of possible fluid retention.[<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] Studies with other agents, which can be used as alternatives to steroids in transforaminal injections, are hence being conducted,[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and it is likely that drugs blocking tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; and other similar candidate compounds could emerge as potential treatments for sciatica.</p><p>The primary concerns with the use of clonidine are regarding its adverse effects and possible neurotoxicity. Bradycardia and hypotension associated with epidural clonidine have been reported, but the doses used in this study are significantly lower than those found to be associated with these complications. Moreover, the use of clonidine as an adjuvant to steroids in transforaminal injections has not been reported till date. Burgher <italic>et al</italic>. have used clonidine as an alternative to steroids in TFESI giving 2% lidocaine and either clonidine (200 or 400 mcg) or triamcinolone (40 mg). A rapid improvement in radicular pain was observed in both treatment groups, but with greater functional improvement in those patients receiving steroids. There was no difference in side-effects and no serious complication was reported. Differences in analgesia were unclear. As target enrolment determined by power analysis was not achieved in this study, the outcome cannot be generalized.</p><p>This prospective study, wherein patients suffering from lumbosacral radiculopathy received transforaminalepidural injection of methylprednisolone alone or with 0.5 mcg/kg or 1 mcg/kg of clonidine showed that although there was effective pain relief in all three study groups, maximum relief was noted in patients who received methylprednisolone with 1 mcg/kg of clonidine. Data of multiple previous studies can be analyzed and their inferences extended to concur with this conclusion.</p><p>None of the patients of the present study suffered from bradycardia, hypotension, hypoxaemia or sedation. The only complication observed in our study was transient paresthesia in the nerve distribution, which occurred only in 12 patients (6.67% patients), with no difference of complication rate among the three groups. At the same time, the complication resolved in all the patients within 24 h without any sequelae.</p><p>Thus, clonidine, when used as an adjuvant to methylprednisolone in transforaminal injection at 0.5 mcg/kg and 1 mcg/kg, showed a dose-dependent increase in the quality of analgesia. No side-effect could be attributed to transforaminal clonidine in a dose of up to 1 mcg/kg.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The results of this randomized, double-blind trial of fluoroscopy-guided transforaminal methylprednisolone alone and with low doses of clonidine (0.5 mcg/kg and 1 mcg/kg) in persistent pain of lumbosacral radiculopathy due to herniated intervertebral disc have demonstrated pain relief in 75% of the patients receiving methylprednisolone with 1 mcg/kg clonidine over the course of 6 months, with superior results compared with the methylprednisolone alone and with 0.5 mcg/kg clonidine.</p><p>Thus, it can be said that transforaminal injection of clonidine as an adjuvant to steroid, methylprednisolone acetate, may be an effective treatment for sciatica due to disc herniation. Clonidine is found to be a more effective adjuvant at doses of 1 mcg/kg as compared with 0.5 mcg/kg with practically no significant side-effect or complication. A longer duration of follow-up may be necessary to assess whether there is a difference in the duration of analgesia between the study groups.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
