According to the ESHRE/ASRM Rotterdam consensus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], the diagnosis of PCOS requires at least 2 of the following 3 criteria: oligoovulation or anovulation (irregular or no menstrual cycle at all), clinical (hirsutism) and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism (elevated free androgen index or elevated testosterone levels), polycystic ovarian morphology (on ultrasound), and the exclusion of other aetiologies that might cause hyperandrogenism. PCOS women will generally experience one or more of the following symptoms in varying degrees: hirsutism (excessive body hair growth), acne, anovulatory infertility, obesity, insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>The incidence of overweight and obesity in PCOS women is between 50 and 60% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The prevalence of obesity in the general population is increasing, and this might result in an even higher incidence of PCOS in the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The current prevalence of overweight and obesity is significantly higher in PCOS women, especially in Caucasian women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Overweight in women with PCOS negatively affects all clinical features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and gaining weight aggravates also psychological aspects. Women with PCOS report a major impact on their quality of life (QoL) due to PCOS symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and experience more distress compared to women without PCOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Weight concerns in particular appear to have the largest impact on QoL, compared to other PCOS symptoms such as amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, hirsutism and acne [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Obesity is also a risk factor for lower self-esteem and greater sexual dissatisfaction in women with PCOS, compared to age matched controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. PCOS women with amenorrhoea seem to have lower levels of self-esteem and greater fear of negative appearance compared to PCOS women with oligo-amenorrhea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Whether PCOS women have a unique predisposition to obesity is not yet clear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A recent study by Louwers et al, looking into the genetic predisposition for overweight or obesity, did not discover any differences in the number of risk alleles for obesity between women with PCOS and the controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Although women with PCOS generally do have a healthy diet, they seem to have a higher caloric intake and are physically less active, compared to controls without PCOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Also, women diagnosed with PCOS more often use a self-initiated inadequate diet than controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Insulin resistance might play a mediating role in the effect of obesity on metabolic and reproductive symptoms in PCOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Other authors do suggest that the high prevalence of obesity might be a result of selection and referral bias of obese PCOS women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In summary, much about the link between PCOS and obesity remains unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is still unclear whether obesity is the cause, or an effect of the disease itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>There is a large number of small (one or two-component) studies demonstrating that losing 5 to 10% of initial body weight improves reproductive, metabolic and psychological features in PCOS women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Moreover, it often leads to ovulation and subsequent pregnancy, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] as well as a reduction in miscarriage rates in PCOS women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Weight loss also reduces the risk of Type II Diabetes Mellitus and the incidence of the metabolic syndrome in the long term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Additionally, studies have indicated that decreasing intra-abdominal fat tissue in particular results in the restoration of ovulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], even when women remain within their World Health Organisation (WHO) weight class after weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Recent work from Mutsaerts et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and Dokras et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] showed different results. A mean weight loss of 4.4&#x000a0;kg following a two-component lifestyle treatment of 26&#x000a0;weeks did not result in a significant difference in live birth rates compared to a weight loss of 1.1&#x000a0;kg in the control group. Also, there was no difference in pregnancy and neonatal complications between groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Weight loss by the Look AHEAD protocol (16&#x000a0;weeks) or the use of the oral contraceptive pill shows significant improvement in both groups at physicial and mental domains related to quality of life, depression and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. At the ESHRE/ASRM PCOS meeting in 2010, a consensus was reached that lifestyle should be optimized before conception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] to improve the effectiveness of fertility treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and to improve (mental)health across a woman&#x02019;s lifespan as well as that of her child to be [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, no international evidence based protocol exists for the long-term treatment of overweight and obesity in this particular group of obese women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p>The biggest challenge in weight management programs is to achieve a reasonable and sustainable weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Many obesity interventions compare one-component (physical activity or nutrition intervention) with two-component (physical activity and nutrition or nutrition and counselling) interventions. Three-component (physical activity, nutrition and counselling) lifestyle interventions seems to have the biggest effect, compared to one or two components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Weight loss programs in general seem to be effective in the short term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]; however, most of the initial weight loss is regained within 1 year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Long term weight-loss seems the biggest challenge for the &#x0201c;global obesity epidemic&#x0201d; according to the WHO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Incorporating a healthy diet, increasing physical activity and changing dysfunctional thinking patterns in women with PCOS are key points in losing weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. However, treatment adherence is often low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and drop-out rates are high. The longer the treatment, the higher the chance for participants to drop-out, and indeed the highest dropout rates are reported in interventions that last 24&#x000a0;weeks or longer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. This relation between the drop-out rate and the duration of therapy is particular worrying, as long lasting lifestyle changes are preferred. Patients who are likely to drop out will benefit most from adherence to a long-term lifestyle program compared to patients not at risk to drop out. Fauser et al. commented that more research is needed to optimize lifestyle interventions, maximizing weight loss and minimizing drop-out rates for PCOS women with a wish to conceive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>A possible solution to increase therapy adherence and reduce the drop-out rate is support by mobile phone applications. Weight loss interventions making use of internet and mobile phone applications have emerged to induce behavioural changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. There is a growing body of literature on Short Message Service (SMS) and smart phone interventions for obesity treatment, indicating that tailored text messages are more effective than generic ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Smart phone and mobile phone applications seem effective when embedded in an intervention program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Studies have indicated that sending SMS results in weight maintenance up to 12&#x000a0;months after completion of cognitive behavioural treatment (CBT), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] and supports controlling the desire to eat and promoting an active lifestyle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Moreover, the use of SMS has shown to improve adherence and decrease the drop-out rates in weight loss treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], which is associated with improvement in weight-related behaviours and weight outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p>Fauser et al. commented that more research is needed to optimize lifestyle interventions, maximizing weight loss and minimizing dropout for PCOS women with a wish to conceive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Aim</title><p>The aim of this study is to examine whether CBT, provided by a mental health professional working in a multidisciplinary team with a dietician and a physical therapist (a three-component intervention), is effective to decrease weight, compared to usual care at the end of treatment in obese women with PCOS.

</p><p>The gynaecologist presents the patient information about the study using a patient information leaflet. After 2 weeks, patients are contacted by telephone in order to assess whether they are willing to participate in the study. In order to participate, patients need to sign the informed consent form and return it by regular mail. As soon as this form is received out our research office, appointments for baseline measurements are made.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Randomisation</title><p>At the baseline, after the initial assessment, participants are randomized at a 2:1 ratio into the following groups: 1-year CBT lifestyle intervention with SMS (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;78), 1-year CBT lifestyle intervention without SMS (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;78), or the control group who receives usual care (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;78) using a computer-generated random numbers table. A research nurse, who is not involved in the study, carries out the randomisation. Assignment is made by sequentially numbered, identical, sealed envelopes, each containing a letter designating the allocation (i.e. &#x0201c;A&#x0201d; for intervention with SMS, &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; for intervention without SMS and &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; for control,).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Intervention</title><p>The 1-year multidisciplinary lifestyle intervention aims at: 1) changing cognitions; 2) changing dietary habits; 3) encouraging and promoting physical activity; and 4) activating social support; and consists of twenty 2.5&#x000a0;h group sessions. The first 1.5-h of every group session is supervised by a mental health professional and a dietician. The last hour of each session is supervised by a physical therapist. Each lifestyle intervention group consists of a maximum of 10 patients to ensure that there is sufficient individual attention for every participant. Additionally, participants receive five individual counselling sessions of 45&#x000a0;min with a mental health professional, five individual sessions with a physical therapist and five with a dietician.</p><p>We developed the &#x0201c;PCOS lifestyle textbook&#x0201d; for participants, which describes the activities of each group session and the homework assignments. To standardize the treatment and to facilitate the therapist&#x02019;s treatment adherence, we developed a therapist manual, which includes protocols for each session. The manual also includes PowerPoint slides to present at each group session.</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>Phase 1: first 3&#x000a0;months (session 1 to 11)</title><p>We divided the 20 group sessions into four phases. The outline of each session is presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. In the first phase of the program, the group sessions are held weekly. CBT techniques are used to create awareness and to restructure dysfunctional thoughts about lifestyle (food &#x00026; exercise), weight (loss) and self-esteem. The Dutch food guide (DFG) is used as a guideline for healthy eating and is the main guideline during the nutritional sessions run by the dietician. Subjects receive the DFG guide for women aged 19 to 50 (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Based on the DFG, a healthy woman with a normal weight and regular exercise, may take in up to 2000 kilocalories in total, consisting of 1700 kilocalories for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and another 300 kilocalories for (healthy) snacking. The take-up of 2000 kilocalories in total is normally advised for weight maintenance. Hence, for most women in the lifestyle program this (reduced intake) will result in weight loss.

This resulted in 156 patients to be enrolled in the intervention group and 78 patients in the control group, a total of 234. This number was registered at the Dutch Trial Registry (TC 2450). On behalf of the Grant Foundation (MRace), an interim analysis was performed in May 2014. After inclusion of 150 patients, we applied an interim power analysis to the complete cases.

We observed an intercorrelation of about 0.90 between all measurements. Maintaining a ratio of 2:1, the required sample is 84 participants in the lifestyle intervention and 42 in the control group, a total of 126 complete cases. With an observed drop-out proportion of 40%, a total of 210 participants are needed for the study. We anticipated to have a relatively high drop-out rate, because pregnancy leads to exclusion.

Mixed modelling can efficiently deal with missing data and unbalanced time-points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. This analysis will include two levels: the patients will constitute the upper level, and their repeated measures the lower level. First, for each outcome variable a saturated model will be postulated, with the primary or/and secondary outcomes as dependent variables. The saturated models will include treatment group, time, quadratic time, logarithm of time, and all treatment-time interactions as fixed effects. The deviance statistic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>] using restricted maximum likelihood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>] will be applied to determine the covariance structure. Next, the saturated fixed part of the models will be reduced by eliminating insignificant fixed effects using Wald tests, respecting that interaction effects must be nested under their main effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. The significance of the difference between the saturated models and the parsimonious final models will be determined with the deviance statistic using ordinary maximum likelihood. The residuals of the model will be checked for normal distribution, which is necessary for a correctly fitted mixed model. Effect sizes will be calculated by dividing the differences between time-point and baseline estimations and the estimated baseline standard deviation. The definition of Cohen will be used for the interpretation of the effects sizes: an effect size of 0.20 is considered a small effect, 0.50 medium and 0.80 a large effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Discussion</title><p>This paper outlines the protocol of a study evaluating the effectiveness of an intensive 1-year multidisciplinary lifestyle intervention for overweight/obese women with PCOS. Weight loss through lifestyle modification before starting fertility treatment is described as the first step for overweight/obese PCOS women who are trying to conceive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, no international evidence based protocol exists describing the design of a three-component lifestyle modification program. This is the largest RCT investigating the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary cognitive- lifestyle intervention in overweight/obese women diagnosed with PCOS. The present study started in September 2009 and the first results are expected in December 2016.</p><p>One of the strengths is the selection criterion that not only PCOS women in obesity class III, but also in obesity classes I and II, as well as overweight women are included in this study. All PCOS patients with a BMI&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;25&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> who are eligible for ovulation induction treatment are obligated to follow the lifestyle modification protocol prior to fertility treatment. Therefore, study inclusion is not biased by weight loss motivation as in most research, as weight loss is compulsory for treatment at the Erasmus MC. This enhances the generalizability of our findings; however, this might result in higher drop-out rates.</p><p>Another strength is the length and intensity of this three-component lifestyle modification program. This 1-year program combines several evidence based elements: cognitive behavioural techniques, a multidisciplinary team, and long term support. Indeed, a recent study demonstrated that a non-invasive (two-component) 6-month weight-loss intervention preceding infertility treatment did not result in reasonable weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Also, the use of the oral contraceptive pill improves quality of life compared to lifestyle treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Research supports that combining a healthy diet, increasing physical activity and behavioural modification through CBT is the best strategy for long-term weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In addition, the SMS aims at increasing weight maintenance success and decreasing drop-out rates. As treatment adherence is often problematic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], SMS is a promising e-health tool to enhance adherence rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p>The goal for every participant is to achieve relevant reduction of at least 4.0 BMI points. The fertility treatment cut-off at the Erasmus MC in Rotterdam is set at 34&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. That means that not all women who achieve a reduction of 4.0 BMI are eligible for further fertility treatment at the Erasmus MC. We could have chosen to include this cut-off as the criterion of the primary outcome. In that case, participation would be considered a success if the weight loss was at least 4.0 BMI points AND the BMI was below 34&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. We chose not to include this cut-off at 34&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, because there is no consensus about the height of such threshold. Inclusion of this ad hoc threshold would therefore hamper the generalizability of the study. Moreover, it was considered unrealistic to expect that participants would be able to reduce more than 4.0 BMI in one year. If the participant was still above 34&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> after one year of treatment, the participant was encouraged to continue weight loss on their own, using the skills and attitude learned in the intervention.</p><p>Obesity increases the costs and decreases the effectiveness of fertility treatment in PCOS women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. The costs of this lifestyle intervention are relatively low, compared to increased medical costs in PCOS women without weight loss, as fertility treatment success is lower and the risk of pregnancy complications is higher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>].</p><p>Obesity is considered to be a multi-factorial problem; therefore, a more tailored intervention for subgroups, beyond using the BMI, is needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Recent research indicates that weight loss in the first 2 months is a good predictor for outcomes after 1 year of lifestyle intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Hence, identifying individuals at risk for being unsuccessful or those being successful, and providing tailored treatment, might be the solution for successful long-term weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. A stepped-care model should be considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. Therefore, we are planning to compare the results of the current study to other fertility clinics who have less invasive (one or two-component) weight loss consultation programs. This seems to be an ideal first step for the future development of a stepped-care multicentre RCT.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CBT</term><def><p>Cognitive behavioural therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COLA</term><def><p>CyclusOLigoAmenorroe</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DEBQ</term><def><p>Dutch eating behaviour questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EDE-Q</term><def><p>Eating disorder examination questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FNAES</term><def><p>Fear of negative appearance evaluation scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HRQoL</term><def><p>Health-related quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IPAQ</term><def><p>International physical activity questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NEVO</term><def><p>Dutch food composition database</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PAR-Q</term><def><p>Physical Activity readiness questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCOS</term><def><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCOSQ</term><def><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QoL</term><def><p>Quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RSES</term><def><p>Rosenberg self esteem scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SF-36</term><def><p>Short Form 36</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SMS</term><def><p>Short message service</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p>World health organisation</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Wendy van Dorp, Yvonne Louwers, Sharon Lie Fong, Pauline Wijngaard, Jenny Brouwer, Cindy Meun, Rivka Koedooder, Anne-Lotte van der Kooi for the repeated PCOS screening of all participants.
