TAXUS Element is a third-generation paclitaxel-eluting stent which incorporates a novel, thinner-strut, platinum-enriched metal alloy platform. The stent is intended to have enhanced radiopacity and improved deliverability compared to other paclitaxel-eluting stents. The safety and efficacy of the TAXUS Element stent are being evaluated in the pivotal PERSEUS clinical trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The PERSEUS trials include two parallel studies of the TAXUS Element stent in single, de novo coronary atherosclerotic lesions. The PERSEUS Workhorse study is a prospective, randomized (3:1), single-blind, non-inferiority trial in subjects with lesion length &#x02264;28 mm and vessel diameter &#x02265;2.75 mm to &#x02264;4.0 mm which compares TAXUS Element to the TAXUS Express<sup>2 </sup>paclitaxel-eluting stent system. The Workhorse study employs a novel Bayesian statistical approach that uses prior information to limit the number of study subjects exposed to the investigational device and thus provide a safer and more efficient analysis of the TAXUS Element stent. PERSEUS Small Vessel is a prospective, single-arm, superiority trial in subjects with lesion length &#x02264;20 mm and vessel diameter &#x02265;2.25 mm to &#x0003c;2.75 mm that compares TAXUS Element with a matched historical bare metal Express stent control.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The TAXUS PERSEUS clinical trial program uses a novel statistical approach to evaluate whether design and metal alloy iterations in the TAXUS Element stent platform provide comparable safety and improved procedural performance compared to the previous generation Express stent.

However, repeat revascularization is still required in approximately 7-10% of patients (versus 20-25% with bare metal stents) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. It has been proposed that the thickness of stent struts may impact the ability of the stent to reduce restenosis. Compared to first generation stents with strut thicknesses of approximately 130-150 &#x003bc;m, stents with thinner stent struts (80-100 &#x003bc;m) have been associated with a lower late luminal loss and less neointimal volume obstruction after stenting, possibly as a result of less stent-induced arterial injury and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Thinner stent struts also facilitate deliverability through tortuous vessel anatomy. However, the development of thinner struts with 316L stainless steel limits both radiographic visualization (ie, radiopacity), which is required to ensure proper stent placement, and the necessary radial strength for adequate stent expansion, particularly in resistant fibrocalcific target lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The TAXUS Element paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent uses the same polymer and has similar paclitaxel release kinetics as the earlier TAXUS Express [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and TAXUS Libert&#x000e9; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], 9-11 316L stainless steel stent systems, but employs a new 81 &#x003bc;m platinum chromium alloy in a design intended to improve deliverability, increase radiopacity, and maintain low stent recoil when compared with previous TAXUS stent designs. The PERSEUS program evaluates the TAXUS Element stent for the treatment of single de novo atherosclerotic lesions using a novel Bayesian statistical approach to increase efficiency.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Device Description</title><p>The TAXUS Element stent is a novel, balloon-expandable, 81 &#x003bc;m, platinum chromium alloy stent pre-mounted on a high-pressure delivery balloon.

Subjects with target lesion length &#x02264;28 mm and reference vessel diameter (RVD) &#x02265;2.75 mm to &#x02264;4.0 mm were considered for enrollment. Additional inclusion and exclusion criteria are given in Appendix B. Subjects were randomized after successful predilatation of the target lesion and were considered to be enrolled at the time of randomization. The randomization schedules were computer-generated using a pseudo-random number generator and stratified both by clinical site and by the presence or absence of medically treated diabetes. The number of diabetic subjects was capped at 350. In total, 1264 subjects were enrolled at 90 clinical sites in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore (see Acknowledgements), of whom 330 subjects were randomly assigned to protocol-mandated 9-month angiographic follow-up (angiographic subset). The primary endpoint is the rate of target lesion failure (TLF) at 12 months post-index procedure. In-segment percent diameter stenosis at 9 months post-index procedure as measured by quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) is the secondary endpoint. Additional clinical and angiographic endpoints in both the WH and Small Vessel studies include target vessel revascularization (TVR), major adverse cardiac events (MACE), stent thrombosis, and technical and procedural success, as well as angiographic late loss and binary restenosis.</p></sec><sec><title>PERSEUS Small Vessel (SV) Trial</title><p>PERSEUS SV is a prospective, single-arm, superiority trial that compares the TAXUS Element stent to a matched bare metal (Express) historical control group garnered from the TAXUS V trial. The control group comprised 125 intent-to-treat subjects with RVD &#x02265;2.25 to &#x0003c;2.75 mm and lesion length &#x02264;20 mm of whom 108 subjects had QCA at 9-month follow-up. A total of 224 subjects from 28 United States sites were enrolled. All subjects in PERSEUS SV are required to undergo a 9-month angiographic assessment. The primary endpoint is in-stent late loss by QCA on 9-month angiographic follow-up and the key secondary endpoint is TLF at 12 months. Additional clinical and angiographic endpoints are similar to the PERSEUS WH study as noted above.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Endpoint Definitions</title><p>TLF is defined as any ischemia-driven revascularization of the target lesion (TLR), myocardial infarction (MI; both Q-wave and non-Q-wave) related to the target vessel, or cardiac death related to the target vessel. If relationship to the target vessel could not be determined with certainty, the event was assumed to be related to the target vessel. MACE is defined as MI, TVR, or cardiac death. Stent thrombosis is defined per historical Boston Scientific Corporation protocol definitions (see Appendix C) and per the Academic Research Consortium definition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Additional clinical and angiographic endpoint definitions are given in Appendix C.</p></sec><sec><title>Follow-up Schedule</title><p>For both studies, clinical endpoint measurements were conducted in-hospital and at 30 days, and are planned at 9 months, 12 months, 18 months, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, and 5 years. Angiographic follow-up at 9 months is planned for subjects randomized to the angiographic subset in the PERSEUS WH study and for all subjects in PERSEUS SV. Starting with the 18-month visit, follow-up will be limited to those study subjects who actually received a study stent (TAXUS Element or TAXUS Express).</p></sec><sec><title>Antiplatelet and Other Concomitant Medical Therapy</title><p>Treatment with aspirin and clopidogrel (or ticlopidine) is required for both PERSEUS studies in compliance with the ACC/AHA/SCAI Guidelines for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Aspirin &#x02265;300 mg was administered orally at least 1 hour prior to catheterization and a clopidogrel oral loading dose of &#x02265;300 to 600 mg was administered (preferably &#x02265;6 hours prior to the procedure, but no later than 2 hours after completion of the index procedure). During the procedure, unfractionated heparin was recommended as necessary to maintain an activated clotting time &#x02265;250 seconds. Alternatively, enoxaparin, bivalirudin or other procedural antithrombotics could be administered per local standard of practice. Abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban could be administered at the discretion of the investigator. Clopidogrel at 75 mg orally daily was required for at least 6 months and ideally up to 12 months in subjects not at high risk of bleeding consistent with the ACC/AHA/SCAI Guidelines for PCI in effect at the time study enrollment began. Five months after the start of study enrollment, the PCI guidelines were revised to recommend 12 months of clopidogrel therapy in all patients receiving drug-eluting stents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In case of allergy or intolerance to clopidogrel, ticlopidine 250 mg orally twice daily was prescribed. Daily aspirin therapy was mandated concomitantly with clopidogrel or ticlopidine and continued indefinitely.</p></sec><sec><title>Criteria for Multiple and Staged Interventions</title><p>Only one target lesion segment, treatable by a single stent, was to be considered the target lesion. If separate lesions in 2 different native coronary arteries were eligible, the operator was to decide which lesion would be treated as the target lesion prior to treating any lesion(s) or vessel(s). The assumed culprit lesion was selected as the target lesion (defined as the lesion most likely responsible for a clinical event based on evidence of ischemia or the lesion with greatest percent diameter stenosis on visual estimate). Treatment of one lesion in a single non-target vessel during the index procedure was allowed by protocol prior to treatment of the target lesion. Treatment of the non-study lesion could not require additional unplanned stents, and must have been successful angiographically (see Appendix C) for the subject to be eligible for enrollment into the study. Staged PCI or subsequent planned coronary artery bypass graft procedures were not allowed post-index procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Angiographic Follow-up</title><p>Angiographic follow-up is required at 9 months in the angiographic subset of PERSEUS WH and in all PERSEUS SV subjects. Central analysis of all angiographic studies will be performed by an Angiographic Core Laboratory (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA) using standard qualitative morphologic criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] identical to those used in the TAXUS Express and TAXUS Libert&#x000e9; clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis Plan for the Primary Endpoint</title><sec><title>PERSEUS WH</title><p>For the primary endpoint analysis, Bayesian hierarchical modeling will be used to determine if the 12-month TLF rate for the TAXUS Element stent is non-inferior to the 12-month TLF rate for the TAXUS Express<sup>2 </sup>paclitaxel-eluting stent system. The hierarchical model will be used to estimate the difference in the 12-month TLF rate between the TAXUS Element and TAXUS Express devices. This hierarchical model involves the TLF rates observed for TAXUS Element and TAXUS Express in patients enrolled in PERSEUS WH, as well as rates observed in data conditionally borrowed from TAXUS IV and V patients (under the Bayesian framework, as described below).</p><p>Bayesian methods differ from the more conventional frequentist methods in that they can utilize prior information, potentially increasing the precision of analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. While frequentist methods also use prior data in trial planning for sample size and power calculations, the evidence for or against the null hypothesis comes solely from the current trial. By utilizing the prior information in assessing trial endpoints, the Bayesian approach may allow for a smaller sample size, thereby minimizing the number of patients exposed to an investigational drug or device during its evaluation. Bayesian analyses may be interpreted in a more intuitive way than frequentist analyses because they treat the parameter of interest as a random variable rather than as a fixed unknown value. Specifically, Bayesian methods provide a posterior probability that a statement is true or false given the prior information and the observed data, whereas the frequentist <italic>P </italic>value provides the probability of observing data as or more extreme than that observed assuming the null hypothesis is true. The Bayesian approach has been supported by the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Center for Devices and Radiological Health for medical device clinical trials when the prior data utilized come from robust clinical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Bayesian methods were chosen for PERSEUS WH in order to utilize extensive prior data on the TAXUS Express stent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and thus reduce the number of study subjects, particularly in the control arm. In the PERSEUS WH trial, historical TAXUS Express stent data from the TAXUS IV and TAXUS V trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] may be borrowed under certain conditions to augment data from the TAXUS Express control group, using subjects who had similar target lesion characteristics (lesion length &#x02264;28 mm, RVD 2.75 mm - 4.0 mm) as those enrolled in the PERSEUS WH study. The observed 12-month TLF rates in these historical cohorts was 8.2% (44/535) for TAXUS IV and 10.9% (33/304) for TAXUS V. Historical control data will only be borrowed if the observed 12-month TLF rate in the TAXUS Express control group enrolled in PERSEUS WH exceeds 8.0%. If the observed TLF rate for PERSEUS WH subjects treated with the TAXUS Express stent is &#x02264;8.0%, historical data will not be borrowed as doing so would raise the TLF rate in TAXUS Express stent subjects in the non-inferiority comparison and potentially bias the analysis in favor of the TAXUS Element stent. This design is therefore more conservative than non-conditional borrowing. The weight of the historical data will depend on how closely the results from the concurrent control match those from the historical controls. If data are borrowed, data from approximately 119 patients (if 12% TLF rate observed) to 199 patients (if 9% TLF rate observed) will be "effectively" borrowed from the historical control, as discussed by Malec et al, 2001 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Based on discussions with the US FDA, a non-inferiority margin (&#x00394;) of 4.1% was chosen and non-inferiority of the TAXUS Element stent will be accepted if the Bayesian posterior probability (&#x003b8;<sub>1 </sub>- &#x003b8;<sub>2 </sub>&#x0003c; 0.041 | data) is at least 0.95, where &#x003b8;<sub>1 </sub>is the 12-month TLF rate for TAXUS Element and &#x003b8;<sub>2 </sub>is the 12-month TLF rate for TAXUS Express. This non-inferiority margin preserves at least half of the treatment difference observed between TAXUS Express and the lesion-diameter-matched bare metal Express stent control in the combined TAXUS IV and V trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This difference in TLF was deemed to be clinically indistinguishable from a treatment choice perspective and is similar to non-inferiority margins used in other studies comparing DES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The sample size of 1264 subjects (which is expected to result in 1200 evaluable subjects assuming 5% attrition) was determined through simulations based on hierarchical modeling. Although power and type I error do not apply to PERSEUS WH in the frequentist sense, this sample size was selected because it was the minimum sample size required to give approximately an 80% probability of correctly concluding non-inferiority (over a range of assumed TAXUS Express TLF rates from 6% to 12%) if the TAXUS Element TLF rate is indeed non-inferior to the TAXUS Express TLF rate.</p></sec><sec><title>PERSEUS SV</title><p>For the PERSEUS SV study, a 2-sided <italic>t</italic>-test will be used to determine if the 9-month in-stent late loss observed for the TAXUS Element stent is superior to that observed for the bare metal Express stent historical control subjects in the TAXUS V trial. The null hypothesis that the true difference in means (TAXUS Element - bare metal Express) is equal to zero will be tested against the two-sided alternative that the true difference in means is different from zero. The sample size was calculated for a two-group test of means using nQuery Advisor<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Version 5 (Statistical Solutions Ltd., Saugus, Massachusetts, USA). The expected 9-month in-stent late loss for the TAXUS Element stent is 0.55 mm and the 9-month in-stent late loss for the Express stent is the observed mean (0.77 mm) from the TAXUS V study in subjects with visual estimate RVD &#x02265;2.25 mm to &#x0003c;2.75 mm and lesion length &#x02264;20 mm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The common standard deviation is assumed to be 0.6 mm, which is derived from the TAXUS V Express stent cohort. Given a two-sided &#x003b1; of 0.05, 190 TAXUS Element stent subjects will provide 85% power to reject the null hypothesis if it is indeed false. Further allowance for approximately 15% attrition based on a QCA endpoint resulted in a study enrollment target of 224 subjects.</p><p>All frequentist statistical analyses will be done using The SAS System Version 8.2 software or above (SAS Institute Inc., North Carolina, USA). Software for the Bayesian hierarchical modeling was developed by Professor Ming-Hui Chen (University of Connecticut) and was written using the Fortran 90 language and compiled with the Intel Visual Fortran Compiler Professional Edition for Windows with IMSL Version 10.1 or above (Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, California, USA). This software was also used to run simulations of sample size, power and type I error based on the hierarchical models and specialized Gibbs sampling algorithms.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Study Organization and Ethical Considerations</title><p>An independent clinical events committee will adjudicate all reported events of stent thrombosis and MACE. An independent data monitoring committee is responsible for oversight of all reported adverse events and aggregate safety data to monitor for incidence of MACE and other trends that may warrant modification or termination of the trials. PERSEUS study organization and oversight committee membership are listed in the acknowledgements.</p><p>The Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee at each participating center approved the study protocol and all subjects provided written informed consent. The protocols and consent forms were consistent with the International Conference on Harmonisation Guidance for Industry E6 Good Clinical Practice, the Declaration of Helsinki, EN ISO 14155-1 and EN ISO 14155-2, and all local regulations, as appropriate. The PERSEUS study protocols were approved by the US FDA under Investigational Device Exception number G060237.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations of Study Design</title><p>The comparator controls for PERSEUS were chosen based on the commercially available stents at the time of study enrollment. Since that time, a next generation paclitaxel-eluting stent (TAXUS Libert&#x000e9;) and 2 dedicated small vessel paclitaxel-eluting stents (TAXUS Express Atom and TAXUS Libert&#x000e9; Atom) have been US FDA approved. Thus, the PERSEUS comparator groups do not represent the most recently available paclitaxel-eluting stents. Although the formal statistical hypotheses were based on TAXUS Express and Express bare metal stent, the PERSEUS results will need to be interpreted in the context of more recent DES studies.</p><p>In addition, the study design includes comparisons to historical controls. In PERSEUS, use of historical data could contribute to bias as a result of differences in patient complexity or patterns of treatment between PERSEUS and historical controls. For PERSEUS WH, data from TAXUS IV and V may be borrowed only if the observed TLF rate in the TAXUS Express concurrent control is similar to the TLF rate in the historical TAXUS Express control. This conditional borrowing results in a more conservative test and also minimizes the likelihood that differences between the concurrent and historical controls will bias the non-inferiority comparison.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The TAXUS Element paclitaxel-eluting stent incorporates a new metal alloy in a novel design, intended to facilitate deliverability and improve radiopacity relative to the earlier generation TAXUS Express<sup>2 </sup>and TAXUS Libert&#x000e9; stent systems. The safety and efficacy of the TAXUS Element stent are being studied in the PERSEUS clinical trial program, which evaluates the TAXUS Element stent in comparison with either the first generation TAXUS Express stent (WH) or a bare metal Express stent (SV). The PERSEUS WH study employs a novel Bayesian statistical design that uses data from prior TAXUS Express studies to increase power while maintaining acceptable type I error and limiting the number of subjects treated in the study. Enrollment is complete in both studies and primary endpoint data are expected in 2010.</p></sec><sec><title>List of Abbreviations</title><p>ACC: American College of Cardiology; AHA: American Heart Association; FDA: US Food and Drug Administration; MACE: Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MI, TVR, Cardiac Death); MI: Myocardial Infarction; PCI: Percutaneous Coronary Intervention; QCA: Quantitative Coronary Angiography; RVD: Reference Vessel Diameter; SCAI: Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions; SV: Small Vessel (PERSEUS Small Vessel Study); TLF: Target Lesion Failure; TLR: Target Lesion Revascularization; TVR: Target Vessel Revascularization; WH: Workhorse (PERSEUS Workhorse Study).</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors wish to disclose the following competing interests: DJA, AB, KDD, JH, AN, and SW are full-time employees of and hold equity in Boston Scientific Corporation.

(A) Stent integrity, as measured by an accelerated life test of the bending fatigue of a stent in a simulated overlapped stent configuration, showing number of bend cycles before stent fracture. The test is conducted by mounting one end of a nominally deployed stent to a fixed mandrel while the other end is mounted to a mandrel suspended in a flexible membrane. The membrane mounted end of the stent is translated perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the stent to impart a repeatable bend in the stent. (B) Conformability - a measure of the torque required to bend the stent to a specific curvature, which is directly related to flexibility of the stent.

The drug-polymer matrix provides controlled paclitaxel release similar to that of the slow-release TAXUS Express and TAXUS Libert&#x000e9; stents.

It has been suggested that delayed arterial healing following drug-eluting stent implantation is associated with persistent fibrin deposition and reduced or delayed endothelialization, and may be predictive of late stent thrombosis. Stents with thinner struts may be associated with less inflammation and injury to the vessel wall and to become endothelialized more rapidly compared with thicker strut stents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Preclinical studies demonstrate that the thinner-strut Element stent is associated with reduced fibrin deposition and more rapid clearance of fibrin compared with either the TAXUS Express or TAXUS Libert&#x000e9; stents (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) and suggest that the thin-strut Element stent design may facilitate healing compared to previous generation TAXUS stents.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Fibrin deposition around stent struts following TAXUS stent implantation in porcine coronary arteries</bold>.
