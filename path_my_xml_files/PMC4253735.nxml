While its cause is multifactorial, one factor predisposing to the development of the disease appears to be atopy, a propensity to make IgE, which is associated with T helper type 2 (Th2) CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p><p>OX40 (CD134) is a costimulatory receptor transiently expressed on activated T cells <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">[1</xref>,<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2]</xref>. Its ligand, OX40L, is expressed on a broad range of cell types, including dendritic, vascular endothelial, natural killer, mast and B cells. OX40L is up-regulated on dendritic cells following stimulation with the IL-7-like cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), CD40L or toll-like receptor ligands <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The OX40&#x02013;OX40L interaction contributes to an optimal T cell response and plays an important role in the maintenance and reactivation of memory T effector cells. OX40&#x02013;OX40L interactions have also been implicated in the suppression of regulatory T cell function <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Importantly, OX40&#x02013;OX40L expression is increased in the bronchial submucosa in mild asthma, but not in moderate-to-severe disease, and is related to the degree of tissue eosinophilia <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Interactions between OX40 and its ligand, OX40L therefore may play an important role in the generation and maintenance of Th2-type responses and in the development of allergic lung inflammation. Thus, blocking OX40&#x02013;OX40L interactions potentially could down-modulate the allergic inflammation observed in asthmatic subjects.</p><p>Anti-OX40L is a recombinant, human monoclonal antibody of the IgG1 subclass which binds OX40L with high affinity and blocks OX40&#x02013;OX40L interactions, resulting in inhibition of events downstream from OX40 signalling in T cells <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Anti-OX40L monoclonal antibody (MAb) shows <italic>in vitro</italic> effector function; thus, in addition to blockade of signalling, it is also capable of lysing OX40L-expressing cells by antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Anti-OX40L MAb was shown to inhibit Th2 inflammation in a non-human primate model of asthma <italic>in vivo</italic>

There was no effect of anti-OX40L MAb treatment on allergen-induced early- and late-phase asthmatic responses, allergen-induced sputum eosinophils or methacholine airway hyperresponsiveness. In keeping with the proposed role of OX40&#x02013;OX40L signalling, we observed a small but statistically significant reduction in serum total IgE with anti-OX40L MAb treatment, with a corresponding decrease in pre-allergen sputum eosinophils, indicating pharmacological activity of the anti-OX40L MAb. No changes in the frequency of T cells responding to sensitizing allergens or recall antigens were observed indicating that the treatment did not induce global suppression of T cell immunity.</p><p>In human disease, there is good evidence that TSLP is associated with asthma <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. OX40L is expressed by dendritic cells following activation with TSLP. Ligation of OX40 on na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells plays a key role in allergic disease by inducing their differentiation into effector Th2 cells, which produce high levels of the Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">[12</xref>,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13]</xref>, and thus can trigger allergic inflammatory Th2 immune responses. Expression of OX40 and OX40L has been shown to be increased in the bronchial submucosa in mild but not moderate-to-severe asthma, and its expression positively correlates with IL-4 and tissue eosinophils <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. OX40L is also expressed on airway smooth muscle cells from asthmatic subjects and is up-regulated by TNF-alpha <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, suggesting that inflammatory cell interactions with OX40L on airway smooth muscle may induce functional consequences. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments have shown that blocking OX40&#x02013;OX40L interactions in cocultures of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and TSLP-activated dendritic cells inhibits the production of Th2 cytokines <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Blockade of OX40&#x02013;OX40L interactions also limits proliferation of Th2 memory cells by arresting these cells at the G0 phase of the cell cycle <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> highlighting the roles of OX40L in the induction of inflammatory Th2 cells and the maintenance of the Th2 memory cell pool. The current study evaluated several cytokines/chemokines and T cell subsets, including memory and effector T cells in the blood and saw no effect (data not shown). The lack of effect seen may be due to differences in the sampling site because most animal studies are able to assess airway samples and lymph tissue.</p><p>Animal models of allergic airways disease have been instrumental to identify TSLP and OX40&#x02013;OX40L as critical elements for development of airway inflammation and hyper-reactivity. In murine models of asthma, OX40-deficient mice challenged with ovalbumin showed significantly lower levels of Th2 cytokines, total serum IgE, mucus secretion, decreased lung inflammation, reduced eosinophilia and goblet cell hyperplasia, and significantly attenuated airway hyper-reactivity compared with wild-type control mice <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">[16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19]</xref>.</p><p>An anti-OX40L-MAb has also been evaluated in a mouse model of asthma <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">[17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20]</xref> with beneficial results. Administration of anti-OX40L MAb resulted in significant decreases in Th2 cytokines and antigen-specific serum IgE and IgG1 levels, and attenuated Th2 cytokines and infiltration of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and eosinophils in BAL fluid of mouse and non-human primate models of asthma, demonstrating OX40L is a critical mediator in TSLP-induced allergic inflammation <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Of direct relevance to the current study where asthmatic subjects were challenged with an antigen to which they were already sensitized, administration of anti-OX40L Ab in mouse and non-human primate lead to a significant decrease in serum IgE levels, release of Th2 cytokines and reactivation and infiltration of memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells during the recall response to antigen <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In the current study, we observed a reduction in total serum IgE 113&#x000a0;days after the first dose of anti-OX40L MAb, concurrent with lower sputum eosinophil counts. These findings are in keeping with the observed effects of OX40L blockade in animal models of asthma. Furthermore, the OX40 signalling pathway has been shown to play an important role in regulating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in other TSLP-mediated inflammatory diseases, such as autoimmune encephalomyelitis <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">[20</xref>,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21]</xref>.</p><p>Positive findings from preclinical studies have suggested that blockade of OX40 and OX40L <italic>in vivo</italic> could provide new therapeutic targets for inflammatory immunological disorders such as allergic asthma; however, investigations into the role of OX40&#x02013;OX40L in humans is very limited, and mouse models cannot predict success of clinical trials in human asthma. Subjects enrolled in the study had mild asthma and thus had low eosinophil levels in blood and sputum. Our findings of reduced IgE and airway eosinophils in subjects treated with anti-OX40L MAb supports the notion that OX40&#x02013;OX40L signalling contributes to the development of allergic inflammation, even though the effect that we observed is limited both in magnitude and duration. The effect of anti-OX40L MAb on IgE and airway eosinophils is not as marked as observations in murine models, and this can be attributed to the inherent large biological variation within research subjects with different duration of disease and sensitizing antigens, versus mice with the same background strain. Of note, blockade of costimulation by CD28, which leads to suboptimal activation of T cells, is effective in preventing antigen-induced airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness in mouse models of asthma, but had no effect on BAL eosinophil levels in asthmatic subjects following segmental allergen challenge <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Collectively, these results suggest targeting T cell function and expansion in humans may not be as effective as in murine models and/or that recently discovered sources of Th2 cytokines, such as type 2 innate lymphocytes <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> are not affected by OX40L blockade. That we did not observe an effect of anti-OX40L MAb on measures of airway hyperresponsiveness at baseline or following allergen challenge, or an effect on allergen-induced bronchoconstriction suggests that the pathways downstream from OX40&#x02013;OX40L signalling do not play a major role in the development of these physiological changes.</p><p>We acknowledge that there are several limitations when interpreting the data from this study. The dose regimen of anti-OX40L MAb in this study was chosen based on safety and efficacy considerations. The safety of this dose regimen was supported by previous testing of anti-OX40L MAb in single and multiple ascending dose Phase I studies in atopic allergic rhinitis patients, together with the safety profile provided by a 6-month non-clinical chronic toxicity study. The dose of anti-OX40L MAb in this study was also expected to result in exposures sufficient to inhibit OX40&#x02013;OX40L interactions in the airways. The overall exposure in this study is predicted to maintain more than 25-fold higher serum concentration than the IC90 demonstrated in <italic>in vitro</italic> assays of efficacy. An excess of anti-OX40L MAb in the serum allowed for the unknown difference between the amount of drug required to show efficacy in the lung and the observed effective concentration based on <italic>in vitro</italic> assays. A loading dose of 8&#x000a0;mg/kg was chosen to allow rapid achievement of steady-state serum antibody concentrations. Anti-OX40L MAb is postulated to have a relatively slow onset because the mechanism of action relies on the effects of OX40L on dendritic cells, which are resident cells in lung tissue and lymph nodes in the lung. As such, the exposure was given over 4&#x000a0;months as a rapid on-set of action was not expected. We were able to provide a high exposure of antibody in this small proof-of-activity study based on safety exposures in humans but the exposures in the non-human primate studies were at approximately twofold to threefold higher than given in this study <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Although we reached the target anti-OX40L MAb levels in serum which were based on efficacy in <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, and we were likely to have fully blocked OX40L pathway in both this human study and the non-human primate study, we have no indication that this concentration is actually effective in humans. Furthermore, there are no proven biomarkers for OX40L regulation, and because the recognition of allergen presented by dendritic cells is situated in local lymph nodes, the development of assays to demonstrate target engagement or downstream pharmacodynamic activity are challenging. We were surprised by the placebo response seen particularly in the LAR response for both Day 56 and Day 113. Typically, the allergen challenge model has not shown placebo responses such as we saw in this study <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">[24</xref>,<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25]</xref>. We do not think it impacts the interpretation of the results as the small sample size would not have been able to control for Type I error.</p><p>Targeting TSLP or OX40&#x02013;OX40L has the potential to be an effective therapeutic strategy, and perhaps a disease modifier, given the role of the OX40&#x02013;OX40L axis in allergic sensitization and the development of Th2 lymphocytes. Similar to the effects of mepolizumab, anti-OX40L MAb reduced eosinophil levels with an absence of effects upon LAR or airway hyperresponsiveness <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. It is possible that in addition to its effects on allergic sensitization, OX40L blockade might also reduce exacerbation frequency as observed with mepolizumab <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. While it is entirely possible that this intervention is most effective when administered prior to the onset of established allergic sensitization, the timing of intervention in the current study was long after the establishment of allergic sensitization. Furthermore, we do not know whether subjects selected for development of allergen-induced LAR have the clinically relevant ongoing activation of the OX40&#x02013;OX40L axis. There is evidence in murine models of asthma that OX40L blockade inhibits reactivation and infiltration of memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells during the recall response to antigen, <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>; however, it is not well understood whether anti-OX40L MAb should be an effective treatment in established human asthma. Neither OX40 or its ligand has emerged in unbiased screens of gene expression in asthma, and furthermore, redundancy in the regulation of Th2 inflammation may diminish the impact of targeting OX40 signalling alone.</p><p>Treatment of subjects with mild allergic asthma with anti-OX40L MAb had no effect on allergen-induced airway responses or on airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine, but had a small though significantly reduced serum total IgE and airway eosinophils at 16&#x000a0;weeks post-dosing. It is possible that the duration of dosing or the dose of drug administered in the current study was insufficient for impacting airway responses in these subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Genentech Inc., a member of the Roche group and the AllerGen Network of Centers of Excellence, Clinical Investigator Collaborative.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Ignacio Rodriguez, Maria Fuentes, Peng Lu, Mirella Lazarov and Judith Jaegar and Mike Derby for their review of the manuscript, and Francine Deschesnes, Linda Hui and Richard Watson for co-ordinating the study visits.</p></ack><sec><title>Conflict of Interests</title><p>GMG, LPB, DWC, JMF, IM and POB have received Grants-in-Aid from Genentech.
