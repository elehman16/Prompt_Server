These properties render sevoflurane suitable for inhalation induction of anesthesia. Inhalation induction should provide rapid loss of consciousness to ensure patient's comfort and satisfaction and to avoid adverse effects such as excitations, breath holding, coughing and/or laryngospasm. Several adjuvants and techniques have been proposed to ensure a rapid induction of anesthesia with sevoflurane, such as intravenous (IV) midazolam,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] clonidine,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] fentanyl,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] breathing different gas flows,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] or ventilation with larger tidal volumes.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>The effect of nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) when added to the inhalation of sevoflurane in oxygen has been controversial.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] N<sub>2</sub>O added to oxygen was reported to make shorter the induction time with sevoflurane, an effect similar to that produced by clonidine.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] These results are not consistent with the results obtained from other studies, which conclude that the addition of N<sub>2</sub>O to the sevoflurane/oxygen mixture is not advantageous regarding the speed of induction of anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In contrast, results from previous studies point out that the addition of N<sub>2</sub>O to the sevoflurane/oxygen mixture may be associated with more, though minor, excitatory phenomena.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Our hypothesis was that the speed of inhalation induction with sevoflurane may benefit from the pretreatment with N<sub>2</sub>O, and subsequent volume contraction[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] before sevoflurane administration.

Eighty patients American Society of Anesthesiology physical status I or II scheduled for hysteroscopy under general anesthesia, who accepted an inhalation induction with no premedication, gave their written informed consent to participate in the study protocol. The study was conducted between October 2006 and March 2009. Patients with body weight exceeding the ideal body weight by 25%, with central nervous system disease, respiratory disease, hyper-or hypothyroidism, intake of sedatives, hypnotics, and antidepressants were excluded from the study before randomization. Difficult airway was not an exclusion criterion.</p><p>Patients were randomly allocated to the air (FiO<sub>2</sub> = 0.21) or N<sub>2</sub>O (N<sub>2</sub>O/O<sub>2</sub>:50/50, FiO<sub>2</sub> = 0.5) group. Randomization was done by means of odd and even numbers retrieved from a computer-generated table (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomizer.org">http://www.randomizer.org</ext-link>) corresponding to the N<sub>2</sub>O and to the air group respectively. The pretreatment gas was administered via N<sub>2</sub>O-oxygen flow meters or an air flow meter connected to the wall pipelines, all covered by drapes so the investigators were blinded to the gas administered. Group allocation to intervention was done by an independent anesthesiologist not participating in the study who arranged the gases before induction (air or N<sub>2</sub>O/O<sub>2</sub>), covered the flow meters with drapes and recorded the group each patient was assigned.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Induction of anesthesia</title><p>In the operating room a peripheral vein was catheterized and a Ringer's solution infusion was started. Monitoring consisted of pulse oximetry, electrocardiogram, heart rate, noninvasive arterial pressure, end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO<sub>2</sub>), inspired and end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations, tidal volume and respiratory rate (S/5&#x02122; Anesthesia Monnitor, Datex-Ohmeda Division, Datex-Ohmeda, Helsinki, Finland) and bispectral index (BIS <italic>xp</italic> A-2000&#x02122; Monitor, System Rev 3.21, ASPECT Medical Systems, Leiden, The Netherlands).</p><p>According to the group allocation, in the preinduction period patients were fully awake, breathing spontaneously either 50% N<sub>2</sub>O in oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub> = 0.5) or air (FiO<sub>2</sub> = 0.21) for 10 min via a Mapleson C breathing system and a tightly fitting face mask. The face mask was hold by the attending anesthesiologist. In the meantime, the anesthetic circuit was primed with 8% sevoflurane: An oxygen flow 6 L/min was allowed to pass through the circle anesthetic system with the sevoflurane vaporizer dial being set at 8% for 5 min. An endotracheal tube was attached to the end of the anesthetic system with the distal end tightly surrounded by a plastic bag.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] After the completion of the 10 min administration of the N<sub>2</sub>O/oxygen or air, the face mask was connected to the sevoflurane primed anesthetic circuit and all patients were allowed to breathe spontaneously sevoflurane in oxygen with the sevoflurane vaporizer set at 8% and an oxygen flow rate 6 L/min. After a 5 min period of sevoflurane inhalation, the study protocol and data collection were completed. A short acting opioid was given IV and a supraglottic airway device was inserted for the ventilation of patients during surgery.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Measurements</title><p>During the 10 min preinduction period, BIS, respiratory rate, tidal volume, EtCO<sub>2</sub>, heart rate and oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) were recorded every minute. The same parameters were recorded every 30 s during the first 5 min induction period with the patient breathing sevoflurane in oxygen. During the induction period inspired and end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations were also recorded every 30 s. Arterial blood pressure was recorded only before starting the pretreatment with the gas and after completion of measurements to avoid stimulus during cuff inflation affecting BIS measurements.</p><p>We hypothesized that the speed of inhalation induction with sevoflurane will be enhanced by N<sub>2</sub>O pretreatment, and possible subsequent volume contraction occurring before sevoflurane administration. BIS was the primary outcome measure, the rest variables being secondary outcome measures. At each time point, three consecutive BIS values were read and the median one was selected.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Initial sample size estimation showed that approximately 40 patients are needed in each group to detect a clinically relevant reduction of BIS after induction of anesthesia by 30% with a power of 0.80 and level of significance of 5%.</p><p>To assess differences in patients&#x02019; characteristics between the two groups, two independent samples <italic>t</italic>-tests for normally distributed responses and Mann-Whitney tests for nonnormally distributed responses were carried out. Overall group differences in all variables were assessed by using repeated measures ANOVA. A paired samples <italic>t</italic>-test or a Mann-Whitney test was used to assess differences at each time point wherever appropriate.

These results are not consistent with other studies when N<sub>2</sub>O was administered concomitantly with sevoflurane for inhalation induction. Nevertheless, these studies were based on clinical criteria, which are subjective and therefore more difficult to be quantified.</p><p>O'shea <italic>et al</italic>. found that the addition of 50% N<sub>2</sub>O to the sevoflurane/oxygen mixture had no effect on the speed of induction and was associated with more excitatory effects. The investigators defined induction time as the time needed for the raised arm to fall to the horizontal level.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Also, according to Siau and Liu, 66% N<sub>2</sub>O added to oxygen did not decrease the induction time with 8% sevoflurane when compared to the induction time of 8% sevoflurane in oxygen alone. Adverse events during induction were similar in the two groups. The induction time was defined as the time to cessation of finger tapping. These investigators administered higher concentrations of N<sub>2</sub>O than those administered in the present study but did not prime the circle breathing circuit with sevoflurane.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>In a previous study, we have shown that pretreatment with 100% oxygen enhances the inhalation induction with &#x02265;7% sevoflurane as assessed by BIS monitoring.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Replacing nitrogen in the lungs with a more soluble gas like oxygen, results in lung collapse, decreased functional residual capacity and increased alveolar concentration of the inhaled anesthetic, that is, sevoflurane.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In contrast to oxygen, in the present study the N<sub>2</sub>O was discontinued during induction. It is worthy to note that during induction, the end-tidal (F<sub>E</sub>) sevoflurane concentration (though no statistically significant) was higher during the first 120 s. The higher F<sub>E</sub> is consistent with increased ventilation in the N<sub>2</sub>O group, as indicated by the higher respiratory rates and the lower CO<sub>2</sub> values. Increased ventilation favors the uptake of the volatile anesthetic.</p><p>In the present study, oxygen is also expected to enhance the sevoflurane uptake and to diminish the difference between the N<sub>2</sub>O and air groups as it is more soluble than nitrogen and part of the lungs will collapse to some extent (absorption atelectasis).[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Similarly, N<sub>2</sub>O-being 32 times more soluble than nitrogen - is rapidly up taken by the blood, resulting in lung contraction and increased alveolar concentration of sevoflurane. However, eventually alveolar collapsing will be associated with pulmonary shunt which will delay sevoflurane uptake.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The time points at which BIS values differ significantly in the present study are between 60 and 150 s.</p><p>The inspired and expired sevoflurane concentrations did not differ between the N<sub>2</sub>O and the air groups during the 300 s period of induction, though the end-tidal/inspired concentration (F
<sub>E</sub>/F<sub>I</sub>) ratio for sevoflurane was consistently higher by 2-7% in the N<sub>2</sub>O group. Sevoflurane due to its low blood gas partition coefficient might not benefit from the second gas effect phenomenon. However Taheri and Eger have nicely demonstrated the second gas effect for desflurane, an agent even less blood soluble.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Hendrickx <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated a higher ratio of alveolar/inspired (F
<sub>A</sub>/F<sub>I</sub>) sevoflurane concentration when N<sub>2</sub>O was added to the inspired mixture.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Peyton <italic>et al</italic>. reported a two to three times more powerful second gas effect of N<sub>2</sub>O on arterial versus the end-expired sevoflurane pressures and attributed this effect to ventilation perfusion inhomogeneity by general anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In both studies, sevoflurane measurements were performed after IV induction of anesthesia and during mechanical ventilation.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Our data were collected with the patients breathing spontaneously and receiving solely sevoflurane without other anesthetics or adjuvants.</p><p>Pretreatment with N<sub>2</sub>O may not ensure an overall faster inhalation induction, but highlights the failure of previous studies to demonstrate enhancement of sevoflurane induction by concomitant N<sub>2</sub>O administration. Nonetheless, shorter periods of exposure may also enhance the sevoflurane induction. Previous studies failed to show a more rapid induction of anesthesia with sevoflurane for various reasons. As sevoflurane is an agent with low solubility, it may not benefit the very first minutes of induction by the concomitant administration of N<sub>2</sub>O. The additive synergism of the N<sub>2</sub>O and sevoflurane might also enhance the inhalation induction. However, such a synergism should also enhance the induction times in other studies. So we remain with our hypothesis that this difference between the N<sub>2</sub>O and air groups may be attributed to the pretreatment rather than the co-administration of N<sub>2</sub>O during sevoflurane induction of anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] A very early increased concentration effect due to volume reduction and before the &#x0201c;shunt&#x0201d; effect, as N<sub>2</sub>O is taken up by the pulmonary capillaries or increased ventilation, as shown by the lower EtCO<sub>2</sub>, in the N<sub>2</sub>O group may have influenced the speed of the sevoflurane uptake.</p><p>In clinical practice, fast inhalational induction may be beneficial for both patients and hospitals; it may shorten the second stage of anesthesia, thus reducing the risk of agitation/adverse respiratory events, and increase patient's satisfaction, while-depending on the time saved - it may also decrease the overall operating room time and facilitate fast turnover.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Our measurements are limited by the sensitivity of the device we used to measure sevoflurane and N<sub>2</sub>O, thus the infrared analyzer, as the gold standard to measure concentrations of inhaled anesthetics is the gas chromatography or the mass spectrometry. Other limitations of the study are the number of dropouts, which may have an impact on the study power and the relatively long period of N<sub>2</sub>O pretreatment which weakens the clinical implementation of our results and shorter pretreatment periods like 2 or 3 min may be clinically applicable.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Under the
