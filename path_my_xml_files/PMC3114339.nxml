These studies have provided valuable information that is limited, however, by a short period of observation (12&#x02013;16 h) and by the comparison of NPH with only one long-acting insulin analog, either glargine or detemir. The present randomized cross-over study was undertaken to establish the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the basal insulins NPH, glargine, and detemir in subjects with type 2 diabetes who need insulin.</p><sec id="s5"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>After approval by the local ethical committee, and after receiving informed, written consent, 18 type 2 diabetic subjects on insulin (NPH as basal) and/or oral hypoglycemic agents were recruited (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc10-1911/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>) and studied according to the Helsinki Declaration and GCP requirements. This was a randomized, single-dose, single-blind, three-way, cross-over study that used the previously described euglycemic glucose clamp technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Each subject received the three insulins by assignment to one of three sequences, as directed by a Latin-square design (ABC/BCA/CAB). After a 2-week run-in period, during which the previous treatment was continued, subjects were randomly assigned to a once-daily dose of either NPH (Humulin I; Lilly and Co., Indianapolis, IN), detemir (Levemir; Novo Nordisk, Bagsv&#x000e6;rd, Denmark), or glargine (Lantus; Aventis Pharma, Frankfurt, Germany) at 2200 h for a period of 1 week, during which titration of the dose of basal insulin was continued. After the 7-day treatment, all subjects underwent a euglycemic clamp for 32 h after a 0.4 units/kg subcutaneous injection at 2200 h of the basal insulin they were on (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc10-1911/-/DC1">Supplementary Study Design</ext-link>). On the day of the study, subjects received the last subcutaneous insulin (rapid-acting analog) with the 1200-h meal and fasted afterward. Between 1600 and 2200 h, they received intravenous insulin to normalize plasma glucose, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Then, subjects had a 2-week wash-out period, during which they resumed the basal insulin regimen of the run-in period (NPH). The subjects were then crossed over to the second basal insulin according to the randomization schedule and studied as above and finally moved to the third basal insulin and studied for the third and last time.</p><p>The primary end point was the glucose infusion rate (GIR) over 0&#x02013;32 h (area under the curve [AUC]<sub>0&#x02013;32 h</sub>).

Duration of action was defined as the minimal duration of action and end of insulin action (calculated as the time at which plasma glucose was &#x0003e;118 and 136 mg/dL, respectively). The study ended at the time at which plasma glucose was, for at least 30 min, &#x0003e;150 mg/dL (all definitions in the absence of glucose infusion). Plasma glucose, C-peptide, insulin, glucagon, and nonglucose substrates (free fatty acids, &#x003b2;-hydroxy-butyrate, and glycerol), as well as glucose fluxes, were measured as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc10-1911/-/DC1">Supplementary Analytical Methods</ext-link>).

GIR with NPH increased shortly after the subcutaneous injection at 0400 h, as a result of a rapid suppression of EGP by ~50%, followed by a sensible reduction after 10&#x02013;11 h because of increased EGP, which resulted in a significant increase in plasma glucose. This most likely accounts for the greater risk for nocturnal hypoglycemia reported in clinical studies with NPH versus glargine and detemir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), as well as for the abnormal early-morning increase in blood glucose known as the &#x0201c;dawn phenomenon&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). In the second half of the study, from 1400 h, GIR requirements for NPH and glargine were greater than those for detemir up to the end of the study. Likely, this was the result of the interplay of greater activity of NPH and glargine compared with detemir and the afternoon increased insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). This finding is in line with the observation of more frequent predinner hyperglycemia and/or need for twice-daily detemir dosing in clinical studies compared with glargine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Finally, glargine had greater effects on suppression of lipolysis than NPH and detemir. Compared with detemir only, glargine suppressed more C-peptide and glucagon concentrations. In addition, it had a longer duration of action with lower variability across subjects, as suggested by the smaller interquartile range.</p></sec>
