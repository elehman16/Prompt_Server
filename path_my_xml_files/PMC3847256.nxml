It was a prospective, randomized, open-label, controlled, comparative clinical study, conducted in patients attending the skin out-patient Department of C U Shah Medical College and Hospital, Surendranagar from May 2009 to November 2009. Diagnosis of tinea infections was performed by the Dermatologist. Patients newly diagnosed with tinea infections of skin were included in the study while follow-up cases, pregnant or lactating women, patients having an allergy to imidazoles or allylamines were excluded. All patients were explained about the study and written informed consent was obtained. Patients were randomly allocated in two groups. Group A received topical Whitfield's ointment to be applied twice-a-day for 4 weeks plus oral fluconazole (150 mg once a week for 4 weeks) while Group B received topical 1% butenafine cream twice-a-day for 4 weeks. All patients were administered oral chlorpheniramine maleate (4 mg) twice-a-day for a month to relieve pruritus. Whitfield&#x02019; ointment, fluconazole (150 mg) and 1% butenafine were purchased from the pharmacy store of the hospital.</p><p>Skin scraping was collected on the slides having 1-2 drops of 20% KOH and observed under &#x000d7;10 and &#x000d7;45 of the microscope at each follow-up [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] The scraping were cultured on the plates of Sabouraud's agar supplemented with 1% chloramphenicol in the incubator at 32-35&#x000b0;C for 7-10 days. The species were identified by lactophenol cotton blue preparation. Photographs of both gross cultures and microscopic appearance of lactophenol cotton blue preparation were taken. Patients were followed-up at the interval of 10 days for 4 weeks to assess the relapse.

Normality of the data was checked by Kolmogorov Smirnov test. Mann Whitney test was used to compare the groups with respect to age.

Baseline comparison of sign and symptom score between the groups was performed by Mann Whitney test. Total score of erythema, pruritus and scaling before and after treatment was compared by Wilcoxon matched pair test. Chi-square test was used to compare global evaluation score between both groups at each follow-up. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

In a study by Crevits <italic>et al</italic>., 82% (37/45) of patients by oral fluconazole had shown complete clearance of the lesion, 90% and 88% respectively for tinea corporis and cruris respectively.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Whitfield's ointment produced 67% clinical cure at the end of 3 weeks treatment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>This study demonstrated that 62.74% of the patients were completely cleared with the lesion clinically and mycollogically at the end of second follow-up (20 days) and 98% were completely cleared at third follow-up (30 days) with topical 1% butenafine cream. Present study found 97% of the patients mycologically cured at the end of treatment in both groups. In the study by Tschen <italic>et al</italic>. in interdigital tinea pedis, 88% mycological cure was achieved at the end of for weeks with the treatment of butenafine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] The present study found no statistical significant difference between the two groups in clearing of the lesion and in the development of excellent clinical response (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).

Thus, it can be inferred that Whitfield's ointment plus oral fluconazole is as efficacious as topical 1% butenafine in tinea infections of the skin. Both treatments are safe and provide residual protection for 4 weeks after the completion of therapy. However, Whitfield's ointment plus oral fluconazole is more cost-effective as compared with topical 1% butenafine in tinea infections of the skin.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>We are thankful to the Dean of the institute for allowing us to carry out the study in the hospital and are also grateful to all
