Cortical bone is preferred over cancellous bone because it has a higher concentration of bone inductive proteins and has less antigenicity. This antigenicity is further reduced by the process of freeze drying as it removes more than 95% of water content from the bone. FDBA are osteoconductive that is, they act as a trellis or scaffold over which new host bone can form.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Several commercially available resorbable membranes have been developed with type I collagen as their main component.

This was in accordance with the results of various authors.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] On comparison of test and control arms, there was no significant difference in probing depth at 3 months and 6 months from baseline. These results were contrary to that of Tsao <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] who found a significant difference in vertical bone fill in the control group and test group at 6 months with a mean difference of 1.9 &#x000b1; 1.4 mm and 0.7 &#x000b1; 0.9 mm at 6 months.</p><p>The present study also had a significant decrease in horizontal furcation depth from baseline at 3 months and 6 months with a mean difference of 1.0 &#x000b1; 0.816 mm and 1.6 &#x000b1; 1.26 mm, respectively in test arm. In previous studies,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] similar results were demonstrated with a mean difference of 1.7 &#x000b1; 1.22 mm.</p><p>The RAL assessed for test arm in present study showed significant changes at time interval from 3 months to 6 months and baseline to 6 months with a mean difference of 1.0 &#x000b1; 1.15mm and 1.9 &#x000b1; 1.52 mm, respectively. These were similar to those of Leonardis <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] as they found a significant change in clinical attachment level at 6 months with a mean difference of 2.3 &#x000b1; 0.1 mm. There was no significant change in RAL on comparison of both the groups at any interval.</p><p>The parameters evaluated for regeneration (probing depth, horizontal furcation depth, and RAL) showed positive results attributing to successful periodontal regeneration in Grade II furcation defects treated in test arm. This could be explained by the fact apart from the effect of osteoconductive potential of FDBA which facilitated the formation of new host bone, additional placement of collagen membrane over FDBA could promote periodontal ligament fibroblast and osteoblast cell adhesion and enhance periodontal regeneration via collagen membrane hemostatic and chemotactic function.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>Piattelli <italic>et al</italic>. compared FDBA and DFDBA histologically and histochemically. The results showed that in the DFDBA sites, only those particles which were near the host bone were involved in mineralization whereas on the other hand in the FDBA sites, ethose particles which were even far from the host bone were involved in mineralization and were lined by osteoblasts. These results suggest more of an osteoconductive potential in FDBA than DFDBA.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Moreover, FDBA is economically more viable than DFDBA. Keeping these points in mind, in the present study, FDBA was used with and without bioabsorbable membrane in Grade II furcation defects.</p><p>The limitation of present study were:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Radiographic assessment was not done, as in cases of Grade II furcation radiographic assessment cannot be done only on the basis of Intraoral periapical, it requires advanced radiographic techniques which were not available</p></list-item><list-item><p>Ten defects each were treated in both the arms in the present study and the results demonstrated a lack of statistical difference between both the arms. A larger sample size could have given a statistically significant difference between both the arms.</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-11"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>From this study it could be concluded that:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Grade II furcation defects treated in both control and test arm demonstrated a significant improvement in the probing depth, horizontal furcation depth, and RAL at 6 months postsurgery</p></list-item><list-item><p>There was no statistically significant difference in the results obtained when compared between both the treatment modalities. Hence, further long-term studies with a larger sample size, radiographic assessment, and quality of bone assessment are required to substantiate the efficacy of FDBA with and without bioabsorbable GTR membrane in the treatment of Grade II furcation defects.</p></list-item></list>
