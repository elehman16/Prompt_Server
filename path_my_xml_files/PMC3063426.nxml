Calculated sample size per group was 13, considering &#x003b1; = 0.05, study power = 80%, effect size = 1, and SD = Range/6. Eligible patients were recruited from the registered patients at IMSS. Inclusion criteria were age of 18 to 55 years, clinically definite MS (according to McDonald criteria)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> with disease duration of less than two years, RRMS disease course, and baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale score (EDSS) of less than 6.0. Those with a clinical relapse within two months prior to enrollment, prior use of immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive drugs, women who were pregnant, lactating, or of childbearing age who did not consent to approved contraceptive use during the study, those with abnormal blood tests performed during the screening studies, and patients with other major medical illnesses (e.g. cancer, significant gastrointestinal disease, immunodeficiency, or other autoimmune diseases) were excluded from the study. Informed consent was obtained from all patients after full explanation of the study aim and protocol and the ethical approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Intervention</title><p>Patients were randomized into MMF (n = 13) and placebo (n = 13) groups using table of random numbers generated by random allocation software.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> Weekly intramuscular IFNB-1a started for all patients. Patients in the MMF group received oral MMF (500 mg Tablet) started at 500 mg daily for one week, weekly escalated by 500 mg daily, until a target dose of 2000 mg daily (1000 mg every 12 hours) was achieved and then continued it for 12 months. Placebo was administered with the same daily schedule as of MMF in the placebo arm. Compliance was checked during the study by the treating physician in interviews with patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Assessments</title><p>The primary outcome of the study was the number of new T2 lesions and new Gd-enhancing lesions in MRI evaluation after one year of therapy. The MRI was performed with a Philips 1.5T scanner. Two radiologists, blinded to the treatment arms, were responsible for MRI evaluations. The secondary outcomes included relapse rate and changes in the EDSS score. Physical examination, monitoring of adverse effects, and laboratory studies including complete blood count with differential, liver function tests (LFT), blood urea nitrogen; and creatinine were performed at baseline and then at months 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12. EDSS assessment and brain MRI were performed at baseline and then after one year of therapy. Relapses during the study were documented by a single neurologist and treated by intravenous methylprednisolone 1g/day for three consecutive days.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using SPSS version 16.0.

According to the results, MMF in combination with IFNB-1a has no more significant effects over IFNB-1a alone on clinical (relapse rate, EDSS) or paraclinical (number of new T2 or Gd-enhancment lesions in MRI) measures in relatively new cases of MS without history of previous IFNB therapy.</p><p>Current disease-modifying therapies for RRMS include IFNB preparations and glatiramer acetate, but in considerable amount of patients, these therapies are only partially effective and patients usually have break-through disease activity despite therapy with these agents.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> Therefore, there is a need for additional treatment options in MS, e.g. combination therapies to enhance the effectiveness of these relatively safe drugs.</p><p>Evidence has suggested the ability of MMF in a treatment of a variety of inflammatory disorders including systemic lupus erythematosus, myastheniagravis, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, polymyositis, and neuromyelitis optica.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> Evidence on the efficacy and safety of MMF in the treatment of MS are also available. Open-labeled studies involving MS patients treated with MMF suggested tolerability and potential efficacy of this drug.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> In a recently published randomized trial, Frohman et al. compared MMF with IFNB and found similar effects of MMF compared with IFNB on inflammatory brain MRI indices including the cumulative mean number of new Gd-enhancing lesions, new T2 lesions, and combined active lesions and disability measures including EDSS scores and multiple sclerosis functional composite.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref> To the best of our knowledge there is no report from placebocontrolled study on the tolerability and potential efficacy of combining MMF with IFNB. Vermersch and colleagues in an openlabeled pilot safety study evaluated the effect of adding MMF to IFNB-1a in 30 patients with RRMS refractory to IFNB-1a and found clinical and radiographic benefits as well as acceptable safety.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> The results of the present study, however, did not show statistically significant effect of combining MMF with IFNB, which is probably due to the small sample size of the study and relatively short duration of observation. Although data are available on the safety of MMF in MS pa-tients, considering the possible severe side effects of MMF, we could not enroll more patients for investigation. Previous studies have included MS patients who were refractory to IFNB therapy, but in our study we included patients with no history of treatment with IFNB because we aimed to find the effect of such combination in new cases of MS to see if we could prevent relapse and further progression of disease to more progressive types. Therefore, since the differences were not significant between the groups, larger sample size is needed to detect smaller differences. According to the results of the present study, at least 64 patients per group are needed for a more reliable analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of this study showed that MMF is a safe medication when combined with IFNB, considering clinical and laboratory measures. However, we were unable to show significant clinical or radiological improvements for the MMF over placebo in MS patients under IFNB therapy. It should be considered that this was a pilot study and had limitations and most importantly the sample size was small. Considering the observed safety of the combination, controlled trials with a larger sample size and longer followups are recommended in this regard.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>Conflict of Interests</title><p>Authors have no conflict of interests.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>Authors&#x02019; Contributions</title><p>The principal idea was from ME, who also participated in designing and conducting the study, as well as editing the manuscript.
