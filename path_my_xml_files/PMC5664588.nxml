Lotilaner, a novel isoxazoline, is rapidly absorbed following administration of a flavored chewable tablet formulation (Credelio&#x02122;), providing at least 98% efficacy for at least 1&#x000a0;month following assessments at 48&#x000a0;h post-treatment, and following subsequent challenges. A study was conducted to determine the speed with which lotilaner kills ticks.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">From 38 dogs, the 32 with the highest <italic>Ixodes ricinus</italic> counts from a Day -4 infestation were randomized among four groups: two groups were untreated controls, two received lotilaner tablets at a minimum dose rate of 20&#x000a0;mg/kg. Infestations with <italic>I. ricinus</italic> were performed on Days -2, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35. Counts were completed 4 and 8&#x000a0;h post-treatment (Day 0), and 8 and 12&#x000a0;h following subsequent infestations. All live ticks were incubated for 24&#x000a0;h following removal from study dogs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">At 4&#x000a0;h post-treatment, there was a 69.8% reduction in geometric mean live tick counts in treated dogs compared to controls. After incubation, the reduction increased to 97.2%. At 8&#x000a0;h after treatment, pre- and post-incubation reductions were 99.2 and 100%, respectively. Following post-treatment challenges, post-incubation efficacy through Day 28 at 8 and 12&#x000a0;h was at least 94.3 and 98.0%, respectively, and was 85.7 and 94.2% at 8 and 12&#x000a0;h after the Day 35 challenge. Mean live tick counts in the lotilaner groups were significantly lower than in the control groups at all assessments through Day 35 at 8 (<italic>t</italic>

The geographical expansion of tick species and growing incidence of diseases caused by the pathogens they transmit has been attributed to man-made changes in land use, to socio-economic changes with the expansion of human habitats into new areas such as woodlands, to wildlife migration, and to the international transport of animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">The discovery of a novel family of compounds, the isoxazolines, is providing a valuable addition to the measures that are available for the management of tick infestations, and for reducing the risk of dogs contracting tick-borne diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. When administered orally to dogs, the isoxazolines offer a means of tick control that does not require the owner to carefully apply a product directly onto the dog&#x02019;s skin to ensure optimal effectiveness. Other benefits of orally administered products compared to those that are topically applied link to the absence of concerns of reduced effectiveness with varying climatic conditions, of exposure of treated animals to water during swimming or bathing, and of potential pesticide exposure of household family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Lotilaner is a novel isoxazoline that is rapidly absorbed following oral administration to dogs. Following treatment, insecticidal and acaricidal activity is then maintained for at least 30&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Studies completed for registration showed that against <italic>Ixodes scapularis</italic>, <italic>Ixodes ricinus</italic>, <italic>Dermacentor variabilis</italic>, <italic>Dermacentor reticulatus</italic>, <italic>Rhipicephalus sanguineus</italic> and <italic>Amblyomma americanum</italic>, lotilaner eliminated 100% of tick burdens 48&#x000a0;h after treatment of existing infestations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Lotilaner effectiveness of at least 98% was sustained against each of those species at 48&#x000a0;h after weekly challenges for at least 4&#x000a0;weeks. Nonetheless, by 48&#x000a0;h post-infestation, ticks may have sufficient time to transfer pathogens to a host, with the risk of transfer increasing from the time the tick first begins to attach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. There was therefore a need to determine lotilaner&#x02019;s sustained speed of kill (SOK) against new tick challenges throughout the product protection period of at least 1&#x000a0;month. To address this need a study was designed with the primary objective of determining the SOK of lotilaner flavored chewable tablets following a single oral administration, at a minimum dose rate of 20&#x000a0;mg/kg.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par13">This blinded, randomised, parallel-group laboratory study was carried out in accordance with the protocol and in compliance with the VICH guideline on Good Clinical Practice (GCP; VICH GL 9), and in compliance with the relevant national legislation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

For inclusion dogs were required to be healthy, to be older than 7&#x000a0;months at the initiation of the acclimation period and to have had a live tick attachment rate of at least 25% of applied female ticks from an infestation applied on Day -4. Dogs were excluded if during the previous 60&#x000a0;days they had been involved in any study or were treated with any compounds having activity against ticks. Dogs were also excluded if they had been treated with any isoxazoline compounds within the prior 6&#x000a0;months. Selected dogs ranged in age from 15 to 85&#x000a0;months and weighed from 10.7 to 17.5&#x000a0;kg. To facilitate tick counting and tick infestation, each dog was individually housed before infesting with ticks. Between tick challenges, dogs were pair-housed in caged concrete-floored pens. For the duration of the study, the temperature remained between 17 and 19&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and the humidity ranged between 42 and 69%. Lighting was controlled to give approximately 10&#x000a0;h light and 14&#x000a0;h darkness per 24&#x000a0;h period. When tick counting occurred during the 14-h dark period the lights were turned on prior to the start of the tick count and turned off after the tick count was completed.

The first four males formed a block, the next four males formed a second block and so on until four blocks of four males had been formed, and the same process was followed for females. Animals within a block were then assigned to the four study groups using random order numbers derived from Fisher and Yates tables.</p><p id="Par17">Groups 1 and 2 were mock-dosed untreated controls. Groups 3 and 4 were treated on Day 0 with lotilaner flavored tablets at as close as possible to the minimum dose rate of 20&#x000a0;mg/kg.

Each dog was observed for successful intake of the dose immediately after administration, at 30&#x000a0;min (&#x000b1; 5&#x000a0;min) and at 1&#x000a0;h (&#x000b1; 10&#x000a0;min) after administration.

Dogs were sedated prior to application of the ticks by intramuscular injection of 0.04&#x000a0;ml/kg medetomidine hydrochloride (1&#x000a0;mg/ml) which, after infestations, was reversed by intramuscular injection of atipamezole hydrochloride (5&#x000a0;mg/ml) at a dose rate of 0.04&#x000a0;ml/kg. Tick infestations were completed on Days -6, -2, 7, and then weekly through Day 35. Vials with the correct number of ticks were shaken until none were clinging to the container.

Ticks were removed carefully, using a removal device, to ensure they were not damaged.</p><p id="Par20">The numbers of live attached and live free ticks on the dogs were counted. Since male <italic>I. ricinus</italic> ticks do not attach, they were not included in the count and were discarded in methylated spirits. Ticks were considered alive if legs reacted to a tactile or exhaled air (CO<sub>2</sub>) stimulus and were considered dead if they did not. Dogs were not sedated for tick counts. To ensure that all ticks had been located, personnel checked each dog&#x02019;s body very carefully, moving the fur against the grain. Examination time was at least 5&#x000a0;min. Following tick removal, all animals were combed to ensure no further ticks were present.</p><p id="Par21">All live attached and live free ticks removed from the dogs were counted and placed into containers, each with a vented cap, which were immediately transferred to an incubator at 26.1&#x02013;28.8&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and 74&#x02013;88% relative humidity.

There were three observations of adverse events in treated dogs: one dog had an incident of dark red feces with normal consistency, one had edema of the dermis due to a tick bite reaction and one dog had a superficial bite wound. None of these events were attributed to treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par30">The experimental methodology was validated, as at least 25% on average of the applied female <italic>I. ricinus</italic> ticks were attached to control dogs at each assessment. Additionally, the continued viability of the pre- and post-incubation ticks from these control groups, with no significant difference in live tick numbers before and after incubation, validated the incubation methodology in determining that the live ticks taken from lotilaner-treated dogs subsequently died as a result of the treatment. The rapid onset of lotilaner&#x02019;s acaricidal activity in this study is consistent with the SOK demonstrated against fleas and can be attributed to the rapid achievement of maximum blood concentrations within 2&#x000a0;h of administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. As in laboratory studies using <italic>Ctenocephalides felis</italic> infestations, the high effectiveness of lotilaner in this study was maintained through 35&#x000a0;days when assessments of tick mortality were made at 12&#x000a0;h after each challenge.</p><p id="Par31">Conclusions concerning between-product comparisons when studies are completed in different laboratories under different (albeit similar) conditions must be guarded. Nonetheless, the pre-incubation onset of tick SOK by lotilaner in this study appeared to match or compare favorably with reports from other isoxazoline studies (which did not include post-incubation effectiveness data). In our study, at 8&#x000a0;h post-treatment lotilaner pre-incubation efficacy against <italic>I. ricinus</italic> was 99.2%, while efficacies for sarolaner and fluralaner at this time point were 76.7 and 97.9%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. For afoxolaner no data are available for the 8-h post-treatment time point, but at 12&#x000a0;h post-treatment it was found to be 93.4% effective against <italic>I. ricinus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], implying a somewhat slower onset of activity than was observed for lotilaner in this study.</p><p id="Par32">Reports of the post-treatment effectiveness of lotilaner provide support for its favorable sustained SOK relative to other isoxazolines. At the end of the labeled 1&#x000a0;month effectiveness period at 8 and 12&#x000a0;h post-challenge, mean tick count reductions for lotilaner (using pre-incubation results) were 75.9 and 97.5%, respectively. At these time points, following treatment with sarolaner, reductions in mean counts of <italic>I. ricinus</italic> compared to untreated controls were 23.2 and 94.9%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. For afoxolaner, 12&#x000a0;h post-challenge on Day 28, <italic>I ricinus</italic> tick count reductions were just 38.5% compared to an untreated control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">Other studies have demonstrated that lotilaner was highly effective against <italic>I. scapularis, D. variabilis</italic> and <italic>R. sanguineus</italic> when assessments were completed at 48&#x000a0;h following challenges through 35&#x000a0;days after treatment, and against <italic>A. americanum</italic> when challenges were completed 28&#x000a0;days after treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. To date, there have been no reports of the SOK of any isoxazoline against <italic>D. variabilis</italic>, <italic>R. sanguineus</italic> and <italic>A. americanum</italic>, and it is hoped that further studies with these species can confirm that they are as susceptible as <italic>I. ricinus</italic> to lotilaner and to the other isoxazolines.</p><p id="Par34">Transmission of pathogens such as <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic>, <italic>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</italic>, <italic>Rickettsia</italic> and <italic>Bartonella</italic> species from tick to host typically appears to begin from 24 to 36&#x000a0;h after a tick begins to attach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The possibility of earlier transmission cannot be completely discounted because of the extrusion of substances from a tick&#x02019;s salivary glands during the process of attachment.</p><p id="Par35">There is conflicting evidence as to whether systemically acting isoxazolines could be as effective as topically acting chemicals, which may have some repellent activity, in reducing the risk of tick-borne pathogen transmission. In one study, topical permethrin showed a significantly faster activity against ticks than afoxolaner and fluralaner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Following challenge with <italic>R. sanguineus</italic>, there was no evidence of <italic>Ehrlichia canis</italic> transmission to permethrin-treated dogs, while transmission was demonstrated into four of eight dogs treated with afoxalaner and two of eight treated with fluralaner. The absence of evidence of <italic>E. canis</italic> transmission to the permethrin group was attributed to permethrin preventing tick attachment. That conclusion is in conflict with another study which found that throughout a month following treatment there were more live ticks on permethrin-treated than on sarolaner-treated dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Regardless, the speed with which ticks are killed is important, and the faster the death of the tick, or at least the faster feeding is completely stopped, the lower the probability of disease transmission.</p><p id="Par36">Isoxazolines have been shown to induce a paralysis in insect and acarine parasites through blockade of distinct binding sites on &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid- and glutamate-gated chloride channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In vitro, the onset of the neurological effects of isoxazolines on insects has been observed to occur within 10&#x000a0;min of exposure, progressing through incoordination to prostration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Thus the actual time for insects and acarines to be classified as dead is longer than the time at which the paralyzing effects of the treatment occur. As an affected tick becomes moribund, these effects would likely interfere with engorgement and transmission of pathogens. Specific investigation is now needed to determine the degree to which lotilaner might interrupt or prevent such transmission.</p><p id="Par37">The data presented in this paper indicate that lotilaner at least matches, and has the potential to exceed those of other tick control products in quickly killing ticks present at the time of treatment, and in providing a sustained rapid SOK throughout and beyond the monthly re-treatment period. As such, used as a product to control flea and tick infestations, lotilaner has potential as a safe and effective means of reducing the incidence of disease caused by tick-borne pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par38">Lotilaner administered orally to dogs at a minimum dose rate of 20&#x000a0;mg/kg began to kill <italic>I. ricinus</italic> ticks within 4&#x000a0;h of treatment and was 100% effective against existing infestations within 8&#x000a0;h. Relative to an untreated control group, lotilaner reduced mean <italic>I. ricinus</italic> live tick counts by 94.3% as soon as 8&#x000a0;h after challenges through 28&#x000a0;days after treatment. At 12&#x000a0;h after these infestations, lotilaner effectiveness of at least 94.2% was sustained through 35&#x000a0;days after treatment. Lotilaner has therefore been shown to be a valuable tool for achieving a rapid effect on existing tick infestations and for providing ongoing sustained rapid speed of kill in the four to 5&#x000a0;weeks following treatment. By quickly killing ticks that infest dogs, lotilaner has the potential to help limit the transmission of tick-borne pathogens.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec11"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par45">
