Further exclusion criteria included acute or chronic respiratory disease based on symptoms and respiratory function test results, systemic arterial hypertension, and evidence of previous or present cardiac disease based on symptoms, 12-lead electrocardiography, or Doppler echocardiography. Subjects who participated in trials with continuous positive airway pressure devices in the previous six months were also eliminated from the study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-cln_65p393">7</xref></p><p>The study protocol was approved by the local Ethics Review Committee, and all participants signed written informed consent forms.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>After consenting to participate in the study, all of the patients were evaluated for the presence of vascular or metabolic disease (i.e., arterial hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, hyper-cholesterolemia, and diabetes mellitus) and smoking habits.

Each participant received two coded envelopes, one containing the drug and the other containing the placebo, and was asked to randomly select one of the envelopes and take the pill that was inside at bedtime.

The following measurements were collected: an electroencephalogram (at positions C3-A2, C4-A1, and O1-A2 of the International 10&#x02013;20 System), a bilateral electrooculogram, a submental electromyogram, and an electrocardiogram (modified V<sub>2</sub> lead).</p><p>Respiration was monitored as follows: airflow was measured with a nasal cannula/pressure transducer system (Pro-Tech Services Inc; Mukilteo, WA, USA) and a mouth thermocouple; chest and abdominal efforts were measured with uncalibrated, inductive, respiratory plethysmographic belts; arterial oxygen saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>) was measured with pulse oximetry (Ohmeda Hatfield, Herts., England), and body position movements were measured with a mercury gauge. Body position was determined by a sensor.

The minimum duration of an event was ten seconds. The apnea hypopnea index was defined as the total number of apneas and hypopneas/hour of TST. Obstructive AHI was defined as the number of obstructive apneas plus hypopneas/hours of TST, mixed AHI was defined as mixed apneas plus hypopneas/hours of TST, and central AHI was defined as central apneas plus hypopneas/hours of TST. The percentage of TST spent in apnea/hypopnea events (%TST AH) was calculated to estimate the duration of respiratory events during sleep. The desaturation index (DI) corresponded to the number of arterial oxygen desaturations (with a drop greater than 4%) per hour of TST. The percentage of TST spent with less than 90% oxyhemoglobin saturation (Sat O<sub>2</sub>&#x0003c;90%) was also measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Heart rate variability</title><p>Frequency domain analysis of HRV<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-cln_65p393">21</xref> was performed for the central five-minute sample of the longest interval of SWS and REM sleep that was free of stage shifts, artifacts or arousals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-cln_65p393">22</xref> Additional frequency domain analysis of HRV was carried out in one-minute samples during apnea and after the opening of the upper airway in SWS and REM.

We used short-term frequency domain analysis throughout the sleeping period and paid special attention to high-frequency and low-frequency ranges.</p><p>Our previous study found that sildenafil was correlated with impaired respiratory parameters during sleep (e.g., mean values of saturation, desaturation, apnea hypopnea index and desaturation index) that were not followed by an increase in the respiratory arousal index.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-cln_65p393">7</xref> This study found that sildenafil was correlated with an increase in HF<sub>nu</sub> and a decrease in the LF/HF components of HRV during SWS but not during REM sleep. We examined the mean difference in HRV parameters (&#x00394;) between post-apnea and apnea events and identified a trend toward a reduced modification of LF<sub>nu</sub> and of the LF/HF components of HRV during REM sleep with sildenafil in comparison to the placebo.</p><p>These findings suggest that, in patients with severe OSA, a single dose of sildenafil (50 mg) before sleep affects sleep HRV, with predominance of parasympathetic upon sympathetic tone. This was evident in SWS, but not in REM, in which greater sympathetic tone typically occurs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-cln_65p393">12</xref> Furthermore, the trend toward less modification of LF<sub>nu</sub> and of the LF/HF components of HRV during REM sleep with sildenafil suggests that either the increased LF overshadows the HF increment in this sleep stage or that a ceiling effect occurs in the sympathetic tone that is related to the severity of respiratory events.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-cln_65p393">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-cln_65p393">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-cln_65p393">16</xref></p><p>In the evaluation of post-apnea and apnea modification in HRV, the first open breath was excluded because of the typical surge of sympathetic activity triggered by hypoxia or by the activation of carotid and/or aortic chemoreceptors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-cln_65p393">27</xref> As found in previous studies (see Younes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-cln_65p393">27</xref> for reviews), the amplitude of the modification of HRV parameters had relatively little influence on the number of apnea events in these patients.</p><p>This research is clinically important because abnormal autonomic control is a key factor in the causal link between OSA and cardiovascular disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-cln_65p393">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-cln_65p393">16</xref> Apnea is associated with increased circulating norepinephrine and with the loss of vagal tone, a combination that may underlie life-threatening arrhythmias.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-cln_65p393">28</xref> Long-term complications, i.e., hypertension, myocardial infarction, and stroke, may result from repeated temporary loss of NO in tissues. This loss of NO is produced by a lack of oxygen, one of the two essential substrates of NO.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-cln_65p393">10</xref> Manipulation of the NO/cyclic GMP system may therefore be a therapeutic option in this circumstance. Our finding that the HF component of HRV increases in severe OSA patients after the use of sildenafil shows that caution must be exercised when changes in HRV spectral indices are interpreted to represent changes in vagal or sympathetic activities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-cln_65p393">29</xref> Sometimes, estimates of HF do reflect heart rate variability;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-cln_65p393">30</xref> instead, they reflect both non-respiratory sinus arrhythmia and respiratory instability. The emergence of hyperpneic breaths following the termination of apnea can increase estimates of HF, leading to the erroneous interpretation of increased vagal tone during these episodes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-cln_65p393">31</xref></p><p>The influence of sleep stage on respiration and HRV has been reviewed in detail.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-cln_65p393">12</xref> The shift from wakefulness to non-REM sleep is accompanied by a progressive increase in parasympathetic modulation and a decrease in sympathetic modulation of the heart rate. On the other hand, REM sleep, which typically occurs at 90-minute intervals, is associated with significantly greater sympathetic modulation than non-REM sleep. In addition, ventilation and breathing patterns vary according to sleep stage; non-uniform ventilatory patterns can substantially influence LF and HF, particularly in sleep-disordered breathing conditions. High-frequency power is closely associated with the respiratory modulation of heart rate, commonly known as respiratory sinus arrhythmia. Both tidal volume and breathing frequency compromise the reliability of the HF component of HRV as a measure of parasympathetic activity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-cln_65p393">31</xref></p><p>Clinically, OSA is a REM-sleep related disease; obstructive events occur more frequently, for a longer duration of time, and with more desaturation of oxyhemoglobin during REM sleep than non-REM sleep.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-cln_65p393">32</xref> Variable surges in sympathetic activity are associated with a range of arousal events. Arousals can vary from increases in muscular and respiratory activity to sleep stage shifts and full awakening.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-cln_65p393">33</xref> Changes at the cortical level may not be visible in SWS because the magnitude of the autonomic activation is lower than in light and REM sleep. Previous studies reported that around 30% of apneas/hypopneas, particularly in NREM sleep, are not terminated by visible cortical arousals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-cln_65p393">34</xref> The present study provides evidence that, after administration of sildenafil, either hypoxemia or increased upper airway resistance due to nasal congestion may lead to a lack of arousals during SWS as a response to apneas and hypopneas. The same was not observed in REM sleep due to eased sympathovagal balance and arousability.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-cln_65p393">35</xref> Exacerbation of obstruction and an increase in inspiratory effort make upper airway pressure even more negative. An ineffective pharyngeal dilator reflex may also impair arousal and lead to central apnea events in OSA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-cln_65p393">28</xref></p><p>It is also possible that the profound change in respiratory pattern observed in the cases of severe OSA in this study may have had a direct influence on the excitatory drive of peripheral and central chemoreceptors after sildenafil administration. In addition to a direct effect on chemoreceptor afferent input, an indirect action at the level of central respiratory drive may profoundly influence vagal efferent activity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-cln_65p393">36</xref> The predominant cholinergic control of airway smooth muscle at the level of the neuro-effector junction has recently been reviewed in detail by Jordan<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-cln_65p393">36</xref> and the anatomical organization of airway pathways in the brainstem has been reviewed by Mazzone and Canning.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-cln_65p393">37</xref> The data presented in this study also raise important questions about the role of NO in the responsiveness of the cerebral vasculature to changes in blood gas tension as well as to sildenafil. NO plays a direct role in obstructive apnea events; during these events, there is an intermittent failure to transport nasal NO to the lungs with each breath and a decrease in NO synthesis due to the lack of oxygen.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-cln_65p393">38</xref> In this context, sildenafil, a PDE-5 inhibitor, potentially impairs NO-dependent protective mechanisms of adaptation to intermittent hypoxia. For example, it may affect the compensatory mechanism that matches perfusion to ventilation and alter efferent pathways that control the activity of pharyngeal dilators and thoracic musculature.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-cln_65p393">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-cln_65p393">39</xref></p><p>Furthermore, neuronal and endothelial NO exerts an inhibitory nitrergic influence on both inotropic and chronotropic cardiac responses to adrenergic stimulation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-cln_65p393">40</xref> NO acts to increase acetylcholine release in cholinergic neurons. Conversely, NO generated in the sympathetic ganglia reduces the release of noradrenaline.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-cln_65p393">41</xref></p><p>The results of our study are also supported by the findings of Chowdhary et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-cln_65p393">42</xref> which demonstrated that enhancement of baroreflex gain by NO may underlie the modulation of cardiac vagal control. An increase in HF, but not in LF, was observed with NO-synthetase drug inhibitors and exogenous NO donors.</p><p>In addition to the reported involvement of NO in sleep termination, other studies have reported that NO<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-cln_65p393">43</xref> has a somnogenic effect in OSA patients (see Gautier-Sauvign&#x000e9;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-cln_65p393">44</xref> for a review of this literature). These studies support our finding that the use of sildenafil is associated with blunted arousal response to respiratory events during sleep.</p><p>Our data on the modification of HRV components between post-apnea and apnea events are heterogeneous; this may highlight the individual pattern of collapsibility of the upper airway and of ventilatory instability. The degree of airway collapsibility and the necessary effort required to open it are inversely proportional to and dependent on the degree of arousal.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-cln_65p393">45</xref></p><p>Several methodological considerations must be acknowledged. These include the application of HRV analysis to non-stationary conditions such as sleep in OSA patients. To overcome this difficulty, we used spectral analysis of central 5-minute samples of the longest interval of SWS and REM sleep that was free of stage shifts, artifacts or arousals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-cln_65p393">23</xref> However, because AHI was high, particularly after the use of sildenafil, it was not possible to obtain five-minute samples of SWS or REM sleep that were free of apnea or hypopnea events; adjustments for respiration were performed in the spectra of the selected samples.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-cln_65p393">24</xref></p><p>This study has several limitations. First, we estimated changes in heart frequency using HRV rather than baroreceptor reactivity. However, it was not feasible to perform recordings of baroreflex or vagal efferent activity which are supposedly impaired during sleep in severe OSA patients. Second, overnight measures of CO<sub>2</sub> and the number of central sleep apnea events would provide additional information regarding chemoreceptor influence on HRV parameters. Third, sildenafil is designed to influence penile erection for 2 to 5 hours; this is less time than a full night of sleep. However, little is known about the duration of the other effects of this drug. Further studies of long-term PDE-5 inhibitors such as vardenafil and of daily sildenafil doses are needed to improve our understanding of this group of drugs. Finally, the small sample size of this study raises questions about the applicability of results. The data from the 13 patients, however, show a consistently low ratio of arousals and apnea/hypopnea events during SWS and REM sleep, as well as increased desaturation and lower saturation after the use of sildenafil. Additionally, because all eligible recorded apneas/hypopneas were similarly analyzed, the large amount of data may be representative of the characteristics of the respiratory events.</p><p>The lack of increase in the arousal index during SWS may suggest a link between the worsening of OSA and HRV abnormalities after sildenafil. These findings provide evidence of a potential risk of sildenafil use by OSA patients with cardiovascular disease. Our data support Stein et al.&#x02019;s suggestion that increases in HF estimates do not always reflect better heart rate variability.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-cln_65p393">30</xref></p><p>In conclusion, the decrease in arousal response to apnea/ hypopnea events along with the increase in HF and decrease in LH/HF components of heart rate variability during SWS suggest that, in addition to worsening sleep apnea, sildenafil has potentially immediate cardiac effects in patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This study was
