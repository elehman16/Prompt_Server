These antibiotics may affect the function of normal bowel flora, cause overgrowth of unfavourable species such as <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>, <italic>Candida</italic>, <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, <italic>Klebsiella</italic> and <italic>Clostridium</italic> or cause changes in intestinal mucosa and motility.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> These changes often present as antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD), which is distressing to both patients and carers and may result in poor compliance with antibiotic therapy.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The frequency of AAD depends on the definition of diarrhoea and the age of the patient but is estimated to be between 11% and 30% for children on oral antibiotics.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Probiotics are often recommended on the assumption that ingestion of &#x02018;healthy&#x02019; bacteria will reduce the disturbance of gut microbiota and subsequent diarrhoea.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Like pharmaceuticals, different probiotics exert different actions and have different effects. A number of clinical trials have used probiotics for the prevention of AAD. These studies have used a range of probiotics and have shown variable results. Meta-analyses show equivocal results due to the lack of homogeneity between studies.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Sub-group analyses of the meta-analyses showed a significant reduction in AAD with the use of probiotics, namely <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> GG (LGG) and <italic>Saccharomyces boulardii.</italic><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;10</xref> A number of methods have been used to administer these probiotics, including capsules, tablets and yogurts.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>

<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and the doses vary between studies, from 10<sup>7</sup> to 10<sup>10</sup> colony-forming units (CFU).<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Studies on adults in hospital settings have shown LGG can be used to treat vancomycin resistant Enterococcus<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and prevent AAD and <italic>Clostridium difficile </italic>associated diarrhoea.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In the paediatric setting, studies have tested probiotic tablets and powders for the prevention of AAD. Currently there is only one study examining probiotic yogurt that included children, but no studies have been done solely on children to examine the efficacy of an LGG containing probiotic yogurt.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Probiotic yogurt/drinks are increasingly seen as attractive vehicles for delivery of probiotics because they are easily available, economical, easy to swallow, generally well tolerated and provide added energy, vitamins, minerals and protein when children are unwell. In Australia, the only commercially available yogurt containing LGG comes as a combination with <italic>Bifidobacterium lactis</italic> (Bb-12) and <italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic> (La-5).</p><p>Previous studies<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> assessing the effect of probiotics for patients on antibiotics have focused only on the presence or absence of AAD. The WHO defines diarrhoea as three loose stools a day for two or more days.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> This approach fails to address the spectrum of type and severity of GI symptoms, which can range from minor to serious. Even minor symptoms may have an impact on children, their parents and compliance with treatment. Additionally, researchers have used different definitions of diarrhoea with differences in what frequency (two or three times a day for two consecutive days) constitutes diarrhoea, and the term &#x02018;loose&#x02019; has not always been quantified.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>

<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Although each study will be internally consistent, the different definitions do not allow for the comparison of absolute rates between different studies. Consequently, we have presented our results with a range of diarrhoea definitions, permitting a better understanding of both disease severity and comparison with previous work.</p><p>This study investigates the efficacy of yogurt containing LGG (strain deposit number (SDN) ATCC53103), Bb-12 (SDN DSM15954) and La-5 (SDN DSM13241), compared to a placebo, in reducing the rate of AAD in children on antibiotics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>This was a multisite stratified (prior history of AAD/no prior history of AAD), randomised, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled clinical trial. The study took place in two general practices and four pharmacies in Launceston, a regional town in Tasmania, Australia, with a catchment area of 100&#x02005;000 people. General practitioners/pharmacists approached parents who presented with outpatient children aged 1&#x02013;12&#x02005;years prescribed broad-spectrum oral antibiotics. Children were excluded if they had a history of milk allergy or intolerance, antibiotic treatment within the previous 2&#x02005;months, prophylactic antibiotic treatment, use of a probiotic product for medicinal purposes within the previous 7&#x02005;days, immunodeficiency, chronic GI disease and acute or chronic diarrhoea. Parents were fully informed about the aims of the study, and written informed consent was obtained from at least one parent. The Human Research Ethics Committee (Tasmania) Network, Australia approved the study protocol (H0010498).</p><p>Using data from Koning's study,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> a sample size of 58 compared using a t test (1.5 stools/day, SD 0.5/day) would detect a minimum relative reduction in frequency of 25% (power 80%; &#x003b1; 0.05). The reduction of 25% was chosen after informal discussion with clinicians as to what effect size they would consider significant enough to recommend the use of probiotic yogurt to patients they commenced on antibiotics. A sample size of 70 completed was chosen with 20% over-sampling as it was planned to use ordered logistical regression. The statistical methods were revised before the data analysis was commenced. To better understand the extent of the GI distress, we chose to use different definitions of diarrhoea as the outcome measure and this mandated time to event analyses (Cox proportional hazards regression).</p><p>A statistician generated independent allocation sequences and randomisation lists for each study site, using the random number generator in Microsoft Excel. As prior AAD has been shown to be a predictor of subsequent AAD, participants were stratified on their history of AAD.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> To avoid a disproportionate number of patients between treatment groups, randomisation at each site was performed in blocks of 10 (5 placebo and 5 probiotic). To ensure allocation concealment, an independent person oversaw the packaging and labelling of trial treatments based on the randomisation schedule. All investigators, participants, outcome assessors and data analysts were blinded to the assigned treatment throughout the study.</p><p>Children received yogurt (2&#x000d7;100&#x02005;g tubs/day) from the start to the end of their antibiotic treatment. The probiotic yogurt (Vaalia, a commonly available brand in supermarkets) contained LGG (mean dose 5.2&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>&#x02005;CFU/day), Bb-12 (mean dose 5.9&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>&#x02005;CFU/day) and La-5 (mean dose 8.3&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>&#x02005;CFU/day). In contrast, the placebo yogurt was a pasteurised yogurt containing <italic>S thermophilus</italic> (mean dose 4.4&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup>&#x02005;CFU/day) and <italic>L bulgaricus</italic> (mean dose 1.2&#x000d7;10<sup>3</sup>&#x02005;CFU/day). Both the probiotic and the placebo yogurt were supplied by Parmalat (Brisbane, Queensland, Australia) who had no role in the formulation or conduct of the study or in the data analysis or interpretation. An independent laboratory assessed the CFU content. The yogurt was in 100&#x02005;g containers with identical labels. The yogurts were similar in taste but one yogurt was thinner in texture. Participants were only shown the yogurt they were going to use and did not have the opportunity to make a comparison. Instructions were provided on giving the yogurt and maintaining a diary for the duration of treatment plus 1&#x02005;week. This time was chosen as the average onset of diarrhoea after commencement of antibiotics in children is 5.3&#x000b1;3.5&#x02005;days (range 0&#x02013;15&#x02005;days).<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>On enrolment, baseline data for age, sex, weight, antibiotic and dose, usual bowel frequency and history of prior AAD was collected. Information on prior history of AAD was used for stratification during randomisation. Parents were given a diagrammatic representation of the Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) for children<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and shown how to rate their children's stool for consistency. They were also provided with a diary to record information on stool frequency and consistency, antibiotic and yogurt consumption (both trial and any other yogurt) and adverse symptoms.</p><p>The primary outcome was the efficacy of probiotic yogurt in prevention of diarrhoea, classified at different levels of severity: for example, less severe (stool frequency &#x02265;2/day for 2 or more days with stool consistency &#x02265;5 on the BSS); more severe (stool frequency &#x02265;3/day for 2 or more days with stool consistency &#x02265;6 on the BSS).</p><p>The raw data of stool frequency and consistency was processed into a series of categories representing thresholds for different levels of disease severity (which were analysed based on event frequency), and then also analysed based on the time of first occurrence (event dated from the start of symptoms) of: stool frequency of two or more a day; stool frequency of three or more a day; stool consistency of type 5 (soft blobs with clear-cut edges, passed easily); and stool consistency of type 6 (fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool). Similarly, the time to first occurrence of diarrhoea was calculated for each individual in the study using various definition of diarrhoea. These included: (A) stool consistency &#x02265;5 and stool frequency &#x02265;2/day for more than 2&#x02005;days; (B) stool consistency &#x02265;5 and stool frequency &#x02265;3/day for more than 2&#x02005;days; (C) stool consistency &#x02265;6 and stool frequency &#x02265;2/day for more than 2&#x02005;days; and (D) stool consistency &#x02265;6 and stool frequency &#x02265;3/day for more than 2&#x02005;days.</p><p>Time to first occurrence (event dated from the start of symptoms) data was compared between the placebo and the probiotics groups by estimating HRs using Cox proportional hazards regression adjusting for age, sex, susceptibility to antibiotic induced diarrhoea and the class of antibiotics. Fisher's exact test was used to compare the number of events of diarrhoea between the two groups. To check for compliance for antibiotic and yogurt intake, mean daily intake was calculated for each participant and then compared between the two groups. Where multiple outcomes were assessed, a corrected &#x003b1; was calculated to assist interpretation of the estimated effects using the Holm&#x02013;Bonferroni method: this method assumes that the outcomes are independent, but takes into account the results of all the outcome assessments together. All analyses were performed using Stata SE/V.13.0.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>Seventy-two participants were recruited between September 2009 and August 2012, but two did not return their details or trial results.

In all classifications of diarrhoea there were significantly fewer incidences in children given a probiotic rich yogurt in comparison to children on a placebo yogurt. No children in the probiotic group experienced severe diarrhoea compared to six in the placebo group. There was only one child with mild diarrhoea (definition A) in the probiotic group and 21 in the placebo group. There was a significant reduction in duration and a delay in onset of increased stool frequency and stool consistency for children given a probiotic yogurt. This shows that an easily available yogurt provides a relevant reduction in AAD in children at the same time as providing energy and nutrition.</p><p>While children have not previously been tested with a LGG probiotic yogurt, the results of this study are consistent with previous trials in adults on antibiotics given LGG yogurt<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and children given LGG supplements.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>

<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> This suggests that not all probiotics are the same, so each probiotic needs to be tested for its efficacy in a specific context.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> A recent review recommends further studies of probiotics in an outpatient setting.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> This research begins to fill this gap. In general, previous studies have reported on the incidence of diarrhoea as an all-or-none phenomenon and as such may not reflect the real world impact of GI distress. Our study demonstrates that there is a wide spectrum of apparent response to probiotics, depending on which levels of disease severity are analysed: mild events are associated with relatively low estimates of benefits from probiotics, whilst more severe events are associated with much larger estimates of benefits. Thus the apparent heterogeneity may be due in part to measurement issues.</p><p>Increased stool frequency or loose bowel movements can be distressing for the child or parents/carers. They may not be particularly concerned whether they have met the WHO definition of diarrhoea.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Symptoms of increased frequency or liquid consistency may cause premature termination of antibiotic therapy, missed days from school or day care and, by association, lost days of work for parents/carers.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Definitions of diarrhoea in earlier studies have varied; some using two or more loose stools/day,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>

Using this approach we were able to create a range of definitions of diarrhoea and analyse the effect across a spectrum of disease as well as allow comparison with previous trials. Across all measures, there was an apparently large statistically significant reduction in symptoms for the children receiving the probiotic-rich yogurt, with no suggestion of a smaller effect in those with more severe symptoms. At the same time, yogurt is easy to administer and provides a palatable source of calories, vitamins, minerals and protein when children may not be inclined to eat or drink because of their illness.</p><p>A limitation of this trial is that the effects on stool were only recorded for the duration of antibiotic treatment plus 1&#x02005;week; there may have been further incidents outside this time frame that have not been reported. This time frame was chosen as studies have noted that the majority of incidents of AAD occur within the first 2&#x02005;weeks of commencing antibiotics,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and we were concerned with the issue of compliance with data collection for a longer follow-up period. This study relied on self-report by either the parents or child. When the child was at school or day care, reporting and recording in the diary may have been less than complete. As noted by Lane, children under the age of 8 are less reliable in their use of the modified BSS,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> however, in the post-trial questionnaire, all the participants found the stool chart easy to use and often a conversational piece. The placebo yogurt was not tested for ability to induce or reduce diarrhoea. It would seem unlikely that the placebo should have caused diarrhoea, as the incidence of diarrhoea in the placebo group was consistent with previous studies.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> A further limitation may be the time it took to recruit the patients, almost 3&#x02005;years, which may have caused a selection bias. It also highlights the difficulty of recruitment in busy outpatient clinics.</p><p>All p values are lower than the &#x003b1; values corrected for multiple hypothesis testing (Holm&#x02013;Bonferroni). The consistent trend of the results across all definitions of diarrhoea makes a type-1 error unlikely.</p><p>The mechanism by which probiotics reduce diarrhoea may be via modulation of the host immune system or on the composition of the GI microbiota and their by-products.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> This study was not designed to investigate these mechanisms and additional microbiological study is warranted. Currently clinical studies randomly test probiotics for their therapeutic potential. In the future these studies could be better targeted if their mechanism of action was understood.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study, conducted in a community setting for an everyday problem that affects hundreds of thousands of children each year, using an economical, easily accessible, nutritious food, shows that a yogurt combination of LGG, La-5 and Bb-12 is an effective method for reducing the incidence of antibiotic-associated GI disturbance in children.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> MF was responsible for literature search, study design, data management, data interpretation and writing.
