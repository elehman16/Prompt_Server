Our aim was to examine the effectiveness of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) on maternal glucose control and obstetric and neonatal health outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial, we recruited women aged 18&#x02013;40 years with type 1 diabetes for a minimum of 12 months who were receiving intensive insulin therapy. Participants were pregnant (&#x02264;13 weeks and 6 days' gestation) or planning pregnancy from 31 hospitals in Canada, England, Scotland, Spain, Italy, Ireland, and the USA. We ran two trials in parallel for pregnant participants and for participants planning pregnancy. In both trials, participants were randomly assigned to either CGM in addition to capillary glucose monitoring or capillary glucose monitoring alone. Randomisation was stratified by insulin delivery (pump or injections) and baseline glycated haemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>). The primary outcome was change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> from randomisation to 34 weeks' gestation in pregnant women and to 24 weeks or conception in women planning pregnancy, and was assessed in all randomised participants with baseline assessments. Secondary outcomes included obstetric and neonatal health outcomes, assessed with all available data without imputation. This trial is registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs10">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ctgov:NCT01788527" id="interrefs20">NCT01788527</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Between March 25, 2013, and March 22, 2016, we randomly assigned 325 women (215 pregnant, 110 planning pregnancy) to capillary glucose monitoring with CGM (108 pregnant and 53 planning pregnancy) or without (107 pregnant and 57 planning pregnancy). We found a small difference in HbA<sub>1c</sub> in pregnant women using CGM (mean difference &#x02212;0&#x000b7;19%; 95% CI &#x02212;0&#x000b7;34 to &#x02212;0&#x000b7;03; p=0&#x000b7;0207). Pregnant CGM users spent more time in target (68% <italic>vs</italic> 61%; p=0&#x000b7;0034) and less time hyperglycaemic (27% <italic>vs</italic> 32%; p=0&#x000b7;0279) than did pregnant control participants, with comparable severe hypoglycaemia episodes (18 CGM and 21 control) and time spent hypoglycaemic (3% <italic>vs</italic> 4%; p=0&#x000b7;10). Neonatal health outcomes were significantly improved, with lower incidence of large for gestational age (odds ratio 0&#x000b7;51, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;28 to 0&#x000b7;90; p=0&#x000b7;0210), fewer neonatal intensive care admissions lasting more than 24 h (0&#x000b7;48; 0&#x000b7;26 to 0&#x000b7;86; p=0&#x000b7;0157), fewer incidences of neonatal hypoglycaemia (0&#x000b7;45; 0&#x000b7;22 to 0&#x000b7;89; p=0&#x000b7;0250), and 1-day shorter length of hospital stay (p=0&#x000b7;0091). We found no apparent benefit of CGM in women planning pregnancy. Adverse events occurred in 51 (48%) of CGM participants and 43 (40%) of control participants in the pregnancy trial, and in 12 (27%) of CGM participants and 21 (37%) of control participants in the planning pregnancy trial. Serious adverse events occurred in 13 (6%) participants in the pregnancy trial (eight [7%] CGM, five [5%] control) and in three (3%) participants in the planning pregnancy trial (two [4%] CGM and one [2%] control). The most common adverse events were skin reactions occurring in 49 (48%) of 103 CGM participants and eight (8%) of 104 control participants during pregnancy and in 23 (44%) of 52 CGM participants and five (9%) of 57 control participants in the planning pregnancy trial.

We identified three randomised trials that used continuous glucose monitoring in women with pre-existing diabetes during pregnancy, which found conflicting results. Two of the three studies included women with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. One study found a reduction in glycated haemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) and macrosomia; however, it used an intermittent, masked continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device so that patients did not see the glucose values in real time. Another study used intermittent real-time CGM and found no difference in glycaemic control or perinatal outcomes. However, only five women in this study used real-time CGM continuously. Together, these two studies included 225 women of whom 165 had type 1 diabetes. A third small pilot study compared continuous and intermittent CGM in 25 women with type 1 diabetes, and found no difference in glycaemic control or neonatal outcomes; however, the study was not powered for these outcomes. A 2017 Cochrane review of self-blood glucose monitoring among pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes concluded that the evidence is weak regarding the efficacy of continuous glucose monitoring and that additional evidence from well designed, large randomised trials is needed to inform choices of glucose monitoring.</p><p id="para50"><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p id="para60">In our multicentre, international, randomised controlled trial in 325 women with type 1 diabetes, we randomly assigned women during early pregnancy or planning pregnancy to receive either real-time CGM or standard capillary glucose monitoring. We found a small but significant reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels at 34 weeks' gestation, accompanied by an increased time in target, reduced hyperglycaemia, and less glycaemic variability. This was accompanied by reductions in neonatal outcomes in the proportion of infants large for gestational age, neonatal hypoglycaemia, admission to neonatal intensive care for more than 24 h, and a 1-day shorter hospital stay among infants of mothers randomly assigned to CGM during the first trimester. The results were generalisable across 31 international study sites and comparable for women using insulin pumps or multiple daily injections, regardless of baseline glucose control. By contrast, we found no significant benefit from CGM use in women planning pregnancy.</p><p id="para70"><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p id="para80">Our study indicates that the use of CGM during pregnancy in women with type 1 diabetes is associated with improved neonatal health outcomes attributed to reduced exposure to maternal hyperglycaemia. The numbers of pregnant women needed to treat with CGM to prevent one newborn complication are six for both neonatal intensive care admission and large for gestational age, and eight for neonatal hypoglycaemia. National and international clinical guideline recommendations in type 1 diabetes in pregnancy should be revised to recommend offering CGM to pregnant women with type 1 diabetes using intensive insulin therapy in the first trimester. To our knowledge, this study is the first to indicate potential for improvements in non-glycaemic health outcomes from CGM use.</p></boxed-text></p><p id="para90">Thus, clinical care guidelines recommend that women with type 1 diabetes strive for optimal glycaemic control before and during pregnancy.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> However, this optimal glycaemic control is difficult to accomplish given the complexity of insulin dose adjustment, gestational changes in insulin sensitivity and marked day-to-day variability in insulin absorption during late pregnancy.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Nationwide UK data confirm that only 15% of pregnant women achieve target glycated haemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) levels during early pregnancy and that despite intensive support (2-weekly antenatal clinics and frequent between-clinic contacts), only 40% of women with type 1 diabetes achieve target HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels after 24 weeks' gestation.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Thus one in two newborn infants experience complications associated with exposure to maternal hyperglycaemia, with no improvement in neonatal morbidity in the past three to four decades.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Furthermore, as women strive for optimal glucose control, the rates of severe hypoglycaemia, particularly during early pregnancy, are five times higher than in non-pregnant women.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref></p><p id="para100">Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) provides detailed data on the direction and rate of change of glucose levels.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref>.

Eligibility required that participants wear the sensor for 6 days, provide at least 96 h of glucose values including a minimum of 24 h overnight, and obtain at least four capillary glucose tests daily. Participants meeting these criteria were randomised to receive either CGM in addition to capillary glucose monitoring (intervention) or capillary glucose monitoring alone (control). Treatments were allocated in a 1:1 ratio via a web-based system that used a computer-generated randomisation list with permuted block sizes and stratification by method of insulin delivery (pump or multiple injections), and baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> (&#x0003c;7&#x000b7;5% <italic>vs</italic> &#x02265;7&#x000b7;5% or 58 mmol/mol for the pregnancy trial; &#x0003c;8&#x000b7;0% <italic>vs</italic> &#x02265;8&#x000b7;0% or 64 mmol/mol for the planning pregnancy trial).

In these women, we found reductions in the proportion of infants large for gestational age, neonatal hypoglycaemia, and admission to neonatal intensive care, and a 1-day shorter hospital stay among their infants. In women who were planning pregnancy, the point estimate of glycaemic change with CGM use was of a similar magnitude but with greater uncertainty, potentially due to smaller sample size or greater variation.</p><p id="para460">The numbers of pregnant women needed to treat with CGM to prevent one complication are six for both neonatal intensive care admission and large for gestational age, and eight for neonatal hypoglycaemia. Further health-economic analyses will be required to understand the costs of CGM and its implementation into antenatal care, which might be offset by the reduction in neonatal intensive care admissions and reduced hospital stay.</p><p id="para470">The mechanisms for the improved neonatal outcomes in mothers randomly assigned to CGM during early pregnancy are unclear. The reduction in large for gestational age was seen both in countries with higher (Canada and UK) and with lower (Italy and Spain) prevalence. The clinically small improvement in HbA<sub>1c</sub> seems unlikely to be the sole explanation for the observed reductions in neonatal complications. We chose HbA<sub>1c</sub> as the primary outcome because of its strong clinical validity, but it has well established limitations during pregnancy when HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels are influenced by gestational changes in red cell turnover, anaemia, and iron supplementation.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Pregnant CGM users spent 68% of their time within the recommended glycaemic control target range compared with 61% for their control counterparts, translating to an additional 1&#x000b7;7 h/day in target. Pregnant CGM users also spent 27% of their time above 7&#x000b7;8 mmol/L compared with 32% for control participants, equivalent to approximately 1 h less per day spent hyperglycaemic. These direct CGM measures of day-to-day exposure to maternal hyperglycaemia might be more relevant for neonatal outcomes than are surrogate markers such as HbA<sub>1c</sub>.</p><p id="para480">In the authors' clinical experience, women are uncomfortable changing treatment modality during early pregnancy, and thus starting CGM in women planning pregnancy seemed logical. The direct CGM measures suggest a lower mean glucose and 5% higher time in target (1&#x000b7;2 h/day) but these were not significant (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 8</xref>). Longer periods of CGM recordings might have increased the statistical power of the study. We found a similar between-group difference in HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels, but with wide confidence intervals, either due to smaller sample size or more variation in the treatment effect. The motivation of participants planning pregnancy for optimising glucose control might have also been more variable than the motivation of pregnant participants, although 50% of CGM participants and 40% of control group participants in the planning pregnancy trial did achieve their glycaemic control target.</p><p id="para490">During pregnancy, CGM users had slightly more frequent scheduled and notably more unscheduled contacts. Problems encountered with CGM use were commonplace, with more than 80% of women reporting frustrations of CGM use, such as connectivity issues, alarms, and calibration errors, and almost 50% experiencing skin reactions, such as bleeding, erythema, and discomfort. The increased contacts for sensor-related diabetes management issues might also reflect the heightened anxiety of pregnant women seeing the 288 daily glucose values in real time, and the initial support required to incorporate CGM data into their diabetes routines. The increased rate of change of glucose concentrations most likely reflects CGM users' actions taken in response to out-of-range glucose levels. Post-hoc analysis showed that adjusting for additional contacts did not affect treatment effect and was unrelated to changes in HbA<sub>1c</sub>. Furthermore, contact for non-sensor related issues did not differ between groups.</p><p id="para500">It is difficult to make direct comparison with the smaller previous studies that included pregnant women with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

The direct CGM measures suggested that although women achieved lower mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> (5&#x000b7;8% or 40 mmol/mol), they spent only 56% of time in target, 33% above target, and 13% below target.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> The Danish trial<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> used an earlier CGM technology intermittently with one real-time CGM on five occasions for the intervention group.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> They reported comparable HbA<sub>1c</sub> and glucose control to the UK study (58% in target, 28% above, and 14% below target based on capillary glucose levels).</p><p id="para510">Our pregnant CGM users spent substantially higher time in target (68%) compared with previous studies, with approximately 10% or 2&#x000b7;4 h/day less hypoglycaemia. Of note, 19 (16%) of 119 Danish women had 59 severe hypoglycaemia episodes<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> compared with 23 (11%) of 207 women with 39 severe hypoglycaemia episodes in our study. This suggests that, over the past decade, the burden of severe hypoglycaemia has substantially reduced. Only a minority of pregnant women (&#x0003c;20%) were using pumps with insulin suspend features, so this alone does not explain the reduced incidence of maternal hypoglycaemia. However, exposure to hyperglycaemia&#x02014;the so-called prandial problem&#x02014;persists. Post-prandial hyperglycaemia was also evident in our recent closed-loop study in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes,<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> which achieved comparable time in target to the CGM users in the present study. These results indicate that additional strategies might be required to minimise post-prandial excursions, such as faster acting insulins or adjunctive therapies. Automated insulin delivery options might also give women more confidence to administer larger pre-meal boluses, especially for the evening meal, with less fear of nocturnal hypoglycaemia. Notably, although women in the CGM group showed a greater decrease in hypoglycaemia avoidance behaviour than did women in the control group, they did not have less worry, suggesting that automated insulin delivery might be more effective for reduction in maternal fear of hypoglycaemia.</p><p id="para520">Compared with the landmark Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation study<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> in which 90% of adults were using pump therapy, the CGM group in our study included more than 50% women on multiple daily injections.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> These women did just as well in terms of their treatment response and had lower absolute HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels compared with women using insulin pump therapy. The finding that the treatment effect of CGM is comparable between pump and injection users is very important for widening access to technology. This result is consistent with recent CGM studies outside of pregnancy which focused specifically on multiple injection users.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> These studies using more recent CGM technology achieved sensor compliance approaching 90% use, with another trial<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> of a newer flash CGM device showing that users in the CGM group accessed their glucose levels 15 times per day compared with 5&#x000b7;6 capillary glucose tests.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref></p><p id="para530">We note that even with the improvement obtained with CGM use, pregnancy outcomes remained suboptimal, with a high proportion of infants large for gestational age and high levels of neonatal morbidity. The UK pregnancy in diabetes audit, which used the same customised birthweight charts, reported a lower proportion of infants large for gestational age (46%) despite higher maternal HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels in early and late pregnancy and fewer women achieving target HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels (40% compared with 66% of pregnant CGM users).<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> These results suggest that, in addition to glucose, other nutrients might also be important. We also note that pregnant women in our study were in the overweight range and weight gain was higher than what is recommended by the Institute of Medicine.<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> In addition to hyperglycaemia, these issues will need to be addressed to improve pregnancy outcomes in women with type 1 diabetes.</p><p id="para540">Our trial has several strengths. First, the sample size for the pregnancy trial was large enough to provide statistical power for a range of clinically relevant maternal and neonatal outcomes. Second, our trial has a robust randomised controlled design with prior publication of the clinical study protocol, CGM treatment algorithms, prespecified statistical analyses, central laboratory HbA<sub>1c</sub> assays, and direct CGM measures of glycaemia. Third, it has high external validity, including 31 antenatal clinics with variable diabetes technology experience and providing results that are applicable to pregnant women using insulin pumps or multiple daily injections. The data for maternal and neonatal health outcomes are more than 99% complete.</p><p id="para550">However, our trial also has some limitations. The planning pregnancy trial did not have sufficient power to detect the magnitude of differences that were significant in the pregnancy trial. Although every effort was made to ensure complete HbA<sub>1c</sub> and CGM datasets, this was not achieved because of missing or lost samples, withdrawals, and pregnancy losses or delivery before 34 weeks. However, the percentage of missing data (&#x0223c;20%) fell within the prespecified power calculation assumptions and the patterns of change were similar in analyses of imputed and of available HbA<sub>1c</sub> data. Women entering the trial had to demonstrate willingness to use CGM before randomisation. Unfortunately, we do not have data on the frequency of capillary glucose monitoring and its relationship to glucose control or on the use of insulin suspension. We observed more unscheduled contacts for women in the CGM group than in the control group. We also acknowledge that there are potential differences between the CGM data collected using real-time sensors in the CGM group and masked sensors in the control group, and a large number of statistical tests were conducted without adjustment for multiple testing.</p><p id="para560">To our knowledge, this study is the first to show an effect of continuous glucose monitoring on health outcomes other than glycaemic outcomes, and with substantial reductions in neonatal complications attributed to maternal hyperglycaemia. The results were consistent across 31 international study sites and comparable for women using insulin pumps or multiple daily injections, regardless of baseline glucose control. Our data indicate a role for offering CGM to all pregnant women with type 1 diabetes using intensive insulin therapy in the first trimester.</p><p id="para320a"><boxed-text id="cetextbox20"><p id="para330b">This online publication has been corrected.
