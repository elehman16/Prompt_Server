Since there is a significant rise in obesity among Indian youth and because research indicating the role of sleep in development of obesity among Indian population is scant, the current study was undertaken to assess the effect of sleep duration on adiposity among Gujarati Indian adolescents.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>A randomized cross-sectional study was done on 489 voluntarily participating Indian adolescents in the age group of 16-19 years. Participants were grouped into two categories 1). Adequate Sleep Duration at Night (more than seven hours, ASDN) and 2) Inadequate Sleep Duration at Night (less than seven hours, IASDN) as reported by the participants. The participants were later assessed for adiposity in terms of BMI, BF %, FM, FMI and waist circumference, meal frequency per day and physical activity status.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>In both boys as well as girls, the BMI, BF%, FM and FMI were significantly lower in the ASDN group than the IASDN group. However, there was an insignificant difference in the meal frequency and physical activity status between the ASDN and IASDN group.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Inadequate sleep duration increases adiposity among Gujarati Indian adolescents but further studies are required to find out the mechanisms through which sleep affects adiposity in this population.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Gujarati Indian adolescents</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>sleep duration</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A phenomenal rise has been observed in the prevalence of overweight and obesity among Indian youth.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref>) This has been attributed to nutritional transition in India, characterized by a shift in the diet content towards a high fat and high sugar diet.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref>) However, recent studies conducted in various parts of the world indicate that sleep has evolved as a significant determinant of body composition besides conventional factors like physical activity status, dietary habit and genetic inheritance that determine the body composition.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref>) These studies indicate that lack of adequate sleep predisposes the children to overweight and obesity.

Multi-stage sampling was used for recruitment of participants into the study. The study was conducted on the students of age group 16-19 years, studying at schools and colleges in the local population, irrespective of socio-economic class and who had attained the Tanner Stage 4 by self-reporting.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT7">7</xref>) A total of 489 subjects (Boys = 297, Girls = 192) were studied after measuring the sample size on the basis of a pilot study using PEPI software (Version 4.0, J H Abramson, P M Gahlinger, 1993-2001).</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>Sleep duration at night</title><p>The participants were asked to self-report the number of hours for which they slept during most of the nights, in a week, for the last one-year.

The body weight (Wt) was recorded bare footed to the nearest 0.5 kg. The height was measured using meter scale without footwear to the nearest 5 cm. BMI was calculated as the weight (kg) divided by the square of height (m<sup>2</sup>).(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref>) Body Fat Percentage (BF %) and Total Body Fat Mass (FM) were assessed by bioelectrical impedance technique using Omron Body Fat Monitor HBF -302.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref>) Handles of the device contain plate electrodes, which are held by both hands with arms outstretched and parallel to the ground while standing erect. The Omron Body Fat Monitor sends a weak electrical current of 0.5Mv through the body from one electrode and receives the resistance encountered by the current as the current flows through the body. It then calculates the BF% and FM of the individual using the impedance encountered in consideration with the age, gender, height and weight of the person. Fat Mass Index (FMI) was calculated as the Fat Mass (kg) divided by the square of height (m<sup>2</sup>). Waist circumference was measured at the mid point between the lower costal margin and the highest point on the iliac crest to the nearest 0.5 cm at the end of normal expiration.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref>)</p></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The subjects were categorized into two groups based on the sleep duration at night: Adequate Sleep Duration at Night (more than seven hours), ASDN and Inadequate Sleep Duration at Night (less than seven hours), IASDN.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref>)</p><p>The study variables (Body composition, Meal Frequency and Physical Activity Status) of the two groups were then compared using unpaired student's t-test at 95% confidence limit and five per cent confidence interval.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-7" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0002">2</xref> show that in both genders, adolescents in ASDN group had a significantly (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c; 0.05) lower weight, BMI, BF%, FM and FMI as compared to the adolescents in the IASDN group.

Similar findings were reported in the NHANES I survey, where adolescents with self-reported sleep durations at baseline less than seven hours had higher average body mass indexes and were more likely to be obese than subjects with sleep duration of seven hours.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref>) A cross-sectional study done on South Indian children in the age group 6-16 years showed that children who slept less than eight and half hours/day had significantly higher odds of being overweight when compared to children who slept more than nine and half hours/day, after adjustments for age, gender, location of stay and socio-economic status.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref>)</p><p>Several studies are being done to elucidate how sleep deprivation affects adiposity. A recent study has indicated that at least three pathways may be involved which link sleep deprivation with adiposity i.e., alterations in glucose metabolism, up-regulation of appetite and decreased energy expenditure.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT12">12</xref>) Studies have shown that the increased adiposity observed in sleep-deprived individuals is due to changes in the plasma concentrations of Leptin and Ghrelin, the hormones that regulate the eating behavior of an individual and a compromise in the Insulin sensitivity.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT14">14</xref>) A crossover clinical study indicated that sleep restriction was associated with an average reduction in the anorexigenic hormone Leptin, elevations in the orexigenix factor ghrelin and an increase in hunger especially for calorie dense foods with high carbohydrate content.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT13">13</xref>)</p><p>The current study, however, shows that in the Gujarati adolescents meal frequency seems to be unaffected by the duration of sleep, but it may be possible that the sleep duration may be affecting the eating behavior in other aspects such as the type of food or quantity per meal which have not been studied in the present study.</p><p>Though literature indicates that deprivation impairs physical functioning and emotional well being with reduction in motivation and early fatigue,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT15">15</xref>) the current study shows that an insignificant difference exists in the physical activity pattern between adolescents having adequate sleep duration and adolescents having inadequate sleep duration.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-9" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study shows that sleep deprivation (night sleep duration less than seven hours) significantly affects the body composition of the Gujarati adolescents of age group 16-19 years and predisposes them to the risk of overweight and obesity. However, further studies are required to understand the mechanism of increase in fat mass in this population because of sleep deprivation.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
