Pakistan is the world&#x02019;s sixth most populous country with a stroke-vulnerable population and is without a single dedicated chronic care center. In order to provide evidence for a viable solution responsive to this health care gap, and leveraging the existing &#x0003e;70&#x000a0;% mobile phone density, we thought it rational to test the effectiveness of a mobile phone-based video intervention of short 5-minute movies to educate and support stroke survivors and their primary caregivers.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Movies4Stroke will be a randomized control, outcome assessor blinded, parallel group, single center superiority trial. Participants with an acute stroke, medically stable, with mild to moderate disability and having a stable primary caregiver will be included. After obtaining informed consent the stroke survivor-caregiver dyad will be randomized. Intervention participants will have the movie program software installed in their phone, desktop, or Android device which will allow them to receive, view and repeat 5-minute videos on stroke-related topics at admission, discharge and first and third months after enrollment. The control arm will receive standard of care at an internationally accredited center with defined protocols. The primary outcome measure is medication adherence as ascertained by a locally validated Morisky Medication Adherence Scale and control of major risk factors such as blood pressure, blood sugar and blood cholesterol at 12&#x000a0;months post discharge. Secondary outcome measures are post-stroke complications and mortality, caregiver knowledge and change in functional outcomes after acute stroke at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12&#x000a0;months. Movies4Stroke is designed to enroll 300 participant dyads after inflating 10&#x000a0;% to incorporate attrition and non-compliance and has been powered at 95&#x000a0;% to detect a 15&#x000a0;% difference between intervention and usual care arm.

Two thirds, i.e., 36 million of the estimated 56 million deaths worldwide are attributed to non-communicable diseases (NCD), primarily stroke. Over 80&#x000a0;% of strokes now occur in LMICs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], with 15 million strokes occurring annually worldwide, leaving five million dead, and five million permanently disabled. One person suffers a stroke every 45&#x000a0;seconds; one person dies of a stroke every 4&#x000a0;minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Globally, stroke accounts for 46.6 million disability adjusted life-years (DALYs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>NCD and stroke are becoming an important issue in Pakistan as the country undergoes demographic transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Pakistan, the sixth most populous nation in the world, has a distinctively stroke-prone population. Today, about one in four adult Pakistanis has hypertension and/or diabetes, heart disease, or a stroke equivalent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Yet, early detection and risk reduction would have prevented stroke in 80&#x02013;90&#x000a0;% of victims [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A local study conducted on one ethnicity (Pashtoon), reported a prevalence of 4.8&#x000a0;%, which would translate into four million persons in a country of 180 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In another hospital-based study, 65&#x000a0;% of adult Pakistani stroke survivors reported at least one post-stroke complication and a 12&#x000a0;% mortality in the first year post discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>This high-risk population is also highly underserved. Health systems are acutely responsive and are not equipped to respond to chronic diseases. There is not a single inpatient comprehensive rehabilitation system. Since the recent democratic reforms and 18th Constitutional Amendment, an opportunity has arisen for health reform, where devolution has resulted in provincial autonomy for health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Thus, evidence for a systematized, replicable, scalable and effective response to chronic disorders is much more likely to be adapted.</p><p>In 80&#x000a0;% of stroke victims, further events may be prevented by altering lifestyle risk factors, and increasing adherence to medications to control hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, there exists an implementation gap to adopt widely recognized beneficial medicines and lifestyle changes after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we will assess the effect of video-based intervention on primary stroke survivors and their caregiver dyads on improving adherence to stroke preventive medications and control of three major risk factors at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months in a Pakistani population. Our rationale is to leverage the existing mobile phone infrastructure and use IT to deliver post-stroke education to dyads returning to the community and thereby improve post-stroke outcomes. We hypothesize that there would be a difference of at least 15&#x000a0;% in adherence to stroke preventive medications and control of three major risk factors at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months among stroke survivors who are given video-based education as compare to those who are given usual care.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study question</title><p>Does video-based intervention given to stroke survivors (with mild to moderate disability) and their caregivers at the time of enrollment into the study, at discharge and sustained during follow-up, improve adherence to stroke preventive medications and control of three major risk factors (diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia) at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months after first ever stroke?</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Primary objective</title><p>To determine the effect of video-based education intervention provided to patient and caregiver dyads after first ever stroke on:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Proportion of participants adhering to medications prescribed (definition of adherence is the use of prescribed medications on at least 5&#x000a0;days a week and measured by the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Proportion of participants achieving control of blood pressure (control is defined as BP &#x0003c;125/85), blood sugar (glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) &#x0003c;7&#x000a0;%) and blood cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) &#x0003c;100&#x000a0;mg/dl)</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Secondary objective</title><p>To determine the effect of video-based education intervention provided to patient and caregiver dyads after first ever stroke on:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Stroke-related knowledge assessment among caregivers regarding risk factors, emergency preparedness, stroke rehabilitation and medications</p></list-item><list-item><p>Readmission to hospital with any of the stroke-related complications &#x02013; urinary tract infection, pneumonia, and deep venous thrombosis, among stroke survivors admitted to the AKUH Stroke Unit, Karachi</p></list-item><list-item><p>Stroke-related mortality among stroke survivors with mild to moderate disability admitted to the AKUH Stroke Unit, Karachi</p></list-item><list-item><p>Change in functional outcome (severity and disability after stroke) from baseline among stroke survivors admitted to the AKUH Stroke Unit, Karachi</p></list-item><list-item><p>Level of satisfaction with the intervention and acceptability of mobile health (mHealth) innovations by stroke survivor and caregiver dyads</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study design</title><p>This will be a randomized controlled, outcome assessor blinded, parallel group, single center superiority trial in which participants with first ever stroke (both ischemic and hemorrhagic) will be randomized within 48&#x000a0;hours of their stroke to either the video-based education intervention group or the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].

The sample size was calculated keeping in mind the two primary end-points of medication adherence and risk factor control; the primary end-point that gave the highest sample size was kept as the final sample size. This number of participants would provide the study with the ability to detect a 15&#x000a0;% difference among groups with a power of at least 95&#x000a0;%. The proportion of participants achieving control of three modifiable risk factors (blood pressure, blood cholesterol and blood sugar) was assumed to be 0.50 in the treatment group and 0.350 in the control group. The test statistics used was a two-sided <italic>Z</italic> test.

Their assumptions will be checked and their significance will be reported. At univariate analysis level, a variable will be considered to be biologically significant as well as statistically significant if the <italic>p</italic> value is less than or equal to 0.10.

All variables that are considered to be significant at the univariate analysis level will need to run through a stepwise model building approach (manual) to obtain a parsimonious model. Multiple linear regression (MLR) will be used to predict the final model. Adjusted beta-coefficients with their appropriate 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval will be reported for the final model. The final model will be assessed for interaction between biologically plausible variables as well as for confounding after checking for interaction; beta-change (15&#x000a0;%) will be considered significant for confounding to be reported.

Previous studies that have used education to assist stroke survivors in communities are mainly based in developed countries (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>).</p><p>A randomized controlled, single center, clinical trial assessed the effect of training of caregivers of stroke participants in a stroke rehabilitation unit on discharge, at 3 and at 12&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This study showed a significant difference between the trained group and conventional caregivers with respect to quality of life and mood outcomes, and burden of care, as well as cost-effectiveness. Another multicenter study that enabled caregivers during inpatient hospitalization, recommended more follow-up training after discharge due to lack of sustained effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. A Cochrane Review based on caregiver enablement via non- pharmacological interventions listing eight studies with 1007 participants, with heterogeneous follow-ups, interventions and settings, concluded that more work was needed in this area due to heterogeneity of effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. None of these interventions took into consideration resource-poor, health-illiterate populations, fragmented health systems, attention to scalability, or adaptation to local needs, or used digital media.</p><p>The health care system in Pakistan represents a unique challenge. Like other LMICs with rapid demographic transition, there is now a double burden of maternal and childhood illnesses along with a significant additional NCD burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, the health systems are not prepared for this challenge. There is not a single inpatient rehabilitation center for stroke survivors and the majority of care is provided directly by caregivers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>While there is a relative lag in development of such centers, we plan to test and leverage our existing mobile infrastructure as a means of providing continuous care.

In this study we may report its efficacy, but the performance in different sites may vary; contamination bias: in an educational intervention, care will have to be taken to avoid contamination of the non-intervention arm with the intervention. To ensure this, videos will be shown in a separate room, and not at the bedside. Given the fact that families do share information, contamination is possible; however, most stroke participants are on different schedules for visits, rehabilitation times, etc. and so we expect less contamination than in areas where a lot of time is spent together by families; attrition bias: many participants may drop out due to the longitudinal nature of the study. To counteract this, trained health care providers will try to follow the subjects closely through regular phone calls and build good rapport with them. A Stroke Helpline number will also be provided.</p><p>If this initial study shows promising results, we will plan a larger study where interactive chronic disease support software will be evaluated for reduction in mortality and disability after acute stroke for families living in LMIC settings.</p><sec id="Sec47"><title>Trial status</title><p>Ongoing</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec48"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2016_1175_MOESM1_ESM.doc" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
