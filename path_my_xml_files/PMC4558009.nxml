In this randomized controlled clinical trial we investigated the changes introduced in the oral ecosystem, during and after orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances in combination with or without a fluoride mouthwash, of 10&#x02013;16.8 year old individuals (N = 91). We followed several clinical parameters in time, in combination with microbiome changes using next-generation sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. During the course of our study, the oral microbial community displayed remarkable resilience towards the disturbances it was presented with. The effects of the fluoride mouthwash on the microbial composition were trivial. More pronounced microbial changes were related to gingival health status, orthodontic treatment and time. Periodontal pathogens (e.g. <italic>Selenomonas</italic> and <italic>Porphyromonas</italic>) were highest in abundance during the orthodontic treatment, while the health associated <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, <italic>Rothia</italic> and <italic>Haemophilus</italic> gained abundance towards the end and after the orthodontic treatment. Only minor compositional changes remained in the oral microbiome after the end of treatment. We conclude that, provided proper oral hygiene is maintained, changes in the oral microbiome composition resulting from orthodontic treatment are minimal and do not negatively affect oral health.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The study was financially supported by Elmex research / Colgate-Palmolive Europe.

For instance, the impaired gingival health status [<xref rid="pone.0137318.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137318.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and increased plaque formation [<xref rid="pone.0137318.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137318.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] that are associated with the placement of fixed orthodontic appliances. Besides, the latter could lead to the formation of white spot lesions, creating an undesirable aesthetic effect and possibly resulting in a cavity in need of restauration [<xref rid="pone.0137318.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137318.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>So far, studies aimed to investigate the changes in bacterial taxa during orthodontic treatment, used culturing or targeted molecular approaches, allowing for a limited number of opportunistic pathogenic species to be observed [<xref rid="pone.0137318.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0137318.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].

To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the dynamics of the oral microbiome of adolescents during orthodontic treatment, and the use of a fluoride mouthwash using an open-ended molecular approach.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Sampling and treatment</title><p>A randomized placebo-controlled parallel clinical trial was performed as described by van der Kaaij <italic>et al</italic>.

The randomization allocation list was made in Microsoft Office Excel 2003 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) using the random number generation function in the analysis toolpack for one variable with a discrete distribution, allocating 50% of the 120 subjects to the test and 50% to the control group. The study was powered on the basis of the primary outcome; the data presented here were secondary outcomes.</p><p>All subjects participating in this study were scheduled to receive full fixed orthodontic appliances. Subjects could only be scheduled to receive full fixed orthodontic appliances if they maintained a proper oral hygiene and had no severe gingivitis. The guidelines at the Orthodontic Department at ACTA state that orthodontic appliances will not be placed when the bleeding by probing score is above 2 (1: 0&#x02013;5% of the sites are bleeding, 2: 6&#x02013;10% of the sites are bleeding, 3: 11&#x02013;20% of the sites are bleeding, 4: 21&#x02013;35% of the sites are bleeding, 5: &#x0003e; 35% of the sites are bleeding), except if immediate orthodontic treatment is indicated, for example, in case of traumatic occlusion.</p><p>The inclusion criteria for the study were: 10&#x02013;18 yrs of age, good general health, no use of medication and no demineralizations in need of restauration present at a buccal surface, in addition to providing their written informed consent. A total of 120 subjects set to receive fixed orthodontic appliances in both jaws were to participate in the study. Roth Ovation Brackets (Dentsply, GAC International, Bohemia, NY, USA) were used and all were bonded following the same procedure and methods, using Transbond XT primer and adhesive (3M unitek, Monrovia, USA).</p><p>In this triple-blind study, the subjects received a randomly assigned mouthwash containing 100 ppm amine-fluoride (AmF) and 150 ppm sodium-fluoride (SnF<sub>2</sub>) (Elmex caries protection, Colgate-Palmolive Europe, Therwil, Switzerland) or a placebo, also provided by Colgate-Palmolive Europe. The mouthwash was used from the time of bonding until debonding. The subjects were instructed not to use fluoride containing products, other than toothpaste, during the course of the study. Their dentist was informed about the study and was asked not to apply extra fluoride during the study period. Furthermore, the subjects received oral hygiene instructions after placement of the fixed appliances and were advised to use interproximal brushes to clean the areas of the tooth adjacent to the bracket underneath the orthodontic wire.</p><p>The subjects were instructed not to clean their teeth 24 h before supragingival plaque samples for microbiome analysis were taken. These samples were obtained at six time-points during this study: T0 (approximately one week before placement of the fixed orthodontic appliances), T1 (six weeks after placement), T2 (twelve weeks after placement), TD (debonding, average of 25 months after placement), TD1 (six weeks after debonding) and TD2 (twelve weeks after debonding). Supragingival plaque was collected from the buccal surface of the upper left premolars using a sterile plastic spatula. In presence of the brackets (visits T1, T2 and TD), which were placed on the middle of the tooth, the plaque was collected between the gingiva and the bracket. Gingival swelling often occurs within one or two months after placement of orthodontic appliances [<xref rid="pone.0137318.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137318.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137318.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Hence, in cases where the gingival margin reached the bracket, the plaque was collected mesially and/or distally from the bracket. The plaque samples were spun down for 30 s at 16.100 x g and stored at -80&#x000b0;C.</p><p>The number of white spot lesions of the subjects was recorded at visits T0, TD, TD1 and TD2, and is described in more detail by van der Kaaij <italic>et al</italic>.

More pronounced were the microbial changes observed in relation to gingival health status and orthodontic treatment.

There was no observable shift in the composition of the total community in time (<xref rid="pone.0137318.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). A remaining change in abundance was observed for a few genera (<xref rid="pone.0137318.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>) and, interestingly, most genera that did increase in abundance in time were associated with a healthy oral cavity.</p><p>In this study, an amine fluoride (AmF) combined with stannous fluoride (SnF<sub>2</sub>) mouthwash was used to reduce the amount of demineralization, since fluoride is a well-established anti-caries agent [<xref rid="pone.0137318.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and caries is an infectious bacterial disease.

[<xref rid="pone.0137318.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] observed a decrease in plaque index, gingival index and bleeding on probing within one month in orthodontic patients using AmF/SnF<sub>2</sub> toothpaste, regardless if the toothpaste was combined with an AmF/SnF<sub>2</sub> mouthrinse.

This is similar to our findings, as we did not observe a clear effect of the fluoride mouthwash on the microbial composition.

[<xref rid="pone.0137318.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] found that <italic>Fusobacterium</italic> sp. was lower in their circumpubertal group compared to a younger and older test group, suggesting that the presence of <italic>Fusobacterium</italic> sp. is influenced by the physiological maturity of the host.</p><p>In contrast to <italic>Fusobacterium</italic>, the abundance of the genus <italic>Streptococcus</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0137318.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7A Fig</xref>) and OTU351 (<italic>Streptococcus</italic>) (<xref rid="pone.0137318.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8C Fig</xref>) showed an increase in time without decreasing first. Increase in <italic>Streptococcus</italic> abundance in puberty has been observed before [<xref rid="pone.0137318.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], although we cannot identify this member of the genus <italic>Streptococcus</italic> on species level, we speculate that it is associated with a healthy state of the gingiva.</p><p>
<italic>Haemophilus</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0137318.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4E Fig</xref>), <italic>Rothia</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0137318.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4F Fig</xref>) and OTU65 (<italic>Rothia</italic>) (<xref rid="pone.0137318.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5A Fig</xref>) were associated with a healthy state of the gingiva as well. Their increase after debonding appeared to coincide with the decrease in gingivitis after debonding (<xref rid="pone.0137318.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Members of these two genera were usually not included as target micro-organisms in studies of the oral microbiome during puberty or orthodontic treatment. Although the role of <italic>Haemophilus</italic> in health and disease of the oral cavity remains somewhat ambiguous, <italic>Rothia</italic> is generally associated with health [<xref rid="pone.0137318.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137318.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, the effects of the fluoride mouthwash on the adolescent microbiome were indiscernible and promoted neither health nor disease associated bacterial growth. Yet, van der Kaaij <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0137318.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] did observe fewer demineralizations in subjects using the fluoride mouthwash compared to those using the placebo. Thus, the use of a fluoride mouthwash during orthodontic treatment might be beneficial for the health status of the oral cavity.</p><p>Nevertheless, we did observe changes in the abundance of various bacteria. In general, the bacteria that were associated with periodontal pathogenesis decreased in abundance in time, while the abundance of the health related bacteria increased, suggesting that orthodontic treatment during puberty does not have a lasting negative effect on the gingival health status. Still, the lack of an age-related control group not receiving orthodontic treatment precludes us from making a clear distinction between microbial changes instigated by puberty and the effects on the oral ecology caused by orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. A future study including such a control group would be necessary to determine which microbial changes are truly caused by the presence of orthodontic appliances, allowing for the maintenance of a healthy oral microbiome during orthodontic treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec014"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0137318.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Difference in abundance of the genus <italic>Fusobacterium</italic> between mouthwash groups per visit.</title><p>The read count is displayed on the y-axis.
