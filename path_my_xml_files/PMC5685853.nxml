Moreover, the two strategies did not result in serious adverse events such as bleeding.</p><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is defined as thrombosis occurring in the trunk of the portal vein or portal branches (mesenteric and splenic veins)[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The prevalence of non-neoplastic PVT in liver cirrhosis ranges from 7.2% to 17%[<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and is higher at the decompensated or advanced stage[<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Acute thrombosis can be severe and may lead to mesenteric ischemia and variceal bleeding. Recent studies have shown that acute PVT influences the outcomes of liver cirrhosis and results in worse survival and a significant increase in the risk of gastroesophageal variceal rebleeding[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Up to now, there has been no consensus on the treatment of liver cirrhosis with acute PVT in any guideline. Anticoagulation is usually used as a first-line treatment, and has been confirmed to be effective by some studies[<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], whereas systemic and local thrombolysis, percutaneous portal vein recanalization, and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) are often considered as second-line choices[<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Recently, endovascular selective catheterization thrombolytic therapy has been increasingly successfully implemented, which can be administered directly <italic>via</italic> percutaneous transhepatic or transjugular intrahepatic route or indirectly <italic>via</italic> the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) through femoral or radial artery infusion of thrombolytic agents[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of transcatheter selective SMA urokinase infusion therapy and TIPS in patients with cirrhosis and acute PVT to evaluate their effectiveness and safety.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>From January 2013 to December 2014, all patients with cirrhosis and acute PVT treated at the Second Hospital of Chongqing Medical University were enrolled. All patients provided informed consent before admission. The ethics committee approved our research program. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients with liver cirrhosis; (2) clear thrombosis in the portal vein system as seen through Doppler ultrasound, angio-computed tomography (CTA), and/or angio-magnetic resonance imaging analyses (MRA); (3) onset of acute thrombosis within 1 wk; (4) continued abdominal pain or abdominal distension. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) contraindications to anticoagulation therapy; (2) severe cardiac or lung disease; (3) previous TIPS or thrombolytic therapy; (4) PVT after liver transplantation; (5) malignant tumor; and (6) refusing interventional therapy or follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of PVT status</title><p>Before the study, clinical symptoms, physical examination, and laboratory examination were recorded. All patients had an endoscopy to check for varices prior to thrombolysis and band ligation would be used to prevent variceal bleeding in patients with varices.</p><p>Doppler ultrasound, CTA, and/or MRA were used to estimate thrombosis from the aspects of location and severity. The PVT location was divided into the main portal vein (MPV), superior mesenteric vein (SMV), and splenic vein (SV). The PVT severity was divided into four levels: grade 0 (thrombus deficiency), grade I (MPV thrombus &#x0003c; 50% or only SMV and SV thrombus existed), grade II (MPV thrombus accounted for 50%-100%), and grade III (complete blocking or cavernous transformation of the portal vein).</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>Using randomly generated numbers, patients who met the inclusion criteria were randomly allocated to the SMA group or the TIPS group.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>In the SMA group, we used the transfemoral approach for transcatheter selective SMA urokinase infusion therapy. Transcatheter thrombolysis was completed as follows: a catheter was selected for the SMA and remained in place. Contrast agent was injected through the SMA catheter. The first impact volume was 500000 IU. After the completion of angiography, urokinase was continuously pumped <italic>via</italic> the indwelling SMA catheter, depending on the patient&#x02019;s weight (250000-500000 IU, twice daily, for a total of 15000 IU/kg/d). Thrombolysis time depended on the improvement of the patient&#x02019;s clinical symptoms, a decrease in D-dimer, and imaging data. Anticoagulant therapy was completed as follows: patients were given subcutaneous heparin (2000 IU, twice daily) to maintain an international normalized ratio (INR) between 2 and 3. Patients were constantly monitored during thrombolytic therapy, including D-dimer, coagulation function, and routine blood tests. In addition, at intervals of 72 h and before removal of the catheter, angiography was re-performed. We considered ending thrombolysis and removing the indwelling SMA catheter when: (1) Superior mesenteric venography showed improvement of portal vein and SMV obstruction; (2) CT-enhanced examination showed that the PVT had obviously absorbed (stale thrombus occupying &#x0003c; 50% after treatment); or (3) vascular recanalization was achieved. After leaving the hospital, the patients continued taking oral warfarin for at least 3 mo.</p><p>In the TIPS group, TIPS was performed by two experienced physicians in accordance with standard procedures. After balloons were used to expand the obstructive passageway, a covered stent was embedded into the passageway. Additional bare-metal stents were placed into other obstructive veins of the portal venous system. After the procedure, the patients were given hypodermic low-molecular-weight heparin to prevent acute thrombosis (6000 IU, three time daily, consecutively for 1 wk). After discharge, all patients were treated with warfarin to achieve an INR of 2 to 3 for 6 mo.</p></sec><sec><title>Follow-up</title><p>All patients were followed at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 mo after the procedure. Physical examinations and laboratory testing (coagulation function, routine blood test) were performed in both groups at each arranged follow-up visit, and CTA or Doppler ultrasound was performed at 6, 12, and 18 mo or whenever clinically required (<italic>e.g</italic>., for ascites, black stools, or abdominal pain). During follow-up, no blind method was adopted for patients taking warfarin.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measurements</title><p>The primary outcome measure was the change in portal vein patency status, which was evaluated by CTA or Doppler ultrasound. Secondary outcomes were rebleeding and hepatic encephalopathy. Changes in portal vein patency status were defined as follows: (1) recanalization, with complete disappearance or reconstruction of cavernous transformation; (2) improved, with recanalization improvement from grade III or II to grade II or I, or disappearance of an SMV or SV thrombus; (3) stable; and (4) worsened, with worsening from grade I or II to grade II or III, progression of thrombus to cavernous transformation, or formation of an SMV or SV thrombus.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software version 19.0. All tests of significance were two-sided, and a <italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered significant. A Student&#x02019;s <italic>t-</italic>test was used to compare the differences in continuous variables between the two groups. Bivariate associations between categorical variables were analyzed with the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test and Fisher exact test. Category ordinal variables, including Child-Pugh class and MPV thrombus severity, were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. Survival analysis was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by log-rank test.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>A total of 40 patients were included in our study. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> shows the patient inclusion and exclusion process. Twenty patients were assigned to the SMA group, and the other 20 patients were assigned to the TIPS group. Between the two groups, the baseline characteristics (<italic>i.e</italic>., age, sex, etiology, liver function, splenectomy, and status of PVT) had no significant difference (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). There were 29 (72.5%) men and 11 (27.5%) women. The mean patient age was 49.3 &#x000b1; 11.0 years (range, 27-72 yr). There were 31 (77.5%) patients with cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV), 1 patient (2.5%) by hepatitis C virus (HCV), 6 patients (15%) by alcohol, 1 patient (2.5%) by an autoimmune disorder, and 1 patient (2.5%) had a cryptogenic etiology. The average Child-Pugh score was 8.98 &#x000b1; 1.79, and the average MELD score was 8.56 &#x000b1; 5.98. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the MPV status; SMV thrombosis and SV thrombosis occurred in 16 patients and 15 patients, respectively.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline characteristics of the study population</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="center"><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Characteristic</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>SMA group (<italic>n</italic> = 20)</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>TIPS group (<italic>n</italic> = 20)</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold><italic>P</italic> value</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody align="center"><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (yr)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="T1FN1">1</xref></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">48.4 &#x000b1;

At 48 h after the start of treatment, all of the 20 patients had a definite improvement in symptoms, and no patient had abdominal pain or distention before the end of thrombolysis (SMA catheter withdrawal). The mean time of indwelling SMA catheter placement was 8.75 &#x000b1; 2.31 d, and the average dose of urokinase was 3705000.0 &#x000b1; 1437000.1 IU. Before removing the catheter, contrast studies showed that in 15 cases, PVT had completely disappeared; another five cases of PVT had been absorbed (compared with before treatment, residual thrombus was &#x0003c; 10%).</p><p>During the follow-up period, no patients died. Oral warfarin (1.5-3.0 mg/d) for at least 3 mo was administered to patients to achieve an INR of 2 to 3.

The last ultrasound scan before discharge showed that PVT had completely disappeared in 14 cases, and another 6 cases of PVT had been absorbed. During the follow-up period, one patient died of liver failure 14 mo after treatment. Ten patients had gastrointestinal rebleeding. Six patients had hepatic encephalopathy. Shunt dysfunction occurred in eight patients, six of whom underwent stent recanalization. Three patients were diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma, and one patient was diagnosed with suspected liver cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p><bold>Changes in PVT:</bold> At the 6-mo follow-up, in the SMA group, 15 patients maintained sustained recanalization, four improved, and one remained stable; no patient had a worsened condition.

Although there is general agreement that anticoagulant therapy is needed for most symptomatic cases of PVT[<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], there is no consensus on the treatment of liver cirrhosis with acute PVT. It was reported that simple anticoagulant therapy had a better curative effect on the patients with mild symptoms and limited scope of thrombus[<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Compared to anticoagulation therapy, catheter-directed thrombolysis and TIPS are used infrequently, but they can: (1) decrease the risk of rebleeding in cirrhotic patients with previous variceal bleeding; (2) increase the rate of portal vein recanalization; and (3) be used in patients with cavernous transformation of the portal vein[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>-<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>In our study, acute PVT greatly improved after catheter-directed thrombolysis and TIPS, and there was no significant difference between the two groups. Evidence about the use of thrombolytics for the treatment of acute PVT in patients with cirrhosis is relatively rare; some studies showed that PVT disappearance occurs in 100% of cases, with no recurrence during follow-up[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Acute PVT in 70% of patients was improved after TIPS treatment, which is consistent with previous studies that PVT disappearance occurred in 57% to 100% of patients[<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We consider that this is consistent with the view that a reduced portal vein flow velocity is the key risk factor for PVT formation[<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Patients with concomitant cirrhosis have significantly slower portal vein flow rates than the healthy population[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In addition, old thrombus often cannot be cleared completely, which aggravates local blood circulation disorder. Moreover, we observed that SMV thrombolysis and SV thrombolysis disappeared significantly in the SMA group, and no phenomenon occurred in the TIPS group. Previous reports showed that the treatment of acute PV-SMV thrombosis by transcatheter superior mesenteric artery catheter urokinase infusion therapy <italic>via</italic> the radial artery was effective[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This method is simple, easy to operate, and very safe. Because the thrombolytic agent circulates into the branch of the intestinal vein, the treatment of mesenteric venous thrombosis is better. All in all, acute PVT improved after SMA and TIPS; in addition, transcatheter selective SMA infusion therapy is better for the treatment of fresh thrombus in the mesentery.</p><p>Another problem that we are particularly concerned about is rebleeding. We observed that the rates of rebleeding were lower and the time to rebleeding was delayed in the TIPS group compared with the SMA group, although there was no significant difference between the two groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.320). It has been confirmed that TIPS decreases the incidence of rebleeding as the second-line treatment for variceal hemorrhage[<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In our study, infusion of relatively low-dose urokinase, no simultaneous peripheral venous infusion, and close monitoring of blood coagulation (which may cause the incidence of rebleeding) kept complications relatively low.</p><p>In the TIPS group, the patency rate in 24 mo was consistent with those reported in previous studies using covered stents[<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. TIPS is related to an increased risk of hepatic encephalopathy[<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Our study showed that occurrences of hepatic encephalopathy in the TIPS group were markedly higher than those in the SMA group, and 50% of patients with hepatic encephalopathy, which was caused by the portosystemic shunting, had this occurrence within of 6 mo after TIPS treatment, whereas patients in the SMA group had hepatic encephalopathy caused by deterioration of liver function.</p><p>There are some limitations to our study. First, the lack of a large sample of participants is the major limitation, and further large-scale studies are needed. Second, our study was not a double-blind study, because patients in our study needed to be closely followed for blood clotting, and to detect complications that may be life-threatening.</p><p>In conclusion, transcatheter SMA infusion therapy and TIPS are both safe and effective treatments for patients with cirrhosis and acute PVT, particularly for grade I and II PVT, and transcatheter SMA urokinase infusion therapy is more ideal for the treatment of fresh thrombus in the mesentery.</p></sec><sec><title>ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS</title><sec><title>Research background</title><p>Acute portal vein thrombosis is a common complication of cirrhosis and would lead to adverse prognosis.
