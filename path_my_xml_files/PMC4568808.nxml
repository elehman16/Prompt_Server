cognitive function and blood viscosity in sedentary elderly men. Forty-six healthy
inactive men, aged 60&#x02013;75 years were randomly distributed into a control group (n=23)
and an experimental group (n=23). Participants underwent blood analysis and physical
and memory evaluation, before and after the 6-month program of physical exercise. The
control group was instructed not to alter its everyday activities; the experimental
group took part in the fitness program. The program was conducted using a cycle
ergometer, 3 times per week on alternate days, with intensity and volume
individualized at ventilatory threshold 1. Sessions were continuous and maximum
duration was 60 min each. There was significant improvement in memory (21%;
P&#x0003c;0.05), decreased blood viscosity (&#x02212;19%; P&#x0003c;0.05), and higher aerobic capacity
(48%; P&#x0003c;0.05) among participants in the experimental group compared with the
control group. These data suggest that taking part in an aerobic physical fitness
program at an intensity corresponding to ventilatory threshold-1 may be considered a
nonmedication alternative to improve physical and cognitive function.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cognition</kwd><kwd>Elderly adults</kwd><kwd>Physical exercise</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="40"/><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aging is a dynamic and progressive process that involves morphological, functional,
biochemical and psychological transitions (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).
This process is often accompanied by impairment of cognitive functions such as memory,
attention, visuospatial ability and information processing speed (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). An increment in blood viscosity is also common with aging (<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Moreover, some authors have observed that
reductions in cerebral blood flow have been linked to reduced cognitive function in
older people and patients with Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). One study demonstrated a significant correlation between decreased
cognitive function and increased blood viscosity, suggesting that high blood viscosity
is an important factor in cognition to be investigated in future studies (<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Poor cognitive function has been associated with
development of comorbid disease, increased risk of dementia, loss of independence,
hospitalization, institutionalization, and death (<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). These alterations affect quality
of life in the elderly population, particularly by restricting their social life and
gradually reducing their independence.</p><p>Physical exercise has received much attention as a potential protective factor for
neurocognitive functioning and as an alternative to medication for reducing blood
viscosity (<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Exercise is thought to contribute
to improving cognitive performance as a result of the cumulative physical and
psychological changes that occur over the course of multiple exercise training sessions,
particularly with aerobic training (<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). A study
by Dik et al. (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) showed that physical exercise
can mitigate changes in cognitive functions. Some authors have shown that physical
activity is inversely associated with cognitive decline in elderly adults. Another study
reported a close correlation between improved physical fitness and aerobic capacity and
better cognitive functioning (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>However, some studies failed to find a significant association between cognitive
functioning and aerobic exercise training (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).
Conflicting data in the literature raise some questions as to the real effect of
physical exercise on cognitive functions. Despite controversy, epidemiological studies
have confirmed that moderately active people have less risk of mental impairment than
those who are sedentary. The research also supports that taking part in physical
exercises programs leads to physical and neuropsychological benefits (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and physically active individuals are likely to
have faster cognitive processing speeds (<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Given that few and varied randomized interventions have examined the effects of aerobic
training on cognition, and few studies have managed to advance understanding of the
mechanisms involved, important questions remain in the literature. We hypothesized that
aerobic exercise training in elderly adults could: promote a decrease in blood viscosity
by improving aerobic capacity, improve blood circulation in the brain, and have a
positive impact on cognition. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine the impact of a
6-month physical exercise program on cognitive function and blood viscosity in sedentary
elderly adults.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Forty-six healthy sedentary male volunteers were selected and randomly distributed
into two groups: a control group (n=23; age=65.86&#x000b1;3.80 years; weight=76.38&#x000b1;11.10 kg;
height=1.67&#x000b1;0.58 m; body mass index=27.17&#x000b1;3.09 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and an experimental
group (n=23; age=68.08&#x000b1;5.49 years; weight=77.56&#x000b1;13.45 kg; height=1.69&#x000b1;0.85 m; body
mass index=27.06&#x000b1;3.75 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). We included participants with at least 7
years of formal education who were nonsmokers and had a sedentary lifestyle (i.e., no
habitual physical activity), no clinical symptoms or indicators of cardiovascular
disease, no medication that could alter cardiovascular or cognitive function, no
psychotropic drug use or of any pharmaceutical drug for which physical activity is a
contraindication or that may negatively influence cognitive function, and no recent
surgical intervention (in the past 6 months). The criterion used to determine a
sedentary lifestyle was gathered from three sources of information: an interview, a
short questionnaire measuring regular physical activity (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), and analysis of oxygen uptake (&#x0003c;25
mL&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000b7;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). Participants were given resting and exercise
electrocardiograms to assess cardiovascular health.</p><p>The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) was also administered (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), divided into five subtests (orientation, immediate memory,
attention and calculation, recall and language). To better describe sample
demographical variables, the cutoff score was set to 24 points. We also used Raven&#x02019;s
Standard Progressive Matrices sets A-E to evaluate general intelligence and confirm
that participants had no signs of cognitive deficits greater than those expected for
their age (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>All methods and procedures were approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the
Universidade Federal de S&#x000e3;o Paulo/Hospital S&#x000e3;o Paulo (#207/01) and were in accordance
with the principles of the Helsinki Declaration of 1975. The nature of the study, its
aims and possible risks were carefully explained to participants in advance, and all
participants signed consent forms.</p></sec><sec><title>Description of groups</title><p>The experimental group took part in an aerobic physical fitness program 3 times a
week on alternate days for 6 months. Sessions were continuous and lasted 60 min; the
initial 20-min session was gradually increased to the maximum 60 min. A LifeCycle
9500HR cycle ergometer (Life Fitness, USA) was used for all sessions. Participants
underwent prior ergospirometric evaluation at ventilatory threshold 1 (VT-1).
Exercise intensity was prescribed in accordance with the concept of an anaerobic
threshold proposed by Wasserman and McIlroy (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Participants&#x02019; heart rate was monitored during sessions. Stretching
and joint flexibility exercises were included as supplementary activities.</p><p>Participants in the control group were asked not to vary their everyday activities or
to begin any type of physical fitness program. Volunteers were monitored
longitudinally through monthly phone calls to maintain contact and to keep them
informed of the study&#x02019;s progress. Participants in the control group were also
informed that although they could not currently take part in the fitness program,
they could do so after the intervention period had ended.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental procedure</title><sec><title>Ergospirometric test</title><p>Cardiopulmonary assessment was carried out, in which exhaled gases were analyzed
by direct measurement of oxygen consumption to determine ventilatory threshold.
Tests were conducted using a Vmax 29 series metabolic cart (SensorMedics, USA).
The system was pre-test calibrated using known gas concentrations (O<sub>2</sub>
and CO<sub>2</sub>), and flow sensor calibration was carried out with a 3-L
syringe. A flow-through face mask (Hans Rudolph Inc. USA) was positioned on each
participant before testing. The procedure involved 25-W load increments every 2
min; initial warm-up load was 3 min at 25 W and the test was terminated on
reaching the safety margin for peak oxygen consumption. Blood pressure was
monitored during testing with a manual sphygmomanometer and heart rate monitored
with a Polar Vantage NV device (Polar Electro, Finland). To avoid circadian
interference, tests were conducted at the same time each day (8:00&#x02013;11:00 am) in a
climate-controlled standard laboratory environment. Ventilatory threshold 1 (VT-1)
was assessed by two blinded independent investigators, and the criteria used to
determine oxygen consumption at VT-1 were as described by Wasserman et al. (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) and Wasserman and Koike (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>All evaluations, including blood analysis and physical and memory assessments,
were performed 48 h before the start and 48 h after the end of the 6-month
program, following the same procedure. The testing sequence was planned to avoid
interference between tests as much as possible, according to Spreen and Strauss
(<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The tests administered are
described below.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Neuropsychological assessment</title><sec><title>Picture Arrangement</title><p>(WAIS-III; Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 3rd edition) In this subtest,
individuals are presented with a series of cards in an incorrect order and asked
to arrange the pictures in the correct order to tell a story that makes sense.
This task provides information about an individual&#x02019;s nonverbal understanding of
social interaction and reasoning abilities; performance is related to the ability
to understand precursors and consequences of events, and is a measure of planning
ability (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Corsi Block-tapping</title><p>This test is a measure of attention, immediate memory capacity, and spatial
memory. The apparatus used consists of a set of nine blocks arranged irregularly
on a wooden board. The blocks are tapped by the examiner at the rate of one block
per second in novel sequences of increasing length. In this study, the subject was
required to reproduce each block-tapping sequence immediately after the examiner,
in direct (forward) and inverse (backward) order (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Verbal Paired Associates</title><p>This test consists of a list of eight paired words. Individuals are required to
learn four pairs of semantically related words considered &#x0201c;easy&#x0201d; (for example,
rose-flower) and four pairs of unrelated words considered &#x0201c;hard&#x0201d; (for example,
hot-quiet) across three study test trials, followed after 30 min by a delayed
recall test. This task gives information about memory acquisition capacity and
yields a memory acquisition score, a learning score, as well as delayed recall and
recognition scores. Thus, this task is sensitive to diverse aspects of memory
functioning (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Free Word Recall</title><p>This test evaluates verbal episodic declarative memory and provides evidence of
short- and long-term memory function independent of the central executive
processes related to capacity to integrate information. In this test, individuals
are presented with 12 lists, numbered 1&#x02013;12, each containing 15 common Portuguese
disyllabic and trisyllabic words. For even-numbered lists, positions 7, 8, and 9
contained semantically related words (e.g., fire, firemen). After the examiner
slowly presents each list (one at a time), individuals are asked to verbally
recall as many words as possible, in any order. There is no time limit. After
recall, a new list is presented, and so on, until the 12 lists have been
presented. The presentation order of stimulus words influences recall, causing an
increased or decreased probability of recall according to the position of the word
on the list (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Blood assessment</title><p>A blood sample (4 mL) for hemorheological measurements was drawn from each
participant into a Vacutainer evacuation tube (Becton, Dickinson and Company, USA)
containing potassium EDTA anticoagulant. Whole blood viscosity was determined with a
DV-III model Wells-Brookfield Cone/Plate Viscometer (Brookfield Engineering Labs.
Inc., USA), following the technique standardized by Galdur&#x000f3;z et al. (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The temperature of the viscometer was
maintained at 37&#x000b1;0.3&#x000b0;C, and viscometric measurements were taken at shear rate
250/s.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>STATISTICA 12 (StatSoft, USA) software for Windows was used for statistical analysis.
The Shapiro-Wilk test was applied to determine whether the distribution curve was
normal. Data are reported as means&#x000b1;SD. To determine the effect of intervention
periods (time effect), we used two-way repeated measures ANOVA with a Duncan
<italic>post hoc</italic> test. Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test was used to
determine significant differences between the control and experimental groups in
recall probability for word recall testing. The minimum significance level was set to
0.05 (5%).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Before initiating the experimental protocol, we observed no significant differences
between the study groups, suggesting that the participants had similar conditions with
respect to age (t=1.47; P=0.14), weight (t=0.14; P=0.88), height (t=0.61; P=0.53) and
body mass index (t=&#x02212;0.25; P=0.79).</p><p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table 1</xref> shows the results of neuropsychological
assessment. The post-training data revealed the strongest effect in the picture
arrangement test (F=43.16; P&#x0003c;0.001), with the experimental group showing an increased
score when compared with baseline scores (P&#x0003c;0.01) and the control group (P&#x0003c;0.04).
Similar results were observed for the Corsi Block-tapping Task (F=11.18; P&#x0003c;0.001)
with improvement in memory and attention seen in the forward task, compared with the
baseline condition (P&#x0003c;0.04) and control group (P&#x0003c;0.008). Comparing baseline and
post-training results, the experimental group also showed improved memory acquisition
capacity, as measured by the Verbal Paired Associates test. Post-training scores for
&#x0201c;hard&#x0201d; word pairs, after one (F=5.18; P&#x0003c;0.04); two (F=5.63; P&#x0003c;0.02) and three
trials (F=4.48; P&#x0003c;0.04), were increased compared with baseline and control group
scores (P&#x0003c;0.05, for all). For Free Word Recall, better recall of non-semantically
related (F=18.33; P&#x0003c;0.04) and semantically related words (F=26.09; P&#x0003c;0.001), as
well as fewer intrusions (F=8.70; P&#x0003c;0.05), was observed in the experimental group
compared with the baseline condition and control group (P&#x0003c;0.05, for all). No changes

differences, it is possible to affirm that both groups had homogenous pre-intervention
skills. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1A and C</xref>, both groups presented

week for 6 months and observed improvements in cognitive functioning in the experimental
group compared with the control group. In general, we observed a marked enhancement of
planning and reasoning ability, executive functions (picture arrangement); attention,
praxia, spatial memory (Corsi Block-tapping Task); verbal memory, learning, and capacity
to integrate information (Free Word Recall and Verbal Paired Associates).</p><p>These data are in agreement with several previous reports of improved cognitive
functioning in elderly adults who engage in regular physical exercise (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Several mechanisms could explain the
improvement observed in cognition, such as improved cerebral blood flow. Elderly adults
with cognitive impairment have demonstrated lower cerebral blood flow in the left
frontal and temporal cortices as well as in the bilateral medial frontal and anterior
cingulate cortices. These brain areas with low blood flow are suggestive of a mechanism
underlying cognitive impairment (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). It is
possible that physical exercise enhances physiological stimulation, contributing to
neurotransmitter release and increased blood flow, which in turn promote improved
cognitive performance (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p><p>Increases in neurotrophic stimulation (including hippocampal neurogenesis, which
steadily declines with age) are associated with cognitive functioning. The very low
levels of hippocampal neurogenesis persisting in the aged brain are suspected as
underlying the cognitive deficits observed in elderly populations (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Studies have suggested that physical exercise may stimulate
nerve cell growth in adult mice (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), If these
studies were to be confirmed in humans, this would indicate that physical activity might
provide a neuronal buffer to protect against age-related neurodegeneration.</p><p>Another perspective is related to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), essential
for the development, increase, survival, and synaptic development of new neurons. BDNF
supports more efficient brain plastic and adaptive processes, which can influence and
improve cognitive functioning in older adults (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Positive impacts of physical
exercise on improved BDNF levels and cognitive functioning have been reported. Despite
controversial findings, BDNF is considered one of the most plausible factors involved in
cognitive benefits associated with physical activity (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p><p>Improvements in physical fitness in the experimental group, evident from improved
parameters for oxygen consumption, maximum load and higher load at VT-1 intensity,
reflect their improved aerobic capacity. This improvement may explain the beneficial
effects on cognitive performance obtained by participants in this group. Studies, such
as by et al. (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), have suggested that physical
exercise maintains vascular integrity and improves the flow of oxygen to the brain, thus
making cognitive processing faster and more efficient in physically active persons,
owing to mechanisms like better cerebral circulation and alteration in the synthesis and
degradation of neurotransmitters.</p><p>We observed a decrease in blood viscosity among participants in the experimental group.
This decrease may be related to the improvements in cognitive functions seen in that
group. We believe that the fitness program served to promote improvement in
cardiovascular functioning and enhance cerebral blood flow. Although the actual
mechanism remains unclear, our hypothesis is that physical exercise increases fluid
transfer from the blood to the interstitial space. Another possible mechanism is related
to the increase in erythrocyte volume caused by exercise. The accompanying rise in
plasma volume would result in decreased hematocrit, which is associated with lower blood
viscosity. Furthermore, some authors have described blood viscosity as a function of
plasma hematocrit and erythrocyte deformability, and that physical exercise is capable
of improving this deformability (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).</p><p>An important implication of engaging in regular physical exercise is that it may be an
effective method to maintain functional skills and promote well-being in elderly adults
(<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). In addition, exercise is relatively
low-cost and is available to large numbers of people. Varying the intensity of physical
exercise in relation to VT-1 leads to beneficial alteration of some physiological
parameters. More intensive exercise leads to a better response, suggesting that the
adaptive response may be intensity-dependent. According to Angevaren et al. (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), the intensity and variation of weekly physical
activities are positively and significantly associated with cognitive performance and
overall cognitive functioning. In contrast, a recently published article by our group
showed that moderate aerobic exercise improved various cognitive parameters in an
elderly population, including sustained attention, mental control, verbal comprehension,
visual and spatial orientation, capacity planning and organization, response speed and
executive functions (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p><p>A limitation of our study is that our sample comprised healthy elderly males with
excellent physical and cognitive status. This situation might cause difficulty in
establishing cognitive and blood viscosity improvements.</p><p>Our sample included sedentary elderly males. It is known that physical inactivity is
associated with elevated mortality risk in middle-aged and older adults (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) and is considered the largest public health
problem of the 21st century (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Long-term,
regular physical activity can reduce morbidity and mortality, postpone disability,
prolong life, and can potentially counterbalance some of the negative effects of aging.
It is important to consider that physical exercise may not have a meaningful impact on
cognition when it is undertaken infrequently. Long-term, regular physical activity may
be a useful intervention contributing to improvements in cognitive performance, as the
result of cumulative physical and psychological changes during the course of multiple
exercise training sessions (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>).</p><p>Our data suggest that a 6-month program of aerobic exercise at VT-1 intensity may be an
effective alternative to medication for cognitive and physical improvement in elderly
adults without dementia. These data contribute to understanding of the relationship
between exercise and cognition; however, many questions remain. Improvement in cognition
caused by aerobic exercise remains open to debate, thus, further studies are needed to
clearly understand the mechanisms involved.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are grateful to AFIP, CAPES, and FAPESP (#98/14303-3) for financial support.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>First published online.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B01"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>American College of Sports Medicine Position Stand</collab></person-group><article-title>Exercise and physical activity for older
