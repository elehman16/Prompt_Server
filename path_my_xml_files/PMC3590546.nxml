Aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the effects of addition of two different doses of clonidine (15 and 30 mcg) to 11 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine in patients undergoing inguinal herniorrhaphy surgery under spinal anesthesia.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Seventy-five patients enrolled in the study were randomly divided into three groups of 25 each.

Seventy-five patients of either sex in the age group of 18-50 years belonging to American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I or II and scheduled for inguinal herniorrhaphy were included in the present study. The patients on cardiovascular medications, those with history of hypersensitivity to clonidine or local anesthetics, and those with conditions that preclude spinal anesthesia were excluded from the study. The study was carried out prospectively in a double-blinded randomized manner.</p><p>All patients were examined preoperatively, and details regarding clinical history and general physical examination were recorded. All routine investigations were carried out and informed written consent from all the participants was obtained. During the pre-anesthetic visit, every patient was familiarized with linear visual analog scale (VAS 0 = no pain and 10 = worst imaginable pain).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Patients were kept fasting for 6 h and premedicated with oral alprazolam 0.25 mg at the previous night. In the operating room, after the establishment of intravenous (IV) line and attachment of standard monitors [non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP), electrocardiography (ECG), and pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>)], IV preloading was done with 500 ml of lactated Ringer's solution over a period of 15&#x02013;20 min. Heart rate and systolic/diastolic blood pressure recorded after preloading were taken to represent the basal readings of hemodynamic parameters.</p><p>All the patients were randomly allocated to one of the three groups (<italic>n</italic> = 25 each) and administered 2.4 ml of the coded intrathecal drug. Patients in all the study groups received hyperbaric bupivacaine 11 mg. Group I received only bupivacaine; group II received 15 mcg clonidine with bupivacaine; and group III received 30 mcg of clonidine with bupivacaine. The volume of solution was kept constant to 2.4 ml by adding saline wherever needed. Allocation to one of three combinations was done using sealed coded envelopes. The study drug was prepared by a fellow anesthesiologist who was not involved in the study. Under all aseptic and universal precautions, spinal anesthesia was administered in lateral decubitus position at the L3&#x02013;L4 interspace and the study drug injected. Patient was then turned supine and 5 min after subarachnoid block, the level of sensory block was assessed by pin-prick method using a 25-G short beveled needle, and reassessed every 5 min for 30 min to record the highest level of block and time taken to achieve the highest level. Thereafter, reassessment was done every 15 min to note two-segment regressions and then every 30 min till the recovery to L3 dermatome. Degree of motor block was assessed by modified Bromage scale as follows[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]:</p><p>

Rescue analgesia in the form of diclofenac sodium 75 mg intramuscularly was administered whenever VAS was &#x0003e;4.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] The time to rescue analgesia (time to first analgesic request) was noted.

Ephedrine 5 mg IV stat was administered to treat hypotension and, whenever needed, atropine 0.3 mg IV was administered when the heart rate dropped to 50 beats/min or &#x0003c;20% of the basal value.

Its analgesic effect is mediated spinally through activation of post-synaptic &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> receptors in substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord. It is known to increase both sensory and motor blocks of local anesthetics by 30&#x02013;50%. This effect has been reported using doses as high as 1 or 2 mcg/kg. At these doses, improved analgesia is associated with systemic side effects such as sedation, bradycardia, and hypotension.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] This study compared whether addition of a small dose clonidine to hyperbaric bupivacaine for spinal anesthesia increased the spread and duration of sensory block, duration of motor block, and time to first analgesic request with minimum side effects.</p><p>We observed that peak sensory level was comparable among the groups. Our findings were similar to those of the study conducted by Van Tuijl <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] who used the same dose of clonidine but lower dose of bupivacaine. Peak sensory level in another study showed a similar trend to our study despite the use of large dose of clonidine (1 mcg/kg),[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] suggesting that the dose of intrathecal clonidine does not affect the peak sensory level. Dobrydnjov <italic>et al</italic>. added 0, 15, or 30 mcg clonidine to 6 mg of intrathecal hyperbaric bupivacaine for inguinal hernia repair and found increase in duration of motor block (146, 155, and 182 min, respectively) as in our study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] The mean time to two-segment regression, regression to L<sub>3</sub> dermatome, and time to first analgesic request was significantly more in clonidine groups than in control group, but increasing the dose of clonidine from 15 to 30 mcg did not affect these parameters. Intensity and duration of motor block was significantly more in groups II and III as compared to group I. Intrathecal clonidine when combined with local anesthetic significantly potentiates the intensity and duration of motor blockade possibly due to the fact that &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenoreceptor agonists induce cellular modification in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and facilitate the local anesthetic action, and prolongation in sensory block can be due to vasoconstrictive effect of clonidine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>Increasing the dose of clonidine from 15 to 30 mcg in our study did not result in any significant difference in peak dermatomal level, peak sensory level, time to two-segment regression and intensity and duration of motor block. De Kock <italic>et al</italic>. also observed that increasing the dose of clonidine from 15 to 45 mcg with 8 mg of ropivacaine did not result in much difference in the above parameters.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>A significant fall was observed in the arterial blood pressure after intrathecal clonidine administration in our study. The fall in blood pressure occurred at 15&#x02013;240 min after spinal injection in groups II and III than in group I. Dobrydnjov <italic>et al</italic>. also recorded a significant decrease in MAP 45&#x02013;120 min after spinal injection in groups BC15 and BC30 than in group B.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Grandhe <italic>et al</italic>. also observed significant decrease in MAP in groups BC1 and BC2 as compared to group B from 45 min to 8 h after intrathecal injection.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Clonidine affects arterial blood pressure in a complex manner because of opposing actions at mutiple sites. The &#x003b1;2-adrenergic agonists produce sympathicolysis and reduce arterial blood pressure through effects at specific brainstem nuclei and on sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord, effects that are counteracted by direct vasoconstriction resulting from the &#x003b1;2-adrenergic agonists on the peripheral vasculature. Combining &#x003b1;2-adrenergic agonists with local anesthetic can potentially increase the degree of sympatholysis and the resulting hypotension.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Various clinical studies and our study have shown that as the intrathecal dose of clonidine is increased, the incidence of hypotension also increases. Heart rate did not change significantly in the three groups. These observations are similar to the observations made by Dobrydnjov <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>Postoperative pain relief was better and prolonged in patients receiving intrathecal clonidine as compared to plain bupivacaine in our study. Although De Kock <italic>et al</italic>. recommended a dose of 15&#x02013;45 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g of clonidine as optimal for supplementing spinal anesthesia,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Dobryndjov <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] suggested that analgesia significantly increases by 15 mcg of intrathecal clonidine, but increasing the dose further does not increase the duration of analgesia. Our findings are in agreement with the findings of Dobryndjov <italic>et al</italic>.</p><p>Incidence of shivering observed in our study is consistent with the observation made by Jeon <italic>et al</italic>. who found that intrathecal clonidine 150 mcg failed to prevent post-spinal shivering and confirmed that IV clonidine 1 mcg/kg is an effective method to prevent shivering in patients undergoing spinal anesthesia for orthopedic surgery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] Dobryndjov <italic>et al</italic>. noted postoperative nausea and vomiting in four patients (one each in group B and BC30 and two patients in BC30).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Sethi <italic>et al</italic>. observed that one patient in the control group and three patients in the clonidine group had nausea,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] but it was insignificant in our study. Sedation is another central effect of &#x003b1;2-adrenergic agonists that can occur after their administration via systemic, epidural, or intrathecal routes. The sedative effect of clonidine is dose dependent and thus explains the absence of sedative effects in our study. Dobryndjov <italic>et al</italic>. and Grandhe <italic>et al</italic>. reported similar findings. Niemi <italic>et al</italic>. and Aaalovschi <italic>et al</italic>. observed significant sedation in patients receiving clonidine because they used higher doses of clonidine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] In the study by Sethi <italic>et al</italic>., 11 patients complained of dryness of mouth, but it was statistically not significant. This was possibly because of a large dose of clonidine (1 mcg/kg) used in their study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] No patient in our study complained of dryness of mouth.</p><p>To conclude, the addition of 15 mcg and 30 mcg of clonidine to bupivacaine intrathecal were found to beequally effective in respect of the duration and quality of sensory block, motor block, and time to first analgesic request. Clonidine 30 mcg was associated with a higher incidence and duration of hypotension than 15 mcg of clonidine. When prolongation of spinal anesthesia is desired, the preferred dose of clonidine, as an adjuvant to local anesthetics, is 15 mcg,.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
