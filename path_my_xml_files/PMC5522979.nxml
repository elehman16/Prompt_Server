Over-prescribing of AB is one of the key causes for the development of bacterial resistance, which the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) calls &#x0201c;one of the world's most pressing public health problems&#x0201d;. In addition to the CDC initiated &#x0201c;Get Smart About Antibiotics&#x0201d; campaign, focused on educating doctors the public about the importance of appropriate AB use, other programs tackling this problem include the development of new treatment paradigms. Data published at the Oregon Health &#x00026; Science University demonstrated that a &#x02018;wait-and-see&#x02019; approach, without an AB prescription for the treatment of acute childhood ear infections, was as quick, safe, and effective in resolving the infections as an AB prescription (Spiro DM, Tay KY, Arnold DH, Dziura JD, Baker MD, Shapiro ED. Wait-and-See Prescription for the Treatment of Acute Otitis Media. JAMA 2006; 296:1235-1241).</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>To try and reduce inappropriate prescribing practices, a wait and see or delayed approach requires patients to return for a prescription if their symptoms persist or worsen. The aim of this study was to determine whether treatment with Mucinex D (Reckitt Benckiser LLC, Parsippany, New Jersey) lowers the use of antibiotics in the treatment of URTIs when compared with placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Patients aged 18 to 75 years with symptoms of acute URTIs were randomized to 1200 mg guaifenesin/120 mg pseudoephedrine hydrochloride extended-release, bilayer tablets or matching placebo for 7 consecutive days. Eligible patients met physician&#x02019;s criteria for antibiotic therapy but were considered suitable for a wait and see approach (withholding antibiotics for &#x02265;48 hours). Patients recorded symptom ratings via an interactive voice response system.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>One thousand one hundred eighty-nine patients enrolled; data are presented for the modified intent-to-treat population (n = 1179). At Day 8, significantly fewer patients receiving guaifenesin/pseudoephedrine versus placebo desired antibiotics (4.2% vs 8.0%). No adverse effects were reported due to patients not taking antibiotics. Significant reductions in URTI symptoms were observed for extended-release guaifenesin/pseudoephedrine versus placebo, from Day 1 throughout the study; however, the proportion of patients experiencing overall relief at the Day 4 evening assessment (primary end point) did not reach statistical significance. Treatment-related adverse events were reported in 9.8% and 4.7% of patients receiving guaifenesin/pseudoephedrine and placebo, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The study found that a wait and see approach was associated with decreased antibiotic use. In addition, the use of a guaifenesin pseudoephedrine combination product provided an effective symptom control compared to a placebo and a well-tolerated first-line strategy for the management of URTIs. This study was not designed to assess the effects of guaifenesin or pseudoephedrine individually. Other limitations include the need for better clinical methods to assess the effectiveness of treatments for acute symptoms of patients with URTIs. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov" id="ir0005">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier: NCT01202279.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group id="keys0005"><title>Key words</title><kwd>antibiotics</kwd><kwd>extended-release guaifenesin</kwd><kwd>pseudoephedrine hydrochloride</kwd><kwd>upper respiratory tract infection</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are typically caused by viruses and are, therefore, not treatable with antibiotic agents.

Only patients actively seeking treatment were enrolled; no advertising was carried out to recruit participants. Eligible patients (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table I</xref>) with onset of symptoms within the past 5 days were enrolled if they had a total respiratory symptom score &#x02265; 12 (based on a 0&#x02013;5 severity rating of 7 respiratory symptoms), with at least 2 out of 3 symptoms; that is, chest congestion, nasal congestion, or thickened mucus, having a score &#x02265; 3. Participants were required to meet the physician&#x02019;s normal criteria for identifying patients who should receive antibiotic therapy but who were considered suitable for a wait-and-see approach (withholding antibiotics for &#x02265;48 hours). Exclusion criteria included recurring respiratory symptoms due to chronic allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, or bronchitis; significant comorbidities; receiving treatment with intranasal medications, systemic antihistamine, or bronchodilators; receiving treatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor within 2 weeks of enrollment, or sleeping pills, sedatives, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, or antidepressants within 7 days (except long-term medication that had been administered at a stable dose for &#x02265;3 months), or systemic corticosteroids or antibiotics within 6 weeks; febrile illness &#x0003e;38&#x000b0;C within 7 days of enrollment; onset of symptoms of URTIs within 2 weeks of receiving a seasonal influenza or 2009 H1N1 vaccination; pregnancy or lactating; and participation in another clinical investigation within 4 weeks of enrollment. The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or other medications to treat URTIs was prohibited during the study, with the exception of low-dose aspirin (81 mg) or acetaminophen (2 &#x000d7; 325 mg) every 4 to 6 hours.<table-wrap id="t0005" position="float"><label>Table I</label><caption><p>Patient characteristics at baseline (modified intent-to-treat population).<xref rid="tblIfn1" ref-type="table-fn">*</xref></p></caption><alt-text id="at0025">Table I</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Guaifenesin/pseudoephedrine (n = 591)</th><th>Placebo (n = 588)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Age, y</td><td align="char">37.4 (13.7)</td><td align="char">38.8 (13.7)</td></tr><tr><td>Female sex</td><td align="char">395 (66.8)</td><td align="char">404 (68.7)</td></tr><tr><td>Race</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;White</td><td align="char">494 (83.6)</td><td align="char">485 (82.5)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Black/African American</td><td align="char">59 (10.0)</td><td align="char">63 (10.7)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Other</td><td align="char">38 (6.4)</td><td align="char">40 (6.8)</td></tr><tr><td>Diagnosis</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Acute bronchitis</td><td align="char">66 (11.2)</td><td align="char">68 (11.6)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Acute sinusitis</td><td align="char">145 (24.5)</td><td align="char">151 (25.7)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Rhinitis</td><td align="char">62 (10.5)</td><td align="char">67 (11.4)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Nasal congestion</td><td align="char">87 (14.7)</td><td align="char">70 (11.9)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Chest congestion</td><td align="char">22 (3.7)</td><td align="char">24 (4.1)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Other</td><td align="char">209 (35.4)</td><td align="char">208 (35.4)</td></tr><tr><td>Baseline total symptom score</td><td align="char">23.4 (4.9)</td><td align="char">23.6 (4.5)</td></tr><tr><td>Baseline individual symptom scores&#x02002;</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Chest congestion</td><td align="char">3.05 (1.14)</td><td align="char">3.11 (1.11)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Thickened mucus</td><td align="char">3.50 (0.90)</td><td align="char">3.49 (0.80)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Nasal congestion</td><td align="char">3.55 (0.92)</td><td align="char">3.57 (0.92)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Runny nose</td><td align="char">2.93 (1.23)</td><td align="char">3.01 (1.14)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Sinus headache</td><td align="char">3.11 (1.35)</td><td align="char">3.11 (1.30)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Sinus pressure</td><td align="char">3.39 (1.09)</td><td align="char">3.36 (1.10)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Postnasal drip</td><td align="char">3.11 (1.16)</td><td align="char">3.15 (1.07)</td></tr><tr><td>Baseline WURSS-21 score</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Overall total</td><td align="char">90.4<xref rid="tblIfn2" ref-type="table-fn">&#x02020;</xref> (22.1)</td><td align="char">91.2 (21.0)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Symptom score</td><td align="char">44.0<xref rid="tblIfn2" ref-type="table-fn">&#x02020;</xref> (10.7)</td><td align="char">44.3 (10.0)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Functional score</td><td align="char">36.2<xref rid="tblIfn2" ref-type="table-fn">&#x02020;</xref> (12.9)</td><td align="char">36.7 (12.6)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>WURSS-21 = Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblIfn1"><label>&#x0204e;</label><p id="ntp0005">Values are presented as mean (SD) (age, baseline total symptom score, baseline individual symptom scores, and baseline WURSS-21 score), or n (%) (sex, race, and diagnosis).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblIfn2"><label>&#x02020;</label><p id="ntp0010">n = 590.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="s0020"><title>Randomization to treatment</title><p>The random allocation sequence was generated by the study statistician.

This difference from placebo was apparent throughout the study, except for the evening score on Day 4 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.1). The reason for this discrepancy is unknown, but this isolated outcome was not expected, considering that the symptom score <italic>P</italic> values are significant for the combination drug versus placebo at both the bracketing time points on Day 4 morning (<italic>P</italic> = 0.027) and Day 5 morning (<italic>P</italic> = 0.02). The single, statistically nonsignificant assessment result on Day 4 evening seems to be inconsistent with the other 13 assessments throughout the study and also stands in contrast with the total overall WURSS-21 score, which includes a symptom subscore and showed statistical significance favoring the combination product over placebo at the same Day 4 evening measurement.</p><p>Placebo effects in studies of mucoactive drugs in URTI patients have been documented.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Such a phenomenon could also have influenced the questionable outcome on Day 4 in this study. The main hypothesis to explain this single point deviation in the study results is that there may have been some sort of white coat or Hawthorne effect<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> caused by the office visit on Day 4 before patients completed their afternoon/evening assessment. The hypothesis implies that the clinic experience and heightened awareness of being studied on that day may have made patients unsure about what to enter into the IVRS for their self-assessment, contrary to how they had done the scoring at the other time points before the afternoon of Day 4 and for the remainder of the study on the morning of Day 5 and onward. In some way, the examinations and interviews at the clinics seem to have influenced patient perceptions, leading to the elimination of the differentiation between the active treatment and placebo at the afternoon/evening assessment on Day 4 compared with the earlier time points in the study.</p><p>The primary end point for this study was not chosen because Day 4 evening is a particularly significant time point for assessing treatment efficacy in a study of this nature. Rather, it was an arbitrary selection based on a prior, differently designed study,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> which also served to determine the sample size. In retrospect, earlier assessment time points might arguably be more relevant, because rapid symptom reduction is a priority for most URTI patients, and the ER drug combination tested in this study achieved a significant reduction in symptom score versus placebo starting on Day 1 and at all time points preceding the Day 4 evening assessment.</p><p>The treatment effect reported in this study may raise a question as to what constitutes a clinically meaningful difference between placebo and active treatment. For example, 1 study publication reported that patients with the common cold would accept a small treatment benefit in symptom relief (10% or less),<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> and in a review of the effectiveness of nasal decongestants,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> the decrease in subjective symptoms compared with placebo was small but statistically significant at 6%. The difficulty in demonstrating sizeable treatment effects in placebo-controlled URTI studies can, to a large extent, be attributed to the rapidly changing URTI condition and naturally improving symptoms. The other key factor contributing to this difficulty is the absence of relevant objective or validated, subjective clinical methods to capture the gradual changes in symptomatology while the underlying (viral) infection is resolving.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Therefore, the usually small improvements recorded with active OTC cough and cold treatments compared with placebo in URTI treatment studies may, in contrast, be perceived as being more meaningful by consumers self-treating with such products, because the clinical methods used in the studies do not capture the real-life consumer self-treatment experience with OTC cough and cold products.</p><p>The second objective of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a wait-and-see approach in reducing antibiotic prescribing in patients with acute symptoms of a URTI if they are instead offered a treatment for rapid symptom relief. The results of this study encourage the use of such a strategy in that ~80% of patients did not receive, or ask for, an antibiotic, regardless of treatment group. Compared with placebo, fewer patients in the active treatment group (ER guaifenesin/pseudoephedrine) were prescribed an antibiotic than in the mITT and PP populations and statistically significantly fewer patients receiving ER guaifenesin/pseudoephedrine desired antibiotics, compared with the PP population, at Day 8.</p><p>It has to be noted that reduction of antibiotic use in the Mucinex D group compared with the placebo was observed at Day 4 and Day 8 in the mITT and PP populations, but statistical significance was only achieved at Day 8 in the PP population (<italic>P</italic> = 0.033).</p><p>These outcomes may potentially be attributed to the redirecting of HCPs on the appropriate prescribing of antibiotics, combined with the observed improvement in symptoms resulting from the ER guaifenesin/pseudoephedrine treatment. Suggestions for HCPs provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Get Smart About Antibiotics campaign relating to antibiotic use include recommending a specific symptomatic therapy, spending time answering patient questions, and offering a contingency plan if symptoms worsen.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> This study provides evidence that using a wait-and-see approach, combined with the use of ER guaifenesin/pseudoephedrine to improve symptoms, does seem to result in the desired reduction in both requests for, and use of, antibiotics in patients with acute symptoms of URTIs.</p><p>Limitations of this study are that the treatment effect was not significant at the arbitrarily chosen primary efficacy end point, and that this outlier result compared with the other 13 symptom scoring occasions cannot be sufficiently explained. Other irregularities, such as the differences in efficacy observed between the active treatment and placebo, that missed statistical significance in the mITT population but were significant in the PP population, highlight that protocol violations (eg, placebo-assigned patients taking additional treatments), may have compromised the strength of this study. This study was also not designed to quantify the individual contribution of guaifenesin or pseudoephedrine to the observed symptom improvements. Although pseudoephedrine is an established decongestant, guaifenesin is a well-recognized expectorant and has been shown to be effective for chest congestion and improvement of cough as well as symptoms of rhinitis and nasal congestion.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Thus, it is assumed that both agents contributed to the relief of URTI symptoms and the related patient satisfaction.</p><p>Lastly, it was logistically and methodologically challenging to implement the wait-and-see strategy in this study because it was difficult to recruit true antibiotic-seeking patients and have a better defined target population. Although the study outcomes point to the potentially beneficial effects of a wait-and-see strategy in reducing antibiotic overuse in URTI patients, a larger sample size and optimized patient recruitment strategies might have resulted in even more convincing results in terms of showing reduced antibiotic requests or desired prescriptions in these patients. Further method development efforts for conducting these kinds of studies are needed.</p></sec><sec id="s0075"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of this wait-and-see study provide additional insights, not only regarding the effectiveness and safety of an ER guaifenesin/pseudoephedrine combination product in reducing acute URTI symptoms, but also in the strategy of providing symptom relief to discourage unwarranted antibiotic use in this patient population. Addressing patient concerns and recommending symptom-relieving products for URTIs early on can meet patient expectations for rapid relief and diminish their desire for antibiotic prescriptions.</p><p>Further research in the assessment of symptomatic treatments for the management of acute URTI symptoms is needed. Data from this trial may inform the design and execution of future studies of URTI patient populations to identify better clinical methods and encourage more prudent use of antibiotics for viral URTIs.</p></sec><sec id="s0080"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>This study was supported by Reckitt Benckiser LLC, Parsippany, New Jersey.</p><p>Helmut Albrecht is a consultant to Reckitt Benckiser LLC, Parsippany, New Jersey.
