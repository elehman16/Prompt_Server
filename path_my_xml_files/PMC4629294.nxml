Purslane is a rich source of antioxidants including Vitamins A, C, and E, and beta-carotene, which might help strengthening body's total antioxidant capacity (TAC).[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Previous studies have indicated that phenolic alkaloids of purslane, including oleracin A, B, and E increased scavenging of free radicals in rat brains.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Administration of purslane aqueous juice was beneficial for hepatic, renal, and testicular tissue due to its antioxidant properties.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Other studies have also demonstrated that polysaccharides from purslane led to lower exercise-induced oxidative stress.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In diabetic rats, administration of purslane extract has been resulted in reduced lipid peroxidation.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Despite lots of information about the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications, limited data are available on the application of dietary strategies for alleviating oxidative stress in diabetic patients. The antioxidant properties of purslane in prior studies have been mostly examined in animal models, and we are aware of no study that examined the effects of purslane intake on oxidative stress in humans. Assessing the effect of purslane intake on biomarkers of oxidative stress is particularly relevant for diabetic patients who are at increased risk of oxidative stress. The current study was designed to examine the effects of purslane seeds on biomarkers of oxidative stress in type 2 diabetic patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Diabetic patients aged 35&#x02013;65 attending Endocrine Research Center of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, were included in this randomized cross-over clinical trial. The study was carried out in Isfahan, Iran, during January 2012&#x02013;July 2012. On the basis of sample size formula suggested for cross-over clinical trials, a sample size of 38 people was needed for the whole trial. Given the high drop-outs in cross-over trials, we enrolled 40 subjects that diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, based on the criteria of American Diabetes Association in this trial.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In addition to being a diabetic patient, subjects were needed to be nonsmokers, nonusers of alcohol, nonpregnant, and nonlactating women. They were recruited in the study if they had not changed the dosage and type of medications in the last 2 months prior to the study and had no history of cardiovascular, lung, kidney, and liver diseases. A written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study design</title><p>Diabetic patients were randomly assigned to the initial arm of the study to receive either 10 g/day purslane seeds powder, with 240 cc low-fat yogurt (intervention group) or only 240 cc low-fat yogurt (as control group) for 5 weeks. The prescribed dose of 10 g/day purslane seeds powder was selected based on a previous study.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] After a 2-week washout period, subjects were crossed over to the alternate treatment arm for an additional 5 weeks. Patients were asked not to change their regular diet and routine physical activity levels for the duration of the study. They were also requested not to start insulin injection and not to change the dosage and type of medications throughout the study. We assessed dietary intakes of subjects by the use of dietary records three times during each study phase (2 weeks days and a weekend day). Nutritionist IV software (First Databank) was used to calculate nutrient intakes based on dietary records. Physical activity levels were also assessed through physical activity records during the study once every 2 weeks. Data from physical activity records were expressed as MET-h/day.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Assessment of biochemical measures</title><p>Fasting blood samples (10 mL) were taken at baseline and end of each study phase in an early morning after an overnight fast. Blood samples were immediately centrifuged (Hettich D-78532, Tuttlingen, Germany) at 3500 rpm for 10 min to separate serum. Then, the samples were stored at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C before analysis at the laboratory. Plasma TAC and plasma oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) was assessed by the use of ELISA kit (Glory Science, USA). Serum malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were quantified using ELISA kit (Glory Science, USA). All inter-and intra-assay coefficients of variation for biochemical indicators were &#x0003c;5%.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>All statistical analyses were done using the Statistical Package for Social Science version 16 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA).

To our knowledge, this study is among the first investigations that examined the effects of purslane seeds on biomarkers of oxidative stress in type 2 diabetic patients.</p><p>Type 2 diabetes is the most prevalent metabolic disease all over the world. Oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] There are several ways to control the oxidative stress in diabetic patients. Earlier studies have shown that some medicinal plants may protect diabetes against oxidative stress.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Due to the high concentrations of antioxidants in purslane, it has potential antioxidant effects.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] However, we did not find any beneficial effect of purslane seeds on oxidative stress in the current study. A limited number of studies has been published about the health effects of purslane. In addition, previous studies have reached opposite findings. Administration of aqueous juice of purslane has been resulted in improvement in antioxidant parameters in rats.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Consumption of purslane leaves for 3 weeks led to a significant reduction in TBARS and a tremendous increase in GSH-R in diabetic rats.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In addition, Hao <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] reported that purslane administration resulted in the increased levels of superoxide dismutase and decreased levels of MDA in the brains of mice treated with D-galactosamine. Others have also shown that purslane leaves can reduce some cardiovascular risk factors through decreasing ox-LDL and increasing the activity of the paraoxanase-1 enzyme in hyperlipidemic subjects.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Previous studies have documented that intake of 5 g/day <italic>P. oleracea</italic> seeds in type 2 diabetic subjects could decrease serum levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, liver alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transaminase, total and direct bilirubin, fasting and postprandial blood glucose, insulin, body weight, and body mass index while increased high density lipoprotein cholesterol and albumin.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The discrepancy between our findings and other studies might be explained by the discrepancies in study design, duration of intervention and participants of the study. Furthermore, it must be kept in mind that almost all previous studies have been done on animals. In addition, we used purslane seeds rather than purslane leaves or other preparations in this study.</p><p>Several mechanisms might explain the antioxidant effects of purslane. It has been shown that purslane intake results in better glycemic control in diabetic patients.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Purslane mechanism can be in connection with increasing insulin secretion by closing of the channel gate ATP-K<sup>+</sup>, membrane depolarization, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry stimulation as the first key step in insulin secretion.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Improved homeostasis of glucose in diabetic patients might explain the beneficial effects of purslane on biomarkers of oxidative stress. However, as we published previously,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] we did not find any significant effect of purslane seeds on plasma glucose levels in these patients. Purslane has been shown to elevate antioxidant enzymes through which it might lead to reduced oxidative stress.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>The strength of the present study was the use of a crossover design which decreased the effect of confounders. Also, the study was among the first investigations that examined the effects of purslane seeds on biomarkers of oxidative stress in patients with type 2 diabetic. Some limitations need to be taken into account in the interpretation of our findings. One of our study limitations is the method of assessment of compliance to purslane seeds intake. We assessed compliance through phone interviews as well as asking participants to deliver the empty sachets to study personnel. Future studies are better to assess the compliance through the use of an appropriate biomarker. Although finding a suitable biomarker for purslane intake is difficult, measurement of the alpha-linolenic acid content of red blood cells&#x02019; membranes might provide some information in this regard.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] The short duration of intervention might prohibit us to reach significant effects of purslane on biomarkers of oxidative stress. In addition, a single measurement of the metabolic profile, which has day-to-day variations, in the current study, might lead to misleading findings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>This cross-over clinical trial revealed that consumption of purslane seeds for 5 weeks in type 2 diabetic patients did not result in improved oxidative stress. Additional studies with a much longer experimental period and a larger sample size are needed to further explore the effects of purslane on oxidative stress.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This study was extracted from an MSc thesis which was approved by Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (No.
