This difference was robust to variations in the starting weight of shakers, as well as time spent shaking and participant shaking explored in experiments 2&#x02013;4.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec019"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="sec020"><title>Summary of results</title><p>This is the first documented study we are aware of exploring differences in salt delivered by salt shakers commonly encouraged in independent takeaways in England. We compared the standard 17HSS to the newer 5HSS. Across all experiments, the 5HSS delivered around 34% of the salt delivered by the 17HSS. This difference was robust to changes in the starting fullness of shakers, the length of time spent shaking and the person serving.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Strengths and limitations of methods</title><p>We considered a number of variables that may influence how much salt is delivered by salt shakers: starting fullness of shaker, length of time spent shaking, and person shaking. We focused on length of time spent shaking, rather than number of shakes, as our observations of real-life practice suggest that shaking a salt shaker is a continuous action, rather than a series of discrete actions. Our anecdotal observations in Fish &#x00026; Chip Shops also suggest that median time spent shaking is around 4-5s, ranging from around 1-10s, indicating that the range of times we chose are largely reflective of practice. We conducted 10 trials of each condition, and recruited a range of different individuals for experiment 4 to increase the reliability of our results.</p><p>Participants were only semi-blinded to the purpose of the experiment. They were aware that we were investigating how much salt different shakers delivered. But they were not aware which was the &#x02018;new&#x02019; shaker or which was proposed to deliver less salt. Given that participants could also see how much salt was being delivered (although they were not informed of how much salt was actually delivered), this may have had some influence on their shaking behaviour.</p><p>Experiments 1&#x02013;3 were all conducted by the same individual and in series. It is possible that this subject was more careful in their shaking, and less tired, during experiment 1 than in later experiments. However, there remained clear differences between salt shakers in all experiments, suggesting this did not impact substantially on the results.</p><p>Salt shakers were trialed alternatively in all experiments&#x02013;that is the 5HSS was trialed, then the 17HSS, then the 5HSS, then the 17HSS until 10 repeats of each had been conducted. If subjects tired during testing, this may have differentially effected the different shakers. However, by alternating shakers throughout, this is likely to have a small effect, if any.</p><p>We were not able to take account of all variables that may influence how much salt is delivered in practice. These include: customer preference, humidity leading to potential clogging of shakers, and any shop-specific special procedures. Our results represent controlled conditions and may not be generalizable to salt shaker use in practice.</p><p>The sample size in all experiments may appear &#x02018;low&#x02019;. The main risk of a small sample size is of type 2 error&#x02013;that is, failing to identify a difference where one exists. As we identified a difference in all comparisons, there is no risk of type 2 error. However, it is possible that our results are subject to type 1 error&#x02013;that is, identifying a difference where one does not exist. The main method for reducing type 1 error is to reduce the threshold p-value taken to indicate statistical significance. All of our p-values were &#x02264;0.001 &#x02013;indicating that type 1 error will occur in 0.1%, or fewer, tests. Given we have conducted 7 tests, the overall chance of type 1 error is less than 0.7%. As such, our results are very unlikely to be subject to type 1 error.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Interpretation of results and implications for policy, practice and research</title><p>Our results are encouraging for the increasing number of English local government areas and independent takeaways who promote, or use, the 5HSS to reduce the salt content of takeaway food. They may also be a useful prompt for those working to reduce the salt content of takeaway food in other countries to consider how 5HSS could work in other settings. Although our intention was not to determine under what conditions the least amount of salt is delivered, our results do suggest that less salt is delivered when shakers are half full, compared to nearly empty or nearly full. It is not clear how practical this finding could be in practice. Unsurprisingly, shaking for less time also resulted in less salt delivered.</p><p>We cannot conclude from our results that the 5HSS will necessarily be associated with less salt consumed with takeaway food. For example, in real-life settings, servers may shake for longer with the 5HSS,[<xref rid="pone.0163093.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] or customers may ask for, or add their own, additional salt. There is some anecdotal evidence to suggest these, unintended, consequences do occur.[<xref rid="pone.0163093.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Further research is required to confirm that the 5HSS is associated with less salt added to takeaway food, less salt consumed with takeaway food, and to explore any impact on customers&#x02019; total diets.</p><p>The results of experiment 4 showed substantial between-person variation in the amount of salt delivered by the 5HSS and 17HSS. Indeed, between-subjects variance was 1.57 for the 5HSS and 23.04 for the 17HSS, whilst within-subjects variance was 0.26 for the 5HSS and 1.87 for the 17HSS. Whilst, overall, the 5HSS delivered less salt than the 17HSS in experiment 4, the salt delivered by some individuals using the 5HSS was more than that delivered by others using the 17HSS. Between-person variation should, therefore, also be expected in practice. Substantial variation in salt content of takeaway food has been previously documented[<xref rid="pone.0163093.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and this may reflect both variations in recipes and serving practice. The variance figures reported above give variance ratios (between-subjects variance/within-subjects variance) of 6.04 for the 5HSS and 12.32 for the 17HSS&#x02013;indicating proportionally greater between-subjects than within-subjects variance for the 17HSS than the 5HSS. The 5HSS may help standardise, as well as reduce, the amount of salt added to food.</p><p>The 5HSS only addresses discretionary salt added by servers, and possibly customers, to takeaway food. The 5HSS does not address the relatively high levels of salt added to these foods in preparation.[<xref rid="pone.0163093.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0163093.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Further interventions may be required to help takeaways reformulate recipes to reduce salt added during preparation. Reformulation to reduce salt content has been successful in the wider UK food industry.[<xref rid="pone.0163093.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Other, wider, initiatives are also be required to tackle salt consumption holistically.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec023"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Five holed salt shakers delivered around 34% of the salt of 17HSS in controlled conditions. This difference was robust to variations in: the amount of salt in the shaker, the length of time spent shaking, and the person serving. This confirms the potential of the 5HSS as a method to reduce the salt content of takeaway food, and particularly food from Fish &#x00026; Chip shops, where these shakers are particularly used. Further research will be required to determine the effects of this intervention on customers&#x02019; salt intake from takeaway food and total dietary salt intake.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec024"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0163093.s001"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>Statistical code.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0163093.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Julia Lough, Bill Scott and Chris Hawthorne at Gateshead Council originally developed and introduced the five holed salt shaker studied in this work.</p><p>Aoife Doherty, student on the Food &#x00026; Human Nutrition BSc at Newcastle University, helped with data collection.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0163093.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Adams</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Goffe</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Lake</surname><given-names>AA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Summerbell</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>, <name><surname>White</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
