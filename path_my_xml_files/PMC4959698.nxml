High intensity exercise is not always a viable option for many patient groups or in a rehabilitation setting where low to moderate intensities may be more suitable. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of intensity in mediating the effects of acute cardiovascular exercise on motor skill learning. We investigated the effects of different exercise intensities on the retention (performance score) of a visuomotor accuracy tracking task. Thirty six healthy male subjects were randomly assigned to one of three groups that performed either a single bout of aerobic exercise at 20 min post motor skill learning at 45% (EX45), 90% (EX90) maximal power output (W<sub>max</sub>) or rested (CON). Randomization was stratified to ensure that the groups were matched for relative peak oxygen consumption (ml O<sub>2</sub>/min/kg) and baseline score in the tracking task. Retention tests were carried out at 1 (R1) and 7 days (R7) post motor skill learning. At R1, changes in performance scores were greater for EX90 compared to CON (p&#x0003c;0.001) and EX45 (p = 0.011). The EX45 and EX90 groups demonstrated a greater change in performance score at R7 compared to the CON group (p = 0.003 and p&#x0003c;0.001, respectively). The change in performance score for EX90 at R7 was also greater than EX45 (p = 0.049). We suggest that exercise intensity plays an important role in modulating the effects that a single bout of cardiovascular exercise has on the consolidation phase following motor skill learning. There appears to be a dose-response relationship in favour of higher intensity exercise in order to augment off-line effects and strengthen procedural memory.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004825</institution-id><institution>Nordea-fonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>02-2011-4360</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8745-7462</contrib-id><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Nordea-fonden grant number 02-2011-4360, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nordeafonden.dk/english">http://nordeafonden.dk/english</ext-link>.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="3"/><page-count count="16"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>Data is available from Zenodo: DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.57508">10.5281/zenodo.57508</ext-link>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>Data is available from Zenodo: DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.57508">10.5281/zenodo.57508</ext-link>.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>The benefits of physical activity on brain function, brain health and cognition are well documented [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and it has previously been demonstrated that an acute bout of exercise can positively affect cognition [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0159589.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and declarative memory [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0159589.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The relationship between exercise and memory has been summarized in a meta-analysis by Roig and colleagues and the evidence points towards acute exercise having positive effects on long-term memory. Results vary greatly however, depending on the type of task and memory studied [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Recent studies have reported that an acute bout of high intensity aerobic exercise can also improve motor skill learning [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. While the different phases of the memory formation process; acquisition, consolidation and retrieval/retention encompass several neural processes and involve a vast number of interconnected brain networks [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], these studies provide evidence supporting the idea that an acute bout of cardiovascular exercise can positively affect procedural memory by affecting underlying cellular mechanisms in the period following skill practice (off-line effects).</p><p>While there is evidence to suggest that an acute exercise bout can positively affect procedural memory, the mechanisms underlying the effects remain, however, poorly understood and learning tasks and exercise paradigms vary between studies [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0159589.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It is thus, not clear which aspects of exercise are critical for positive effects on procedural memory. Acute exercise interventions do, however, allow for readily controlling and monitoring specific parameters (intensity, duration, modality) when investigating effects on procedural memory. Specifically, within exercise, it is possible to control intensity; either relative to maximal oxygen uptake, maximum power output or age related maximum heart rate.</p><p>In relation to procedural memory, Statton and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] recently investigated the effect of an acute bout of moderate intensity exercise (30 min running at 65&#x02013;85% of age predicted maximum heart rate) on motor skill acquisition and retention with the Sequential Visual Isometric Pinch Task (SVIPT). When moderate intensity exercise was performed prior to motor practice, exercise improved acquisition. There was however no effect of exercise on retention level over multiple days of training. The finding that moderate intensity exercise prior to motor practice influence skill acquisition but not delayed retention was also recently found by Snow and co-workers [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Recent work by Roig and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] investigated the effects of an acute high intensity (90% VO<sub>2peak</sub>) exercise bout (cycling) on motor skill learning. The results showed that a bout of high intensity exercise performed prior to motor skill acquisition had a significant positive effect not on skill acquisition but on procedural memory assessed with delayed retention tests. Mang and co-workers also observed improvements in sequence-specific implicit motor learning at a 24h retention test when an acute bout of high intensity exercise, similar to the protocol from the study by Roig et al., was performed prior to acquisition [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Importantly, Roig and colleagues also found positive effects of intense exercise <italic>following</italic> motor practice, and in this case, the intense exercise bout had an even greater effect on consolidation of the procedural memory compared to when performed prior to motor practice [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The finding that exercise following motor practice can promote retention of procedural memory was recently confirmed by Thomas et al. [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>These studies add credence to the hypothesis that exercise intensity (and timing) is somehow intimately related to improvements in the acquisition and retention of motor skills. Whereas moderate intensity exercise prior to motor practice had beneficial effects on acquisition, this was not found for high intensity exercise. High intensity exercise prior to and following motor practice had positive effects on consolidation of procedural memory and delayed retention. While these positive effects of intense exercise were found in delayed retention tests, the importance of exercise intensity following encoding or acquisition is however currently unclear, since only effects of high intensity exercise have been elucidated.</p><p>As exercise intensity is increased circulating concentrations of catecholamines, serotonin (5-HT), lactate, dopamine, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) increase concurrently [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0159589.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Different measures of corticospinal excitability (CSE) have also been reported to be affected by an acute bout of aerobic exercise [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0159589.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The specific role of these biomarkers and changes in CSE in relation to procedural memory are currently also poorly understood, but they are potential candidates influencing the process. Furthermore, their direct relationship to exercise intensity means that their potential contribution should be carefully considered.</p><p>High intensity exercise bouts may be too challenging and not appropriate for certain patient groups or in a rehabilitation setting. We planned to investigate the role of exercise intensity on the consolidation of motor skill learning via a visuomotor tracking task. We, therefore, aimed to investigate to what extent a low to moderate aerobic exercise bout of a similar duration affects motor skill learning when performed post acquisition and measured with delayed retention tests. We proposed the following hypothesis; the level of consolidation of a newly acquired motor skill, measured via retention tests at 1 (R1) and 7 days (R7), would depend on the intensity of the exercise performed in a dose-response manner. The higher the intensity the more pronounced the consolidation of the long term memory.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials &#x00026; Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Subjects</title><p>Thirty-six able-bodied, healthy, right-handed males, 24 &#x000b1; 3 (SD) years old were recruited from the Copenhagen area to participate in the study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0159589.t001">Table 1</xref>).

Their right forearm was fixed in a custom made frame with the elbow joint angle at 100&#x02013;110&#x000b0; while their left arm rested on the table in front of them. At the distal end of the custom made frame a vertical cylindrical handle with a diameter of 2.5cm and a length of 14.5cm allowed subjects to grip with a completely closed fist. The handle was attached to a strain gauge, which transferred information on the torque created. Subjects were able to apply force to the handle with isometric muscle contractions in a lateral and medial direction (i.e. wrist extension and flexion).

With no lateral or medial force applied to the handle the cursor would return to the pre-determined baseline position. The cursor moved with a constant velocity from left to right taking 8s for each trial. The closer the cursor was moved to the target, the better the score.</p><p>Handle torque force was digitized and sampled at 500Hz with a USB 6228 DAQ (Data Acquisition) board (National Instruments Inc., USA). A customized script built on MATLAB (MathWorks Inc., USA) was used to run the VAT. After each trial feedback on performance was provided on the screen by means of a score from 0&#x02013;100. The score was calculated as a reverse function of the measure of total error between the double sine curve and the trace produced by the subject. The error score was defined as the mean vertical distance from the fixed target in relation to its distance from the &#x0201c;zero&#x0201d; position of the cursor when force = 0N. If the root mean square (RMS) error exceeded two times the distance from target to baseline the score was zero. A RMS error of 0 equaled a score of 100. This was calculated at all sampled data points across each trial. Subjects performed the VAT on three occasions: at the main experiment (acquisition), at the 1 day retention test (R1) and at the 7 day retention test (R7). The acquisition phase consisted of 5 blocks (B1, B2, B3, B4, B5) of 20 trials (100 trials in total) with each block taking 4 min to complete with rest periods of 2 min between blocks giving a total time of 28 min performing the VAT.</p><p>Before starting the VAT at acquisition, R1 and R7 all subjects performed a familiarization trial with a single sine wave and had to score &#x02265;50 three times consecutively with the correct tracking direction at the first deflection of the target in order to proceed. This was done to minimize differences at baseline that could have affected the final levels of performance at block 5 (B5). At the start of all VAT sessions the apparatus was reset with the subject holding the handle at rest with their wrist in the neutral start position. Furthermore, at acquisition, the VAT was introduced via a standardized presentation lasting 5 minutes. The VAT model was based on similar visuomotor tasks used to induce a robust learning effect [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0159589.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Baseline was defined as the mean score for trials 2&#x02013;20 in block 1 (B1) and Block 5 (B5) represented the post motor learning level. A single block of 20 trials was performed at R1 and R7 without feedback (score) for each trial [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The mean score for trial 2&#x02013;20 in each block was used as a measure of retention. The first trial was omitted to ensure any adverse effects on the retention tests due to large variability relating to initiation of the test block. The 7 day retention test (R7) included an additional training block, R7Tr, consisting of 20 trials with feedback as the performance score. This was used to check for saturation in the VAT and to assess for a potential ceiling effect in skill level where mean scores (trial 2&#x02013;20) were compared to R7. Subjects therefore performed a total of 160 trials throughout the whole experiment.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Graded Maximal Exercise Test</title><p>The graded maximal exercise test was conducted in order to assess the subject&#x02019;s aerobic fitness level (VO<sub>2peak</sub>), maximal power output (W<sub>max</sub>) and to collect blood lactate samples at various workloads.

Our main result supports this hypothesis demonstrating that a significantly greater change in mean scores was observed for the high intensity exercise group (EX90) at 1 and 7 days compared to both the low intensity (EX45) and resting control (CON) groups. The CON group demonstrated a tendency towards an off-line decrease at 24h with a further decline at 7 days. While the values for CON did not reach statistically significant levels, the between-group differences between the control group and the EX90 and EX45 groups were significant at the 7 day retention test. Following the 7 day retention test only the CON and EX45 groups improved motor performance with continued practice. This could indicate that EX90 had significantly larger offline gains in motor performance compared to CON and EX90 and were approaching a possible ceiling effect in the VAT task, and that the task may, to some extent, have limited the effects observed for EX90.</p><p>We provide here additional information regarding the influence of one of the several parameters within exercise, which can potentially affect the consolidation of procedural memory. Our results suggest that intensity of the acute exercise bout following motor skill acquisition is central to stimulating or amplifying the cellular mechanisms in the central nervous system that underlie the consolidation process. There appears to be a connection between exercise intensity, consolidation and the retention of procedural memories. It is well established that systemic blood flow increases in line with a concurrent increase in exercise intensity and these are accompanied by increases in biomarkers [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0159589.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0159589.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Similarly, a larger percentage of skeletal muscle must be recruited as intensity increases involving a greater contribution from the central nervous system. Whether exercise has an effect at a systemic level increasing blood flow and activity in the central nervous system, or whether it is one or more of the biomarkers released during exercise that contribute to this amplification effect is uncertain. It is possible that it is a combination of multiple factors, which the following section will address.</p><p>Based on the results of Skriver et al. [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] lactate appears to be an important biomarker of the effect of exercise on motor memory. It does not necessarily indicate that it is an elevated blood lactate level <italic>per se</italic>, which triggers amplification of the plastic changes occurring at the synaptic level. The increased production and release of lactate during high intensity exercise potentially represents a signaling mechanism or mediator compound relating to the release of BDNF [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and motor memory formation [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0159589.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. It is however unclear how the interplay and contributions of lactate and various different compounds in humans affect learning and how exercise seems to amplify these effects. Exercise at higher relative intensities have shown to lead to greater release of a number of biomarkers of which BDNF and norepinephrine (NE) correlate with an increased level of retention of a motor skill [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] although associations between the peripheral concentration of some of these neurochemicals and procedural memory are not supported by all studies [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Other compounds, which may also play a role in memory processing, namely epinephrine, dopamine and insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] are possible contributors having modulating effects. Peripheral measures of these compounds and their role in plastic changes within the central nervous system must be approached with caution as they are not necessarily an accurate correlate or predictor of improvements in motor skill learning [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Similar to the 2012 study by Roig and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] we observed a more pronounced difference in retention level after 7 days. This may be related to the proposed phases of memory consolidation presented by Dudai and co-workers [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0159589.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Newly acquired memories, in this case motor memory, are consolidated first of all at the cellular/synaptic level over a period of minutes and hours following encoding and termed synaptic consolidation. The post-encoding reorganization of long-term memory lasting days and years involving structural and network changes is termed as systems consolidation and could partly explain the continued increase in retention of the motor skill at 7 days. There is evidence to suggest that exercise may protect newly established memory traces. This has been demonstrated by the recent study by Rhee and co-workers [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. While the type of task differed from the visuomotor accuracy tracking task used here, exercise, placed in close temporal proximity to the encoding phase of a motor skill, would seem to augment the consolidation process [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0159589.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The focus of the Rhee study was on the effect of exercise in relation to interference and a broad enhancement and protection of the off-line gains of task A was observed when performed immediately prior to a second interfering task (B) at 2h post.</p><p>During the consolidation phase procedural memory can potentially be enhanced and/or stabilized [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0159589.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0159589.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0159589.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. There is also the potential for interference during this phase [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] but it would seem that the placement of exercise here can lead to an enhancement of the memory [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This further underlines the extent to which consolidation is susceptible to both positive and negative influences. The acquisition and retention of motor skills have been shown to be susceptible to changes in and/or states of awareness [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], sleepiness, mood [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], motivation and relating to motivation the type and timing of feedback and/or cues [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0159589.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The homogeneity of the three groups at the outset of the study where subjects were also matched for age, BMI, relative aerobic capacity and baseline score in the visuomotor tracking task (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0159589.t001">1</xref> &#x00026; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0159589.t002">2</xref>), allows us to more confidently attribute the differences in retention between groups to be related to the exercise intervention.</p><p>Regarding the potential for incorporating exercise into motor skill learning scenarios there are a number of considerations. It would seem that an acute bout of high intensity aerobic exercise following acquisition of a new motor skill improves the skill level by promoting an increased level of long-term retention. This may be a viable method with healthy, moderately trained individuals, as shown in this study, but may not be a viable alternative for certain patient groups in a rehabilitation setting or the elderly [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Performing a bout of high intensity exercise is both physically and mentally taxing and if a similar positive effect on retention could be elicited by reducing the intensity then this would provide a more practically viable option [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].</p><p>The effects of low intensity exercise on retention seem to be present but not as pronounced as the effects of high intensity exercise. The work conducted by Statton and co-workers [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and Snow et al. [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] on moderate intensity exercise and skill acquisition, therefore, can be seen to support this finding although it is important to underline the fact that the exercise bout was placed prior to motor skill acquisition in these studies. In the present study exercise was placed <italic>following</italic> skill acquisition and low intensity exercise led to a significant change in mean score for the low intensity group compared to the control group after 7 days. The larger positive effects observed for intense exercise do not necessarily mean that moderate or low intensity exercise cannot be applied, but rather that it is a trade off in certain groups between improvements in motor skill learning and responsible, viable practices in a clinical setting. Studies applying exercise in a clinical setting for the sick, weak or elderly will provide additional information [<xref rid="pone.0159589.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The practical application of the results from this study in a clinical setting must also be approached with caution as the participants here were young healthy males with relatively high aerobic fitness levels. While high intensity exercise could be applied in a clinical setting or for the elderly it would be necessary to screen for contra indications and take appropriate precautions for safety, whereas low intensity exercise bouts provide a viable alternative.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec018"><title>Conclusions</title><p>An acute bout of high intensity aerobic exercise improves consolidation of a visuomotor tracking task (VAT) where significant improvements are seen at 1 and 7 days post acquisition of the motor skill. These improvements were observed both in the low and high intensity exercise groups compared to a control group that rested post acquisition. Importantly, the high intensity exercise group demonstrated a higher level of retention than both the control and low intensity group at 1 and 7 days. This result suggests that there is a dose-response relationship between exercise intensity and retention level in this type of task when exercise is performed 20 min after motor skill acquisition. The results also emphasize the importance of studying the effects of exercise intensity in modulating potential mechanisms underlying the effects of acute exercise on motor memory.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0159589.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Hillman</surname><given-names>CH</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Erickson</surname><given-names>KI</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Kramer</surname><given-names>AF</given-names></name>. <article-title>Be smart, exercise your heart: exercise effects on brain and cognition</article-title>. <source>Nature reviews neuroscience</source>. <year>2008</year>;<volume>9</volume>(<issue>1</issue>):<fpage>58</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>65</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18094706</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0159589.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>van Praag</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name>. <article-title>Exercise and the brain: something to chew on</article-title>. <source>Trends Neurosci</source>. <year>2009</year>;<volume>32</volume>(<issue>5</issue>):<fpage>283</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>90</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tins.2008.12.007">10.1016/j.tins.2008.12.007</ext-link></comment> ; PubMed Central PMCID: PMC2680508.<pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19349082</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0159589.ref003"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><name><surname>Hillman</surname><given-names>CH</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Pontifex</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Themanson</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name>. <source>Acute exercise and physiological functions: a cognitive-energetic approach</source>
