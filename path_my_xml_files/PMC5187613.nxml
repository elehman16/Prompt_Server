The primary outcome measure of the study was duration of sensory block.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>This prospective, randomized, double-blind study was carried out after institutional ethics committee approval and written informed consent of the participating subjects from November 2011 to February 2013. Male patients with femur fractures, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I or II and 18&#x02013;60 years of age were recruited. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the drugs used, bilateral lower limb fractures, contraindications to regional anesthesia, height &#x0003c;150 cm or &#x0003e;180 cm and emergency surgery were excluded.</p><p>After attaching standard monitors, intravenous (IV) access was secured with 18G cannula and baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded. Preloading with lactated Ringer's solution 10 mL/kg was done. An epidural catheter was inserted to provide postoperative analgesia. Epidural space was located in sitting position in L2-L3 vertebral interspace with loss of resistance technique via midline approach and epidural catheter was threaded 4 cm inside the space. No test dose or saline flush was given via the epidural catheter. This was followed by subarachnoid block (SAB) in L3-L4 intervertebral space using 25 G Quincke's needle and study solution was given according to the group allocated after randomization by draw of lots.</p><p>Group R patients received 2.5 mL isobaric ropivacaine 0.75% with 0.5 mL normal saline while group RT patients received 2.5 mL isobaric ropivacaine 0.75% with 0.5 mL (25 mg) preservative free tramadol.</p><p>Study drug was prepared by an anesthesiologist not involved in block assessment during or after the study. The investigator assessing the block characteristics and other variables was blind to the group allocation. Patients were made supine thereafter. Time of completion of subarachnoid injection was noted (T<sub>0</sub>). SBP, DBP and HR were recorded at T<sub>0</sub> and every 5 min thereafter till 30 min. Sensory and motor block levels were assessed every 2 min for the first 10 min and then every 5 min for next 20 min. Sensory level was assessed subsequently every 15 min till the patient complained of pain or till the block level receded to T<sub>12</sub>, whichever was earlier. Rescue analgesia was given via the epidural catheter with 0.375% ropivacaine 6 mL. This was considered as the end point of study for sensory blockade. Failure of block was defined as nonachievement of sensory level of at least T<sub>10</sub> within 20 min of administration of intrathecal drug. Sensory block was assessed with a pin prick using a sterile 24 G needle in the midline and motor block was assessed according to Bromage score. Sedation was assessed according to Ramsay's sedation score.</p><p>Hypotension was defined as 25% decrease in SBP[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] from the baseline and was treated with fluids and vasopressors (mephentermine 6 mg IV) if required. Bradycardia was defined as HR &#x0003c;50 bpm and was treated with 0.6 mg atropine IV.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Respiratory depression was defined as respiratory rate &#x0003c;8 bpm. Any episode of nausea, vomiting, shivering or pruritus intra-operatively or postoperatively for the first 24 h was recorded.</p><p>Based on the results of a pilot study conducted with 10 patients in each group, a sample size of 21 patients per group was calculated to detect a difference of 30 min of duration of block between the two groups at 5% level of significance and 80% power. Considering the possibility of failure of block in some cases, 25 subjects were included in each group. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 17 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). Student's <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare demographic data and block characteristics. Qualitative data were analyzed using Chi-square test and Fischer's exact test. Repeated measures ANOVA test was used to compare hemodynamic variables.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>Patient characteristics [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>] and baseline HR, SBP and DBP [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>] were comparable in the two groups.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Patient characteristics</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOACP-32-483-g001"/></table-wrap><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The mean heart rate at different time intervals</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOACP-32-483-g002"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>The mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure at different time intervals (SBP = Systolic blood pressure, DBP = Diastolic blood pressure)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOACP-32-483-g003"/></fig><p>There was statistically significant fall in HR in both the groups after administration of intrathecal drug [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].

Lipophilic opioids like morphine, fentanyl and sufentanil have been used effectively for this purpose.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] However, they are associated with the development of complications such as respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, pruritus and delayed voiding.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Tramadol is a safer opioid which is known to have less respiratory depression.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Various doses of preservative free tramadol have been used alone or as an additive to bupivacaine in the subarachnoid space and have been found to be safe.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, a dose of 2.5 mL intrathecal ropivacaine (18.75 mg) was used for SAB as a similar dose has been previously shown to produce effective and safe anesthesia for lower limb surgeries like total hip arthroplasty.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>The addition of 25 mg tramadol did not result in prolongation of the duration of action of intrathecal ropivacaine in the present study. There are contradictory reports in the literature on the efficacy of intrathecal tramadol.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] When added to intrathecal bupivacaine, it prolonged the duration of analgesia in women undergoing gynecological[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] or obstetric procedures[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] but did not affect the postoperative morphine requirements or the time to first analgesic requirement in patients undergoing TURP.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Various theories have been proposed to explain the efficacy as well as the inefficacy of tramadol as an adjuvant in subarachnoid block. The failure to prolong the duration of analgesia may be because of its lesser affinity for &#x000b5; receptors,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] high lipophilicity leading to rapid diffusion out of subarachnoid space[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and anti-analgesic effects at low doses.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Mechanism of action of tramadol is inhibition of re-uptake of both central and peripheral monoaminergic neurotransmitters (5-hydroxytryptamine and noradrenaline).[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] It also has a local anesthetic like effect, that is blocking of action potential following subcutaneous administration[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and at the peripheral nerves.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] However, another study, where tramadol was used as an adjunct to psoas compartment block with levobupivacaine 0.5%, failed to prove a clinical local anesthetic or peripheral analgesic effect.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Recently, Brummet and Williams have even recommended against the use of perineural tramadol.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>None of the patients in the present study developed respiratory depression and the incidence of sedation was also comparable in the two groups. However, the incidence of nausea and vomiting was higher in the tramadol group than the control group (24% vs. 4% for nausea and 16% vs. 4% for vomiting, respectively). This difference, although clinically relevant, could not achieve statistical significance. This could be because our sample size was not powered enough to study these side-effects. Scott et al have also pointed out that there may be a higher incidence of side-effects such as nausea and vomiting with the use of tramadol.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>To conclude, the addition of tramadol 25 mg to intrathecal 18.75 mg isobaric ropivacaine did not improve the sensory or motor block characteristics. Further trials with increased dose of intrathecal tramadol cannot be recommended in view of clinically significant higher incidence of nausea and vomiting with 25 mg intrathecal tramadol.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None
