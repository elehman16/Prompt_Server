The PRP is frequently used for tissue repair mediated by different types of cytokines and growth factors.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Clinically, PRP is widely used to heal tendinitis, neural injuries, cardiac muscular injuries, osteoarthritis, oral surgery, and plastic surgery.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] It is also used as a beneficial treating modality in sport medicine to rehabilitate disable muscles.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] However, all of these approaches were resulted in inconsistent treatment response rates in different clinical trials.</p><p>Recently, the use of PRP has been tested in comparison with other treatment options and medications for treatment of plantar fasciitis. In some trials, using PRP was associated with more improvement in activity limitation and physical disability when compared with corticosteroids and even with surgical management.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] However, the beneficial effects of PRP remained already uncertain and needs to more assessment.

The inclusion criteria were age &#x0003e;18 years, chronic plantar fasciitis (duration more than 3 months), and lack of effect of conservative treatment. The exclusion criteria included history of receiving corticosteroids within the last 6 weeks, history of surgical interventions in the ankle and the heel, receiving aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) within a week ago, history of stroke within the last 3 months, pregnancy or breast feeding, malignancy, anemia, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, peripheral neuropathy, acute infection or fever, and coagulopathies.</p><p>The study protocol was approved by the Research and Ethics Committee at the University and written informed consent was received from all study subjects.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Randomization</title><p>The computer-generated randomization sequence was used to allocate participants into 1:1 ratio in both the arms.

The referred patients were initially examined by a single physiatrist and those with the tenderness at the junction of fascia to calcaneus at the medial plantar were primarily diagnosed as plantar fasciitis. The included patients were then randomly assigned to the case group (that received PRP, <italic>n</italic> = 16) and the control group (that received corticosteroid as methylprednisolone 1 ml plus lidocaine 1 ml, <italic>n</italic> = 16). PRP preparation was carried out by adapting the protocol proposed by Sonnleitner <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The 40 ml collected intravenous blood was firstly centrifuged at 1600 rpm, for 12 min, at environmental temperature. After isolating erythrocytes, the serum containing platelets and white blood cells (as poor platelet plasma) were centrifuged at 3500 rpm, for 12 min for achieving 3 ml of PRP. After preparing PRP, it was placed inside the ice and injected into the targeted point of the cases within a maximum of 1 h. For testing the efficacy of the prepared PRP, cell blood count was taken from the patients before and also after PRP injection that checking the level of serum PRP platelet should expected at least 6-fold increase in platelet levels than before the PRP injection. All injections (for PRP and corticosteroids) were done by the physical therapist at supine position and in neutral position of the ankle. Afterward, the maximal point of the tenderness was found and injection was performed with the medical approach. After injection, ice was placed at the injection site for 15 min and repeated for 4&#x02013;5 times in the day of injection. In the event of local pain, the patients were recommended to elevate the lower extremity. The patients were educated to schedule the program of stretching the achilles tendon and plantar fascia. Also, they were asked not to use corticosteroids or NSAIDS and only used acetaminophen if severe pain appeared.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Participants flowchart</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ABR-5-179-g001"/></fig><p>It is significant that the patient and the physician were not blind to the study, and only the data collector was blind to the treatment group.

All patients completed a VAS in which 0 was no pain and 10 the worst imaginable pain, before injections and also 1, 3, 6 months after injections. The VAS score was determined in the early morning, the mean total day, and after a 10-step walking. Modified RMS were also completed at the same time points. This scoring system is a subjective 4-point patient assessment of pain and limitations of activity (1 = excellent result with no symptoms following treatment; 2 = significant improvement from pretreatment; 3 = patient somewhat improved; 4 = poor, symptoms identical or worse than pretreatment). Plantar fascia was also assessed by B-mode sonography before and also 3 months after primary assessment to determine the thickness of the plantar fascia, calcification, echogenicity, and biconvexity parameters.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Results were presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation for quantitative variables and were summarized by frequency (%) for categorical variables.

Categorical variables were, on the other hand, compared using Chi-square test. Change in study parameters was assessed using paired <italic>t</italic>-test or McNemar test.

Some current evidences for using PRP in plantar fasciitis have indicated promising results and presented this method as a safe option,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] but some others could not clearly confirm the potential role of PRP in healing plantar fasciitis.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] However, similar to our observation, most recent studies could show its high efficacy to improve disease-related pain and disability a short time after injection. In a study by Shetty <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and using two American Foot and Ankle Score (AFAS) and Foot and Ankle Disability Index, significant improvement in pain and disability was obtained 3 months after administration. In a report by O&#x02019;Malley <italic>et al</italic>. (done),[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] improvement in pain, physical ability, and also health-related quality of life were observed about 3 months after the last PRP injection. Comparing the effects of corticosteroid and PRP also showed more effectiveness and durability in PRP group for treating plantar fasciitis.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] One of the interesting results in our trial is that the use of corticosteroid led to quick but short-term effect of corticosteroid when compared with PRP; however, our study showed beginning considerable effect of the PRP after 3 months of administration. Furthermore, beneficial accelerative effects of PRP can be expected about 3 months after injection, but consistent effect may not be observed following use of corticosteroid.</p><p>Regarding trend of the effects of PRP and corticosteroid on pain severity and physical ability, our study could show early effects of corticosteroid, but delayed beneficial effects of PRP. On the other hand, our study showed an increasing trend of physical ability as well as decreasing trend of pain severity during 6 months after PRP injection, but beneficial effects of corticosteroid on pain and physical ability was only observed within 3 months after injection. The difference in the trend of the changes in pain and disability between PRP and steroids was also previously observed. In a study by Say <italic>et al</italic>. and using VAS score and the AFAS, although mean AFAS was higher in PRP group than in steroid group, this score was significantly lower in PRP group at 6 months intervention. Similar trends were revealed in another study by Monto[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] that the corticosteroid group had a pretreatment average the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hind-foot score of 52, which initially improved to 81 at 3 months posttreatment but decreased to 74 at 6 months, then dropped to near baseline levels of 58 at 12 months, and continued to decline to a final score of 56 at 24 months. In contrast, the PRP group started with an average pretreatment AOFAS score of 37, which increased to 95 at 3 months, remained elevated at 94 at 6 and 12 months, and had a final score of 92 at 24 months. Most studies aimed to assess the effects of PRP as a single interventional group without control group and some others considered a short-term follow-up time shorter than 6 months and thus the observed trend in our study could not be reveal in most similar studies.</p><p>The effect of PRP on healing plantar fasciitis is mainly related to some growth factors and cytokines. The PRP is enriched by platelet-derived growth factor, endothelial growth factor and transforming growth factor as well as some anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukins including interleukins 4, 8, 13, 17, tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; and interferon-&#x003b1;.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] The combination of these growth and anti-inflammatory components can initiate the healing stages necessary to reverse the degenerative process at the base of the plantar fascia, enhance fibroblast migration and proliferation, up-regulate vascularization and also can increase collagen production and deposition.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] However, these influences seem to be dose-dependent and thus obtaining optimal dosage with maximized effect is necessary.</p><p>In the present study, beside comparing effects of PRP in comparison with corticosteroids on clinical improvement in patients with plantar fasciitis using clinical scores, some sonographic parameters including the thickness of the plantar fascia, calcification, echogenicity, and biconvexity parameters were also assessed. Although plantar fascia thickness, echogenicity, and positive biconvexity were all improved within follow-up time in both groups receiving PRP and corticosteroid groups, no difference was found across the two groups. In total, it seems that along with clinical scoring systems, using these ultrasonography parameters can be helpful to assess improvement of pain and disability in patients who treated with treatment regiments such as PRP in patients with plantar fasciitis.</p><p>In this study, the volume of methylprednisolone and PRP was not the same which could have some effects on the reduction of pain that was the main limitation of this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The injection of PRP results in significant improvement in pain severity and physical ability in patients with plantar fasciitis. This beneficial effect is appeared about 3 months after injection of PRP, but can be continued consistently for longer time when compared with corticosteroid. Because of this long-term effect of PRP, its use is more preferred than corticosteroid in plantar fasciitis.</p><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Buchbinder</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Clinical practice.
