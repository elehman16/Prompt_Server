It was considered directly responsible for 7.5 million deaths in 2004, about 12.8 percent of the total of all global deaths.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Decline in the blood pressure is the best determinant of cardiovascular risk reduction and most hypertensive patients need two or more antihypertensive drugs for the blood-pressure control. Despite the availability of effective drugs, the progression of the disease and its complications remain uncontrolled in most patients.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The reason appears to be a lack of holistic approach in its management, as we know that life style and psychological stresses play a major role in the genesis of hypertension and heart disease.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Sullivan <italic>et al</italic>., showed that depression and anxiety are related to increased symptom severity and functional impairment in patients with hypertension and heart diseases.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Complementary therapies and healing practices have been found to reduce stress, anxiety and depression. Promising therapies amongst these include imagery and hypnosis, meditation, <italic>yoga</italic>, tai chi, prayer, music, exercise, diet and use of dietary supplements.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] <italic>Yoga</italic> offers several practices that help in mastery over the modifications of the mind (<italic>chitta vritti nirodha</italic>)[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] through the process of calmness of mind (<italic>mana prashamana upaya</italic>)[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] to reach a state of balanced functioning of the mind-body complex (<italic>samatvam yoga uchyate</italic>).[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Integrated approach of <italic>Yoga</italic> therapy (IAYT) involves selecting physiologically acceptable and useful practices that can be grouped under four domains (<italic>raja yoga, karma yoga, bhakti yoga</italic> and <italic>jnana yoga</italic>). <italic>Raja yoga</italic> includes physical postures (<italic>asanas</italic>), breathing practices (<italic>Pranayama</italic>), cleansing techniques (<italic>kriyas</italic>) and meditation (<italic>dharana, dhyana, samadhi</italic>); <italic>karma yoga</italic> refers to stress free activity through action in relaxation; <italic>bhakti yoga</italic> is emotional mastery through nurturing pure love; <italic>jnana yoga</italic> offers cognitive correction through right knowledge.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Studies have found that <italic>yoga</italic> interventions are effective in reducing body weight, blood pressure, glucose level and high cholesterol.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] <italic>Yogic</italic> relaxation leads to a state of parasympathetic dominance that promotes cardiac vagal modulation which could be beneficial in conditions (hypertension) characterized by increased sympathetic activity.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Meditations and <italic>yogic</italic> relaxation techniques specifically have been found to be effective in reducing blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension and preventing its complications.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] <italic>Yoga</italic> and <italic>Ayurveda</italic>, the Indian systems of medicine, lay emphasis on clearing the bowel as an essential component of therapy based on its disease model.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] This model of hypertension, a life style disease (<italic>adhija vyadhi</italic>),[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] proposes that these diseases begin in the mind as persitent long standing emotional responses to stressful demanding situations of life (<italic>adhi</italic> = stress); these (uncontrolled rewinding thoughts) manifest as disturbed breathing and digestive functions (poor appetite and constipation) due to <italic>prana</italic> (chi or vital energy) imbalance. As time lapses, this habituated imbalance of prana percolates to the body level (<italic>annamaya kosha</italic>) causing biochemical imbalances that shows up as hypertension.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Hence, IAYT aims at correcting the imbalances at all levels (the mind, <italic>prana</italic> and body). Correction of imblances in breathing (<italic>pranayama</italic>) and bowel disturbance (purgation) are considered primary requisites. <italic>Shankhaprakhs&#x00101;lana</italic> is a <italic>yoga</italic> practice (<italic>kriya</italic>) recommended for cleansing the bowel.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] <italic>Laghu shankha praksh&#x00101;lana</italic> (LSP) is a simplified version of this <italic>kriya</italic> that is completed in a shorter time and offers lesser physical strain. <italic>Ayurveda</italic> recommends a strictly monitored procedure for purgation called <italic>virechana</italic>. Studies have observed reduction in blood pressure (BP) after <italic>virechana</italic> in patients with essential hypertension.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Mild laxatives, such as <italic>triphala</italic>, whose safety is time tested and already established in number of previous studies[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] may also be used instead of <italic>virechana</italic> in the management of hypertension.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Considering the amount of water consumed and physical exertion involved, it is sometimes felt that LSP may not be safe for persons with hypertension as water intake may raise blood volume (and hence the cardiac output) and strenuous exercise may further increase the heart rate. Thus, both these factors may raise the blood pressure. Therefore we conducted a pilot study to assess the safety of LSP on 8 essential hypertension patients (5 males and 3 females) in the age range of 50 &#x000b1; 8.1 years. The study was conducted under the supervision of medical professionals and blood pressure and pulse rate were measured before and after the practice of LSP. The assessments were done daily early morning, empty stomach, on respective patients. We found a reduction in the blood pressure as well as pulse rate after the practice of LSP.The present study was designed based on this observation with an aim to investigate the immediate effect of LSP on blood pressure and pulse rate in patients with essential hypertension. As <italic>triphala</italic> (combination of three fruits <italic>Phyllanthus emblica, Terminalia bellerica and Terminalia chebula</italic>) is known to have a mild laxative effect it was hypothesized that LSP done with a decoction of <italic>triphala</italic> may have complementary effect in hypertension.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Thus, this study had two objectives: (a) to study the safety of LSP and (b) to compare the effect of LSP with and without <italic>triphala</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Patients</title><p>This study involved thirty two patients who were diagnosed with mild to moderate hypertension as per American Heart Association criteria. Patients were diagnosed to be suffering from essential hypertension by the physician based on initial history, physical, and laboratory evaluation after ruling out all the causes of secondary hypertension. The lab evaluations included kidney functions tests (blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and the urinalysis), USG abdomen, complete blood count, serum potassium, sodium, fasting glucose, total cholesterol, high-density cholesterol, and electrocardiogram. Both male (<italic>n</italic> = 14) and female (<italic>n</italic> = 18) patients in the age range of 30-70 years were included.

Significant changes were also observed in the comprehensive battery of tests after the weeklong program of residential IAYT.</p><sec id="sec2-11"><title>Comparisons</title><p>Several well designed controlled studies have shown the benefits of different types of <italic>yoga</italic> based relaxation (with or without biofeedback) and meditative techniques in hypertensive patients on blood pressure and other hemodynamic variables practiced for varying periods of time. Biofeedback studies reduced systolic BP by 19.6% and the diastolic BP by 10.6% at the end of 8 weeks of meditation, which further reduced by 22.4% and 11.5% at the end of 8 months respectively.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] This was the maximum reduction noted in BP variables by any mind-body intervention. Another effective mind-body technique, the MBSR (Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction),[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] caused reduction of systolic BP by 21.92% and diastolic BP by 16.70% after 8 weeks of the practice. Other meditations such as Transcendental meditation,[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] yogic relaxation,[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Om meditation,[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] traditional Chinese physical and mental exercises[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] etc., caused reduction in Systolic BP ranging from 2 to 10% and the diastolic between 1.5 to 13%.</p><p>Looking at the effect of only the yoga postures on blood pressure, there appears to be mixed responses observed by different studies. Miles <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] showed a significant increase in blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac output immediately after a series of 23 <italic>hatha</italic>-based <italic>yoga</italic> postures in healthy volunteers, whereas Mizuno <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] observed significant reduction of systolic blood pressure (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), heart and respiratory rate (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) after 4 months of regular practice of a sequence of <italic>yoga</italic> postures in patients with hypertension. This suggests that though acute cardiovascular responses (increase in blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac output) to yoga postures are similar to those observed in isometric exercise,[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] when practiced regularly for a longer duration <italic>yoga</italic> postures actually cause reduction in blood pressure and heart rate.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] This may be due to the modulation of autonomic nervous system which is induced by regular practice of <italic>yoga</italic> postures.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</p><p>There are very few studies that have looked at the immediate effects on blood pressure after the practice of selected <italic>yoga</italic> techniques. Telles <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] looked at the immediate effect of alternate nostril <italic>yoga</italic> breathing (ANYB) in a three armed randomized control study on 90 participants with essential hypertension and showed significant decrease in both systolic (4.24%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and diastolic blood pressures (1.56%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The immediate effect of <italic>sukha pranayama</italic> (at the rate of 6 breaths/min for 5 min) was studied by Bhavanani <italic>et al</italic>., in hypertensive patients (attending a hospital <italic>yoga</italic> outpatient dept.) which showed significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) reduction in heart rate, systolic pressure, pulse pressure, mean arterial pressure and rate-pressure product, after just 5 min of the practice.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] The effect of 10 sessions of slow abdominal breathing (six cycles/min) combined with frontal EMG biofeedback was compared with abdominal breathing without EMG feedback in postmenopausal women with pre-hypertension; significant reduction in systolic blood pressure by 8.4% and diastolic by 3.9% was observed in those with the biofeedback.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] Palomba <italic>et al</italic>., showed reduction in blood pressure and BP emotional reactivity after a short (four sessions) Heart Rate-Biofeedback (HR-BF) protocol in unmedicated outpatients with pre- or stage 1 hypertension.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] The present study on the immediate effect of <italic>yogic</italic> LSP in patients with moderate to mild HTN has shown reduction by 11.4% (systolic) and 6.68% (diastolic) after TWLSP, and 10.4% (systolic) and 6.62% (diastolic) after NWLSP. Thus, it seems that for immediate BP reduction, LSP is not only safe but may be more effective than ANYB, Breath Awareness or abdominal breathing with biofeedback.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-12"><title>Mechanisms</title><p>Improved autonomic stability with reduced stress appears to be the mechanism by which <italic>yoga</italic> helps in reducing the blood pressure in hypertensive patients. Studies point to reduction in sympathetic arousal following <italic>yoga</italic> based relaxation techniques.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] <italic>Yoga</italic> offers mastery over the emotional surges through controlled and need based physiological responses to stressfully demanding situations instead of uncontrolled overtones of HPA axis during chronic stress.[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] <italic>Yoga</italic> changes the physiological responses to stressors by improving autonomic stability with better parasympathetic tone and reduction in sympathetic arousal with improved performance.[<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</p><p><italic>Yoga</italic> texts clearly mention that the aim of any <italic>yoga</italic> practice, whether physical, breathing, mental or emotional, is to reach a state of control (<italic>chittavrtti nirodha</italic>) over the responses to situations (healthy stress response)[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] by the process of slowing or silencing the mind.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Internal awareness of the changes in the mind helps in conscious slowing down and thus offers physiological rest. Sage <italic>Gaudapada</italic> in his treatise, <italic>mandukya karika</italic>,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] proposes a concept that one can go on deepening the level of rest by using a series of alternate stimulations (physical stretch or breath awareness or chanting) followed by relaxation technique. Stronger the stimulation (within safety limits), deeper is the rest that follows. Studies using this concept have shown the expected benefits of deep rest and autonomic stability.[<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] All <italic>kriyas</italic> (procedures) including LSP seem to offer this deep stimulation by activating the basic autonomic reflexes. Thus we propose that the activated peristaltic reflex during LSP provided the strong internal awareness that could lead to deeper physiological rest during the relaxation session that followed. Another factor that may have helped in reduction of blood pressure after LSP can be - the dehydration caused due to repeated loose motions. The percent reduction of BP was higher after <italic>triphala</italic> water LSP than normal water LSP and frequency of stools was significantly more in the <italic>triphala</italic> group, this can be explained on the basis of mild laxative effect of <italic>triphala</italic> which may help in reducing blood volume further, thereby reducing the blood pressure. We are not sure whether during normal water LSP (without <italic>triphala</italic>) person loses the same amount of water that he has consumed or he loses some extra water from the body as well. Another possibility is enhanced biomechanical effects of laxation as according to the Indian systems of health, the apana vata in the GI tract influences other vatas in the body, including the vyana vayu. Blood pressure is a function of the vyana vata.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-13"><title>Limitations and scope of the study</title><p>This is the first controlled study on LSP with a good sample size that offers the evidence for the safety of the procedure in hypertensive patients.</p><p>It may have helped to have an additional group (as baseline control) with only IAYT practices without LSP to make the study more robust. Durability of response - short term and long term, outcomes with repeated procedures, subgroup analysis of those with a tendency to constipation may all help to bring forth the effects. Measuring serum electrolytes and stool volume would have been helpful to understand mechanisms. Blood pressure and pulse variations in supine and standing conditions for autonomic response, ankle brachial index and serum electrolytes could have enhanced the study. It would be interesting to assess the effects of LSP using more objective measures such as heart rate variability, holter blood pressure and heart rate monitoring during the entire practice in normal volunteers and hypertensive patients. Glomerular filtration rate alterations, urinary frequency and volume could have assisted in speculating extent of water absorption. There are no repeated measures were done in this study to know the carry over effect of LSP. Future studies should consider this important evaluation and try to generate a dose response curve.</p><p>Also, future studies could look into application of these non-pharmacological interventions in pre hypertensive and early hypertensive patients to assess whether these simple and safe interventions could reduce the dependence on modern anti-hypertensive drugs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This study provides the first evidence that <italic>laghu shankha prakshalana kriya</italic> can be used safely in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Addition of <italic>triphala</italic> to the water of LSP provides better cleansing.
