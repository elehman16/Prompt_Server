Another important complication following bleaching procedure is decreased bond strength of composite resin to enamel.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] This decreased bond strength is due to the presence of oxygen ions which interfere with resin polymerization.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] This decrease in bond strength of composite resin to enamel can be improved by delaying its placement after 1-3 weeks following the bleaching procedure. Several other techniques have also been proposed to remove the oxygen radical from the surface enamel.</p><p>Barghi and Godwin treated bleached enamel with alcohol before restoration. Cvitko <italic>et al</italic>. proposed removal of the superficial layer of enamel, while Kalili <italic>et al</italic>. and Sung <italic>et al</italic>. suggested the use of adhesives containing organic solvent.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Lai <italic>et al</italic>. and Vidhya <italic>et al</italic>. suggested that reduced bond strength can be reversed by the use of antioxidants such as sodium ascorbate and proanthocyanidin.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Lai <italic>et al</italic>. have shown that following treatment with hydrogen peroxide or sodium hypochlorite, reversal of reduction in bond strength of resin to enamel was achieved within 1 h with the use of sodium ascorbate as an antioxidant. Turkun and Kaya shortened the application period of sodium ascorbate to 10 min, and demonstrated that even 10 min application was enough for reversing the reduced bond strength. Therefore, restorative procedures are possible immediately after bleaching, with the use of antioxidants, which shortens the overall time needed for esthetic procedures.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Proanthocyanidin (OPC), a grape seed extract, is a natural antioxidant that has greater potential to scavenge oxygen free radicals.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Its antioxidant potency has been shown to be 20 times more than that of sodium ascorbate.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Another natural antioxidant, lycopene, a carotenoid found in tomato extract, is known to have free radical scavenging ability.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] But the effect of lycopene on bleached enamel has not been investigated so far. Comparative evaluation of these antioxidants, namely, sodium ascorbate, proanthocyanidin, and lycopene, is yet to be done.

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Tooth discoloration has always been a factor of utmost concern as more emphasis is being placed on esthetics. With the growing awareness of esthetic options, there is a great demand for various modalities in treating discolored teeth. Tooth bleaching has been an option since late 1870s.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] It permits a successful esthetic outcome at minimal expense while conserving the tooth structure.</p><p>Carbamide peroxide, a biological oxidant, is still the most commonly used bleaching agent which releases free radicals in the form of nascent oxygen and hydroxyl or perhydroxyl ions, when applied to the dental structure. Free radical is any molecule that has one unpaired electron, providing its high reactivity that actualizes the bleaching process by oxidizing the macromolecules of stains quickly and breaks them into linear fragments, consequently diffusing across dental hard tissues.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>In 1994, Dishman and colleagues reported that a high concentration of oxygen remains among the enamel prisms and in the dentin following dissociation of the bleaching agent.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The dentin and dentinal fluid can act as peroxide and oxygen free radical reservoir and could persist until removed by pulpal microcirculation or be released later through surface diffusion (Titley, <italic>et al</italic>).[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In this perspective, this property could be deleterious during bonding of the composite resin, as higher levels of peroxide or oxygen may be present in the bonding surface, inhibiting the polymerization and, thus, reducing the bond strength.</p><p>Since these oxygen products will persist until removed by pulpal microcirculation, clinicians must allow some time to elapse between the bleaching procedure and restorative treatment to achieve desirable bond strength. Nevertheless, there appears to be no consensus regarding the necessary waiting period, though studies suggest that elimination of residual peroxide degradation product is time dependant.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Optical microscopic studies have shown that resin tags in bleached enamel were short, sparse, poorly defined, structurally incomplete, or completely absent, when restored immediately (Dishman and Covey, 1994).[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>It has been shown that during bleaching with hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals in the apatite lattice are substituted by peroxide ions, resulting in the formation of peroxide apatite. After 2 weeks storage period, the peroxide ions decompose and the substituted hydroxyl radicals re-enter the apatite lattice, resulting in the elimination of the structural changes caused by incorporation of the peroxide ions.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Hence, delay in bonding by 1-3 weeks following the bleaching procedure was recommended.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] But this rendered immediate reestablishment of further esthetic procedures impossible.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Lai <italic>et al</italic>. stated that inclusion process of peroxide ions could be reversed by the use of antioxidants.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Sodium ascorbate is a derivate of ascorbic acid with neutral pH. It is a potent antioxidant capable of quenching reactive free radicals in biological systems.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Since vitamin C and its salts are non-toxic and widely used in food industry as antioxidants, it can be used on the dental hard tissues without creating any adverse biological effect or clinical hazards.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The application of 10% sodium ascorbate was effective in reversing the compromised bonding to the oxidized enamel and dentin.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Hence, 10% sodium ascorbate was used in this study.</p><p>Proanthocyanidins are high-molecular-weight polymers comprising the monomeric flavan-3-ol (+)-catechin and (&#x02212;)-epicathechins. Proanthocyanidins are a group of polyphenolic bioflavonoids found in high concentrations in natural sources such as grape seed extract, pine bark extract, cranberries, lemon tree bark, and hazelnut tree leaves. Grape seed extract was chosen for this study since it yields a 10% higher concentration of proanthocyanidins, with a greater degree of oxygen free radical scavenging potential. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have confirmed that OPCs are 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more powerful than vitamin C.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Lycopene, a carotenoid compound, is a natural pigment synthesized by plants. It is a tetraterpene assembled from eight isoprene units composed entirely of carbon and hydrogen, containing 11 conjugated and 2 non-conjugated carbon &#x02014; carbon double bonds (c = c). Lycopene exerts potent anti-inflammatory effects through its action as an antioxidant and free radical scavenger. The scavenging rate increased linearly with the concentration of lycopene, and reached 60-80% when the concentration was more than 0.75 mg/ml when used systemically.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Lycopene is naturally accumulated in ripe tomatoes, watermelons, red chillies, and guavas, giving them their characteristic red color. Tomato and tomato-based foods account for more than 85% of lycopene. Due to its potent antioxidant potential, lycopene obtained from tomato extract was taken up for the study.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Since it was used on the external surface of the hard tissues, a minimum concentration of 5% lycopene extract was chosen for this study.</p><p>Therefore, the present study was designed to evaluate the neutralizing effects of various antioxidants on the shear bond strength of composite resins to bleached enamel. The shear, rather than tensile mode of testing, was selected for this study, as it would more accurately reflect the type of forces generated on veneer restorations in the tooth.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>According to the results of this study, group I [control (no bleaching): 46.94 &#x000b1; 0.36] showed the highest bond strength compared to the other groups. Bond strength was the lowest for group II (bleached and not treated with antioxidants: 27.08 &#x000b1; 1.15) compared to the control and the antioxidant groups. This reduced bond strength could be attributed to the residual oxygen free radicals on the enamel surface. This liberation of oxygen could have interfered with the resin infiltration to the etched enamel and/or inhibited polymerization of the resin that cured via free radical mechanism.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Moreover, in 1996, Rostein <italic>et al</italic>. reported that loss of calcium, sulfate, phosphorus, and potassium occurs owing to pH of the bleaching agents. In 1999, Hedeges <italic>et al</italic>. reported that in addition to the reduction in mineral content of the bleached enamel, such losses lead to structural alterations in the enamel, reducing the bond strength of the composite resin to the tooth.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] A similar result supporting this claim has been obtained in this study.</p><p>In group IIB (delayed, no antioxidant: 30.64 &#x000b1; 0.5), the bond strength was higher compared to group IIA (immediate, no antioxidant: 27.08 &#x000b1; 1.15). This could be attributed to the partial loss of oxygen diffusion layer at the tooth and composite interface.</p><p>The antioxidant groups III, IV, and V showed increased bond strengths than group II (antioxidant not used), but the values were less than in group I (control group). Group III (sodium ascorbate) showed the highest bond strength among the antioxidant treated groups; both when bonding was performed immediately (40.33 &#x000b1; 0.98) as well as after 2 weeks (41.50 &#x000b1; 1.64). These results concur with those of Turkun <italic>et al</italic>. (2004) who reported that reduced bond strength is reversed by use of 10% sodium ascorbate solution.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The higher bond strength could be because of their potent antioxidant capacity by quenching free radicals in biological systems.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Sodium ascorbate, being a reducing agent, is capable of donating two high-energy electrons to scavenge the free radicals by the mechanism called passive detoxification. The results of this study are in accordance with previous investigations done by Lai <italic>et al</italic>.</p><p>Although the surface treatment with group IV (proanthocyanidin) showed increased bond strength (37.96 &#x000b1; 0.56) compared to group V (lycopene) (35.13 &#x000b1; 0.53), it had lesser bond strength than group III (sodium ascorbate), which is contrary to the result of the study done by Vidhya <italic>et al</italic>.</p><p>Molecular weight of the materials also seems to have played a role. Hydrogen peroxide, being a low-molecular-weight substance, permeates into the dental hard tissues and breaks down into free radicals,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] so surface treatment done with any antioxidant to remove these free radicals should have low molecular weight for efficient scavenging action. According to Lipinski's rule, molecular weight of the drug should be less than 500g/mol for its bioavailability.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Proanthocyanidin belongs to the category known as condensed tannins. Tannins have a molecular weight of 500-3000 and are highly hydroxylated structures that can form insoluble complexes with proteins and carbohydrates.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Sodium ascorbate has a molecular weight of 198.11 g/mol[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and is water soluble.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] This could have enabled sodium ascorbate to penetrate better than proanthocyanidin. Probably, this may be the reason for better bond strength with sodium ascorbate compared to proanthocyanidin. Although the molecular weight of lycopene (536.87 g/mol[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>])[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] is less than proanthocyanidin, its bond strength is comparatively low since it is insoluble in water. On the other hand, proanthocyanidin has the specificity for hydroxyl free radicals and it possesses multiple donor sites, which enables it to trap superoxide radicals.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Though the bond strength values obtained for group V (lycopene) were the least among the antioxidant groups, its values were not statistically significant from group IV (proanthocyanidin). Lycopene, a carotenoid compound, is most likely involved in the scavenging of two reactive oxygen species, namely, singlet oxygen and peroxide radicals. Further, they are effective deactivators of electronically excited sensitizer molecules which are involved in the generation of radicals and singlet oxygen.</p><p>Singlet oxygen quenching by carotenoid occurs via physical quenching (i.e. the carotenoid remains intact and can undergo further cycles of singlet oxygen quenching).[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] This supports the results obtained in this study. However, bond strength with immediate and delayed surface treatments in all the groups was not statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"
