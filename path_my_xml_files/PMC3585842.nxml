It acts by competitively inhibiting histamine at H<sub>1</sub> receptors, the binding being readily reversible. It has hypnotic, anticholinergic, and local anesthetic effects, and shares the actions and uses of other antihistamines. The effects upon the central nervous system are fundamentally determined by the capacity to cross the blood&#x02013;brain barrier and bind to the central H<sub>1</sub> receptors.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] Although sedation sometimes limits the clinical usefulness of doxylamine when that effect is not desirable, it also provides an additional indication, shared by other antihistamines in the ethanolamine group: symptomatic treatment of insomnia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]</p><p>Currently, doxylamine medicinal products have been authorized for more than 50 years, with an appropriate extent of use, for symptomatic treatment of occasional insomnia, making doxylamine a drug with a well established use. In fact, doxylamine alone or in combination with other drugs is available over the counter in Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Korea, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, the UK, and the US.</p><p>Dormidina&#x000ae; has been marketed in Spain since 1990 with a unique active ingredient: doxylamine hydrogen succinate 25 mg or 12.5 mg. Doxylamine hydrogen succinate 25 mg (salt) corresponds to doxylamine 17.4 mg (base). Doxylamine is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of occasional insomnia in adults aged 18 years and over, particularly those with difficulty in falling asleep, frequent interruptions during sleep, or early waking in the morning. Because its marketing authorization was approved before the implementation of the present regulatory standards, pharmacokinetic studies of doxylamine hydrogen succinate in its current pharmaceutical presentation (film-coated tablets) have never been performed under fed conditions. The main objectives of this study, therefore, were to evaluate the pharmacokinetic properties of doxylamine following single oral dose administration of a doxylamine hydrogen succinate 25 mg film-coated tablet to healthy human subjects under fed and fasting conditions and to assess the relative bioavailability of doxylamine under those conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design</title><p>This was a single-center, randomized, single-dose, laboratory-blinded, two-period, two-sequence, crossover study. A single oral dose of doxylamine hydrogen succinate 25 mg was administered under either fed or fasting conditions in each study period. A 25 mg dose was used, since this is the recommended dosage regimen. No higher doses of the drug are currently recommended. Since the Physician&#x02019;s Desk Reference rates doxylamine as being in pregnancy category B, it was acceptable to include women in the present study. To ensure that no carryover effect was observed, a wash-out period of seven calendar days was observed between drug administrations, corresponding to more than 10 times the expected half-life of the moiety to be measured. It should be noted that the randomization code was not made available to the personnel in charge of the determination of plasma drug concentrations (Algorithme Pharma Inc., Laval, QC, Canada) until the analytical tables were finalized and audited by the quality assurance department.</p><p>The protocol and the informed consent forms were approved by an independent review board (ETHIPRO) on June 17, 2010. All subjects voluntarily agreed to participate in this study and signed the informed consent form after having fully comprehended its contents and prior to initiation of the study procedures. This study was performed in compliance with Good Clinical Practice.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study Population</title><p>Subject screening procedures included informed consent, an inclusion/exclusion check, demography, medical history, medication history, physical examination, height, weight, body mass index, and a concomitant medication check. Subjects were in good health as determined by the medical history, physical examination (including vital signs), 12-lead electrocardiogram, and the usual clinical laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis), including negative HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C tests, negative screening for ethanol and drugs of abuse in urine, and a negative pregnancy test (for female subjects).</p><p>All participating subjects were judged to be eligible for the study when assessed against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Tolerability was evaluated through assessment of adverse events (AEs), standard laboratory evaluations, and vital signs.</p><p>The predetermined reason for excluding subjects from the study was for any safety issues as determined by the investigator. Also, subjects could be withdrawn because of protocol violations, administrative problems, difficulties in blood collection, occurrence of emesis during the time interval described in the protocol, or other reasons described in the protocol. Furthermore, subjects were allowed to discontinue their participation in the study at any time. In the event of such a discontinuation, the subject was requested to complete a safety assessment at the time of discontinuation, and the reason for discontinuation was to be documented.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Blood Sample Collection: Method of Measurement</title><p>Blood samples were collected prior to and 0.33, 0.67, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, and 60 hours after drug administration. This sampling was planned in order to provide a reliable estimate of the extent of absorption, as well as the terminal elimination half-life (t<sub>&#x000bd;</sub>), and to ensure that the area under the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curve (AUC) from time zero to time t (AUC<sub>t</sub>) was at least 80% of the AUC from time zero extrapolated to infinity (AUC<sub>&#x0221e;</sub>). Samples were processed and stored under conditions (frozen) that have been shown not to cause significant degradation of the analyte.</p><p>The experimental samples were assayed for doxylamine at the analytical facility of Algorithme Pharma Inc. Sample pretreatment involved protein-precipitation extraction of doxylamine from 0.100 mL of human plasma. Doxylamine-D5 was used as the internal standard. The compounds were identified and quantified using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection over a theoretical concentration range of 1.00&#x02013;200.00 ng/mL. A gradient of acetonitrile was used for the mobile phase. A low volume was injected at room temperature, using a Turbo Ionspray in positive mode, and the mass : charge ratio (m/z) was monitored according to the optimization of the analytical facility. Between-day variability was evaluated for all calibrants and quality-control samples during the study; within- and between-day variability was also evaluated during the validation of the doxylamine method.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Treatment Schedule</title><p>Subjects received the investigational product (Dormidina&#x000ae; [Laboratorios del Dr. Esteve SA, Barcelona, Spain]; a doxylamine hydrogen succinate 25 mg film-coated tablet) on two occasions (once under fed conditions and once under fasting conditions) according to the randomization list. The randomization scheme was computer generated.</p><p>Food was controlled and standardized for each treatment period and for all subjects.</p><p><bold><italic>The Fed State:</italic></bold> Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, subjects received a high-fat, high-calorie breakfast 30 minutes prior to drug administration. Afterward, a single dose of the investigational product was administered orally with approximately 240 mL of water at ambient temperature.</p><p>The high-fat breakfast, equivalent to approximately 900 kcal, consisted of about 240 mL of whole milk, two large eggs, four ounces of hash brown potatoes (two potato patties), one English muffin with approximately 4.5 g of butter, and two strips of bacon. The subjects ate the total contents of this meal in 30 minutes or less. Furthermore, a standardized lunch was served at least 4 hours after dosing. A supper and a light snack were then served at appropriate times thereafter. Water was allowed ad libitum until 2 hours predose and from 2 hours after drug administration.</p><p><bold><italic>The Fasting State:</italic></bold> The subjects fasted overnight for at least 10 hours prior to drug administration. A single dose of the investigational product was thereafter administered orally with approximately 240 mL of water at ambient temperature.</p><p>Fasting continued for at least 4 hours following drug administration, after which a standardized lunch was served. A supper and a light snack were also served at appropriate times thereafter, but not before 9 hours after dosing. Water was allowed ad libitum until 2 hours predose and from 2 hours after drug administration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Sample Size</title><p>The sample size was calculated, taking into consideration that the intrasubject variations in the maximum plasma drug concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) and AUC<sub>t</sub> following a single dose of doxylamine appear to be around 10%. Therefore, it was estimated that 24 subjects were sufficient to evaluate the bioavailability of a single 25 mg dose of doxylamine after single oral dose administration under fed and fasting conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Statistical Comparison</title><p>Descriptive statistics were used to summarize AEs, safety results, and demographic variables (age, height, weight, and body mass index). Pharmacokinetic parameters such as C<sub>max</sub>, the time to reach C<sub>max</sub> (t<sub>max</sub>), AUC<sub>t</sub>, AUC<sub>&#x0221e;</sub>, AUC<sub>t</sub> : AUC<sub>&#x0221e;</sub>, the elimination rate constant (k<sub>e</sub>), and t<sub>&#x000bd;</sub> were calculated. For statistical analysis of relative bioavailability, the main pharmacokinetic parameters of interest were C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>t</sub>. The natural logarithmic transformation of C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>t</sub>, and AUC<sub>&#x0221e;</sub> was used for all statistical inferences. The main absorption and disposition parameters were estimated using a noncompartmental approach with a log-linear terminal phase assumption. The trapezoidal rule was used to estimate the area under the concentration&#x02013;time curve, and the terminal phase was estimated by maximizing the coefficient of determination estimated from the log-linear regression model. They were not to be estimated for individual concentration&#x02013;time profiles, where the terminal log-linear phase could not be reliably characterized. The mean, median, minimal value, maximal value, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation were calculated for plasma concentrations at each individual timepoint and for all pharmacokinetic parameters. t<sub>max</sub> was analyzed using a nonparametric approach. Testing of fixed period, sequence, and treatment effects was based on the Wilcoxon rank sum test (the Mann&#x02013;Whitney U-test). All other untransformed and log-normal (ln)-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters were statistically analyzed using a random analysis of variance (ANOVA) model. The fixed factors included in this model were the treatment received, the period in which it was given, and the sequence in which each treatment was received. A random factor was also added for the subject effect (nested within sequence).</p><p>The sequence, period, and treatment effects were assessed at the 5% two-sided level. The intrasubject coefficient of variation was calculated, where the mean square error was obtained from the ANOVA model of the ln-transformed parameters. If a pharmacokinetic parameter could not be determined for one period in an individual subject, that subject was excluded from that particular statistical comparison.</p><p>To assess bioavailability, the ratios of the geometric least squares (LS) means with corresponding 90% confidence intervals were calculated from the exponential of the difference between the fed and fasting conditions for the ln-transformed parameters C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>t</sub>.</p><p>Furthermore, an exploratory analysis was carried out to explore the sex effect.</p><p>Statistical and pharmacokinetic analyses were generated using Kinetic, a software application developed at Algorithme Pharma Inc., and SAS&#x000ae; software (version 9.1 or higher), using the mixed procedure.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Subject Recruitment</title><p>A total of 24 healthy volunteers were included (12 male and 12 female), with a median age of 36 years (range 20&#x02013;53), weight of 75.4 kg (range 53.4&#x02013;99.7), height of 173 cm (range 149&#x02013;188), and body mass index of 25.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (range 19.6&#x02013;28.6).

The results of this study show that the fed : fasting ratios of the geometric LS means and corresponding 90% confidence intervals for C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>t</sub> were within the range of 80&#x02013;125%. Consequently, the test formulation of doxylamine hydrogen succinate 25 mg film-coated tablets manufactured by Laboratorios del Dr. Esteve SA (Barcelona, Spain) was judged to be bioequivalent under fed and fasting conditions.</p><p>Data available on the pharmacokinetic profile of doxylamine in humans are limited, notwithstanding that this drug has been marketed in European countries for more than 50 years. In fact, the available studies on pharmacokinetic parameters after an oral dose of doxylamine succinate 25 mg were published more than 20 years ago.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] It should be noted that this phase I clinical trial was one of the first to be performed in compliance with Good Clinical Practice and under the current regulatory standards.

No statistically relevant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters between the two states were found. Although some slight differences in some pharmacokinetic parameters (without clinical significance) might be found in comparison with other published studies, the overall results of this study are in line with studies performed with oral doses of doxylamine succinate 25 mg tablets[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and with oral doses of doxylamine succinate 20 mg solution.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] These slight differences could be explained by the analytical method that was used.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] On the other hand, the fact that no significant sequence effect was observed in either the fasting or the fed treatment period of the study indicates that the washout period was appropriate and that no carryover effect was present. The effect of sex was studied as a descriptive analysis. No statistically significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters between male and female subjects were observed in either the fasting or the fed states. It should be noted that female subjects had a longer t<sub>max</sub> in the fed state than in the fasting state.</p><p>Doxylamine succinate is available as an over-the-counter hypnotic agent and in many cough and cold formulations. The healthy subjects included in this study were young (between 20 and 53 years old). The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of doxylamine did not seem to be significantly affected by the age or by the sex of the subjects, although the clearance of doxylamine could be reduced in elderly men but not in elderly women.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] In a <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis, no sex effect was observed.
