The trial took place within the United Kingdom National Health Service, in four stroke units within Lothian. Ethical approval was received from Scotland A Multi-centre Research Ethics Committee (06/MRE00/82). The trial was retrospectively registered with the ISRCTN registry (Study ID ISRCTN50570295). Written consent was obtained by the research assistant from each participant and for participants unable to give consent from their relative or legal representative.</p><p>Feasible treatment parameters and eligibility criteria were developed by the research team (G.D.B., L.G.S., M.T.S.) in conjunction with a representative from each clinical site involved in the study. The frequency, duration and number of concurrent patients who could be treated with treadmill by the National Health Service staff available was established to ensure consistency across all sites. Inclusion criteria: aged over 18 years, stroke as defined by World Health Organization,<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0269215517720486" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> able to stand for one minute with or without support (to allow harness fitting if required), medically stable, within three months of stroke onset, able to understand and follow verbal instructions, and informed consent had been obtained. Exclusion criteria: co-existing non-stroke-related neurological impairments, comorbidities precluding gait training, non-ambulant prior to stroke, body weight greater than 138&#x02009;kg or clinically determined to be unsafe to use treadmill.</p><p>The research assistant collected all baseline data. Clinical staff used these data for randomization which occurred via computer by accessing a remote, secure server. Participants were randomized into block sizes of five by computer generated randomization to the treadmill or control group 1:1, using minimization<sup><xref rid="bibr12-0269215517720486" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> to account for side of stroke and whether the participant was functionally ambulant without physical assistance (Functional Ambulation Category 4&#x02013;6) or non-ambulant/ambulant with physical assistance (Functional Ambulation Category 1&#x02013;3).<sup><xref rid="bibr13-0269215517720486" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Each site could only recruit a maximum of five participants to the trial at any one time to ensure the randomization algorithm could assign to either group and that if a participant was randomized to treadmill training, there would be sufficient resources available to deliver the intervention. An independent statistical consultant devised the web-based randomization process to assign eligible participants. No one directly involved in the project had access to allocation codes.</p><p>Participants were randomized to an agreed eight-week programme of intervention of either a control or an experimental treadmill training intervention group. Each unit had a Biodex&#x02122; treadmill. Participants in the control group were to receive at least three intervention sessions per week of normal physiotherapy and gait training (which included assisted/independent activities such as weight transfer, stepping with either leg, walking, step ups and stairs, movement control and strengthening) with no access to a treadmill. Treadmill participants were to receive at least three sessions per week of normal physiotherapy and gait training which would include a minimum of two sessions a week of gait training using the treadmill. After eight weeks of intervention, treadmill participants reverted to normal physiotherapy with no further access to the treadmill, control participants continued to receive intervention as normal (if still required) with no access to a treadmill. The protocol intended every participant to have approximately the same amount of time in physiotherapy focused on walking. If participants were transferred or discharged prior to eight weeks, trial intervention ceased.</p><p>The intervention delivered to treadmill participants was not dictated by the trial team as one of the study aims was to determine how the treadmill was used within the United Kingdom National Health Service clinical setting and within available staffing resources. On average, each unit had a staffing ratio of one qualified physiotherapist to nine beds with additional assistant therapy staff available of 1:33 beds which equated to an average 0.8 whole time equivalent therapy assistant per unit. Body weight support with a treadmill harness was used based on clinical reasoning for individual cases.</p><p>Neither the participants nor their therapists were blind to treatment allocation, but the outcomes were measured by a research assistant blinded to treatment group allocation. A battery of standardized validated measures were applied by the research assistant blinded to treatment allocation, at baseline (prior to randomization), eight weeks (&#x02018;end of intervention&#x02019;) and six months post randomization (&#x02018;six month follow up&#x02019;). The Rivermead Mobility Index (0&#x02013;15)<sup><xref rid="bibr14-0269215517720486" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> was designated the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcomes included the Timed Up and Go (seconds),<sup><xref rid="bibr15-0269215517720486" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> a 10-metre walk (seconds),<sup><xref rid="bibr3-0269215517720486" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> a 6-minute walk test (metres)<sup><xref rid="bibr16-0269215517720486" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bibr17-0269215517720486" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and a vertical 10&#x02009;cm Visual Analogue Scale (0&#x02013;100) to measure confidence in walking. The Motor Assessment Scale (0&#x02013;48) was used to measure general recovery of impairments,<sup><xref rid="bibr18-0269215517720486" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Activities of Daily Living were measured using the Barthel Index (0&#x02013;100)<sup><xref rid="bibr19-0269215517720486" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and participation was measured by the Stroke Impact Scale v3.0 (0&#x02013;100).<sup><xref rid="bibr20-0269215517720486" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Higher scores, except for the Timed Up and Go and the 10-metre walk test, reflect better performance. Data were also collected on duration and intensity of treatment and adverse events for both groups and resource issues across all sites to inform feasibility.</p><p>No formal power calculation was carried out since the purpose of this phase II trial was to establish the feasibility of delivering treadmill training in routine National Health Service setting and also the feasibility of performing a larger randomized controlled trial which would determine if the treadmill was effective in improving recovery in walking after sub-acute stroke. Based on available service data, funding and resources, it was anticipated that 100 participants might be recruited to this feasibility study.</p><p>Participants were analysed according to their original treatment allocation irrespective of the treatment they actually received. Outcome data were plotted and tested for normality of distribution. As the majority were non-normally distributed, medians and upper and lower-quartile range data are presented. Non-parametric statistical analysis were undertaken with comparisons taken between groups at each time point using a Mann&#x02013;Whitney U test and a Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis was employed to look for change within groups longitudinally. No adjustment was made for minimization variables or any baseline imbalance.</p><p>There were some missing data points due to dropout, death and inability to perform tasks (e.g. unable to walk). We aimed to perform an intention-to-treat analysis; however, after consideration of dealing with missing data, imputing data from last observation carried forward was discounted as the technique assumes that outcome remains constant at the last observed value after dropout and this is unlikely in many clinical trials.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-0269215517720486" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Analysis was therefore only undertaken on completed outcome measures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="section11-0269215517720486"><title>Results</title><p>A CONSORT diagram is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215517720486">Figure 1</xref>.

It is questionable whether this frequency and intensity of input would be sufficient to effect change. It has been found previously that treadmill training delivered with a frequency of less than 3 times a week showed no effect on walking speed or endurance although only small numbers were included in these analyses,<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0269215517720486" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> our study would concur with these findings. While it appears that the intervention intensity in our study was of too low an intensity to effect a change, the approach to intervention was dictated by available resources in the four sites and therefore this study is clinically relevant, particularly for the UK setting.</p><p>Nearly 60% of the participants were non-ambulant or dependent on at least one therapist for ambulation at baseline (Functional Ambulation Category 1&#x02013;3), and this requires considerable staff input during gait re-education often with the assistance of two staff. If clinical therapists are unable to deliver high-intensity interventions due to lack of adequate resources and given that this study identified that there was no difference in outcome between the groups it may be that therapists should consider whether use of the treadmill as a component of gait re-education is only indicated for people with sub-acute stroke when sufficient intervention time is feasible or when there is clear evidence of a positive effect on a specific impairment. While interventions in our study may well have been task specific, our data do not indicate that intensive training was received which may have affected the outcome. While we investigated the differences in outcome between initially ambulant and non-ambulant participants, we found no differences. This finding is in contrast to a recent Cochrane review<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0269215517720486" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> but may be due to our small sample size and lower intensity interventions.</p><p>In any future work, we would recommend that a minimum intensity intervention was prescribed. We would suggest that this would need to equate to at least three treadmill training sessions per week,<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0269215517720486" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> with time spent actually walking on the treadmill requiring to be substantially increased from that delivered in this study. The actual amount of time walking requires further investigation. Furthermore, sub-analyses should be undertaken to investigate whether there are specific sub-populations of stroke for whom treadmill training gait re-education is indicated; however, this would require a much larger sample size.</p><p>We used specific measures of walking ability, activities of daily living and participation measures in this feasibility randomized controlled trial of treadmill training in ambulant and non-ambulant people with sub-acute stroke. We found no significant differences between the groups for any of the outcome measures at eight weeks or six months. In terms of determining feasibility of outcome measure use for future trials, we found that all the outcome measures were feasible to use with people with sub-acute stroke and sensitive to change over time; however, 16% of potential measures from the primary outcome were not captured, mainly due to death, illness or dropout (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269215517720486">Table 4</xref>). Additionally, there were missing data for physical gait&#x02013;based measures due to the high number of non-ambulant participants at baseline.</p><p>For subsequent work, we have used the Rivermead Mobility Index data from all participants at six months to estimate the sample size needed in a future randomized controlled trial of treadmill training in sub-acute stroke. A sample size of at least 180 per group would be required to identify a clinically significant two-point change in mean score for the Rivermead Mobility Index (assuming a standard deviation of 4.16) at the 0.05% level of significance and 90% power. Given that our Rivermead Mobility Index data were skewed, this sample size should be viewed as a conservative estimate.</p><p>A study investigating a comparable population to ours took outcomes before and after four weeks of intervention as well as at six-month follow-up.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-0269215517720486" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Similar to this study, they found that while all participants showed meaningful improvement in the outcomes tested, no differences were seen between the groups at any of the time points. However, in contrast to their findings that all participants were &#x02018;able to walk at discharge with Functional Ambulation Category &#x02265;1&#x02019;, we had six participants at six-month follow-up that were &#x02018;non functional ambulatory&#x02019; (Functional Ambulation Category&#x02009;=&#x02009;1). In terms of walking ability, our treadmill training participant data are comparable although slightly lower at post intervention for gait speed over 10&#x02009;m (0.45&#x02009;m/s vs 0.5&#x02009;m/s) and walking endurance over 6 minutes (119&#x02009;m vs 160&#x02009;m). For activities of daily living measures, our participants had a slightly higher median Barthel Index score at baseline, but outcomes at six months were comparable.</p><p>The spontaneous element to recovery in the first few months following stroke is well documented; however, it would have been unethical to have a third true control group where gait re-education was withheld. While some authors have demonstrated significant improvements with intensive treadmill intervention,<sup><xref rid="bibr22-0269215517720486" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bibr23-0269215517720486" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> these findings are contradicted by small-scale studies that had highly intensive gait re-education inputs and found no significant differences in gait outcomes.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-0269215517720486" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> It has been suggested that four weeks of treadmill training in ambulant sub-acute stroke patients may be sufficient to improve walking endurance and velocity.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0269215517720486" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>Finally, one of the main strengths of this feasibility study is that it was possible to undertake a multi-site evaluation of treadmill training in sub-acute stroke, with the intervention delivered as part of normal clinical practice. Participants were representative of the general sub-acute stroke population in terms of age and gender.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-0269215517720486" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> The randomization system was robust and outcomes were collected by a blinded outcome assessor adding to the strength of the work. We now have a realistic estimation of recruitment rates in future trials and can identify an appropriately powered sample size.</p><p>Limitations of the study include the low recruitment rate and subsequent small sample size which was appropriate for this type of feasibility design but does not allow generalizations. The recruitment rate may have been influenced by the type of unit (three were rehabilitation only, while the fourth was a mixed acute and rehabilitation setting). An interesting finding was that nearly one-third of the ineligible participants were excluded due to imminent discharge and needs to be considered in the design of future trials. It could be speculated that more people with sub-acute strokes would be found on acute units.</p><p>This study has shown that it is feasible to enrol sub-acute stroke patients into a randomized controlled trial of gait re-education incorporating the a treadmill as a component of rehabilitation. There were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups with respect to mobility, activities of daily living or participation outcomes, but this trial was not powered to detect these. The outcome measures used were mostly sensitive to improvements over time but due to the feasibility study sample size, it is unclear whether they would be able to identify between group differences. However, the intensity of treadmill training which was delivered within the National Health Service was low and unlikely to be sufficient to improve outcomes. Future trials may need additional staff to deliver a more intensive treadmill training intervention.</p><boxed-text id="boxed-text1-0269215517720486" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Clinical Messages</title></caption><list list-type="bullet" id="list3-0269215517720486"><list-item><p>It is feasible to enrol people with sub-acute stroke into a randomized controlled trial to evaluate treadmill training, however.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Adequate resources are required to ensure sufficient intensity of treadmill training can be delivered safely to impact on outcomes.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplementary material</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="cre-2016-5881-File002.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d35e1400" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We gratefully acknowledge the contribution of the following individuals: Jane Shiels (steering group, recruitment and intervention); Wendy Beveridge (steering group, recruitment and intervention); Wendy Juner (steering group, recruitment and intervention); Sarah Harrison (steering group, recruitment and intervention); Liz Gilligan (recruitment and intervention); Gillian McClure (recruitment and intervention); Susan Adams (recruitment and intervention); Gill Murray (recruitment and intervention); David Buchanan (development of web-based randomization computer programme); David Perry (development of web-based randomization computer programme); Robert Rush (statistical advice); and Robert Lee (statistical advice).
