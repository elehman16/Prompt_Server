<bold><italic>Introduction:</italic></bold> Pregnancy can be associated with different
psychological problems such as depression and anxiety. These problems are often neglected
and left untreated. This study aimed to examine the effect of mindfulness-integrated
cognitive behavior therapy on depression and anxiety among pregnant women. </p><p>
<bold><italic>Methods:</italic></bold> A convenient sample of 80 pregnant women were
selected. Participants were randomly allocated to either the experimental or the control
groups. Participants in the experimental group received mindfulness-integrated cognitive
behavior therapy while women in the control group only received routine prenatal care
services. A demographic questionnaire, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and the
Beck Anxiety Inventory were used for data collection. Descriptive statistics measures such
as frequency, mean, and standard deviation as well as the repeated-measures analysis of
variance test were used for data analysis. </p><p>
<bold><italic>Results:</italic></bold> After the study intervention, the mean scores of
anxiety and depression in the experimental group were significantly lower than the control
group. </p><p>
<bold><italic>Conclusion:</italic></bold> Mindfulness-integrated cognitive behavior
therapy can significantly alleviate pregnant women&#x02019;s depression and anxiety. So
implementation of this method alongside with other prenatal care services is
recommended.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cognitive behavior therapy</kwd><kwd>Depression</kwd><kwd>Anxiety</kwd><kwd>Pregnant women</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="2"/><ref-count count="38"/><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta><notes><p> Please cite this paper as: Yazdanimehr R, Omidi A, Sadat Z, Akbari H.

depression, anxiety, phobia, and obsessive disorders are increased during
pregnancy.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><p> About 18% of pregnant women are depressed during pregnancy while 14% of them experience
depression for the first time during pregnancy.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Anxiety is also other common disorder during pregnancy with a prevalence
of around 18%.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p> Depression and anxiety are often comorbid with each other. Evidence shows that these two
disorders cannot be differentiated from each other.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> The results of an interview-based study revealed that more than one
third of pregnant women had comorbid symptoms of depression and anxiety.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p> Untreated gestational depression and anxiety can affect mothers&#x02019; relationships with their
infants and other family members<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and may
lead to different negative consequences for both mother and fetus. For instance, they are
associated with intrauterine growth retardation,<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> infant&#x02019;s depressive behaviors,<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> depression during adolescence,<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> low birth weight,<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>
premature delivery,<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> mothers&#x02019; postnatal
depression,<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and lower accountability
to infants.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Anxiety can also predispose
children to behavioral, emotional, and cognitive disorders later in their life.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p><p> Given their high prevalence and negative consequences, effective and timely management of
depression and anxiety during pregnancy is of paramount importance.</p><p> However, studies have shown that neither pregnant women nor psychiatrists pay attention to
the management of depression and anxiety.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Chan et al., reported that pregnant women
consider inattentiveness as a right option for management of depression.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Currently, psychological problems are treated
mainly by using psychotherapy and drug therapy. Given their unique conditions and their
concerns over the negative effects of medications on fetus, most pregnant women prefer
psychotherapy over drug therapy.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p> Two effective psychotherapeutic interventions which have been used for pregnant women are
cognitive behavior therapy (CBT)<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and
interpersonal therapy.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> However, these
interventions have not been developed for managing comorbid psychological problems such as
depression and anxiety.</p><p> In recent years, mindfulness-based interventions were developed and used for managing
psychological problems among pregnant women. One of these interventions is
mindfulness-integrated cognitive behavior therapy (MiCBT) which integrates mindfulness-based
techniques with cognitive behavior therapy. MiCBT aims at managing comorbid psychological
problems such as depression and anxiety. It is a structured treatment strategy which trains
clients to internalize their attention in order to regulate their emotions and attention and
then externalize and use their regulated emotions and attention for managing their
problems.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p> Previous studies have shown the effectiveness of MiCBT in alleviating depression and
hyperglycemia among patients with type II diabetes mellitus,<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> reducing students&#x02019; procrastination, perfectionism, and
worry.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> However, to our knowledge,
the effects of MiCBT have not yet been evaluated among pregnant women. The aim of present
study was to examine the effect of mindfulness-integrated cognitive behavior therapy on
depression and anxiety among pregnant women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p> This was a single blind randomized controlled trial. We used the cluster random sampling
method to select three healthcare centers from all healthcare centers which had the
necessary facilities for conducting the study and were located in Kashan, Iran. Study
population included of all pregnant women referring to Akramian, Taleghani, and Ketabchi
health centers. We referred to the study setting and compiled a list of all pregnant women
with a gestational age of one to six months. As all pregnant women had already referred to
the health centers since the fifth week of their pregnancy to receive prenatal care
services, the lowest gestational age was six weeks. On the other side, the length of our
intervention was eight weeks with a one-month follow-up and thus, the highest gestational
age was considered to be six months. Pregnant women with higher gestational ages were
excluded due to the likelihood of going into labor before the end of the follow-up period
and the probable confounding effects of labor on their mental status. Accordingly, we only
selected the pregnant women who had a gestational age of one to six months.</p><p> Then, midwives working in the study setting were asked to inform pregnant women about the
study. Pregnant women who had agreed to participate were included in the study.</p><p> The inclusion criteria consisted of pregnant women in the one to six months of gestational
age, had at least a high school degree, acquired a score of greater than 13 in the Edinburgh
Depression Scale and a score of greater than 16 in the Beck Anxiety Inventory, and had no
history of psychological disorders or chronic physical problems, have not received
psychotherapy or drug therapy during the last six months preceding the study, and women
whose depression and anxiety were not secondary to certain known causes such as grief,
marital conflict, divorce, or unwanted pregnancy.</p><p> The exclusion criteria were having no desire for continuing participation in the study,
having two or more absences from the study intervention sessions, and having a premature
delivery. With an alpha of 0.05, a beta of 0.1, and an effect size of 0.8 (25), the Cohen&#x02019;s
formula for sample size calculation revealed that 33 participants were necessary for each
study group. However, by considering an attrition rate of 10%, we recruited 40 participants
to each group. Participants were randomly allocated into experimental and control groups
using block randomization method, by using units of 4 blocks.</p><p> The study primary outcomes were depression and anxiety which were measured three times:
before the intervention (T1), immediately after (T2), and one month after intervention (T3).
The measurement tools were a demographic questionnaire, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression
Scale, and the Beck Anxiety Inventory. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) had
been previously used for measuring pre- and postnatal depression among women.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> It consists of ten four-point items. Items 1,
2, and 4 are scored from 0 to 3 while the other items are scored reversely. The total score
of the EPDS is 0&#x02013;30. Scores of greater than 13 were considered as having depression. The
Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha of the Persian EPDS has been reported to be 0.92.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> We also assessed the reliability of the EPDS which yielded a
Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha of 0.82 (n= 100).</p><p> The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) is a 21-item questionnaire for measuring anxiety
severity. Each BAI item represents one of the common manifestations of anxiety. On each
item, a respondent can choose one of the four points of &#x02018;Not at all&#x02019;, &#x02018;Mildly&#x02019;,
&#x02018;Moderately&#x02019;, and &#x02018;Severely&#x02019; which are scored 0&#x02013;3, respectively. Thus, the total BAI score
is 0&#x02013;63. The cutoff scores of the BAI are as follows: 0&#x02013;7: no or minimal anxiety; 8&#x02013;15: mild
anxiety; 16&#x02013;25: moderate anxiety; and 26&#x02013;63: severe anxiety. The validity and the
reliability of the Persian BAI have been confirmed with a Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha of
0.92.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> We also found that the
Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha of the inventory was 0.78 (n= 1513).</p><p> The study intervention was a MiCBT program which was implemented in eight 90-minute
sessions. The contents of each session were as follows:</p><p>Session 1. An overview of MiCBT, the flow of the program, and the contents of the next
sessions; </p><p>Session 2.The basic principles of mindfulness, the components of CBT, and mindful
breathing; </p><p>Session 3.Mindful breathing (continued), step-by-step body scanning exercises, and
awareness of visceral sensations; </p><p>Session 4.Body scanning exercises (continued), behavior therapy techniques (such as problem
solving), and the relationship of mindfulness with CBT; </p><p>Session 5.Body scanning exercises (continued); </p><p>Session 6.Interpersonal skills, assertiveness, and role play; </p><p>Session 7.Acceptance and management of suffering in daily life; </p><p>Session 8.Review and evaluation.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p> The intervention was performed by a MSc in clinical psychology (first author) who had
received specialized training in this area under the supervision of a PhD in clinical
psychology. Intervention sessions were held at Akramian health center.</p><p> Participants in the experimental group received MiCBT while participants in the control
group received only routine prenatal care services such as weight control, blood pressure
monitoring, and delivery-related educations. At the end of the study participants in control
group received training manual of intervention sessions.</p><p> Descriptive statistics measures such as frequency, mean, and standard deviation as well as
statistical tests such as repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used for data
analysis by using SPSS (version 11.5) software.</p><p> This study was approved by the ethics committee of Kashan University of Medical Sciences,
Kashan, Iran, with an approval code of P/13/0/3/4005, December 17, 2014 and is registered in
the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials with the IRCT2015012920869N1 code. Before
implementing the intervention, participants were asked to fill out and sign the informed
consent form of the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p> Eighty pregnant women participated in this study (40 person&#x0200f; for each group). Ten
participants from the experimental were excluded due to their poor attendance at MiCBT
sessions. Moreover, seven participants from the control were also excluded because of
developing pregnancy-related physical problems or their failure to complete the study
questionnaires at either T2 or T3. Finally, data analysis was performed on the data
retrieved from 63 participants (30 women in the experimental and 33 women in the control
group) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Demographic characteristics of
participants are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. Chi-square and
independent-samples t-test were used for demographic variables (Age, body mass index and
gestational age were analyzedusing the t-test, and educational level, previous childbirth
and job were analyzed using the chi-square test).The of participants' mean age in the
experimental and control groups were 26.0 (5.8) and 26.7 (4.5), respectively (P&#x0003c; 0.05).

effects during pregnancy. This is in line with the results of the previous studies. For
instance, Vieten and Astin implemented an eight-session mindfulness-based educational
program for women who were in the second or third trimester of their pregnancy. They found
that mindfulness-based intervention significantly reduced anxiety. However, it had no
significant effect on depression.25</p><p> Dunn et al., also conducted a pilot study to investigate the effects of mindfulness-based
training on psychological distress among ten multiparous pregnant women.</p><p> 3 the control groups were respectively in the 12<sup>th</sup>&#x02013;28<sup>th</sup> and
17<sup>th</sup>&#x02013;29<sup>th</sup> weeks of their pregnancy. They used EPDS and the
Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS) for data collection and reported that mind
fulness-based intervention significantly reduced the EPDS and the DASS scores.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p><p> In another study, Duncan and Bardacke employed a one-group non-controlled design and
implemented a mindfulness-based educational program for 27 pregnant women. The women were in
the third trimester of pregnancy and most of them (92.6%) were experiencing their first
pregnancy. Women&#x02019;s husbands had also participated in the educational sessions. The findings
revealed that mindfulness was effective in alleviating depression, anxiety, and negative
affect and in enhancing positive affect and well-being. Given the facts that their study was
non-controlled and some of their participants had previously participated in Yoga training
courses, the findings reported by Duncan and Bardacke might have been affected by
participants&#x02019; previous experiences.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p><p> Recently, a study was conducted on 39 women with major depression disorder (27 women) and
bipolar-spectrum disorder (12 women) in order to assess the effects of an eight-week
mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. The participating women either were pregnant (12
individuals), had planned for pregnancy (11 individuals), or were in their postnatal period
(26 ones). The findings showed that mindfulness-based cognitive therapy significantly
alleviated major depression disorder and had no significant effect on bipolar-spectrum
disorder.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p><p> As mentioned earlier, depression and anxiety are comorbid conditions.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>Therefore, the effectiveness of treatments can
be enhanced through adopting treatment strategies which can alleviate both of them. This is
of paramount importance to pregnant women because simultaneous and rapid alleviation of
mother&#x02019;s depression and anxiety can reduce the negative effects of these two conditions on
fetus.</p><p> Mindfulness is rather a new concept in psychotherapy and has attracted therapists and
researchers&#x02019; attention in recent years. It teaches people to focus on the present moment,
identify their own experiences, cultivate a non judgment attitude, accept their experiences,
reduce reactivity towards them, and effectively manage them.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p><p> Mindful attention requires preventing habitual reactions and creating non judgment
attitude towards, acceptance of, and detach from internal experiences.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p><p> People who receive CBT need executive functions such as keeping attention, deliberate
actions, affect regulation, behavior control, problem solving, and motivation in order to
get the most from CBT.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Executive
functions are mainly performed in the prefrontal area of the brain.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> When people access their executive functions
and use them for self-regulation, their distress is reduced. On the other hand, people
suffering from depression experience distress due to having limited access to their
executive functions. Accordingly, during sensitive courses of emotional excitements such as
pregnancy, executive functions can be used and promoted for alleviating depression and
anxiety.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> The effectiveness of
cognitive behavior therapies can be enhanced through integrating mindfulness-based executive
functions.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Moreover, emotional
dysregulation are related to the dysfunction of the front limbic region, i.e. where
prefrontal activity is reduced and amygdale is stimulated.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Mindfulness-based exercises can stimulate the activity of the
prefrontal cortex.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup></p><p> Evidence shows that integrating CBT with mindfulness-based interventions produces more
significant results compared with single therapy.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Great effectiveness of
mindfulness-based interventions has required clinicians to use these interventions to
enhance the effectiveness of their treatments. MiCBT is one of these interventions and
further investigations are still needed for assessing and confirming their
effectiveness.</p><p> This study has some limitations. One of the study limitations was related to lack of
background knowledge about the study subject matter due to its novelty.</p><p> &#x0200f; Mindfulness interventions are among the most appropriate and effective strategies for
managing psychological problems.<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>
Nonetheless, given their novelty, few studies have been conducted so far on these
interventions.</p><p> Moreover, we could not retrieve a random sample of pregnant women from all healthcare
centers located in Kashan, Iran. We also were not able to assess the long-term effects of
MiCBT in the postnatal period. Future studies are recommended to perform long-term follow-up
assessments in order to evaluate the effects of MiCBT on different pregnancy-related
outcomes such as emotional well-being, postnatal depression, and mother-infant
relationships.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p> The results of this study indicated that MiCBT is effective in alleviating pregnant
women&#x02019;s depression and anxiety even for one month after implementing it.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p> We wish to thank the Research Deputy of Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan,
