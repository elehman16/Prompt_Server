The primary efficacy end point was HbA<sub>1c</sub> change from baseline to week 12. Efficacy and safety end points were assessed after 1 year.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>At week 12, adjusted mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> decreased by &#x02212;0.76% with linagliptin and &#x02212;0.15% with placebo (treatment difference, &#x02212;0.60%; 95% CI &#x02212;0.89 to &#x02212;0.31; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001).

Mean insulin doses decreased by &#x02212;6.2 units with linagliptin and &#x02212;0.3 units with placebo. Overall adverse event incidence was similar over 1 year (94.1 vs. 92.3%). Incidence of severe hypoglycemia with linagliptin and placebo was comparably low (three patients per group). Linagliptin and placebo had little effect on renal function (median change in eGFR, &#x02212;0.8 vs. &#x02212;2.2 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>), and no drug-related renal failure occurred.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>In patients with type 2 diabetes and severe RI, linagliptin provided clinically meaningful improvements in glycemic control with very low risk of severe hypoglycemia, stable body weight, and no cases of drug-related renal failure.

Concurrent with this increase, the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is rising worldwide (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Diabetes has been identified as the leading cause of CKD, which may progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or increase the risk of death (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). This association represents an increasing burden for patients and health care systems, particularly in developing countries (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>Standards of diabetes care recommend reducing the risk, or slowing the progression, of CKD by optimizing glycemic control (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). However, most drugs available to treat hyperglycemia are affected by kidney function and should therefore be either avoided or used at reduced doses in patients with CKD (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Consequently, there is a great need to focus on optimal diabetes management in patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD.</p><p>Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are one of the latest therapeutic classes of glucose-lowering medications. Within this class, linagliptin uniquely has a primarily nonrenal route of elimination, with only &#x0223c;5% of the dose being excreted via the kidneys (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). This contrasts with other DPP-4 inhibitors, such as sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, and alogliptin that are predominantly cleared by renal excretion (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Thus, linagliptin needs no dose adjustment in patients with impaired renal function (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Dose adjustment is recommended for sitagliptin, saxagliptin, and vildagliptin in patients with creatinine clearance &#x0003c;50 mL/min, including those with ESRD requiring dialysis (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Previous clinical studies have shown that linagliptin achieves clinically meaningful improvements in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes either as monotherapy (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) or in combination with metformin (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), metformin/sulfonylurea (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), or a thiazolidinedione (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Those studies demonstrated the overall safety and tolerability of linagliptin (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The objective of this study was to investigate the long-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of linagliptin compared with placebo when administered in combination with existing glucose-lowering background therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes and severe renal impairment (RI) over 52 weeks.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Study population</title><p>Eligible study participants were women (nonfertile or using a medically approved birth control method) and men aged 18&#x02013;80 years, previously diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, who were treated with glucose-lowering agents, including insulin, sulfonylurea, glinides, pioglitazone, and &#x003b1;-glucosidase inhibitors. Existing glucose-lowering therapy must have remained unchanged for &#x02265;8 weeks before study entry. Participants fulfilled the criteria for severe RI (CKD stage 4/5) at screening, having an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study equation of &#x0003c;30 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (while not receiving chronic dialysis). In addition, participants had an HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003e;7 and &#x02264;10% (&#x0003e;53 and &#x02264;86 mmol/mol) and a BMI &#x02264;45 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Exclusion criteria at screening included the following: myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or transient ischemic attack within the previous 6 months; any requirement for acute dialysis within the previous 3 months; renal transplantation; impaired hepatic function; and use of any other DPP-4 inhibitor or antiobesity drug within the previous 3 months.</p><p>The study was carried out according to the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice principles. The protocol was approved by the independent ethics committee or institutional review board at each participating site.

It comprised a 2-week, open-label, placebo run-in period, followed by a 52-week double-blind treatment period, and a 1-week follow-up period.</p><p>Study participants who met the eligibility criteria at screening and at the end of the 2-week placebo run-in period were randomized (1:1) to receive double-blind treatment with either linagliptin (5 mg/day) or placebo in addition to their glucose-lowering background therapy for 52 weeks. This allocation was stratified by HbA<sub>1c</sub> (&#x02264;8 vs. &#x0003e;8% [&#x02264;64 vs. &#x0003e;64 mmol/mol]) and glucose-lowering background therapy. Study investigators and participants were blinded to treatment assignment for the duration of the study and to results of interim analyses.</p><p>To assess the glucose-lowering effect of adding linagliptin, stable doses of existing background therapy were maintained during the first 12 weeks of treatment (unless dose adjustment was required for safety reasons). During the following 40-week treatment period, background therapy could be adjusted according to glucose parameters.</p><p>Rescue therapy (any changes in treatment or doses of glucose-lowering background therapy during weeks 1&#x02013;12 and/or addition of insulin during weeks 1&#x02013;52) could be initiated based on failure to meet prespecified glycemic response criteria: a confirmed fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level &#x0003e;240 mg/mL (&#x0003e;13.3 mmol/L) during weeks 1&#x02013;12, a confirmed FPG level &#x0003e;200 mg/dL (&#x0003e;11.1 mmol/L) during weeks 12&#x02013;52, or a randomly determined glucose level &#x0003e;400 mg/dL (&#x0003e;22.2 mmol/L) at any time.

Hypoglycemic events and severe hypoglycemic episodes were recorded (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Additionally, an independent clinical event committee (CEC) prospectively reviewed, in a blinded fashion, all reports of treatment-emergent fatal events and suspected cardiovascular (CV) events and evaluated whether prespecified criteria for adjudication end points (CV death, stroke, MI, and hospitalization for unstable angina) were met.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Assuming that the SD of change from baseline in HbA<sub>1c</sub> was 1.0% in both treatment groups, a total of 50 patients in each group were required to achieve a power of 93% to detect a 0.7% difference in HbA<sub>1c</sub> change from baseline to week 12. An additional 15 patients per group were added to account for patients with potentially missing baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> values or without any on-treatment HbA<sub>1c</sub> value, resulting in 65 patients per treatment group (25% planned dropout rate).</p><p>The primary efficacy end point, change from baseline to week 12 in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, was tested using a superiority hypothesis of linagliptin to placebo at the two-sided 5% level of significance.

The 1-year study was completed by 97 (72.9%) patients (linagliptin, 72.1; placebo, 73.8%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The primary reasons for discontinuation were AEs (linagliptin, 11.8; placebo, 16.9%) and refusal to continue medication (linagliptin, 10.3; placebo, 1.5%). One patient in the linagliptin group refused to continue due to perceived lack of efficacy. The others who refused to continue gave no cause. Other reasons for discontinuation were lack of therapeutic effect (linagliptin, 1.5; placebo, 1.5%) and loss to follow-up (linagliptin, 1.5; placebo, 4.6%).

Overall, most patients were white (73.7%). There were more men (60.2%) than women (39.8%), with a higher proportion of men in the linagliptin group than in the placebo group (66.2 vs. 53.8%, respectively). More than half of patients were aged &#x02265;65 years (55.6%), classified as obese (BMI &#x02265;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 66.2%), and had an HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265;8% (&#x02265;64 mmol/mol; 54.7%). Most patients (96.1%) had type 2 diabetes for &#x0003e;5 years and were receiving glucose-lowering background monotherapy (76.7%), with 63.9% treated with insulin alone and 18.0% with insulin combination therapy. The most common concomitant medications (linagliptin vs. placebo) were antihypertensive agents (94.1 vs. 100.0%), lipid-lowering agents (77.9 vs. 80.0%), and acetylsalicylic acid (67.6 vs. 69.2%).

All patients had protocol-defined severe RI at screening. However, due to common fluctuations in renal function seen in advanced stages of kidney disease, 14.3% of patients had eGFR in the range of 30&#x02013;60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> at baseline (assessed &#x02265;2 weeks after screening). The classification of 92.7% of patients in the linagliptin group remained severe RI at baseline (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). In addition, slightly different formulae were used to calculate eGFR at the initial screening by the central laboratory and at baseline evaluations by the linagliptin study program.

The results show that the addition of the oral DPP-4 inhibitor linagliptin (5 mg once daily) to background glucose-lowering therapy provided a clinically meaningful HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction after 12 weeks that was sustained over 52 weeks. Throughout the study, linagliptin was well tolerated, with a safety and tolerability profile similar to placebo in this vulnerable patient population. In particular, linagliptin was associated with very low risk of severe hypoglycemia, stable body weight, and no cases of drug-related renal failure.</p><p>Glycemic control is fundamental to diabetes management (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Several large clinical trials have demonstrated an association between hyperglycemia and the progression of microvascular complications, such as CKD, in patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). However, antihyperglycemic treatment options are limited in patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD because many oral glucose-lowering agents are cleared by the kidney. Therefore, in patients with severe RI, most of these therapies are either not recommended or contraindicated (e.g., &#x003b1;-glucosidase inhibitors, metformin, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, and some first-generation sulfonylureas) or may require significant dose reduction (e.g., second-generation sulfonylureas, repaglinide, and DPP-4 inhibitors) (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Although advanced CKD does not affect the metabolism of thiazolidinediones, these agents must also be used with caution because of the increased risk of fluid retention and heart failure (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>In this study, adding linagliptin to glucose-lowering background therapy provided a clinically significant placebo-corrected reduction of 0.7% in HbA<sub>1c</sub> after 52 weeks in patients with type 2 diabetes and severe RI. This finding is in line with previous 24-week studies that reported that linagliptin (5 mg once daily) used either alone or in combination with oral diabetes medications was associated with placebo-corrected HbA<sub>1c</sub> reductions ranging from 0.5&#x02013;0.9% in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes and normal renal function or mild to moderate RI (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). These studies have shown linagliptin to improve HbA<sub>1c</sub> in patients with renal function ranging from normal to severe RI.</p><p>Comparisons of the efficacy of other DPP-4 inhibitors are limited due to differences in study design and patient populations; however, the HbA<sub>1c</sub> improvements in patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate or severe RI with linagliptin were similar, or greater, than those seen with other DPP-4 inhibitors. Placebo-corrected HbA<sub>1c</sub> reductions were &#x02212;0.4 to &#x02212;0.7% for vildagliptin after 52 weeks (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) and 0.4 and 0.7% for saxagliptin after 12 and 52 weeks, respectively (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> change from baseline with sitagliptin was 0.7% after 54 weeks in an active-comparator extension study (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). This is noteworthy given that linagliptin, in contrast to other DPP-4 inhibitors, does not require dose adjustment in patients with severe RI, whereas a recent study reported that sitagliptin was frequently used at inappropriate doses in patients with type 2 diabetes and RI, and only 15% of patients with moderate to end-stage RI received recommended doses (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).</p><p>HbA<sub>1c</sub> is a function of both fasting and postprandial glucose levels (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The FPG reductions observed with linagliptin over placebo do not seem to fully account for the HbA<sub>1c</sub> change, suggesting that postprandial glucose reductions, which can occur with incretin-based therapies, must have made more substantial contributions than FPG reductions. This contention is supported by previous observations of linagliptin&#x02019;s positive effects on postprandial glucose (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>Long-term improvements in glycemic control with linagliptin were associated with a trend toward decreases in background insulin therapy in the current study. This could help optimize diabetes management but warrants further studies to determine the extent of this effect. Linagliptin use was also associated with a numerically smaller decline in eGFR than placebo despite slightly worse kidney function at baseline. However, many factors can impact progressive renal disease in this population, and longer-term clinical studies are needed to explore the potential effects of linagliptin on renal function. Along with a previous finding that linagliptin exposure did not vary in patients with normal, mild, or moderate RI (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), the pharmacokinetic data from this study confirm that linagliptin is not expected to accumulate at any degree of impaired renal function.</p><p>Glycemic control becomes problematic in advanced CKD because of the risk of hypoglycemia secondary to reduced renal gluconeogenesis and clearance of insulin as well as of some antihyperglycemic agents and/or their metabolites (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). This study showed that symptomatic hypoglycemic events and severe hypoglycemic episodes occurred at similar rates in the linagliptin and placebo groups. The higher rate of asymptomatic hypoglycemic events is most likely explained by the protocol-fixed background treatment in the first 12 weeks of this study.</p><p>Patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD have high risk for CV disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires evidence that therapies for diabetes do not cause unacceptable increases in CV risk (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Retrospective analyses of data from DPP-4 inhibitors have not suggested any increased CV risk (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). In a prespecified and prospective meta-analysis, linagliptin was associated with a reduced CV event rate (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). In the current study, mortality and risk of CV events were similar between the linagliptin and placebo groups, but the sample size was small. A large prospective ongoing trial (CAROLINA; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>: NCT01243424) will evaluate the effect of linagliptin on CV outcomes.</p><p>Our study is limited by the exclusion of patients with ESRD requiring chronic dialysis, which could affect the extrapolation of data to this population. However, as linagliptin undergoes high-affinity binding to DPP-4, no impact of hemodialysis on drug exposure is expected. Additionally, it has been shown that linagliptin concentrations were not significantly increased in patients with ESRD compared with other degrees of RI (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Therefore, it is unlikely that differences in linagliptin exposure between CKD stages 1&#x02013;4 patients and ESRD patients (CKD stage 5) could affect the efficacy or safety of linagliptin.</p><p>In conclusion, this placebo-controlled, double-blind trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of a DPP-4 inhibitor exclusively in patients with type 2 diabetes and severe RI. These results confirm that linagliptin provides clinically meaningful improvements in glycemic control without unacceptable side effects in this vulnerable patient population. This supports the use of linagliptin as an effective once-daily treatment option in patients with type 2 diabetes and severe RI, without the inconvenience of dose adjustments or more frequent assessments of renal function specifically for dose calculation. In addition, renal function with linagliptin remained stable over time, and overall insulin doses were reduced. Investigations to evaluate these observations further are currently underway.</p></sec>
