Patients were randomized to SYSB or SAL four times daily for 4 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was mean change in NITFBUT from baseline at week 4. Ocular surface staining, goblet cell density, and meibomian gland expression were also assessed. Safety assessments included adverse events (AEs), best-corrected visual acuity, and ocular signs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 49 patients received study treatments (SYSB, n=25; SAL, n=24).

After 4 weeks of treatment, the mean &#x000b1; SD NITFBUT increase from baseline was significantly greater with SYSB (2.83&#x000b1;0.74 seconds) compared with SAL (0.66&#x000b1;0.55 seconds; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001, <italic>t</italic>-test). Improvements in conjunctival and corneal staining, percentage of patients with increased goblet cell density, and meibomian gland expression were also observed with 4 weeks of SYSB over SAL.

The study period consisted of three scheduled visits: a screening/baseline at days 0 and 2 and follow-up visits conducted after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. At the conclusion of the screening/baseline assessments, patients were assigned a subject number in numerical sequence and were randomized 1:1 to receive either SYSB or SAL (0.9% NaCl; Larmabak<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Grupo de Empresas Farmac&#x000e9;uticas SIDUS, Buenos Aires, Argentina). Patients were instructed to instill the study treatment topically in both eyes four times per day corresponding to morning, early afternoon, evening, and bedtime for 4 weeks. Compliance with the assigned study treatment was assessed based on patient feedback and by counting the remaining eye drops in the product bottle.</p><p>This study was performed in compliance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. The protocol was approved by the applicable independent ethics committees or institutional review boards, and all patients provided written informed consent before participating in the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy outcomes</title><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was mean NITFBUT change from baseline (day 0) at week 4. Secondary efficacy endpoints were NITFBUT by visit, NITFBUT change from baseline at week 2, and percent NITFBUT change from baseline after 2 and 4 weeks. Exploratory efficacy endpoints included meibomian gland expression and meibography (ie, evaluation of total and partial missing meibomian glands), conjunctival and corneal staining, and goblet cell density classification. Meibomian gland evaluation and ocular surface staining were assessed for mean scores and percent change from baseline after 2 and 4 weeks; goblet cell density was assessed for change from baseline in classification (ie, improved, maintained, or worse) after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment.</p><p>NITFBUT was assessed using a cold-light illumination interferometer (Tearscope<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Keeler Ltd., Windsor, UK) that enabled visualization of the precorneal tear film. The interferometer was attached to the slit lamp to allow recording of the tear film in real time. One reading was performed per patient, between 60 and 120 minutes after instillation of the assigned study treatment. Patients were instructed to blink naturally for 10 seconds and then to stare straight ahead without blinking. The tear film was observed until dry areas appeared.</p><p>Meibomian gland expression was observed by slit-lamp examination. Glands were expressed from the temporal to the nasal aspect using a cotton-tipped applicator. Expressed meibum was classified based on color and viscosity as follows: normal, clear oil (grade 0); opaque, diffusely turbid meibum with normal viscosity (grade 1); opaque meibum with increased viscosity (grade 2); or inspissated meibum or no excreted material (grade 3). Meibography of the lower eyelid was evaluated by slit-lamp examination aided by a clinical transilluminator (Welch Allyn Inc., Skaneateles Falls, NY, USA). Missing partial or whole meibomian glands in nasal, central, and temporal regions were counted by the examiner.</p><p>Surface staining of five corneal regions and six conjunctival regions was observed by slit-lamp examination after instillation of 5 &#x003bc;L of 2% preservative-free fluorescein or lissamine green, respectively. Surface staining was scored as 0 (normal, no staining), 1 (mild, superficial stippling or macropunctate staining), 2 (moderate, macropunctate staining with some coalescent areas), or 3 (severe, numerous coalescent macropunctate areas or patches). Scores were summed to yield total corneal and total conjunctival staining scores for each eye.</p><p>Goblet cell density was evaluated using impression cytology and Nelson&#x02019;s classification system.<xref rid="b13-opth-8-2365" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> After instillation of tetracaine topical anesthetic, polyvinylidene fluoride filters (22 &#x003bc;m pore) were applied to the inferior tarsal and bulbar conjunctiva for ~10 seconds and processed using standard methods. Periodic acid-Schiff reagent&#x02013;positive areas were averaged across 15 random fields, and results were classified as 0 (normal), I (low number of goblet cells), II (absence of goblet cells), or III (absence of goblet cells plus squamous metaplasia).</p></sec><sec><title>Safety outcomes</title><p>Patient-reported and investigator-solicited adverse events (AEs), BCVA, and ocular signs were evaluated as safety endpoints. BCVA was assessed using an Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study chart at a distance of 10 ft, and results were calculated as logMAR scores. Ocular signs were assessed by slit-lamp examination at all study visits. Conditions and illnesses evaluated were signs of active inflammation or significant structural change or discharge (eyelids and conjunctiva); active inflammation or active structural change, including focal scarring and fine deposition (cornea); active inflammation (iris and anterior chamber); and level of lens opacity, pseudophakia, or aphakia (lens, with an emphasis on the visual axis).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Demographic data were summarized descriptively. Between-group differences in demographic data and baseline characteristics were analyzed using Mann&#x02013;Whitney nonparametric tests, <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> tests, or unpaired <italic>t</italic>-tests. Efficacy endpoints were analyzed in the intent-to-treat population. NITFBUT differences between groups were analyzed in the worse eye using Mann&#x02013;Whitney tests and <italic>t</italic>-tests, with a significance level of 5%. The worse eye was defined as the eye with lower NITFBUT score at baseline; if NITFBUT was equal in both eyes at baseline, the right eye was used. Between-group differences in ocular staining were analyzed using <italic>t</italic>-tests; goblet cell density and meibomian gland expression were analyzed with <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> tests; and meibography data were analyzed using Mann&#x02013;Whitney tests or <italic>t</italic>-tests. AEs were summarized descriptively, BCVA was analyzed with Mann&#x02013;Whitney tests, and ocular signs were analyzed using Fisher exact tests.</p><p>The sample size was based on results of an exploratory study of patients with meibomian gland dysfunction. The mean NITFBUT was 5.2 seconds, and the maximum standard deviation (SD) was &#x000b1;2.88 seconds. A power calculation based on the assumption of a common SD of 2.88 seconds determined that a sample size of 50 patients would provide 90% power to detect a superiority margin of 2.7 seconds using a two-sided significance level of <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients</title><p>A total of 51 patients were screened and randomized to treatment. Two patients in the SAL placebo control group withdrew consent before receiving treatment; 49 patients received treatment and completed the study (SYSB, n=25; SAL, n=24). Most patients were women (67.4%, n=33/49) and Caucasian (63.3%, n=31/49). The mean &#x000b1; SD age was 44&#x000b1;19 years (range, 21&#x02013;85 years). A total of 47 patients received treatment for 28 days and two patients received treatment for 29 days. Most patients reported wanting to use eye drops because of dryness at least half of the time (SYSB, n=21/25 [84.0%]; SAL, n=14/24 [58.3%]). No enrolled patients had a diagnosis of a systemic condition associated with DE (eg, Sj&#x000f6;gren&#x02019;s syndrome).

At the 4-week follow-up visit, the reduction in total ocular staining score from baseline (mean [percent]) was significantly greater with SYSB than with SAL for both cornea (SYSB, &#x02212;1.16 [&#x02212;80.0%]; SAL, &#x02212;0.13 [&#x02212;10.4%]; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-opth-8-2365">Figure 3A</xref>) and conjunctiva (SYSB, &#x02212;7.52 [&#x02212;98.2%]; SAL, &#x02212;1.83 [35.8%]; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-opth-8-2365">Figure 3B</xref>). Mean treatment difference in corneal staining for SYSB vs SAL after 4 weeks of treatment was &#x02212;1.04 (95% CI, &#x02212;1.43 to &#x02212;0.64); mean treatment difference in conjunctival staining for SYSB vs SAL was &#x02212;5.69 (95% CI, &#x02212;7.44 to &#x02212;3.93). Total staining scores were also significantly improved with SYSB compared with SAL at week 2 for cornea (SYSB, &#x02212;0.76 [&#x02212;54.7%]; SAL, &#x02212;0.08 [&#x02212;8.3%]) and conjunctiva (SYSB, &#x02212;5.36 [71.9%]; SAL, &#x02212;1.00 [&#x02212;21.3%]); group differences were statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x02264;0.001 for both cornea and conjunctiva).</p><p>Impression cytology at baseline revealed that most patients had reduced numbers or absence of goblet cells (SYSB, n=22/25 [88.0%]; SAL, n=21/24 [87.5%]; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-opth-8-2365">Table 1</xref>). Conjunctival goblet cell density was improved after 4 weeks of treatment in 84.0% of patients (n=21/25) receiving SYSB compared with 33.3% of patients (n=8/24) receiving SAL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-opth-8-2365">Figure 4</xref>). Compared with baseline classifications, goblet cell density classification at both weeks 2 and 4 worsened in 4.2% and 12.5% of patients receiving SAL, respectively, and in no patients receiving SYSB. In the SYSB treatment group, impression cytology findings were maintained or improved in all patients at both follow-up visits compared with baseline.</p><p>At baseline, expressed meibum was classified as grade 2 (opaque meibum with increased viscosity) in 60% of patients in the SYSB group (n=15/25) and 50% of patients in the SAL group (n=12/24); meibomian gland expression classified as grade 3 (inspissated meibum or no excreted material) was evident in one patient in the SYSB group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-opth-8-2365">Table 1</xref>). No patients had normal meibomian gland expression. From baseline to week 4, the percentage of patients with meibomian gland expression classified as grade 2 or 3 decreased from 64.0% to 28.0% in the SYSB treatment group and from 50.0% to 45.8% in the SAL placebo control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-opth-8-2365">Figure 5</xref>). The percentage of patients with grade 0 or grade 1 expression at week 4 was 72.0% with SYSB and 54.2% with SAL. Overall, after 4 weeks of treatment with SYSB, the number of patients with grade 0 or grade 1 meibomian gland expression doubled; meibomian gland expression was largely unchanged from baseline with SAL. At week 2, meibomian gland expression was similar to baseline in both groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>No AEs were reported for either the SYSB treatment group or the SAL placebo control group in this study. BCVA of the worse eye remained stable from baseline through the 4 weeks of treatment. There were no significant differences in BCVA between groups at any visit.

At baseline, patients in both groups had signs of mild to moderate DE. After 4 weeks of treatment, NITFBUT increased by 65.0% (nearly 3 seconds) in the SYSB treatment group compared with 15.1% (&#x0003c;1 second) in the SAL group; NITFBUT improvement was significantly greater with SYSB compared with SAL. Improvements in corneal and conjunctival staining scores were also significantly greater with SYSB, and a greater percentage of patients in the SYSB group showed increased goblet cell density compared with the SAL group. Meibomian gland expression was also improved with 4 weeks of SYSB compared with SAL. Both study treatments were well tolerated by patients; no AEs were reported during the study period. BCVA remained stable in both groups, and ocular signs (conjunctiva/eyelid) improved from baseline with SYSB and SAL.</p><p>The improvement in NITFBUT with SYSB may be attributable to the demonstrated ability of SYSB to promote tear film stability and protect the ocular surface.<xref rid="b9-opth-8-2365" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The results of the current study also indicated that SYSB may help to manage DE by improving characteristics of DE beyond tear film instability, such as by reducing meibomian gland dysfunction, increasing mucin production, and promoting regeneration of the damaged ocular surface epithelium.</p><p>The results of the current study are similar to those of another open-label, multicenter study in patients with DE associated with meibomian gland dysfunction who switched to SYSB from various other therapies.<xref rid="b11-opth-8-2365" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> After 4 weeks of SYSB treatment, TFBUT, meibomian expression, and corneal staining were significantly improved. Blurred vision was the most common AE (reported by 6% of patients). At week 4, nearly 80% of patients reported satisfaction with SYSB, and &#x0003e;60% preferred SYSB to their previous treatment. These improvements in DE signs and symptoms occurred with an average of &#x0003c;2 SYSB doses per day. In the current study, corneal staining decreased by nearly 100% after 4 weeks of SYSB administered four times daily compared with a previously noted decrease of approximately 25% after 4 weeks of SYSB administered approximately twice daily; the magnitude of NITFBUT increase from baseline in the current study was also larger than the previously reported increased TFBUT with SYSB.<xref rid="b11-opth-8-2365" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>A potential limitation to this study was the relatively small study population (n=24&#x02013;25 per group) and the use of SAL as a placebo control. Comparison of SYSB with SAL enabled comparison of study outcomes after treatment with a formulation that replaces only the aqueous component of the tear film vs a formulation that also restores the lipid and mucin components. Future studies comparing the efficacy of SYSB vs other lipid-containing artificial tears are needed. Additionally, treatment compliance was assessed by patients&#x02019; self-reports and by counting the number of instillations remaining in the treatment bottles. This approach did not allow monitoring of frequency or time of instillation, and potential differences in compliance between SYSB and SAL groups may have influenced study results. Previous work demonstrated that SYSB markedly improved both objective signs of DE and patient-reported DE symptoms,<xref rid="b11-opth-8-2365" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and a significant relationship between TFBUT (a DE sign) and Ocular Surface Disease Index scores of ocular discomfort (a DE symptom) has been reported.<xref rid="b16-opth-8-2365" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Although patient-reported symptoms of DE were not assessed in the current study, objective signs of DE, including NITFBUT and ocular surface staining, were markedly improved with SYSB.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, SYSB restored long-term tear film stabilization and reduced ocular surface staining in patients with lipid-deficient DE. After 4 weeks of treatment with SYSB, NITFBUT increases from baseline and improvements in corneal and conjunctival staining scores were significantly greater than with SAL. Goblet cell density was improved in a greater percentage of patients who received SYSB compared with those who received SAL, and at the week 4 visit, meibomian gland expression was improved in the SYSB group compared with the SAL group. Both SYSB and SAL were safe and well tolerated; no AEs were reported.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Medical writing support was provided by Heather D Starkey, PhD, of Complete Healthcare Communications, Inc.
