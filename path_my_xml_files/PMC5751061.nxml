A key factor contributing to excess SNA event risk among HIV+ patients includes persistent abnormalities in systemic inflammation and coagulation [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;8</xref>]. Based on data from earlier large randomized trials, we and others have demonstrated that plasma measures of inflammation and/or coagulation activation predict risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], cancer [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and all-cause mortality [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;13</xref>], along with the composite of SNA [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These data include patients with advanced HIV disease and/or those with low nadir CD4+ counts. It remains unclear whether ongoing inflammation is associated with clinical event risk specifically among HIV+ patients with recent diagnosis and preserved immunity (ie, CD4+ counts &#x0003e;500 cells/&#x000b5;L).</p><p>Inflammation may improve with ART, but biomarker levels continue to be abnormal among ART-treated patients with viral suppression when compared with uninfected controls [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Early HIV diagnosis and early initiation of ART is now the goal for management of HIV infection in much of the world. Importantly, prior data characterizing the effect of ART on levels of inflammatory biomarkers typically involve nonrandomized comparisons, lack of a comparison group not receiving ART, and/or participants with low CD4+ counts [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;21</xref>].</p><p>The International Network for Strategic Initiatives in Global HIV Trials (INSIGHT) Strategic Timing of AntiRetroviral Treatment (START) trial randomized 4684 ART-na&#x000ef;ve HIV+ persons with CD4+ counts &#x0003e;500 cells/&#x000b5;L to initiate ART immediately after randomization, vs deferring ART until a CD4+ count of &#x0003c;350 cells/&#x000b5;L or progression to AIDS. In START, immediate ART initiation led to a 57% reduction in a composite outcome of AIDS and SNA nonfatal events or deaths; reductions in the risk of AIDS and SNA events were 72% and 39%, respectively [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. START represents a global HIV+ population, and 68% of the primary end points in START occurred among participants with CD4+ counts &#x0003e;500 cells/&#x000b5;L [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The START trial provides a unique opportunity to study associations between biomarkers of inflammation, coagulation, and vascular injury with major clinical outcomes among patients with relative immune preservation.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s5"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s6"><title>Study Design and Clinical Data Collection</title><p>The design and primary findings from the START trial have been described [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

AIDS was defined as serious events within the 1993 expanded surveillance document of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but also including Hodgkin lymphoma and excluding nonfatal <italic>Herpes simplex</italic> virus infection and esophageal candidiasis (excluded because of their lesser severity). SNA-related events consisted of any of the following conditions: cardiovascular disease (CVD; myocardial infarction, stroke, or coronary revascularization) or death from CVD; end-stage renal disease (initiation of dialysis or renal transplantation) or death from renal disease; liver disease (decompensated) or death from liver disease; non-AIDS-defining cancer (except for basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer) or death from cancer; and any other death not attributable to AIDS (see the Appendix of the primary START manuscript) [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Plasma Biomarkers</title><p>Using plasma collected at baseline and the month 8 visit, which was stored centrally at &#x02013;70&#x000b0;C, 7 plasma biomarkers were measured that reflected systemic inflammation (IL-6, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP] and serum amyloid A [SAA]), vascular inflammation (soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 [sICAM] and vascular adhesion molecule-1 [sVCAM]), immune activation (interleukin-27 [IL-27]), and coagulation activation (D-dimer). IL-6 was measured using high-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&#x00026;D Systems), D-dimer using the VIDAS system (BioMerieux), and IL-27 using immunoassay (MesoScale). A multiplex platform was used to measure hsCRP, SAA, sICAM, and sVCAM (Vascular Injury II Panel, MesoScale). All samples were analyzed by researchers blinded to treatment group.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>Biomarkers were analyzed either on the log<sub>2</sub> scale or using rank-based methods because biomarker distributions were right-skewed, and close to normal after log transformation; also, model assumptions were usually better satisfied for log-transformed biomarkers compared with no transformation.</p><p>Associations of baseline biomarker levels (log<sub>2</sub> scale) with event risk (serious AIDS, SNA, all-cause mortality, and their composite) were estimated with Cox proportional hazards regression models, pooled across treatment groups, separately for each biomarker. We pooled the treatment groups because tests for heterogeneity showed that the associations between biomarkers and the risk of the primary outcome were similar in the immediate and the deferred ART groups for all 7 biomarkers. In addition, the homogeneity of the associations between biomarkers and clinical events was assessed across age and gender. The Cox models were adjusted for age, gender, and treatment group and stratified by region. Additional adjustment considered baseline HIV RNA level and CD4+ count given the importance for clinical risk. Biomarker associations with events were also assessed in models that contained all 7 biomarkers. The proportional hazards assumption was examined with expanded Cox models that included an interaction term for the biomarker and log failure time. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the cumulative proportion of participants with clinical events were computed in 2 ways, (1) pooled over treatment groups, by quartiles of baseline D-dimer and IL-6 levels, and (2) separately for the immediate and deferred groups, by whether the baseline biomarker level was above or below the median. In all analyses, follow-up was censored on May 26, 2015, or the date of last study contact.</p><p>Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation coefficients were computed between baseline levels of biomarkers, as well as between baseline factors (age, gender, CD4+ and CD8+ cell count, plasma HIV RNA level, body mass index [BMI], smoking status, and time since HIV diagnosis) and baseline biomarker levels.</p><p>Mean changes in biomarker levels (log<sub>2</sub> scale) from baseline to the month 8 visit were compared between the immediate and deferred ART arms by intent to treat using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models, adjusted for baseline biomarker levels. Mean changes were back-transformed and presented as percent change on the original biomarker scale. Similar ANCOVA models were used for subgroup analyses by CD4+ and CD8+ cell counts and HIV RNA at baseline; homogeneity of the immediate vs deferred treatment difference across subgroup variables was assessed by testing for interaction between the treatment group indicator and the subgroup variable.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary NC), and R software, version 3.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). <italic>P</italic> values &#x02264;0.05 were considered significant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s9"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s10"><title>Participant Characteristics and Biomarker Levels at Baseline (Prior to Randomization)</title><p>The START trial enrolled 4684 HIV+ participants from 215 sites in 35 countries, and 4487 (96%) consented to store plasma.

Greater systemic inflammation (ie, IL-6 levels) and coagulation activity (ie, D-dimer levels) at entry in START were associated with increased risk for AIDS events, SNA events, and the composite of AIDS, SNA, or death. The detrimental effect of inflammation and/or coagulation activation was present in both the immediate and deferred ART groups in START (ie, were independent of the timing of ART initiation), and demonstrated similar associations for AIDS and SNA events when examined separately. In randomized comparisons of immediate and deferred ART initiation, immediate treatment led to significant reductions over 8 months in D-dimer, IL-6, SAA, sICAM, and sVCAM levels, both in absolute terms and relative to deferral of ART.</p><p>It is well established that HIV infection is associated with elevations in systemic inflammatory markers, cytokines, and circulating vascular adhesion molecules [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Consistent with this, we report median levels of IL-6 (1.39 pg/mL) and D-dimer (0.33 &#x003bc;g/mL) at entry in START that are higher than levels previously reported among populations of HIV-negative participants (1.23 pg/mL and 0.22 &#x003bc;g/mL, respectively, in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis; median age, 60 years) [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In other studies, ART treatment has also been shown to decrease levels of D-dimer, IL-6, and sVCAM [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24&#x02013;26</xref>], though the degree of decrease may vary by ART regimen [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and ART-induced viral suppression may not fully restore levels of these biomarkers to those of age-adjusted controls [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Specifically, when compared with levels among uninfected individuals, IL-6 and D-dimer remain approximately 40%&#x02013;75% higher among HIV+ patients on ART with viral suppression [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We show that immediate ART initiation reduced levels of D-dimer, IL-6, SAA, sICAM, and sVCAM, even when started early in the course of HIV disease, before a clinically significant decline in CD4+ count has occurred. When compared with the effect of ART initiation (vs deferral) among a subset of participants in the SMART trial who were not using ART at entry (prior to initiating ART: median CD4+ count, 447 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>; HIV RNA, 39 810 copies/mL), we report here a smaller reduction of D-dimer levels in START (31% vs 19%, respectively), but a similar reduction for IL-6 levels (13% vs 12%, respectively, though ART-related IL-6 changes did not reach significance in the smaller subset of SMART) [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Finally, we reported a paradoxical increase in hsCRP levels with ART treatment, but this lack of a decline (or an increase) has been previously described and may be the result of improved hepatocyte synthetic function (ie, improved hsCRP release), which was previously impaired in the context of untreated HIV infection [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28&#x02013;31</xref>].</p><p>Our findings on clinical risk prediction add to recent literature that has reshaped our current understanding of the mechanisms contributing to morbidity and mortality during HIV disease in the current era. Notably, measures of systemic inflammation are consistently associated with risk for SNA events and the development of individual end-organ diseases [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32&#x02013;35</xref>]. Recent data have also suggested that the independent contribution of CD4+ counts to CVD and other SNA event risk may be more modest, or not apparent, at higher CD4+ counts [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This may explain why we did not detect a significant association with clinical risk for IL-27, which is produced by antigen-presenting cells and is important in T-cell immune responses. We have previously reported that among 3766 ART-treated and virologically suppressed HIV+ patients, risk for SNA events or death was associated with elevations in IL-6 and D-dimer (HR, 1.45 for IL-6 and 1.28 D-dimer level, per 2&#x000d7; higher biomarker level, respectively) [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Even though the START study population included only untreated participants with higher CD4+ counts at entry, we estimate similar HRs for SNA event risk (HR, 1.41 for IL-6 and 1.37 for D-dimer). We also show that the adverse effects from systemic inflammation, in terms of clinical risk over the long term, are present for HIV+ patients whether they start ART very early or later in their disease course (ie, both treatment groups in START). Additional follow-up is required in START to accurately estimate biomarker associations with clinical event risk after viral suppression is achieved among this population treated at higher CD4+ counts, especially given our initial observation that biomarker associations were stronger for early vs later events in START.</p><p>Important questions remain regarding the underlying pathogenesis driving chronic inflammation and coagulation activity among HIV+ patients, both before and after ART initiation. Hypothesized mechanisms have been previously reviewed [<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and may involve factors related to persistence of HIV and related immune activation, incomplete immune recovery, loss of regulatory function, transcription of defective proviruses [<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], reduced control of copathogens (eg, cytomegalovirus), injury to mucosal surfaces with translocation of microbial antigens, toxicity from ART, and host and lifestyle factors. We show that even among HIV+ patients who start ART very early in the course of disease, there is a subset of ART-treated patients with greater clinical risk; such patients might benefit from reducing ongoing inflammation whatever the underlying mechanisms. A central focus and priority of current HIV research is to identify anti-inflammatory strategies and determine if that will translate into reductions in clinical risk for 1 or more SNA conditions [<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Importantly, any candidate adjunct treatment intervention would need to establish safety (or entail minimal risk) and not compromise ART effectiveness, given the excellent outcomes now experienced among HIV-positive patients treated early with ART.</p><p>Strengths of this study include the randomized design, large sample size, globally diverse study population, inclusion of HIV+ patients with preserved immunity initiating ART early (reflective of current goals for clinical practice), and the standardized ascertainment and adjudication of clinical events. Limitations include the lack of additional laboratory measures, the lack of functional measures that more directly reflect potential disease mechanisms, and the use of a single follow-up time point at 8 months that precluded determination of whether immediate vs deferred ART differences in biomarker levels persisted after more prolonged viral suppression (eg, &#x0003e;2 years after ART initiation). Longer follow-up of START will help clarify whether the full effect of more sustained virologic suppression over years ultimately reverses the harmful effects of ART deferral (reflected in the higher levels of inflammation and coagulation biomarkers), when compared with immediate ART treatment at higher CD4+ counts. The relatively low number of events in START overall, and in the immediate ART group in particular, precluded reliable estimates of (a) event risk among any individual end-organ disease condition or focused composite, (b) event risk after viral suppression was achieved and biomarkers reached their new set points, and (c) the interaction between biomarkers and treatment group or follow-up time. Finally, participants in clinical trials may have greater adherence and health-seeking behaviors, which may impact the generalizability of results.</p><p>In START, among a global population of HIV+ persons with preserved immunity, immediate ART initiation reduced biomarker levels of systemic inflammation, coagulation, and vascular injury compared with ART deferral. Differences in biomarkers between groups were the result of reductions after ART initiation, concurrent with increases among participants who deferred ART. Associations between IL-6 and D-dimer levels and risk for AIDS, SNA, and death were present for both treatment groups in START. When combined with data from prior studies [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], higher levels of IL-6 and D-dimer consistently predict increased clinical risk across a broad spectrum of CD4+ counts for HIV+ patients, both ART-na&#x000ef;ve and ART-treated. Cumulatively, these observations support the need for research to better understand the mechanisms driving ongoing inflammation and coagulation abnormalities during effectively treated HIV disease, and to identify disease-modifying treatments or lifestyle interventions that reduce inflammation beyond the effects of ART.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s15"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p>Supplementary materials are available at <italic>Open Forum Infectious Diseases</italic> online.
