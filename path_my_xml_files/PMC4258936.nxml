As part of a wide-ranging brief, she was charged with generating ideas about how to improve early intervention, enhance trust in frontline social workers and improve transparency and accountability in child protection. A central question for the review panel was &#x02018;what helps professionals make the best judgments they can to protect a vulnerable child?&#x02019; [1, p.6]. The final report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] highlighted the failure of historical attempts to improve assessment and decision-making via increased regulation, guidance and procedural requirements, rather than by developing and supporting the analytic and decision-making skills of social workers. It therefore recommended moving away from a culture of prescription and compliance (the &#x02018;status quo&#x02019;) to one that emphasised the importance of professional judgement. Achieving this necessitates ensuring that staff are equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to exercise sound judgement, and chapter 6 of the <italic>Final Report</italic> addresses these issues in detail, noting the importance of the &#x02018;ability to analyse critically the evidence about a child and family&#x02019;s circumstances and to make well-evidenced decisions and recommendations, including when a child cannot remain living in their family either as a temporary or permanent arrangement; and skills in achieving some objectivity about what is happening in a child&#x02019;s life and within their family, and assessing change over time&#x02019; (p.96).</p><p>There is a wide body of evidence to suggest that social workers are adept at gathering information, but find it challenging to analyse complex bodies of evidence and reach accurate judgement as to whether a child is suffering, or is likely to suffer, significant harm. Some studies have suggested that child protection assessments are &#x02018;only slightly better than guessing&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Key reasons for poor quality assessments and decision-making are an inability or failure critically to appraise information collected, random errors, and our susceptibility to sources of bias such as &#x02018;observation bias&#x02019; (a tendency to see things and people in a particular way, based either on what we are told about them beforehand or on the basis of certain features), &#x02018;cultural relativism&#x02019; (the tendency to exercise different standards across different cultures) and the dominance of first impressions. These, and other sources of bias, have consistently been implicated in decision-making, as analysed by serious case reviews and inquiries into child deaths. Again, research suggests that providing professionals with tools to help them organise and critically appraise information in a systematic way can minimise bias and error and improve decision-making.</p><p>Structured decision-making (SDM) has been defined as a &#x02018;general term for the carefully organized analysis of problems in order to reach decisions that are focused clearly on achieving fundamental objectives&#x02019;. SDM draws both on decision theory and risk analyses and, in the field of child protection, has been described as &#x02018;an example of an effort to integrate predictive (actuarial) and contextual assessment strategies&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. So, for example, the Family Strengths and Needs Assessment (FSNA) is a structured approach to assessing (including scoring) child and family functioning in those domains recognised as important in child maltreatment - both from the point of view of causation (which actuarial tools do not address) and intervention. This aims to ensure a &#x02018;logical fit&#x02019; between assessment and response.</p><p>The potential of structured approaches to improve assessment and decision-making has been reinforced by the findings of a systematic review of models of analysing significant harm, commissioned by the Department for Education (DfE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This review identified <italic>two</italic> SDM tools, both developed in the UK, which the review authors considered worth evaluating. Both address the three domains of the statutory guidance provided to professionals (known colloquially as &#x02018;the Assessment Framework&#x02019;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], namely, the child&#x02019;s development needs; family and environmental factors, and parenting capacity.</p><p>The review authors note that both provide practitioners &#x02018;with clear guidance about what to assess, and how to analyse and &#x02018;make sense of&#x02019; the data collected&#x02019; (p.73). In relation to &#x02018;Case Planning&#x02019;, they note that only one of these - the Safeguarding Children Assessment and Analysis Framework (SAAF) - includes an assessment of the possibilities for future change (p.75). Based on this review, and evidence from the Munro report, the DfE commissioned this randomised trial of the effectiveness of the SAAF, alongside an implementation evaluation. Interventions such as SAAF are complex interventions, enacted in the complex environments of local authority (LA) Children&#x02019;s Services Departments (CSDs). Understanding the process of implementation will inform the interpretation of the results of the trial and provide valuable learning to inform future use and roll-out.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Safeguarding assessments</title><p>The work of social workers in CSDs is governed by legal statute. Section (S)17 of the Children Act 1989 lays upon them a &#x02018;general duty &#x02026; to safeguard and promote the welfare of children within their area who are in need&#x02019;. Children are defined as being &#x02018;in need&#x02019; when:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>(they are) &#x02018;unlikely to achieve or maintain, or to have the opportunity of achieving or maintaining, a reasonable standard of health or development without the provision &#x02026; of services by a local authority &#x02026;&#x02019;;</p></list-item><list-item><p>(their) health or development is likely or be significantly impaired, or further impaired, without the provision of such services; or</p></list-item><list-item><p>(they) are disabled</p></list-item></list></p><p>Children in need include children in need of protection, but S47 of the same Act lays down a specific duty to &#x02018;make enquiries&#x02019; in respect of any child where there is &#x02018;reasonable cause to suspect that &#x02026; (he or she) &#x02026; is suffering, or is likely to suffer, significant harm&#x02019;. It is therefore commonplace to categorise referrals as either S17 (child in need) or S47 referrals.</p><p>Enquiries made under S47 are typically those where specific concerns have been raised about a child&#x02019;s safety. However, a significant percentage of S17 cases may also raise concerns about a child&#x02019;s development that are attributable to inadequate parenting and where assessment of family functioning is complex. For the purposes of this study, the impact of SAAF will be assessed with regard to complex assessments in both S17 and S47 cases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aims of the study</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Primary aim</title><p>The primary aim of this study is to determine whether complex assessments undertaken under S47 or S17 of the Children Act 1989 by social workers using SAAF, result in children being less likely to experience maltreatment or re-abuse than children whose social workers do not use SAAF.</p><p>It is hypothesised that social workers using SAAF will make more accurate assessments of risk and better child protection plans, including whether or not to remove a child from the care of his or her parents and the identification of effective intervention and protection plans to ensure their safety.</p><p>For the purposes of this study, complex assessments are those that require information to be gathered from a variety of sources in order to understand what is happening within a family, and where there are concerns about the adequacy of parenting, and/or whether a child has suffered, or is at risk of suffering, significant harm. Typically these assessments are referred to as &#x02018;core assessments<sup>a</sup>&#x02019; or &#x02018;comprehensive assessments&#x02019;, although this language is now likely to change in the light of changes to guidance (see above).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Secondary aims</title><p>The secondary aims of the study are to determine the extent to which SAAF:</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>&#x02009;improves the quality of social work assessments of harm, future risk and parents&#x02019; capacity for change</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02009;is acceptable to social workers and other key stakeholders</p></list-item></list></p><p>If the data permit, the study will also seek to explore SAAF&#x02019;s reliability in producing comparable assessment results across similar cases.</p><p>We will also seek to identify those implementation factors that hinder or facilitate its use and the reasons underpinning any adaptations made by individuals or teams.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study design</title><p>A multi-site, cluster-randomised controlled trial (RCT) in which teams of child protection social workers, stratified by site, are randomly allocated to one of two arms:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>i.)</label><p>SAAF training followed by implementation of SAAF in S47 cases and complex S17 cases;</p></list-item><list-item><label>ii.)</label><p>Management as usual in S47 cases and complex S17 cases.</p></list-item></list></p><p>An implementation evaluation will run concurrently with the trial to explore the experience of using the SAAF, how it is integrated into working processes, and the barriers and facilitators to successful intervention. The study will also explore participant social workers&#x02019; experience of taking part in the trial.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Study sites</title><p>Six CSDs in England have been recruited by the DfE (Leeds, Oldham, Nottinghamshire, Greenwich, Bournemouth and Hampshire).

Social workers in these teams are eligible, irrespective of experience or whether they are employees or agency staff. Generally, this will exclude teams that are working with looked-after children, court-work teams (where decisions have already been made that the level of risk posed to children justified their removal from parents&#x02019; care), intake teams or Multi-Agency Safeguarding Hub (MASH) teams (&#x02018;single point of entry&#x02019; teams who largely act as conduits to other teams&#x02019; services).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Intervention and comparison</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>Experimental group: Safeguarding Children Assessment and Analysis Framework (SAAF)</title><p>The SAAF assessment tool asks social workers to make a judgement relating to each of 55 items that social workers should consider when making their assessments:</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>&#x02009;For 33 items these are judgements of level of risk or concern (both terms are used), covering the child&#x02019;s developmental needs, parenting capacity and family and environmental factors.

Again, this is not a score card. Social workers are asked to indicate where, again on a five-point scale, they judge the prospects for (successful) intervention to lie, with &#x02018;reasonable prospects of success&#x02019; at one end, and &#x02018;poor prospects&#x02019; at the other.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Social workers are then asked to make three summative judgements, using a three-point scale:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>Level of harm (low, moderate, high);</p></list-item><list-item><p>Level of risks of re-abuse or likelihood of future harm (low, moderate, high level of risks); and</p></list-item><list-item><p>Prospects for successful intervention (poor, moderate, better prospects).</p></list-item></list></p><p>This is then used as a basis for guiding decision-making.</p><p>The SAAF approach to assessment and analysis will be taught to social workers in the experimental arm in a two-day training course by SAAF&#x02019;s developers - <italic>Children and Families Training</italic>.

The control condition will therefore be &#x02018;management as usual&#x02019;. Social workers in the control arm will continue to follow departmental policy and undertake S47 enquiries and complex assessments associated with both S47 and S17 (Assessment of Children in Need) cases, developing Child Protection Plans (CPP) as usual, supported by relevant policy guidance and management systems.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Outcomes</title><sec id="Sec18"><title>Primary outcome</title><p>Differences between the two arms in the proportion of cases resulting in maltreatment or recurrence of maltreatment following the completion of an assessment (S17 cases) or initial child protection conference (S47 cases).</p><p><italic>Measures</italic>: using administrative data (CIN data<sup>b</sup>) collected by LA CSDs we will assess the (re)occurrence of maltreatment, as defined by:</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>&#x02009;Number of children who become subject to a CPP for a second or subsequent time (or for the first time following a S47 or S17 assessment that did not result in a CPP), as a result of concerns linked to the original assessment;</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02009;Number of reassessments or re-referrals as a result of concerns linked to the original maltreatment/perceived risk of maltreatment;</p></list-item></list></p><p>At a national level, the CIN data include items such as &#x02018;Initial category of abuse&#x02019; and &#x02018;Latest category of abuse&#x02019;. In order to determine whether or not the trigger incidents are related, that is are indicative of a failed plan or inadequate assessment, data are needed that provide information at a more granular level than that typically collected for the National Statistics Office (the annual CIN return<sup>c,d</sup>). For this purpose we will use the more detailed data gathered by the CSDs (information management) and collect data immediately post-assessment from social workers <italic>via</italic> an electronic questionnaire (the Case Report Form). These data will provide us with information about the concerns of social workers, their confidence in their assessments, their plans and assessments of future risk. They will also ensure that i) we do not miscategorise apparently unconnected events that in fact have a common underlying cause. For example, physical abuse by a parent and sexual abuse by a stranger <italic>may</italic> be unrelated, but they may also be symptoms of a seriously neglectful environment; ii) we can link children who move between one form of assessment or focus to another; for example, S17 to S47, and monitor associated changes in assessment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Quality of assessments undertaken using SAAF:</p></list-item></list></p><p>High quality assessments are necessary but not sufficient for minimising the chances of (repeat) maltreatment. Other factors, such as missing information (that could not have been available to the social worker), changes in circumstances, the lack of appropriate services, or disagreement amongst professionals, may result in future maltreatment following an assessment that a child is not in need of protection (S17) or the implementation of a CPP (S47 cases). An assessment of the impact of SAAF on the quality of assessments, independently of outcomes, is therefore included in this study.</p><p>When 1,800 complex assessments have been completed, the Clinical Trials Unit will randomly select 10% of assessments, stratified by study arm and size of CSD. These 180 assessments will then be quality assessed by members of the research team, blind to whether the assessment is from the experimental or control arm of the study. It is not possible to blind the assessors to CSD given the forms used in each department. The researchers will be asked to record any information that might lead them to believe they know the arm from which the assessment was drawn; for example, reference to SAAF.</p><p><italic>Measures</italic>:</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>&#x02009;Data relating to the quality of assessments will be recorded using a quality assessment schedule developed for this study. This requires the assessor to collect information on 44 items related to assessment quality.</p><p>&#x02009;For 30 items the responses are simply &#x02018;yes&#x02019; (score 1) or &#x02018;no&#x02019; (score 0). For example, item 27 asks: &#x02018;Does the assessment make clear the changes required in the child&#x02019;s care to make the child/ren safe?&#x02019;, and the responses open to the assessor are: &#x02018;Yes, the assessment makes clear the changes required in the child&#x02019;s care to provide them with adequate parenting&#x02019; or &#x02018;No, the assessment fails to makes clear the changes required in the child&#x02019;s care to provide them with adequate parenting&#x02019;.</p><p>&#x02009;For the remaining 14 items there are 3 possible responses, reflecting the factor being assessed; for example, item 24 asks: &#x02018;If included, is there evidence that, in reaching their problem formulation, the author considered other, plausible explanations?&#x02019; and the assessor is asked to select from the following 3 responses, scored respectively 2,1,0: &#x02018;The assessment provides evidence that the social worker considered alternative theories that might explain how the present situation has come about, and has provided reasons why s/he favours the one put forward&#x02019;; &#x02018;The assessment provides no evidence that the social worker considered alternative theories that might explain how the present situation has come about, but s/he provides reasons why/evidence for the hypotheses being proposed&#x02019;; &#x02018;The assessment provides no evidence that the social worker considered alternative theories that might explain how the present situation has come about, and no reason/evidence for the hypotheses being proposed&#x02019;. The maximum possible score for any assessment is 48.</p><p>&#x02009;This is not a validated tool, but it is based on factors known to be associated with quality assessments. Whilst SAAF is designed to improve assessment and analysis, the tool is not biased towards the content of SAAF. Researchers will be provided with a user guide, which provides guidance on what is being looked for, and how to score items. For example, in relation to item 24 (above) about problem-formulation, the user guide states: &#x02018;<italic>Research indicates that premature conclusions can lead to mistakes, some of which can be fatal. It is good practice to consider alternate explanations or theories, and to be able to articulate why one has opted for one particular explanation theory, rather than another</italic>&#x02019;. The schedule will be piloted, the findings discussed, and re-piloted, until a satisfactory rate of inter-rater reliability is achieved. Assessors will receive training in the tool, and will be required to attain a satisfactory reliability rating before assessing SAAF and control assessments.</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02009;Information gathered from social workers on their approach to assessment, information collected and their confidence in the assessment and, where relevant, the proposedCPP.</p></list-item></list><list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>2.</label><p>Relationships between SAAF assessment judgements (55), overall assessments (3) and child protection plans/interventions.</p></list-item></list></p><p>In the review that identified SAAF as a promising tool to improve social work safeguarding assessments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], the authors emphasise the importance of assessing the reliability and validity of the SAAF as a &#x02018;tool&#x02019; to improve the classification of risk and the development availability of evidence-based programmes for those families assessed using SAAF.</p><p>We cannot directly address issues of inter-rater reliability within the resource constraints of the current project, but we will investigate:</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>&#x02009;the extent to which the structured approach (55 judgements) is linked to the 3 summative assessments of harm, risk and prospects for intervention; to recorded variations in CPPs, and to the primary outcome.</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02009;the extent to which the three summary judgements are linked with subsequent maltreatment or its absence.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Data relating to the 55 judgements and 3 summative judgements used in SAAF will be obtained directly from the SAAF forms used by social workers in the experimental arm, and from the Case Report Forms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Timeframe</title><p>Primary outcomes will be assessed at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months after the completion of an assessment.</p><p>Assessment quality will be assessed once the social worker&#x02019;s assessment has been signed off by the relevant line manager.

Of the two measures (the other being re-referral), this was judged to be the most valid measure of re-abuse within the Children in Need (CIN) Database, the source specified by the funder, the DfE. Re-referrals include large percentages of children in need, but not in need of protection; for example, day care, play groups, family support. Data on these indicators can be found in SFR45-2013<sup>b</sup>.</p><p>Children who are deemed in need of protection (that is, are assessed as at risk for significant harm) are subject to a CPP. This sets out what is needed to protect the child and to address the causes of significant harm or risk of significant harm. A successful CPP should remove the threat of significant harm, or reduce it to a threshold that professionals believe can be managed without a CPP. Children who are subject to a second CPP are likely to have been subject to repeat maltreatment, or to be children for whom concerns have increased following the first CPP. The need for a second CPP (or a CPP following an assessment that has judged a child not to require one in the first instance) may indicate a poor quality assessment.</p><p>A number of factors make it difficult to arrive at precise power calculations, namely:</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>&#x02009;the lack of an available inter-cluster correlation (ICC) for this purpose;</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02009;variation in size of clusters (range 6 to 12);</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02009;different rates of CPPs amongst participating CSDs (range 13.2% to 17.5%);</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02009;inability to estimate re-referrals and repeat CPPs within the time frame of the study; for example, amongst repeat CPCCs, there are no data on time to repeat CPCC, and most CSDs indicated that this would be rare &#x02018;within the year&#x02019;<sup>e</sup>, and</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02009;the complexity of the relationship between S17 and S47 assessments, given that one case may have recorded 2 separate assessments.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Together, in the year ending 31 March 2013, the 6 participating CSDs undertook: 8,524&#x000a0;S47 enquiries; 16,395 core assessments<sup>a</sup> and 5,394 CPCCs.</p><p>Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> documents a range of scenarios reflecting various postulated rates of re-abuse in the control group, and varying the design effect (variance inflation factor) from 1.5 (based on an estimated ICC of 0.1 and a cluster size of 6 social workers <italic>per</italic> team) to 2 (which allows, with the same ICC, roughly for an increase in cluster size to 10 to 12 social workers <italic>per</italic> team).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

These data will also be used to explore the possible reasons for differences across the participating CSDs.

Including information on covariates will allow us to examine moderator effects and to begin to unpick the mechanisms through which SAFF might impact on improved assessments and associated outcomes.</p><p>A key part of this analysis will be to try to minimise the unexplained variance in site-specific effects. This will increase power and, by capturing the factors that explain why effects vary across sites, will help in generalising the results beyond the study sites.

The study was commissioned by the government department responsible for children&#x02019;s social care; they are keen to adopt robust standards of evidence, but are relatively inexperienced in commissioning randomised trials, one consequence of which is that the timetable set has proved extremely challenging; for example, the need to develop the logic model underpinning the SAAF had not been identified at the commissioning, resulting in subsequent delays to the original timetable. Whilst the source of primary outcome data is administrative, important information is required from the participating social workers, who already feel overstretched. We have sought to minimise all data requests, and briefing sessions are being provided for all teams, to ensure that they understand the purpose of the trial, the implications of randomisation (and why it is important) and what we are asking of them. One of the challenges inherent in this trial is that staff turnover is significant in most CSDs, and many rely on agency staff, but those are the realities of children&#x02019;s social care at the present time. This is the first study to examine the effectiveness of SAAF. It will add to a currently very limited literature on the contribution that structured decision-making tools can make to improving risk assessment and case planning in child protection and on what is involved in their effective implementation.</p><sec id="Sec41"><title>Trial status at publication</title><p>Social work teams in all CSDs have been randomised.
