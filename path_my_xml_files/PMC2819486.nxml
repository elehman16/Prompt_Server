Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays has been implicated in the high levels of basal and squamous cell skin cancer, especially among people (primarily men) with jobs that involve intense sun exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition, skin cancer rates are much higher among men than women and excessive UV exposure is a risk factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Although skin cancer is one of the most common cancers, it is also one of the most preventable. Daily protection from the sun can reduce lifetime UV exposure by more than 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Protective behaviors, such as using sunscreen, wearing protective clothing, and avoiding midday sun reduce the risk of skin cancer and skin damage due to UV rays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Long-term sunscreen intervention trials have shown that sunscreen use is associated with a lower risk of basal and squamous cell tumors, precancerous skin lesions, and solar keratoses (a strong determinant of skin cancer risk) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Outdoor workers are exposed to approximately six to eight times more UV radiation than indoor workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and are more likely to be diagnosed with skin cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Previous research has shown that outdoor workers tend to spend many years in outdoor jobs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In addition, many of the outdoor workers in the U.S. have fair skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], which is associated with an increased risk for skin cancer (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]). Nonetheless, they typically do little to protect themselves from the sun during work or leisure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This may be partly due to the fact that the majority of outdoor workers are men who engage in lower levels of protection than do women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. For these reasons, interventions for this population&#x02014;male outdoor workers&#x02014;could provide substantial benefits. However, the majority of UV intervention studies have been directed at people who choose to tan (e.g., at the beach, tanning booths) and are based on the assumption that appearance is the major motivation for UV exposure. This assumption is questionable for people whose jobs require them to be outdoors.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Intervention Research for Outdoor Workers</title><p>Although avoidance of UV exposure is ideal, that is not feasible for most outdoor workers; thus, increasing sun protection is the best strategy for this group. A small number of studies have reported interventions designed to increase sun protection among outdoor workers and a few have had some success. For example, Girgis, Sanson-Fisher, and Watson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] assigned mostly male outdoor electrical workers to a dermatological skin screening and a 30-min educational session on skin cancer and sun protection. They found increased sun protection behaviors (sunscreen and clothing) 1&#x000a0;month post-intervention, but they did not examine longer-term efficacy of the intervention and they did not find significant effects on attitudes. Azizi and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and Borland and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] were successful in increasing longer-term sun protection among male outdoor workers via educational interventions, including skin exams, and information videos and brochures addressing the dangers of sun exposure and how to protect oneself. However, cognitions were not assessed. Using a multicomponent intervention at swimming pools, Geller et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] did not find a difference in sun protection behaviors and attitudes between the control and intervention groups, but the young adult aquatic staff working at the intervention pools reported fewer sunburns 6&#x02013;8&#x000a0;weeks later. Similarly, Buller et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] found a reduction in sunburns among employees of a ski resort receiving a multicomponent intervention. Finally, using a multicomponent intervention, including increasing access to sunscreen and hats and educational messages on sun safety and skin cancer with male and female US postal carriers, Mayer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] increased sunscreen- and hat-wearing behaviors and decreased skin darkness (measured with a spectrophotometer) 3&#x000a0;months, 1&#x000a0;year, and 2&#x000a0;years later. However, measures of cognitions were not assessed in this study.</p><p>This research appears to be promising. However, none of the current studies has examined the long-term effectiveness of different intervention components on cognitions, behavior, and skin color changes. Most of these studies and a number of other programs (many with mixed or null results) aimed at increasing sun protection among high-risk outdoor workers have limitations, including having limited comparison or no control groups, limited examination of cognitions, or not examining long-term effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In addition, most of the current programs have not focused on high-risk samples of fair-skinned males who have worked outdoors year-round for many years. Some of the more effective interventions with outdoor workers have included multicomponent strategies (e.g., posters, e-mails, educational sessions), but have not examined the efficacy of the different components. Additionally, none of these interventions has identified important and significant mediators of the intervention effects, which is a critical step to understanding the process through which interventions work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Finally, although self-reports of sun protection among outdoor workers appear to be valid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], it is important to also examine objective measures, such as changes in skin color [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>UV Photography Interventions</title><p>Several recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of appearance-based interventions that use UV photography to highlight skin damage due to sun exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The UV camera produces a photo that reveals skin damage unseen by the eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Chronic UV exposure produces non-uniform pigmentation, which appears as dark blotches and freckles in the photo. These interventions, some of which also include information on the impact of the sun on skin cancer and/or photoaging, enhance knowledge about the link between UV exposure and skin damage and have been shown to increase protection behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p>Several studies have examined the impact of UV photography among young people and/or those seeking a tan. In two studies of college students, Gibbons et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] found that those who viewed vs. did not view their UV photo reported a decrease in tanning booth use 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;weeks later. Using a similar intervention among college students, Mahler and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] found that viewing both the UV photo and a video on photoaging was associated with higher intentions to engage in sun protection, higher perceptions of vulnerability to skin damage, and greater sun protection 1&#x000a0;month later. Among beachgoers, Mahler and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] found that the UV photo, photoaging information, and a combination of the two had a positive immediate impact on sun protection cognitions and intentions. The positive effects were still evident 2&#x000a0;months later and changes in sun protection behaviors were mediated by protection intentions. Longer-term effects (4&#x02013;5&#x000a0;months and 1&#x000a0;year post-intervention) on sun protection behaviors and skin color, as measured by spectrophotometry, were also found using both UV photography and photoaging information among young adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]; however, this study did not examine the long-term impact on sun-related cognitions. Pagoto and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] found that combining the UV photo with information on sun safety and sunscreen use, along with a commitment card and sunscreen samples, had a positive effect on the sun protection habits of Midwestern beachgoers 2&#x000a0;months post-intervention. Weinstock and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] also used a multicomponent intervention with a large sample of beachgoers and found positive sun protection effects among the intervention group 24&#x000a0;months post-intervention. However, neither examined sun protection cognitions in addition to intentions and behaviors.</p><p>This current trend of using UV photography and information on UV damage has demonstrated strong promise for appearance-based interventions among populations that are particularly appearance conscious&#x02014;college students, adolescents, beachgoers, and (young) females (i.e., those who are more likely to tan for appearance reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]). It is not clear, however, if this appearance-based intervention is effective with outdoor workers whose exposure is more incidental than intentional. This may especially be the case for older males who are less appearance conscious and thus are less likely to be motivated to engage in health behaviors for appearance reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and who may also see sunscreen use as feminine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Current Study</title><p>The intervention components in the current study draw upon previous interventions on sun protection using the UV photo and/or photoaging and cancer-related videos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The frameworks and constructs examined in these intervention studies are typically drawn from the Health Belief Model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] and the Prototype Model of Health Behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], both of which describe cognitions thought to mediate the relations between health messages and health behavior. Drawing from the Health Belief Model, previous research has shown that perceptions of risk for skin cancer and damage are associated with higher levels of sun protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Barriers to sunscreen use (e.g., it is greasy) have also been associated with lower levels of sun protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The Prototype Model of Health Behavior includes measures of prototypes or social images of people who engage in a health-risk or health-protective behavior. The more positive an individual&#x02019;s image of a person who engages in a health behavior (e.g., sun protection), the more likely he/she is to engage in the behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. For example, the more &#x0201c;manly&#x0201d; performing a health behavior is seen to be, the more likely a man is to engage in that behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Previous sun protection research using this model has also included perceptions of vulnerability to negative outcomes (e.g., skin cancer) and attitudes (e.g., sunscreen is inconvenient) as core constructs in predicting health behaviors (e.g., sun protection). Gibbons et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] found that the reduction in tanning booth use was mediated by a tanning cognition index composed of tanning attitudes and prototypes of others who engage in tanning behaviors. It is expected that increasing awareness of the link between UV exposure and skin damage will alter images of those who engage in sun protection as well as risk perceptions and attitudes. The present study assessed these images, sun attitudes, and perceptions of vulnerability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Overview</title><p>Participants were randomly assigned either to one of four conditions in a 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 factorial design <inline-formula id="IEq1"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The goals of the present research were to (a) examine the effectiveness of UV photography and both photoaging and skin cancer information in a sample of high-risk, male outdoor workers over a 1-year period and (b) examine potential mediators of changes in their protective behavior. An additional purpose was to examine which intervention component (i.e., information on skin cancer or photoaging with or without a UV photo) would be more effective with this population. We extended previous research by also examining an objective measure of sun exposure.</p><p>First, we hypothesized a main effect of the intervention, such that the four conditions of the intervention would have a positive impact on sun protection cognitions and behaviors relative to the control condition. We further hypothesized that the UV photo conditions would be more effective than the no-UV photo conditions. Although the men in the current study are unlikely to be motivated by appearance, it was not known which video would be more effective over time. Finally, we hypothesized that the effects of the intervention on sun protection/skin color would be mediated by the sun protection cognitions outlined in the prototype model. We controlled for factors associated with the likelihood of a skin cancer diagnosis and engagement in sun protection behaviors: sun sensitivity, based on skin color [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]; past history of skin cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]; and years working outdoors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Participants</title><p>Sample size projections were based on the results of previous UV photo interventions, which had used intentions to engage in long-term sun protection (long-term behavior measures were unavailable).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> Approximately 200 Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT) road workers were asked to participate in the intervention study and 182 (86%) agreed.

Of the remaining 162, 148 met the criteria for inclusion in the study (male, outdoor worker) and completed both the pretest (T1) and post-intervention questionnaires (T2); 97.3% were available to complete the 1-year follow-up (T4). All data collection occurred in June&#x02013;August.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Design and Procedures</title><p>The men answered a pre-intervention questionnaire and had their skin color assessed using skin reflectance spectrophotometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] prior to the intervention (T1). The research was conducted at the DOT highway field offices, and the men participated either during work hours or received $75 for participating before or after work. All aspects of the study received institutional review board approval.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Interventions</title><p>The overall intervention had two primary elements: (a) a photograph taken of the face with a UV-filter camera and (b) a 12-min educational video on UV risk (focusing on either skin cancer or photoaging). The video discussed the impact of the sun and UV exposure on either photoaging or skin cancer and provided pictures of skin damage (wrinkles and age spots or skin cancer). Each video also provided information about sunscreen use and skin protection (e.g., how much sunscreen to use, an explanation of sun protection factor [SPF], recommendation of an SPF of at least 15). Participants were first randomly assigned by worksite to receive or not receive a UV photo or to be in the control condition. Once the experimenters were at the worksite, they used a random number generator to then assign each worker to see the skin cancer or photoaging video. Thus, participants were assigned to one of five conditions: a control condition or one of the four intervention conditions: no-UV/aging, no-UV/skin cancer, UV/aging, UV/skin cancer.</p><p>All participants first had two Polaroid photos taken of their faces: a natural-light black-and-white photo and a UV photo. The filtered UV light is absorbed by the melanin in the skin and the resulting photo highlights the non-uniform epidermal pigmentation that has resulted from chronic exposure to UV rays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Participants in the control and no-UV photo conditions were only shown the natural-light photo and were told the purpose of this photo would be explained at the end of the study. Men in the UV conditions were shown their natural-light photo and their UV photo as comparison. Participants were told that any &#x0201c;dark, freckled, or splotched areas&#x0201d; in the UV photograph that were not evident in the natural-light photograph indicated existing underlying skin damage due to UV exposure that will get worse if they continue to be exposed to the sun without additional protection. Intervention participants then watched their assigned video (cancer or photoaging; for additional details on the manipulations, see Mahler et al.

Upon examination of the mean level of sun protection, it was found that the men in the control condition, followed by those in the no-UV/aging condition, had the lowest level of sun protection (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Planned comparisons again compared each condition to the control condition. Sun protection in the no-UV/aging condition was not significantly higher than those in the control condition, <italic>F</italic>(1, 52)&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.13, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.15.

When the three UV and cancer video interventions were combined and compared to the no-UV/aging and control conditions combined, the ANCOVA was also significant, <italic>F</italic>(1, 146)&#x02009;=&#x02009;13.66, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001, <italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.72. Thus, photoaging information alone did not produce significant changes in long-term sun protection. These results indicate that the most effective interventions for this high-risk male population were those that included the UV photo and/or information related to skin cancer.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>SEM Mediation Model</title><sec id="Sec30"><title>Measurement Model</title><p>Based on the results of the T4 ANCOVAs, the no-UV/aging and control conditions were combined and compared to the three other interventions in the SEM. The model was designed to examine the intervention effects on the major outcome of interest, sun protection at the 1-year follow-up. The model also examined the impact of the effective intervention components on change in sun protection cognitions and whether these changes mediated the changes in sun protection. The model (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) controlled for all control variables. A confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to determine if the indicators loaded on the constructs as expected. The intervention was coded as dichotomous and specified as a manifest construct (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;control/no-UV/aging, 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;cancer video and UV interventions); the other four constructs were specified as latent. Three randomly generated parcels were used as indicators of the latent T1 and T4 sun protection constructs (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.80 and 0.96, respectively), and three randomly generated parcels of the questions were also used as indicators of the latent T1 and T4 sun cognitions constructs in the SEM (T1 <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.81 and T4 <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.83).

All standardized factor loadings were significant and greater than 0.70. To examine potential clustering effects based on worksite, intraclass correlations were calculated for T4 cognitions and sun protection. Both were &#x0003c;0.03, indicating that the proportion of the total variation that could be accounted for by clustering was &#x0003c;3%.

Controlling for important covariates, the UV photo and cancer video interventions altered these men&#x02019;s cognitions about sun protection, and this effect, in turn, partially mediated the significant impact the intervention had on increasing sun protection, including decreasing levels of darkness of skin color. These intervention conditions also had a direct effect on sun protection and cognitions, while controlling for prior sun protection and cognitions. This study replicates the effects of the UV photo interventions on college students and beach patrons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and extends these results by showing longer-term (1-year) effectiveness on sun protection and cognitions and by including objective evidence of lower levels of sun exposure.</p><p>The men in all four intervention conditions reported more positive sun protection attitudes than did those in the control condition immediately following the intervention. In addition, the men who saw their UV photo reported higher estimates of long-term skin damage (vs. those who did not) and those who saw the cancer video reported marginally higher estimates of damage compared to the control condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Positive effects on sun protection behaviors and skin color were evident for all intervention conditions&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;months post-intervention, controlling for pre-intervention levels. However, these effects were stronger among the men in the UV photo and cancer video interventions. The direct impact of these three interventions was also very strong on the primary outcome, sun protection, 1&#x000a0;year post-intervention.</p><p>Consistent with the Health Belief Model and Prototype Model of Health Behavior, there was also long-term evidence that those who received these cancer-related interventions came to view themselves as more susceptible to photoaging and skin cancer and had a more positive image of men their age who engage in sun protection, as well as more positive attitudes toward sun protection. The findings argue for the importance of changing these cognitions. This evidence of significant partial mediation is similar to the findings of Gibbons et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] who demonstrated that UV photography influenced a similar tanning cognition index in a study of college students.</p><sec id="Sec33"><title>Intervention Components</title><p>Unlike interventions that include many different components, we examined the effectiveness of a single (video only) vs. dual (video plus UV photo) component intervention on sun protection. In decomposing the effects of the intervention, the no-UV photo aging video condition was not as effective in the long-term as the other three conditions. It may be that seeing one&#x02019;s damage and/or highlighting the link between UV exposure and skin cancer has more impact for this particular population. These results highlight the importance of examining appearance-based vs. skin cancer-based interventions for different populations. Our results indicate that appearance-only interventions may not be as effective for male outdoor workers, especially within an older population, who are less likely to be appearance-motivated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Mahler and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] did find significant effects of the no-UV aging condition on cognitions and sun protection 2&#x000a0;months post-intervention; however, this sample consisted of primarily female beachgoers with lower levels of UV exposure.</p><p>Previous UV photography interventions have focused primarily on female participants who tend to engage in intentional UV exposure. Although a few other interventions have shown positive effects among high-risk outdoor workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], this is the first demonstration of the long-term effectiveness of UV photography and educational information on (high-risk) outdoor workers. In addition, a national survey of adults found that being male and living in the Midwest are associated with some of the lowest levels of sun protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The finding that the men in our sample also had high rates of UV exposure during leisure time (on average more than 20&#x000a0;h/week), along with the finding that the intervention increased sun protection on their own time, demonstrate the importance of examining UV behaviors among high-risk groups when they are not at work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Limitations</title><p>Although the study included more than 24 participants per group and had a very good follow-up rate, future research should extend these findings to larger, more diverse samples. For example, all of the participants were male. It is important to also examine the effectiveness of the intervention on female outdoor workers. In addition, because of the lack of ethnic diversity and the small range of skin types in our sample, we cannot say that the intervention components would result in the same positive outcomes for workers from other racial/ethnic groups and of other skin tones.</p><p>Another limitation is that the mediators were measured at the same time as sun protection behaviors and skin color. Although the workers were told there would be a follow-up, they were not scheduled until the week prior, thus it is likely that skin color and sun protection behaviors were a reflection of true change. Additionally, we did not find that any of these factors alone mediated the intervention, thus future studies should continue to examine the cognitive processes underlying the intervention&#x02019;s impact. Research on men&#x02019;s health has demonstrated the potential importance of norms (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]) and it is possible that perceptions of increased sun protection among coworkers may have had an impact. In addition, the cancer-related information may have increased feelings of worry and fear, perceptions of the severity of UV damage, as well as efficacy in sun protection, which may have motivated the increased sun protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Finally, we did not find effects with the <italic>L</italic>* spectrophotometry readings. Although effects have been found for <italic>L</italic>* among college students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], Mayer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] also found <italic>b</italic>* to be more appropriate for outdoor workers. It is uncertain why these readings appear to tap into different aspects of skin color, but one possibility is that <italic>b</italic>* is more sensitive to skin color among those with long-term exposure to UV rays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Future Directions</title><p>Future directions of this research should involve combining the UV photograph and educational information in the workplace setting with other mechanisms used in multicomponent interventions, such as newsletters, supervisor training, workplace policies, provision of protective clothing, and skin examinations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. It is also possible that additional exposure to the intervention components would have even stronger impact. Thus far, there have been only a small number of effective behavioral studies in occupational settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and the variations in occupations, measures used, and intervention components make it difficult to directly compare our intervention to those of other settings with other populations. Thus, more studies are needed to determine which components are most effective with which populations.</p><p>Analyses from a separate sample of highway road workers who participated in a different survey study (Stock et al., manuscript in preparation) indicated that having coworkers who engage in sun protection or have had skin cancer predicts positive sun protection cognitions and behaviors, suggesting that future research should further explore the effects of coworkers. We have also found that feeling that it is &#x0201c;manly&#x0201d; to wear sunscreen is a strong predictor of sun protection. Thus, including masculine, respected role models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] may enhance the effects of an intervention on this population. Finally, based on comments made by the participants, we believe it may also be beneficial to make sun protection more convenient and less greasy/messy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study adds to the growing literature demonstrating the efficacy of UV photography interventions in reducing harmful UV exposure among an at-risk group. This study is one of the first interventions with outdoor workers to show mediation of long-term effects on sun protection. In addition, baseline measures along with relevant demographic characteristics were assessed and statistically controlled for in all analyses. Due to the increasing rates of skin cancer, particularly among older males and outdoor workers, an effective intervention for increasing sun protection has the potential for significant public health impact. This intervention is inexpensive, brief, and can be easily implemented at worksites. We believe that the important long-term effects of these intervention components have promise for reducing skin cancer risk among high-risk populations.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by the National Cancer Institute Grant #CA 9051501A2.
