This definition is often used in order to be consistent with the literature and the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders criteria. In clinical practice, however, it is often reasonable and necessary to expand the definition to cases with less than 30 dB of hearing loss&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].&#x000a0;The incidence of ISSNHL is approximately five to 20 per 100,000 population [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].&#x000a0;The etiology and pathogenesis of ISSNHL remain unknown. Proposed theories include vascular compromise, labyrinthine membrane ruptures, a&#x000a0;viral infection of the cochlea, etc. Saumil, et al.&#x000a0;histologically examined 17 temporal bones with ISSNHL&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. No histologic correlates were found in two&#x000a0;ears that recovered hearing after treatment. In the remaining 15&#x000a0;ears, the predominant abnormalities included loss of hair cells and supporting cells of the organ of Corti, loss of the tectorial membrane, loss of stria vascularis, and loss of cochlear neurons.</p><p>From the few&#x000a0;good studies&#x000a0;available, it is generally accepted that early intervention in ISSNHL may increase recovery [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].&#x000a0;It is well known that patients who start treatment within seven days of symptom onset have a higher rate of recovery [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].&#x000a0;According to the current American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAOHNS) clinical practice guidelines, oral steroids, intratympanic (IT) steroids, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy are the recommended treatment options for ISSNHL [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>In the general practice of an otolaryngologist, a significant number of patients with ISSNHL present more than seven&#x000a0;days after symptom onset. This is because a common initial symptom of ISSNHL is aural fullness or a plugged feeling in the affected ear [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].&#x000a0;Because this is a nonspecific symptom, primary care physicians and patients are unalarmed, often causing a delay in appropriate treatment initiation [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].&#x000a0;General practitioners often initiate antibiotics or a steroid nasal spray and only refer to a specialist after no improvement is seen.&#x000a0;</p><p>There are few studies dedicated to evaluating the effect of time to therapy initiation; most of these studies contain a good proportion of patients that present less than seven&#x000a0;days from symptom onset, which is within the recommended time frame for treatment. Upon literature review of the last five years of research on sudden hearing loss in adults, no studies have been formally dedicated to evaluating the average time between symptom onset and presentation in ISSNHL. Few studies have been dedicated to examining the effect of time passed before treatment initiation. Even fewer studies have been dedicated to examining the response to treatment in late presenters. No study was found that simultaneously compared the effectiveness of oral steroids and intratympanic steroids in late presentations (greater than seven&#x000a0;days from symptom onset). Interestingly, the studies that evaluated the effects of time elapsed before treatment had contrasting results. Marco, et al.&#x000a0;showed that time elapsing between symptom onset, the start of therapy, and duration of treatment was not a factor in hearing recovery&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Bogaz, et al.&#x000a0;studied the response of oral steroid treatment as it relates to the time elapsed prior to treatment initiation&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. They demonstrated that response was better when treatment was initiated early (within seven&#x000a0;days), but their study was limited because it only evaluated response to oral steroids.&#x000a0;</p><p>The objectives of this study are to 1) determine how long after symptom onset the average patient with ISSNHL presents to the otolaryngology&#x000a0;clinic; 2) in late presentations, to determine if there is a time to presentation cutoff after which intervention may not be effective; and 3) to study the effectiveness of oral steroids versus a combination of oral and intratympanic steroid therapy in late presentations of ISSNHL. The ultimate goal is to educate clinicians on managing patients with ISSNHL who present late, as is often the case in the typical otolaryngology&#x000a0;clinic.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>There were a total of 64 patients involved in the study. This number was attained after a chart review of 2,037 patients seen at the Metro Health Hospital from the year 2006 to 2016 for sensorineural hearing loss. These 64 patients met the inclusion criteria of this study. Of these, 26 were male and 38 were female. The average age of presentation was 54 years. Thirty-five patients reported left-sided hearing loss and 28 reported right-sided hearing loss.&#x000a0;</p><p>Inclusion criteria for the study were an age of at least 18 years and the diagnosis of ISSNHL. The hearing loss had to be of unknown etiology, rapid onset - occurring over a 72-hour period, and&#x000a0;affect at least three&#x000a0;contiguous frequencies on audiometry. Exclusion criteria were&#x000a0;the presence of&#x000a0;middle and inner ear disease that could explain the&#x000a0;hearing loss, such as trauma, infection, perilymphatic fistula, neoplasm or retro-cochlear lesion, congenital cochlear malformation, degenerative disease of the central nervous system, prior episodes of sudden hearing loss or fluctuating hearing loss (Meniere&#x02019;s disease), focal neurological findings associated with the hearing loss, or ischemic brain lesions.</p><p>All patients included in the study had a type A tympanogram. Data collected from patients were age, sex, laterality of hearing loss, estimated date of hearing loss, date of presentation, baseline audiogram, pretreatment tympanogram, pretreatment speech discrimination scores (SDS), pretreatment audiogram, accompanying symptoms, date of treatment onset, type of treatment with doses, and duration of treatment.&#x000a0;</p><p>Audiograms were analyzed for baseline status and response to treatment. If low and medium tones were involved in the hearing loss, the means of 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 kHz frequencies were calculated. When medium and high frequencies were affected, the means of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 KHz were calculated. When only high frequencies were affected, the means of 3, 4, 6, and 8 kHz were used [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].&#x000a0;The audiology baseline for each patient was calculated as the average of the pure tone averages (PTA)&#x000a0;from a pre-ISSNHL audiogram of the frequencies affected. In patients without a baseline audiogram, the audiogram results of the non-affected ear were utilized as a baseline.</p><p>Treatment&#x000a0;in the study population was either oral steroids or intratympanic steroids. Thirty-nine&#x000a0;of the 40 patients received oral steroid therapy. Eighteen&#x000a0;of these 39 patients also received intratympanic steroids. A prednisone taper was the most common oral steroid therapy. Patients were instructed to take 60 mg for nine&#x000a0;days and tapered over the following five&#x000a0;days for a total of 14 days. This regimen was utilized in 36 of the 39 patients who opted for oral steroid therapy.&#x000a0;One&#x000a0;of the 39 patients was treated with a Medrol&#x000ae; Dosepak&#x02122; (Pfizer, Inc., New York, NY), one&#x000a0;with decadron 8 mg every eight&#x000a0;hours for seven&#x000a0;days, and one&#x000a0;patient was treated with decadron in a tapering fashion unique from the other patients in the study. It was administered 6 mg on day one, 4.5 mg on days two to four, 3.75 mg on days five to seven,&#x000a0;3 mg on days eight and nine, 1.5 mg on days 10 and 11, and 0.75 mg on days 12 and 13.&#x000a0;</p><p>Of the 18 patients who were treated with both oral and IT steroid therapy, 15 were treated with weekly sessions of IT steroids. Under a microscope, topical phenol was used to anesthetize a portion of the tympanic membrane (TM) and 0.5 ml of dexamethasone (4 mg/ml) was injected through the anesthetized area. The patient was kept in recumbent position for 15 minutes after the procedure. The number of sessions varied per patient depending on symptom resolution or willingness to continue therapy. The average number of sessions was 2.6 with a range of one&#x000a0;to five&#x000a0;sessions. The remaining three&#x000a0;patients had tympanostomy&#x000a0;tubes placed and administered 0.1% decadron ophthalmic suspension, six&#x000a0;drops to the affected ear twice daily&#x000a0;for two&#x000a0;weeks. Regardless of the method of delivery, IT steroids were started on average nine&#x000a0;days from beginning oral steroid therapy with a range of zero to 30 days. The only patient that was treated with solely IT steroids also had a&#x000a0;tympanostomy&#x000a0;tube placement and decadron drops in the same dosage described above.</p><p>Many studies devoted to ISSNHL do not have clearly defined endpoints. This was avoided in this study as evidenced by subsequently described criteria.&#x000a0;Response to therapy was deemed significant if it met the internationally accepted Wilson&#x02019;s criteria which are as follows: (1) Complete recovery is post-treatment PTA within 10 dB of baseline audiogram; (2) partial recovery if post-treatment PTA is within 50% of initial hearing level or &#x0003e; 10 dB improvement in hearing; or (3) no recovery is a &#x0003c; 10 dB improvement [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The data collected were statistically analyzed using "paired t-test", also called a "dependent t-test&#x0201d;. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), Version 20 (IBM SPSS Statistics, Armonk, NY) was utilized for the analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>All 64 patients were used to calculate the average time to presentation, but only 40 were included to evaluate the treatment effects because 24 were lost to follow-up or declined treatment. The average time to presentation was 55 days with the&#x000a0;earliest presentation being one&#x000a0;day and latest presentation being 240 days.&#x000a0;</p><p>For the treatment group, there were 40 patients in total (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TAB1">1</xref> for statistics). The average age was 54 years,&#x000a0;with the youngest age being 25 and oldest being 81 years. This group had 24 female and 16 male patients. Twenty-five&#x000a0;complained of left-sided hearing loss and 15 complained of right-sided loss. The average time to presentation was 36 days with a range of one&#x000a0;day to 189 days. The average time to treatment was essentially the same as time to presentation (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TAB1">1</xref>). Thirty-nine patients were treated with oral steroids, and 18 were treated with a combination of oral and intratympanic steroids. Only one&#x000a0;patient was treated with intratympanic steroids only. No patient was treated with hyperbaric oxygen.</p><table-wrap id="TAB1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Descriptive Statistics</title><p>Std: standard; dB: decibel</p><p>&#x000a0;</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

One patient that received both oral and IT steroids developed an exacerbation of a preexisting anxiety disorder. &#x000a0;</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) is defined as sensorineural hearing loss of 30 dB or more over at least three contiguous audiometric frequencies and an onset of fewer than three days, it is acceptable and often necessary to expand the definition to cases of sudden hearing loss that is less than 30 dB [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]<italic>.</italic> Hearing loss that is appreciable to the patient and measurable can and should be included in the definition so as to offer treatment accordingly.&#x000a0;</p><p>The treatment response in Group 1 is as expected and has been shown in papers that studied treatment response in ISSNHL. One of the oldest studies that investigated the response to oral steroids by Wilson, et al. in 1980 was performed in patients that presented within 10 days of symptom onset&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. They found a statistically significant response in the oral steroids vs placebo group. Another study by Bogaz, et al. showed that patients who started treatment before seven days had higher rates of recovery compared to later presenters&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In Group 2, which is this study&#x02019;s main interest, there was a significant improvement in PTA (p-value: 0.005). Forty-seven percent&#x000a0;(N = 8) had objective treatment response utilizing Wilson&#x02019;s criteria. Of the patients that responded to treatment, two patients had a&#x000a0;complete recovery and six had a partial recovery. Average PTA gains were 7.12 dB with a STD of 9.0 dB for the group as a whole. Hearing gains in this group ranged from 10 to 23 dB. The response seen in this group is impressive, given that these patients presented very late (up to 90 days after symptom onset). Again, it is important to note that 63% of patients that had measurable hearing improvement&#x000a0;also had subjective improvement. This demonstrates that this statistical significance is also clinically significant.</p><p>No hearing improvement was observed in Group 3. This is not surprising given that this group contains patients that presented extremely late. The exact range of presentation timing for this group ranged from 90 to 189 days. These findings suggest that although it is reasonable to attempt treatment in all patients (given the low risk of the treatment and the potential of hearing improvement), treatment may not be effective if the initial insult is greater than 90 days.&#x000a0;</p><p>In the recent literature, there has not been a study like this that evaluated the effect of initial treatment on late presenters. The closest study to this was one study that evaluated the effect of re-treatment of end-stage sudden deafness&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Given that it was a re-treatment study, the time to therapy was between two to six months. There was a 46.43% response and average 7.12 dB gains, and this improvement was considered a success. The treatment regimen in that study was a combination of sodium bicarbonate, dexamethasone, and batroxobin&#x000a0;5BU administered intravenously.&#x000a0;</p><p>The findings in this paper suggest that there is a benefit in treating ISSNHL patients that present late, especially if the time of onset is within 90 days. There was a statistically significant improvement in hearing in this group of patients, and a majority of patients who responded to treatment also had subjective improvement in hearing. The hearing gain seen could be the difference between different categories of hearing loss and may bring the patient to serviceable hearing levels.&#x000a0;</p><p>On analyzing the group of patients who also received intratympanic steroids, it is interesting to see that although PTA improvement was seen and almost comparable in magnitude to that of the oral steroid only group, it was not statistically significant. This is likely multifactorial. One reason may be the small number of 13 patients in this group.&#x000a0;Another reason could be that patients with a worse prognosis constituted this group. The majority of patients in this group were started on IT steroids after they had failed a trial of oral steroids. This is an area of limitation in&#x000a0;this study. Being a retrospective study, there were limits in the study design. A study that compares oral vs. IT steroid therapy as initial treatment modalities is necessary to be able to effectively compare these modes of treatment.&#x000a0;</p><p>During the data collection stage of this project, an attempt was made to document associated symptoms, such as aural fullness, tinnitus, or vertigo, so as to study the resolution of these symptoms with therapy. This portion of the study could not be completed because data extracted from the subjective portion of patients' charts&#x000a0;were often incomplete. These associated symptoms were not the chief complaints and hence not documented at every visit. This is another area of weakness in this retrospective study. In a prospective study, there would be an opportunity to make a concerted effort to keep track of symptoms in the form of a questionnaire that patients can complete at every visit.</p><p>As with any treatment, the risk of oral steroid therapy should be discussed with patients. Side effects of oral corticosteroids include insomnia, dizziness, weight gain, gastritis, mood changes, photosensitivity, and hyperglycemia. Severe but rare side effects include pancreatitis, bleeding, hypertension, cataracts, myopathy, opportunistic infections, osteoporosis, and osteonecrosis [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Treatment of ISSNHL with steroids is a relatively short course and most often well tolerated. In this study, the only adverse effect of oral steroid therapy was an exacerbation of a preexisting anxiety disorder in one patient.&#x000a0;</p><p>Select patients, like insulin-dependent or poorly controlled diabetics or patients with labile hypertension, tuberculosis, or peptic ulcer disease may not be able to tolerate oral steroid treatment [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. IT steroid therapy is a good option for these patients.&#x000a0; Alexander, et al. [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] demonstrated that even in long-term steroid treatment (up to 22 weeks) for autoimmune ear disease, the most frequent adverse effect was hyperglycemia and weight gain. Severe events like osteonecrosis and fractures are more commonly seen in patients with preexisting bone and joint problems [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>IT steroids have the advantage of having no systemic adverse effects. It is a good option for patients who cannot tolerate oral steroids. The most commonly cited adverse effect of IT steroids is TM perforations. Five&#x000a0;of the 14 patients that received IT steroids in this study developed TM perforations. All patients recovered but one patient required a tympanoplasty. This experience is similar to that in the study by Slattery, et al. [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] where a 20% rate of TM perforations was reported.&#x000a0; All patients in that study were treated with patches and the perforation resolved within two weeks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Patients with ISSNHL often present late. The average time to presentation seen in this study was about 55 days. The authors advocate for treatment of patients with ISSNHL who present late, given that treatment is relatively safe. As evidenced in this study, there is a statistically and clinically significant response to treatment in late presenters. Hearing improvement was observed when treatment was initiated in patients that presented up to three months from symptom onset. Oral steroid therapy is effective. IT steroid therapy may have an added benefit.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="competing-interests"><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Human Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Consent was obtained by all participants in this study.
