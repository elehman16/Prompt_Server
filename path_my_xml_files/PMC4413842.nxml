When performing confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope angiograms, the dose of indocyanine green (ICG) required is significantly lower compared with flash ICGA. ICG 10&#x02005;mg in 2&#x02005;mL using the accompanying aqueous diluent kit (Akorn, Pulsion or equivalent, as approved by the local health authority) was injected through the anterior cubital fossa vein over &#x02264;5&#x02005;s.</p><p>The standard angiographic field for all frames was 30&#x000b0; centred on the fovea, with a resolution of 1536&#x000d7;1536 pixels and capturing speed of &#x02265;6 frames per second for dynamic angiography. For still-frames, image quality was improved by digital signal averaging using either the automated real-time function or the &#x02018;mean&#x02019; function.</p><p>The timer was started at the start of the bolus injection, while the capture button was triggered only at first dye appearance. The &#x02018;precapture&#x02019; mode of the HRA device allows recording of 2&#x02005;s of the angiogram prior to the triggering of the capturing button, which is very useful for capturing the initial frames when the dye just enters the choroidal circulation through the feeder vessel. In order to image the full filling sequence of the branching vascular network (BVN), the dynamic capture duration was set at &#x02265;30&#x02005;s.</p><p>Still-frame captures were performed according to the sequence as shown in online supplementary appendix 1. Stereo-pair images were obtained during each time period. To obtain stereo-pair images, one frame was taken (using the automated real-time function) and the device was shifted laterally within the same plane, slightly to the right, and the second stereo-pair image taken.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Case definition of PCV</title><p>The Central Reading Center used standardised criteria to diagnose PCV,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>

The baseline ICGA and colour fundus photograph characteristics of patients with PCV are also described. These methods may provide the reference for standardised imaging and grading protocols for PCV in future multicentre studies.</p><p>The relevance of the diagnostic criteria can be seen from the results of this paper. While earlier studies on PCV used a variety of clinical and ICGA features to diagnose PCV and differentiate it from neovascular AMD, these features were highly variable between studies and the characteristic appearance of a polyp was often not well-defined. In many papers, the polyps have been described as &#x02018;polypoidal choroidal vascular dilatations&#x02019;,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> &#x02018;focal vascular dilations&#x02019;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>

<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> or &#x02018;polypoidal lesions&#x02019;.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> These terms, however, may mean different things and be interpreted differently by various clinicians. Therefore, it is imperative to use standardised criteria that are easy to apply across different studies in order to ensure that the results of these studies are comparable. In this study, three parameters were used to describe a typical polyp using ICGA&#x02014;nodular hyperfluorescence on stereoscopic ICGA (91.8%), hypofluorescent halo around the nodule (68.9%) and pulsation during dynamic ICGA (6.6%). We believe that stereo-pair ICGA images are essential in the diagnosis of PCV, as it allows the determination of nodularity (the most common diagnostic feature) and the depth of the lesions, which helps to differentiate vascular polyps from retinal lesions such as macroaneurysms, large microaneurysms and retinal angiomatous proliferation. This was of particular importance because spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) was not widely available in 2008 when this trial was underway. In future studies, SD-OCT may play an important role in determining the depth and shape of the PCV lesion.</p><p>Dynamic ICGA is an essential component of PCV diagnosis, as it allows identification of two of the six diagnostic criteria. The exact boundaries of abnormal vascular channels of the PCV lesion are best visualised in the early phase of the angiogram (within 30&#x02005;s) and may not be seen as clearly after 1&#x02005;min due to complete filling of the normal choroidal vessels. In addition, the presence of pulsation cannot be detected without the use of dynamic ICGA.</p><p>The abnormal vascular channels began to fill within 7.3&#x02013;32&#x02005;s from injection. Therefore, the use of dynamic ICGA for the first 30&#x02005;s is sufficient to detect these vessels. In all cases, the polyps started to fill within 40.4&#x02005;s from injection, with a mean of 21.9&#x02005;s, which corresponds to the original description of early, intense focal hyperfluorescence on ICGA.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Therefore, the use of either the 1-min or 3-min stereo-pair ICGA images should be adequate to assess the presence, location and extent of polyps and a later stereo-pair at &#x02265;10&#x02005;min may not be necessary. True late-onset focal hyperfluorescences (appearing after 6&#x02005;min) are more likely to be focal ICG staining of unhealthy RPE or choroidal vascular knuckle showing through focal RPE atrophy (window defect). In both cases, stereo viewing would help to differentiate them.</p><p>In this series, 33 of 61 cases (54.1%) presented with subretinal haemorrhage. This highlights the importance of haemorrhage as diagnostic criteria for PCV, as has previously been described.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>

<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> This clinical feature was seen in 55.7% of cases in this study, thus highlighting that not all cases of PCV manifest with characteristic nodules and the need for ICGA to identify the PCV lesion.</p><p>The strengths of this study include the use of standardised imaging protocols and equipment on all cases of PCV. The diagnosis of PCV was made by applying stringent diagnostic criteria by expert graders from the Central Reading Center. The main limitation is the lack of data from OCT, which can potentially be used as one of the diagnostic criteria. In future studies, SD-OCT can play an invaluable role in identifying features which are characteristic of PCV, and confirming the location of the hyperfluorescent nodule.</p><p>In conclusion, we have described the standardised imaging protocols, grading methods and diagnostic criteria used to diagnose PCV and highlighted important features in a prospective series of patients with PCV. It is hoped that these detailed techniques, and the baseline characteristics described, can be useful to clinical practice and future randomised controlled trials on PCV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bjophthalmol-2014-305674-s1.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d35e602" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Collaborators:</bold> Members of the EVEREST Study Group: (1) Adrian Koh, MD FRCS, National Healthcare Group Eye Institute, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore; (2) Won Ki Lee, MD PhD, Seoul St Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; (3) Lee-Jen Chen, MD, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; (4) Shih-Jen Chen, MD PhD, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan; (5) Hak Young Kim, MD PhD, Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital, Hallym University, Seoul, Korea; (6) Timothy Y Lai, MD FRCS, Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China; (7) Paisan Ruamviboonsuk, MD, Rajavithi Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand; (8) Tock H Lim, FRCSEd, National Healthcare Group Eye Institute, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> CST and THL were involved in the conception and design of the study.
