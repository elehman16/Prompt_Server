The use of acupuncture to treat myopia is a common practice in China, however, the use of acupuncture to treat myopia is disputed in other parts of the world. This study aims to determine the safety of acupuncture to treat myopia and its efficacy over six months.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A randomized, parallel, single-center, assessor- and statistician-blinded, controlled clinical trial will be performed. A total of 100 teenagers, between seven and 12&#x000a0;years of age, with mild-to-moderate myopia and spherical lenses &#x0003c;-6.00 D and cylindrical lenses &#x0003c;-1.50 D will be selected from the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, a grade III level A teaching hospital in Urumqi, Xinjiang, China (Xinjiang Medical University Affiliated Hospital of Traditional Medicine). The subjects will be randomly assigned to two different groups (control and acupuncture groups), each group containing 50 subjects. The subjects in both groups wear single-vision corrective lenses. In the acupuncture group, acupuncture will be performed daily for nine consecutive days on five points (bilateral Cuanzhu, Tongziliao, Sibai, Muchuang, and Hegu), followed by no treatment for one day. Six cycles of treatment will be undertaken continuously for a total of 60&#x000a0;days. Following 60&#x000a0;days of treatment, a follow-up period of six months will be included. The primary outcome will be diopter determination. The secondary outcomes will include distance visual acuity, axial length, lens thickness, ciliary body thickness, and subjective symptoms of the eyes and entire body. The main time points for the evaluation of clinical efficacy will be the first, third, and sixth months after treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will provide clinical observations of various indices following the use of acupuncture to treat adolescents with mild-to-moderate myopia, as well as information on the safety of acupuncture.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chictr.org/usercenter/project/listbycreater.aspx">ChiCTR-TRC-13003448</ext-link>; registration date: 7 August 2013).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Adolescent</kwd><kwd>Low-to-moderate myopia</kwd><kwd>Acupuncture</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Myopia is becoming increasingly common and has become a worldwide public health issue
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In the United States and Europe, the incidence of myopia is 20% to 50%
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]; in Asian countries, such as mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore, the incidence of myopia is 60 to 80%
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Over the past 50 to 60&#x000a0;years, the incidence of myopia in East and Southeast Asian countries has rapidly increased. Approximately 80 to 90% of urban adolescents in these countries have myopia on graduating from high school
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Myopia often occurs between six and eight years of age, develops rapidly between 13 and 16&#x000a0;years of age, and stabilizes after 16&#x000a0;years of age
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Treatment of myopia in modern medicine is mainly optometric, and includes the use of spectacles (single-vision lenses (SVLs) and progressive addition lenses
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and contact lenses
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Refractive surgeries include laser-assisted <italic>in situ</italic> keratectomy, photorefractive keratectomy
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and posterior chamber phakic intraocular lenses
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, while the most commonly used treatment method (optometric) can increase the best corrected visual acuity, optometric methods are unable to improve the uncorrected visual acuity. Surgery can help eliminate the need for glasses, but may lead to complications, as indicated by long-term follow-up studies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. There is also an age limit for performing such surgery, and it is considered as the last treatment choice for teenagers.</p><p>Acupuncture is highly valued in traditional Chinese medicine, and enjoys a favorable history of more than 2,500&#x000a0;years. Acupuncture has helped millions of patients around the world, and has been shown to be effective in clinical treatment. In 1980, the World Health Organization recommended acupuncture as an effective alternative therapy
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Previous studies have confirmed that acupuncture, ear pins, or ear massage can help treat mild myopia (&#x0003c;-3.0 D)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. There are published reports on the use of acupuncture in the treatment of adolescent myopia, but most studies use visual acuity as the primary outcome measure. Indeed, visual acuity, as determined by eye examination, is easily influenced by many external factors. Therefore, we have designed a randomized controlled trial based on the physiology and pathology of myopia. In addition to using distance visual acuity, diopter, and axial length (AL)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] as indices of clinical observation, indices such as ciliary body thickness
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and lens thickness
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] will also be utilized to obtain more objective and quantitative results. This trial aims to confirm the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in the treatment of adolescent myopia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This trial was designed and will be implemented in accordance with the relevant provision on the protection of rights and interests of the subjects in the Declaration of Helsinki version 08 and the &#x02018;<italic>Biological Ethics Review Method Involving Humans</italic>&#x02019; by the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China (2007).

Subjective optometrics of a single eye will be divided into the following three stages: the initial maximum plus the maximum visual acuity (MPMVA) will be identified, Jackson cross cylindrical lenses will be used to determine the axial direction and degree of the cylindrical lens, and the MPMVA will be repeated. The results will be recorded after optometrics. When the pupils recover, a re-examination will be carried out (three days after the use of cyclopentolate hydrochloride eye drops). After re-examination, the glasses will be tried again. The degree of the glasses will be marked on the glass trial frame, to be chosen by the subjects based on subjective judgment.

The main time points of evaluation will be the sixth month after treatment or when the trial is terminated.</p><p>Distance visual acuity will be measured using a standard logarithmic visual acuity test chart (TR-B; Tongrui Medical Equipment Co., Ltd., Tianjin, China), under sufficient lighting to measure the parameters of visual acuity, with a 5-m distance to the visual acuity test chart. All visual acuity examinations in this study will be carried out by one nurse in a fixed place who will not participate in acupuncture treatment or clinical examinations. The specific details of the subjects will not be disclosed to the nurse.</p><p>In order to measure AL and lens thicknesses, the subject will be placed in the supine position. Oxybuprocaine Hydrochloride Eye Drops (20&#x000a0;ml, Santen Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. Suzhou, China) will be applied to the eye to be examined, and topical anesthesia will be applied. The subjects will be asked to watch the red light at the top of the probe with the eye to be examined. A disinfected ultrasound probe will be placed on the surface of the cornea. Sound waves will pass through the middle of the corneal vertex, the center of the lens, and the vitreous body, to reach the macular fovea. The sound beam will be kept in a vertical orientation. The AL and lens thicknesses will be measured. Ten sets of values will be selected, with a measurement error within 0.1&#x000a0;mm
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The lens thickness is the axial distance from the front surface to the posterior surface of the lens
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. An ophthalmic ultrasound instrument (CINESCAN; Quantal Medical, Paris, France) will be used for these measurements in the proposed study. Ten measurements of a particular index will usually be made, and these 10 measurements will be recorded and the average value obtained. The AL and lens thickness measurements will be carried out by one full-time physician, on a fixed instrument, and at a fixed location. The physician will not participate in visual acuity examinations and acupuncture treatment, and the specific details with respect to the grouping of subjects will not be disclosed to the physician.</p><p>In order to measure ciliary body thickness, oxybuprocaine hydrochloride eye drops will be applied to the eye to be examined. After topical anesthesia is applied, a disinfected eye cup of appropriate size will be placed beneath the upper eyelid. At this time, the subjects will be asked to move the eye downward to prevent scratching the cornea. The lower eyelid will then be pulled. The eye cup will be placed beneath the lower eyelid, so that it is immobilized between the eyelids and the eyeball. Distilled water will be poured into the eye cup. The contralateral eye will gaze at the red indicator light on the nasal side. An ultrasound biomicroscope (MD-300&#x000a0;L; Meda Co. Ltd., Tianjin, China) will be used. A 50 mhz transducer with 4 to 5&#x000a0;mm tissue penetration depth will be used to measure ciliary body thickness at the temporal corneoscleral limbus of the eye to be examined. The image will then be obtained. The built-in ruler will be used to measure ciliary body thickness (vertical distance) 2&#x000a0;mm behind the scleral spur
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The position of the bilateral temporal side (nine points in the right eye, three points in the left eye) will be measured once manually and the results will be recorded. The same instrument will be used for all measurements. The measurement of ciliary body thickness in this research will be completed by one full-time physician, using a fixed instrument, in a fixed place. The physician will not participate in visual acuity examinations or acupuncture treatment, and the specific details of the subjects will not be disclosed to the physician.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Data management</title><p>An electronic CRF will be designed on the Research Manager (Clinical Trial Management Public Platform, Chengdu, China) clinical trials public management platform.

An acupoint is the site where the <italic>qi</italic> of the viscera is transferred and concentrated&#x02019;
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]; the meridian is the pathway for the body surface to connect and interact with the internal organs; and the acupuncture point is a specific point on the meridians, forming a special functional relationship with the corresponding viscera and the related surface structure through the meridians. Stimulation of the acupuncture point can have a specific treatment effect. Therefore, traditional Chinese medicine purports that &#x02018;the meridian circulation is closely related to the amount of meridian <italic>qi</italic> concentrated&#x02019;
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Acupuncture treatment has a clinical effect, and acts on specific meridians and collaterals and specific acupuncture points
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Some studies suggested that acupuncture at visual-related acupoints could modulate optical physiology
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Acupuncture points are specific, but in a relative sense
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Therefore, in the proposed study the local points (Cuanzhu, Tongziliao, Sibai, Muchuang, and Hegu) will be acupunctured simultaneously, and the clinical efficacy of acupuncture treatment in adolescent mild-to-moderate myopia will be determined.</p><p>The advantages of the proposed study will be four-fold. Firstly, Cuanzhu, Tongziliao, Sibai, Muchuang, and Hegu will be acupunctured to study the specific efficacy and safety of acupuncture in adolescent mild-to-moderate myopia. Secondly, the acupuncturist involved in the proposed study will have more than 10&#x000a0;years of experience in clinical acupuncture. The acupuncture procedure in all subjects in the experimental group will be carried out by the acupuncturist, which will ensure consistency of acupuncture treatment. Thirdly, the subjects will mainly be children from a primary school near the hospital, which will help to ensure regular follow-up visits and examinations of the subjects. Fourthly, previous clinical experience has shown that acupuncture treatment of adolescent simple myopia has almost no side effects.</p><p>The limitations of the proposed study are three-fold. Firstly, due to a limited budget, the proposed study will not be a multicenter trial, which will influence the external validity of the conclusions. Secondly, common fake acupuncture methods include neighboring sham acupuncture, non-specific site acupuncture, superficial acupuncture, minimal acupuncture, and a placebo needle; all of these methods could be used as a control, but with obvious deficiencies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Therefore, in the proposed study a sham acupuncture group will not be included. Quantitative, objective indices, such as diopter, AL, lens thickness, and ciliary body thickness will be selected as the outcomes to evaluate the clinical efficacy at a reduced bias. Thirdly, in the proposed study, 100 cases will be included and followed up on for six months. To prevent bias caused by loss-to-follow-up, the following measures will be adopted: first, the subjects will be from an elementary school near the hospital. Second, before the subjects are entered into the proposed study, their guardians will fully understood the specific requirements of the follow-up schedule, as outlined in the informed consent form. Once the subjects are included in the study, communication with the guardians will be strengthened by phone calls or email. The subjects will be informed of the follow-up examination time and place in advance. The subjects will receive the follow-up examination immediately after arriving.</p><p>This will be a randomized, parallel controlled trial, and it is anticipated that acupuncture treatment of adolescent mild-to-moderate myopia will be shown to be safe and effective. The proposed study will demonstrate the specificity of the meridians and acupuncture points and provide evidence-based medical evidence on the use of acupuncture to treat myopia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Trial status</title><p>The first participant was included on 27 November 2013 and to date, six participants have been recruited.
