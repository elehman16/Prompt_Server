Adolescents allocated to the intervention found it easy, quick and informative, but were divided on the credibility of the feedback provided (agreed it was credible: 44.4%, disagreed: 16.7%, unsure: 16.7%, no response: 22.2%). We found no evidence of a statistically significant relationship between which interventions adolescents were allocated to and which interventions staff thought they received. Alcohol consumption, and health and social services data were largely incomplete due to modest study retention rates of 47.7% and 40.9% at 1- and 3&#x02009;months post-intervention, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>A computer-based intervention was acceptable to adolescents and delivery was feasible in the ED in terms of time to use and ease of use. However, adjustments are needed to the intervention to improve its credibility. A definitive RCT will be feasible if protocol adjustments are made to improve recruitment and retention rates; and increase the number of study sites and research staff.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>clinicaltrials.gov NCT01146665</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Paediatric A&#x00026;E and ambulatory care</kwd><kwd>substance misuse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Norlien Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010090</institution-id><institution>Women and Children&#x02019;s Health Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This trial provided important information regarding the feasibility and acceptability of a computer-based intervention for alcohol-related emergency department visits.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The assessment of intervention credibility was novel to our study.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Unintended disruption to the randomisation scheme created an imbalance between the control and experimental group allocation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The retention rates at 1- and 3&#x02009;month follow-up were modest.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec id="s1"><title>Background</title><p>Alcohol use escalates rapidly during adolescence,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and can have long-lasting adverse effects on adolescent health and well-being.

The Research Ethics Boards at each site approved the study.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Eligibility and recruitment</title><p>Between August 1, 2010 and February 28, 2013, research assistants (RAs) at each study site identified patients who presented to the ED with an alcohol-related chief complaint using an ED computer tracking system that indicated the reason for each patient&#x02019;s visit, or by direct referral from ED staff (nurses or attending physicians) that identified the visit was alcohol-related. RA schedules for recruitment were site specific; generally, peak hours for alcohol-related presentations were targeted (eg, between 1pm and 11pm, Friday to Monday). Adolescents aged 12 to 17 years were eligible for the study if they reported drinking alcohol prior to ED visit and/or had a positive laboratory result for alcohol in their medical record (ie, positive Blood Alcohol Content; BAC).</p><p>Adolescents were ineligible for study participation if they: (1) required hospital admission (ie, were medically or psychiatrically unstable), (2) were unable to speak or understand English, (3) were currently enrolled in a treatment programme for alcohol use, (4) did not have the capacity to give informed consent as determined by their attending physician (eg, ongoing intoxication, violent), or (5) did not have regular access to a telephone (necessary for outcome measurement after the ED visit).</p><p>Adolescents who were not accompanied by a parent/guardian, but who were considered by attending ED physicians to be mature minors (ie, mature enough to consent to their medical care), were eligible for enrolment if they otherwise met study eligibility requirements. Adolescents who were not considered mature minors were eligible for enrolment if they assented to study participation and had a consenting parent or guardian. Adolescents who were accompanied by a non-guardianship adult (eg, group home worker) but were not considered mature minors were unable to participate in the study.</p><p>We originally intended to exclude adolescents who reported other drug use and within the 24&#x02009;hours prior to ED presentation (eg, cannabis), but removed this exclusion criterion 1&#x02009;month after study start when we identified a concern from RAs that adolescents were reluctant to disclose other drug use during the screening process for the research study, and declined further screening to determine study eligibility. Removal of this criterion reduced the concern that we were not able to accurately identify or exclude those youth who had used other substances just prior to ED visit. We also felt that this change would not compromise the study&#x02019;s protocol or objectives. At the time of this protocol change, nine adolescents had been deemed ineligible for study enrolment due to report of other drug use or declining to disclose.</p><p>Eligible adolescents deemed capable of providing informed consent/assent by the attending physician (ie, no longer intoxicated), and (if present) a parent/guardian were approached by the RA in their assigned, private ED room to determine interest in study participation and confirm eligibility. The RA obtained informed consent from mature minor adolescents or a legal guardian with assent from the adolescent. Accompanying legal guardians were asked to provide privacy by leaving the ED room during actual study participation, after consent had been obtained.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Randomisation was performed after consent/assent and baseline data had been collected. Participants were assigned in a 1 to 1 allocation to either experimental or control group using a computer-generated randomisation schedule activated by logging into the study website. There was no stratification or planned restriction (eg, permuted blocks).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Blinding</title><p>Researchers and participants were blinded to allocation.

Attending physicians, nurses, and RAs were blinded to intervention assignment to reduce impact on usual clinical treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Experimental group: Computer-based SBIRT</title><p>To reduce impact on usual clinical treatment, the computer-based SBIRT intervention was delivered to adolescents after medical examinations/care associated with the ED visit were complete. The intervention was a customised version of the Check Your Drinking tool (CYD; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.checkyourdrinking.net">www.checkyourdrinking.net</ext-link>). The CYD tool has been previously evaluated in several RCTs involving young adult and adult drinkers.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34&#x02013;37</xref> We used an iPad to deliver the intervention to facilitate ease of use at the adolescent&#x02019;s bedside; each iPad used a data plan for Internet access. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT; 10 items),<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> was embedded into the CYD tool to assess drinking patterns, alcohol dependence, and alcohol-related consequences.</p><p>The CYD tool used the adolescent&#x02019;s self-reported drinking patterns to generate personalised assessment feedback, a type of brief intervention based on normative feedback.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x000a0;Personalised assessment feedback included: (i) <italic>Gender- and age-specific referents:</italic> A summary of the adolescent&#x02019;s weekly alcohol consumption was compared with gender- and age-matched referents.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Age referents were only available for ages 15&#x02013;17 years, so 14&#x02009;year old participants were provided with an explanation that their behaviours had been compared with older adolescents. (ii) <italic>Impact of alcohol consumption:</italic> Based on reported quantity and frequency of drinking, estimated financial costs of this consumption and caloric intake were calculated. A dose-response chart was also generated to highlight the likelihood of alcohol-related consequences, and a summary of adolescent reported consequences related to alcohol in the past year were presented as well as a general summary on the risks associated with alcohol use (eg, accidents, exposure to violence). (iii) <italic>Referral to resources:</italic> The intervention concluded with the provision of locally relevant, youth oriented mental health/addiction resources for problematic drinking (ie, for patients interested in specialty treatment services). Adolescents had the option to e-mail themselves a copy of the intervention&#x02019;s feedback. The time required to complete the intervention was 3&#x02013;5&#x02009;min (2&#x02009;min to administer&#x000a0;+1&#x02013;3&#x02009;min to review feedback).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Control group: Computer-based sham</title><p>The computer-based sham was also delivered post-medical care. The sham was similar in format and duration as the computer-based SBIRT, but instead, engaged adolescents in a 10-item &#x02018;eating and exercise trivia&#x02019; quiz from Kidzworld Media (kidzworld.com). Permission to deliver the quiz was obtained from Kidzworld Media prior to study start. Following each trivia question, a screen showed adolescents whether they answered the question correctly or incorrectly, and provided the correct response to each question with information explaining each response.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Study procedures</title><p>Following study enrolment, the RA collected baseline data and contact information using a paper-based form. The RA then logged into the study&#x02019;s secure website; this login activated the randomisation schedule. There was a several second delay to allow the RA to hand the study iPad to the adolescent to begin the intervention. This delay also served to blind the RA to intervention allocation. Adolescents were left alone in their ED room during the intervention, and were reassured that answers would not be disclosed to their ED care providers or parents/legal guardians accompanying them. The RA collected post-intervention data over the phone at 1- and 3&#x02009;months. Adolescents received a $10 gift card for participation in the study regardless of study completion.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Data collection</title><sec id="s2g1"><title>Study Recruitment and Retention</title><p>A study log was used by the RAs to track the number of adolescents who were screened, eligible and enrolled/not enrolled in the study, and completed post-intervention measures at 1- and 3&#x02009;months.</p></sec><sec id="s2g2"><title>Demographic and ED Visit Characteristics</title><p>Demographic data (age, sex), date of the ED visit, BAC (if available), and information on whether other substances had been used prior to ED presentation were collected by the RA from the adolescent&#x02019;s medical record.

The RA, attending physician, and nurse completed a 1-item survey to indicate whether they thought the adolescent had been randomised to the experimental or control group. Response options were &#x02018;intervention group&#x02019; (experimental group), &#x02018;don&#x02019;t know&#x02019; or &#x02018;control group&#x02019;.

One hundred and seventeen adolescents were eligible for study participation, and of these adolescents, 44 consented and were enrolled in the study (37.6% recruitment rate). The flow of participants through the trial is described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>. Eighteen adolescents were allocated to the experimental group and received computer-based SBIRT. Twenty-six adolescents were allocated to the control group and received the computer-based sham. The imbalance between the intervention and control group allocation was due to the research team accessing the research website during the trial (January 2012) to generate intervention content for a media-related event. Each time a team member accessed the website he/she was randomly allocated to one of the two groups. Team members continued to access the website until they could generate content; thus, the randomisation sequence was disrupted as participants were enrolled. Because no interim analyses were planned, the imbalance went undetected during study conduct.

acceptability to determine the feasibility of a definitive RCT of the effectiveness of a computer-based brief intervention in the ED. Three key lessons were learnt from conducting this pilot study: (1) The computer-based SBIRT intervention was acceptable to adolescents and feasible to deliver in the ED, but adjustments to the intervention are needed to improve the credibility of the personalised assessment feedback in the intervention. (2) A definitive RCT to test the effectiveness of the intervention is feasible if protocol adjustments are made to improve recruitment and retention rates, and increase the number of study sites and research staff. (3) The primary outcome for the definitive trial should be alcohol-related consequences so that the trial is measuring the outcome considered by ED clinicians to be most clinically important for SBIRT delivery.</p><p>Providing computer-based SBIRT is a promising strategy to address clinicians&#x02019; concerns that they have limited time, resources, support and training to address alcohol-related concerns during the ED visit.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 28</xref> Computer-based SBIRT may also standardise care so that ineffective approaches (eg, cautionary appeals) are avoided. The fact that 50% of adolescents in this pilot study reported a prior history of accessing services for alcohol use reinforces the need for a more comprehensive approach to the management of youth who present to the ED with an alcohol-related chief complaint. Results suggest that adolescents found SBIRT to be informative, and that computer-delivery required little time. However, because adolescents were divided on the credibility of the normative feedback provided by the intervention (the brief intervention component of SBIRT), the approach we took for intervention delivery requires reconsideration. In this pilot study, we adopted a self-led approach; that is, adolescents undertook SBIRT without interacting with attending physicians and/or nurses. For the planned definitive RCT, we propose that ED clinicians be involved in the delivery of computer-based SBIRT. Whether it is physician, nursing or specialised mental health staff, clinician involvement would provide an opportunity for adolescents to discuss the normative feedback and for clinicians to address any questions or concerns about the feedback. These discussions, in turn, may reinforce the credibility of the feedback. That some adolescents in this study delayed or did not seek services because of negative feelings and/or the sensitivity of the topic necessitates that clinicians be aware of these barriers to healthcare seeking when interacting with adolescents.</p><p>With the experimental group of the definitive trial proposed as &#x02018;ED clinician delivery of computer-based SBIRT during routine care&#x02019;, we believe that the most appropriate comparator is &#x02018;ED clinician delivery of routine ED care&#x02019; rather than a sham intervention. The sham intervention was more appropriate when computer-based SBIRT was self-led by adolescents. Thus, while this pilot study has indicated that the measures we put into place to reduce the possibility of unblinding&#x02015;computer-based randomisation with the randomisation scheme prepared by a biostatistician and the use of a sham intervention&#x02015;were effective, the definitive trial will be conducted as open-label. ED clinicians will not be blinded to allocation, as they will deliver the interventions. Enrolled adolescents will be informed that they will be taking part in a study comparing different types of alcohol care and will not be made aware of our hypothesis; however, they will be the primary outcome assessors as outcomes will be self-reported.</p><p>We also believe that the definitive trial is best conducted as a multi-site, cluster RCT. The pilot trial recruitment rate and the number of adolescents who declined trial participation (25%) indicate that increasing the number of participating EDs and RA staffing are critical to the success of a definitive trial. Due to budgetary constraints for the pilot RCT, we recruited adolescents from three pediatric EDs; however, there are 14 pediatric EDs across Canada in the Pediatric Emergency Research Canada (PERC) network. We have confirmed participation of 10 of the 14 EDs in the PERC network for the definitive trial. The trial will be designed as a cluster RCT because clinician delivery of computer-based SBIRT introduces a risk of contamination if we randomise at the patient level. In the definitive RCT, random assignment will be based on stratified clusters with month as the unit of randomisation and ED sites as strata. This approach reduces the risk of contamination bias that could be introduced by clinicians with patient level randomisation. Month is the appropriate unit of randomisation for this study as other potential choices (ED, week) will not allow us to also study SBIRT implementation in the ED sites over a sufficient time-period. Months will be randomised within strata in a 1:1 ratio to either experimental (ED clinician delivery of computer-based SBIRT during routine ED care) or control (ED clinician delivery of routine ED care) conditions. A calendar of the randomisation schedule for each ED will be provided to research staff and monitored for adherence. With randomisation now external to the website used for SBIRT delivery, we have also eliminated the potential to disrupt randomisation as we did in the pilot RCT.</p><p>With 10 EDs participating in the definitive trial, we have a much larger population to recruit from, which will address our concerns about the modest recruitment and retention rates in the pilot RCT. With respect to recruitment, in 2016, these EDs treated 976 adolescents with visits for alcohol-related concerns. Using baseline data from our pilot trial, we expect that 89% of these adolescents will screen positive for harmful and hazardous alcohol use. We will aim to enrol these adolescents into the definitive trial. In the same year, these EDs also treated 853 mental health visits that involved harmful and hazardous alcohol use. Discussions with ED clinicians representing the recruitment sites identified that these adolescents are also a preferred population for ED SBIRT delivery given the adolescents&#x02019; underlying problematic alcohol use. Thus, we will also aim to enrol these adolescents into the definitive trial. Taking these annual presentation numbers together, there are 1722 adolescents potentially eligible each year for participation in the definitive trial (~15&#x02009;eligible patients each month per ED). The sample size calculation for the definitive trial will take this information into account. Regarding retention, that the 3&#x02009;month retention rate in this pilot RCT (40.9%) was lower than what was reported in a recent efficacy trial of computer-based SBIRT (50.2%) conducted by Cunningham <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> suggests that strategies to mitigate study attrition are important for our team to consider for the definitive trial. Adolescents in the Cunningham trial received remuneration of $35 at the 3&#x02009;month follow-up time-point; use of Web links email to collect follow-up data (versus telephone follow-up) was also used.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> We will use these strategies in the definitive trial to increase study retention at follow-up.</p><p>Finally, our decision to define alcohol-related consequences as the primary outcome for the definitive trial based on ED clinician feedback is in keeping with two trials published since we designed our pilot trial, that also defined this outcome as a primary outcome of interest.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32 33</xref> In the definitive trial, we will measure alcohol-related consequences 3&#x02009;months after intervention delivery as this end-point reflects a clinically important time period (eg, a sustained effect of a brief intervention).</p><p>Of note, two additional aspects raised during the conduct of this study also need to be addressed during the design of the definitive trial. Our change in protocol to remove the exclusion criterion related to other drug use 1&#x02009;month after study start was not expected. We did not anticipate adolescents&#x02019; hesitation to disclose this use in the context of a research study. Of the nine participants who were excluded prior to the protocol change, we do not know how many were eligible for study participation as they did not answer the question on other drug use or questions that followed related to study eligibility. We also do not know of those who were eligible, how many would have agreed to participate in the study. Because we plan to study the effectiveness of the computer-based intervention in the definitive trial, we will not include this exclusion criterion in the definitive trial. A sub-group analysis will be conducted to determine whether adolescents who report poly-substance use at the time of the ED visit have different outcomes than adolescents who report only alcohol use. Second, the high percentage of missing healthcare utilisation data using the CASA suggests that an instrument with fewer items (the CASA asks&#x000a0;&#x0003e;100 questions) is needed if we are to study this outcome in a definitive trial. While trials of computer-based SBIRT have not examined healthcare utilisation,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32 33</xref> other measures do exist.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results from this pilot RCT indicate that a definitive RCT to assess the effectiveness of computer-based SBIRT in an adolescent population may be feasible in a Canadian context. Adolescents found SBIRT to be informative and that computer-delivery required little time. Adjustments to SBIRT delivery are necessary, however, to address concerns about intervention credibility. Increasing the number of recruiting pediatric EDs, putting measures into place to reduce study attrition at outcome measurement time-points, and re-examining outcome measures to reduce participant burden are also important to consider in the design of a future trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e310" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-015423.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e311" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-015423.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was conducted with the Pediatric Emergency Research Canada (PERC) network.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> Dr Newton conceptualised and designed the study, obtained funding for the study and supervised the study, acquired the data, analysed and interpreted the data, helped draft the initial manuscript, critically revised the manuscript for important intellectual content, and approved the final manuscript as submitted.
