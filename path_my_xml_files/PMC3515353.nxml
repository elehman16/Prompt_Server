Generalised fatigue has a major impact on walking ability, with moderately disabled PWMS experiencing difficulty in walking extended distances. Localised motor fatigue in the ankle dorsiflexors can lead to foot drop, further reducing functional ambulation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a simple dynamic dorsiflexion assist orthosis on walking-induced fatigue, gait, balance and functional mobility in PWMS.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A randomised cross-over trial will be conducted with 40 community dwelling PWMS with mild to moderate mobility disability. Participants will initially be screened for disease severity, balance, strength, depression and fatigue at the South Australian Motion Analysis Centre. On two non-consecutive occasions, within two weeks, participants will undergo either the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) or the 6MWT while wearing a dorsiflexion ankle orthosis (with a randomised condition order). Distance walked, perceived exertion, perceived fatigue and the physiological cost of walking (the primary outcome measures) will be compared between the two walking conditions. Additional pre- and post-6MWT assessments for the two conditions will include tests of strength, reaction time, gait and balance.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will increase our understanding of motor fatigue on gait and balance control in PWMS and elucidate the effect of a Dynamic Ankle Orthosis on fatigue-related balance and gait in PWMS. It will also examine relationships between mobility and balance performance with perceived fatigue levels in this group.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration Number</title><p>ACTRN12612000218897</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Multiple sclerosis</kwd><kwd>Fatigue</kwd><kwd>Gait</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>People with Multiple Sclerosis (PWMS) have difficulties with gait and balance that can significantly limit activities of daily living and may increase the risk of falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Disruption to central nervous system integration of proprioception, visual and vestibular sensory information are all likely to contribute to balance problems and fall risk in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Perceived levels of fatigue are also associated with balance problems and falls in PWMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], while exercise-induced fatigue has been shown to reduce balance control in a backward leaning task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Changes to gait can be detected early in the disease course, even in PWMS without any mobility limitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In fact, early gait and balance changes can be detected in PWMS who have no pyramidal signs or clinical disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These changes may be, in part, due to lower limb motor fatigue, which is commonly reported in PWMS and appears to worsen with increasing walking distance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. A previous study showed no significant kinematic variability in gait with fatigue in a mildly disabled group of PWMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, fatigue related changes in gait variability may become apparent in PWMS with more severe disability levels. As with generalized fatigue in MS, our current understanding of motor fatigue is limited. Ankle dorsifexors are particularly susceptible to the effects of motor fatigue, with both central and peripheral neuromuscular alterations contributing to fatigue-related weakness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>In rehabilitation, treatments addressing dorsiflexion weakness during gait can include specific dorsiflexor exercise and/or prescription of an Ankle Foot Orthoses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. To date, studies have been unable to indicate the effectiveness of these orthoses in improving ambulation in PWMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Static and dynamic ankle foot orthoses have been shown to improve static balance, but impair dynamic balance when walking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The Dorsiflexor Assist Orthosis (DAO) (Foot Up, Ossur&#x000a9;) differs from standard ankle orthoses as it dynamically assists the foot into dorsifexion with an elastic strap without affecting the sensory input of the foot inside the shoe.</p><p>Moderately disabled ambulatory PWMS who have mobility difficulties that impact on their ability to undertake daily activities often seek outpatient or community physiotherapy with the aim of improving or maintaining mobility levels, but unfortunately, there is limited evidence to inform clinicians with regard to best practice in this area. The aim of this study, therefore, is to evaluate the effect of a possible therapeutic device (i.e. a DAO) on the six-minute walk test (6MWT), walking efficiency and perceived levels of fatigue and exertion. The 6MWT was selected as the fatiguing condition as it has been evaluated in PWMS as a measure of functional capacity and because PWMS have reduced 6MWT distance when compared with controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In addition, we anticipate that in a moderately disabled group, the 6MWT will induce fatigue and changes to gait and balance control. We will therefore examine any deterioration in function by in gait patterns, balance and tests of motor function following walking the 6MWT with and without the DAO.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>A randomised cross-over trial will be conducted with 40 community-dwelling PWMS (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Randomised cross-over trial design.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2377-12-27-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Participants will be recruited from the MS Society of South Australia, the multidisciplinary MS Clinic at Repatriation General Hospital (RGH) and from private physiotherapy clinics in South Australia.

The participant will be instructed to step on to the corresponding illuminated plate as quickly as possible, using their left foot for the targets to the left and to the front left, and their right for the targets to their right and front right. Reaction times for (i) time to lift the foot from the base plate and (ii) time to land the foot on target plate will be recorded. Each plate will be presented 5 times, and sufficient time will be given between each trial to re-establish balance and minimise fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Standing balance</title><p>Standing balance will be measured while participants stand on two AMTI force plates.

Standard deviation measures were estimated from previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The difference in 6MWT distance was based on the rationale that a clinically meaningful increase in metres walked by MS patients in this test is 100&#x02009;m (i.e. the difference reported between Mild MS and Moderate MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]). These analyses indicated that a sample size of 35 would be appropriate for the study design. An additional 5 participants will be recruited to allow for possible dropouts.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Initially we will examine the frequency distributions, percentages and calculate means and standard deviations (mean +/&#x02212;SD) for the outcome measures. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to determine differences in the outcome measures with time and DAO condition as factors. Finally, we will examine associations between 6MWT and measures of fatigue (FSS, MFIS VAS-F &#x00026; Borg RPE), EDSS scores and Postural Sway data with Pearson correlations. The data will be analysed with the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software.</p><p>We will adjust for other possible confounding variables by using a covariance analysis. Multiple regression analysis will be used to examine significant, independent predictors of 6MWT distance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will examine the use of a novel ankle dorsiflexion assisting device (DAO) on walking performance in people with moderate MS and determine potential beneficial effects on walking induced changes in fatigue, gait patterns, strength, balance and reaction time. Ambulation distance has historically been a key measure of functional status and disability in PWMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. A recent multidisciplinary consensus conference in 2007, with the Consortium of MS Centres in the USA, agreed that rehabilitation professionals need to improve their understanding of gait and fatigue outcome measures used in MS rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>While it is known that PWMS have reduced mobility, impaired balance and higher fatigue levels compared with healthy controls, the complex interaction between these factors is not well understood. PWMS have a reduced 6MWT performance compared to healthy controls, and it is important to identify the changes in fatigue, gait, balance and motor function that result in this reduced mobility as this may identify key modifiable targets for rehabilitation. These targets may include either exercise and/or timely use of specific orthoses to maximise functional mobility while reducing the risk of falls. We believe this detailed study design will allow us to further determine what kinematic and kinetic changes are associated with prolonged walking in PWMS, providing a more detailed understanding of complex movement dysfunctions such as spasticity and localised motor fatigue. This may also help in designing individualised orthoses aimed at maximising mobility without compromising balance control. In addition we hope to deepen our knowledge of perceived fatigue and physiological performance associated with mobility.</p><p>It is likely a rehabilitation approach that uses exercises that address aspects of strength and skilled recruitment of muscles involved in walking and dynamic balance may need to be combined with individually prescribed orthoses in order to maximise mobility for PWMS. Our ability to analyse gait and balance becomes increasingly important when considering recent therapeutic advancements that have been shown to reduce clinical progression, improve disability and increase ambulation levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. This is an important step for future research directed towards evaluating targeted interventions for improving balance and mobility and reducing fatigue in PWMS.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>PWMS: People with Multiple Sclerosis; 6MWT: Six-Minute Walk Test; DAO: Dynamic Ankle Orthosis; RGH: Repatriation General Hospital; EDSS: Expanded Disability Status Scale; MS: Multiple Sclerosis; BMI: Body Mass Index; FSS: Fatigue Severity Scale; MFIS: Modifies Fatigue Impact Scale; BDI-FS: Beck Depression Inventory- Fast Scale; MSWS-12: Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale; RPE: Rating of Perceived Exertion; VAS-F: Visual Analogue Scale for Fatigue; CSRT: Choice Stepping Reaction Time; PASS: Power Analysis and Sample Size; ANOVA: Analysis of Variance.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing Interests</title><p>The Physiological Profile Assessment (FallScreen) is commercially available through Neuroscience Research Australia.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>JMcL SL DS and MC conceived the idea.
