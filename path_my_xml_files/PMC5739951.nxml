All procedures were conducted at a single site: The Weight Control and Diabetes Research Center (WCDRC) of The Miriam Hospital/Brown Alpert Medical School in Providence RI, USA. Participants were recruited from community and clinical settings via multiple methods (e.g., direct mailing of study brochures to the target demographic, newspaper advertisements, Internet/social media postings) between 11/2012 and 6/2016. Advertisements were targeted to women 18&#x02013;50 years old, who had migraine and obesity, and sought instruction in behavioral headache management strategies. Women who contacted the WCDRC and were declared initially eligible after a telephone screening interview were invited to an in-person orientation during which the study objective (i.e. testing whether the BWL and ME interventions help alleviate migraine attacks) and procedures were explained in detail. Participants then completed informed consent, had migraine diagnosis confirmed by a study neurologist, underwent height and weight measurement, completed questionnaires, and received a smartphone equipped with a diary application to record headache activity for 28 days. Following the headache monitoring period, participants returned the smartphone to the WCDRC and received their treatment assignment. Identical procedures occurred at post-treatment (16&#x02013;20 weeks) and follow-up (32&#x02013;36 weeks). Outcomes assessors were blinded to intervention assignment.

With respect to the latter, participants did not practice any strategies in group sessions nor were instructed to practice outside of sessions. Additionally, ME did not provide BWL-specific information or strategies to minimize potential of weight loss.

Linear mixed effects models incorporating a restricted maximum likelihood approach were used to estimate and conduct between-groups comparisons of the primary outcome (change in headache days/month) and secondary outcomes (change in weight and indices of migraine severity) at post-treatment and follow-up. Time was represented in the model via a binary variable coded 0 for post-treatment and 1 for follow-up. Baseline values of the outcome were entered as a covariate. In the first step of analysis, unconditional models were used to evaluate variance components associated with intercepts (change in the outcome at post-treatment) and slopes (rate of change in the outcome from post-treatment to follow-up). In the second step of analysis, intercepts were treated as random effects; treatment condition was added to the model using a variable coded 0 for ME and 1 for BWL and to interact with the effect of time; and age, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White versus all others), level of education (at least some post-high school education versus all others), and marital status (married versus not married) were entered as covariates. This intent-to-treat approach allowed all available data to be included in the analysis. Tests of significance were two-tailed with alpha=.05.

Contrary to the primary hypothesis, changes in migraine headache frequency at post-treatment and follow-up were not significantly different between the BWL and ME control interventions. Rather, both BWL and ME had significant reductions in monthly migraine headache days from baseline to post-treatment and follow-up, but the improvements were comparable in the 2 conditions. A similar pattern of findings occurred for the other indices of migraine severity.</p><p id="P28">Although BWL lost more weight compared to ME, which gained weight on average, there is no evidence that this greater weight loss led to greater migraine improvements. This might owe to mean BWL weight change (&#x02212;3.8 kg or 3.3% weight loss) being suboptimal&#x02014;i.e. falling below the clinically relevant five percent (~5 kg) threshold.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> It is possible that migraine and its psychological and behavioral sequelae might interfere with ability to lose weight or adhere to behavioral prescriptions.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Pain intensity, regardless of pain type, is associated with poorer weight loss outcomes after BWL intervention.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> High calorie, palatable foods might aid in pain coping, possibly undermining adherence to dietary prescriptions focused on energy intake and dietary quality.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Migraine attacks might also reduce available time to engage in PA or contribute to avoidance of PA in general.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Research to understand barriers to BWL treatment in patients with migraine is needed.</p><p id="P29">However, speculation that larger weight losses after BWL might have produced superior migraine improvements compared to ME is tempered when results are placed in the context of previous uncontrolled studies examining association of weight loss and migraine improvements. For example, this investigative team previously reported a comparatively smaller mean reduction of 1.5 migraine days/month after substantially larger mean weight losses (30.2 kg) achieved via bariatric surgery.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Another study reported a mean reduction of 3.1 migraine days/month (similar to the current study) in adolescents after a 12-month BWL intervention and a mean weight loss of 7 kg.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> These findings showing migraine improvements of similar or lesser magnitude after weight losses that are larger than those achieved after the BWL intervention in the current study suggest that additional mechanisms related to or apart from weight loss might also underlie BWL-related improvements.</p><p id="P30">Moreover, the fact that significant migraine improvements of a similar magnitude occurred after BWL and ME suggests that these treatments may operate through different mechanisms. Notably, special precautions were taken to ensure that migraine was not discussed during BWL and BWL strategies were not discussed during ME. It is conceivable that BWL effects are mediated through both weight loss and related improvements in proposed physiological (e.g., inflammation), psychological (e.g., depression), and behavioral (e.g., PA) factors underlying the migraine-obesity link.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> By contrast, ME effects might be mediated by increased knowledge of migraine (i.e. causes, triggers, treatments) and related improvements in factors such as headache management self-efficacy.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Both BWL and ME might be mediated by increased perceptions of emotional social support resulting from engagement with a group of individuals who all experience the adverse impact of migraine on daily life.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> However, it is unlikely that all of the effect can be attributed to group dynamics given that patients who lose weight via bariatric surgery also experience reduction in migraine.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Finally, although a significant study strength was comparison of BWL to an equally intensive ME condition, the lack of a non-intervention control group limits ability to rule out other explanations for migraine improvements after BWL or ME such as repeated assessments over time and regression to the mean. Given potential mechanistic differences between BWL and ME, future research should examine whether integration of these interventions produces greater migraine improvements than either intervention alone and/or no intervention.</p><sec id="S26" sec-type="methods"><title>Study Strengths and Limitations</title><p id="P31">This study involves the first RCT to test the immediate and sustained effects of BWL as a treatment for migraine in women of reproductive age, who are considered most affected by obesity-related migraine risk.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Moreover, the inclusion of additional procedures to enhance rigor and minimize bias (e.g., in near real-time, naturalistic daily headache assessment and strategies to optimize protocol adherence and limit therapist effects) advances previous uncontrolled investigations of weight loss treatments for migraine.</p><p id="P32">This study also has certain limitations. Study participants reflect a highly selective sample. Given that the study was limited to women with migraine of a certain age who met strict headache and weight-related inclusion criteria, it is unclear whether similar outcomes would be observed in individuals who are male, older, and have different headache frequencies or weight status. Despite substantial efforts to recruit and randomize the planned 140 participants, the study was terminated at the end of the funding period with 110 participants randomized, potentially limiting power to detect smaller effects as statistically significant. Although efforts were made to ensure that the BWL intervention did not address migraine, the possibility of expectancy effects regarding migraine improvements cannot be ruled out given BWL participants&#x02019; awareness that the study was intended to test effects of BWL on migraine frequency and severity. Finally, given previous research showing a relationship between obesity and risk of having migraine, studies are also needed to determine whether behavioral intervention can prevent migraine by preventing weight gain and sustaining a healthy weight.<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S27"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P33">This study compared the effects of BWL and ME on headache frequency in women aged 18&#x02013;50 with comorbid migraine and overweight/obesity. Significant improvements in migraine frequency were demonstrated after both BWL and ME and sustained at follow-up, but no differences between these conditions were observed at either time point. Future research is needed to better understand treatment mechanisms and whether BWL can enhance effects of standard pharmacologic and/or non-pharmacologic migraine therapies in patients with comorbid overweight/obesity.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S29"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (R01 NS077925; PI: Bond)</p><p>The authors wish to thank Mrs. Jennifer Trautvetter (BA) and Ms. Krystal DeFaria (MS), for their assistance in intervention implementation and data collection, and the WHAM patients for their participation and commitment to this trial.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="FN2"><p>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01197196</p></fn><fn id="FN3" fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author Contributions:</bold></p><p><italic>Conception and design:</italic> DSB, JGT, RBL, JR, JMP, LR, RRW</p><p><italic>Acquisition of data:</italic> DSB, JGT, JR, KCO, EWE, RRW</p><p><italic>Statistical analysis:</italic> JGT</p><p><italic>Data interpretation:</italic> All</p><p><italic>Drafting the manuscript:</italic> DSB, JGT</p><p><italic>Revising manuscript for intellectual content:</italic> All</p><p><italic>Final approval of the completed manuscript:</italic> All</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="FN4"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest</bold></p><p>Dr. Bond is funded by grants from the NIH (R01 NS077925, R42 DK103537, R01 DK108579, R01 DK112487, and R01 DK112585) and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (HHSA2092015000021).
