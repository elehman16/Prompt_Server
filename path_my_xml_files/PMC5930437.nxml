Systematic reviews of quality improvement interventions show that such approaches can be effective but there is wide variability between trials and little understanding concerning what explains this variability. A national cohort study of primary care across 99 UK practices identified modifiable predictors of healthcare professionals&#x02019; prescribing, advising and foot examination.</p><p id="Par2">Our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of an implementation intervention to improve six guideline-recommended health professional behaviours in managing type 2 diabetes in primary care: prescribing for blood pressure and glycaemic control, providing physical activity and nutrition advice and providing updated diabetes education and foot examination.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par3">Two-armed cluster randomised trial involving 44 general practices. Primary outcomes (at 12 months follow-up): from electronic medical records, the proportion of patients receiving additional prescriptions for blood pressure and insulin initiation for glycaemic control and having a foot examination; and from a patient survey of a random sample of 100 patients per practice, reported receipt of updated diabetes education and physical activity and nutrition advice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par4">The implementation intervention did not lead to statistically significant improvement on any of the six clinical behaviours. 1,138,105 prescriptions were assessed. Intervention (29% to 37% patients) and control arms (31% to 35%) increased insulin initiation relative to baseline but were not statistically significantly different at follow-up (IRR 1.18, 95%CI 0.95&#x02013;1.48). Intervention (45% to 53%) and control practices (45% to 50%) increased blood pressure prescription from baseline to follow-up but were not statistically significantly different at follow-up (IRR 1.05, 95%CI 0.96 to 1.16). Intervention (75 to 78%) and control practices (74 to 79%) increased foot examination relative to baseline; control practices increased statistically significantly more (OR 0.84, 95%CI 0.75&#x02013;0.94). Fewer patients in intervention (33%) than control practices (40%) reported receiving updated diabetes education (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.74, 95%CI 0.57&#x02013;0.97). No statistically significant differences were observed in patient reports of having had a discussion about nutrition (intervention&#x02009;=&#x02009;73%; control&#x02009;=&#x02009;72%; OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.98, 95%CI 0.59&#x02013;1.64) or physical activity (intervention&#x02009;=&#x02009;57%; control&#x02009;=&#x02009;62%; OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.79, 95%CI 0.56&#x02013;1.11).

Type 2 diabetes is managed in primary care in many jurisdictions, including the North East of England, which has a 6% estimated prevalence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. There are widely agreed clinical guidelines highlighting best practice and target-based incentive schemes promoting high-quality healthcare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. While some data from the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF,&#x000a0;the UK&#x02019;s target-based incentive program) suggest diabetes care is improving, the most demanding indicators show room for improvement (e.g. blood pressure and glycaemic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]). National diabetes audits also suggest that people with diabetes are not receiving optimal healthcare: under 50% receive nine key aspects of care, with variation nationwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. There remains an imperative to support healthcare professionals in improving quality of care to support patients in achieving optimal health outcomes.</p><p id="Par8">We previously conducted a UK-wide study of 99 general practices in the UK MRC GP Research Network about their provision of care for type 2 diabetes, identifying opportunities for improvement (iQuaD study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]). Patient records were audited, and those with type 2 diabetes with a guideline-defined clinical indication for increased medication for glycaemic control and hypertension were assessed for medication alteration in the previous 25&#x000a0;months. Only 39.5% (1595/4038; 81 practices) and 58.9% (624/1059; 81 practices) of eligible patients were prescribed additional therapy for hypertension and glycaemic control, respectively. Of 29,362 patient records assessed across 86 practices, 77.1% had a foot examination. In a patient survey assessing recall of care received over the past year involving 3591 patients with type 2 diabetes, 94% reported attending their practice in the last year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Only 51% of those with a BMI over 30 reported receiving weight management advice, 68% reported receiving self-management advice, and 73% reported receiving information about diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Many factors contribute to variations in care (e.g. patient physiology, treatment response and preferences of patients and their families). However, it is also a function of barriers and enablers to healthcare professional behaviour that, if addressed, could optimize care. iQuaD identified modifiable determinants of clinical behaviours that predicted subsequent behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Practice structures of care and views about organization and team function were not strong predictors of care. However, factors including motivation, self-efficacy, action and coping planning and habit were consistently predictive of the six clinical behaviours, providing a basis for intervention development.</p><p id="Par10">Reviews of trials of quality improvement interventions for diabetes care show they can be effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, there is wide variability in effects and little understanding of what explains such variability or the theoretical and conceptual rationale for selecting intervention strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] in ways that add to those already in place (e.g. QOF).</p><p id="Par11">Many quality improvement interventions focus on a single healthcare professional behaviour. However, clinicians advise, assess, test, review, counsel, measure, prescribe and refer all in time-limited consultations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. We developed a multiple behaviour change intervention aimed at primary care health professionals to improve their management of type 2 diabetes and evaluated it in a cluster randomized controlled trial to minimize contamination. We hypothesized that more patients with type 2 diabetes in practices receiving the intervention would receive guideline-consistent prescribing, advice and foot examination than those in control practices.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p id="Par12">As described in the trial protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], we conducted a two-armed cluster randomized controlled trial. The primary care practice was the unit of randomization. The intervention was delivered to the primary care team, aiming to improve care provided by primary care health professionals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Sample size</title><p id="Par13">The trial was powered to detect differences between intervention and control practices in the six clinical behaviours, anticipating an intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.06. Sample size estimation showed that 20 patients from 40 practices were required to detect a 15% absolute improvement in any of our six clinical behaviours with 80% power at 5% significance levels. To protect against cluster-level attrition, we aimed to recruit 44 practices, providing 83.9% power to detect a 15% improvement if all practices were retained.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participants</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>General practice (clusters) recruitment and data collection</title><p id="Par14">General practices in North-East England and the general medical practitioners (GPs), nurses and healthcare assistants within them involved in providing care for type 2 diabetes participated. We excluded one practice involved in feasibility piloting. We aimed to recruit 44 practices across North-East England. Initial recruitment and contact was via research facilitators. The trial team also presented at a GP research forum. Interested practices contacted us, and we obtained written practice-level consent. We conducted phone interviews with practice contacts to assess organizational structures and identify staff involved in diabetes care. Practices randomized to the intervention were reimbursed for staff time to prepare for and attend the intervention session at an hourly staff rate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Healthcare professional recruitment and data collection</title><p id="Par15">Consent was sought from the cluster level and the general practice staff level prior to randomization. An information and consent sheet was mailed to identified GPs, nurses and healthcare assistants in each practice. We did not involve community nurses working with multiple practices to reduce contamination risk between intervention and control practices. As part of a planned process evaluation, a baseline and 12-month follow-up questionnaire was posted to GPs, nurses and healthcare assistants in all practices.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Trial patients recruitment and data collection</title><p id="Par16">We included patients 18 and older with type 2 diabetes registered in each practice. Patients were identified in computerized medical records using diabetes-identifying codes. We excluded patients under 18, with type 1 diabetes, or for whom inclusion was clinically inappropriate as judged by each primary care team.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Intervention description</title><p id="Par17">Intervention development was consistent with the UK MRC framework for complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and informed by our national study of diabetes care (iQuaD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]). We used behaviour change theory results from iQuaD to identify factors to target and included behaviour change techniques (BCTs) specified within these theories (Social Cognitive Theory, Health Action Process Approach, Dual Process Model, theory-based approaches to multiple goal pursuit) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The overarching strategy involved outreach visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] that moved beyond a knowledge and education-based approach that is more common of such interventions and instead emphasized&#x000a0;healthcare professional behaviour change and addressed&#x000a0; clinical inertia. In brief, the intervention consisted of a content expert (nurse or MD) and a behaviour change expert delivering the intervention at each of 22 individual practices. The intervention allowed practice team members to dedicate 90&#x000a0;min together to consider each of the targeted clinical behaviors and select the behaviors consistent with their current role in the practice. They considered discrepancies between personal estimates of current performance and intended levels and identified barriers and problem solved by developing if-then plans to circumvent identified barriers. They were provided with materials developed with patients with diabetes to pre-identify barriers and solutions to assist in providing physical activity and healthy eating support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. We produced short videos using trained actors presenting practice-based examples of interactions between patients and clinicians (available upon request), common barriers to initiating insulin and providing physical activity advice and possible solutions for successfully managing barriers (see online Additional&#x000a0;files&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref> for detailed intervention description).</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>Feasibility</title><p id="Par18">We conducted two feasibility tests in primary care settings. The first was delivered to medical students to assess pace and timing and identify misunderstandings. The second involved two GPs, two nurses and a healthcare assistant at one practice (excluded from trial recruitment).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Control practices</title><p id="Par19">Control practices supported outcome measure collection (patient survey at 12&#x000a0;months follow-up and access to anonymised patient records at 12&#x000a0;months follow-up); no intervention was provided. Clinicians in control practices completed questionnaires at baseline and 12-month follow-up (planned secondary analysis). We sent materials to control practices at the end of the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Primary outcomes: six clinical behaviours</title><p id="Par20">Primary outcomes were pre-specified in the protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and consistent with the UK NICE diabetes quality standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] (detailed outcome description in online Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Outcome data were collected 12&#x000a0;months after intervention delivery. For the two <italic>prescribing</italic> behaviours and <italic>foot examination</italic>, outcome data were extracted from anonymised patient electronic records for all patients meeting inclusion criteria in each practice for 12&#x000a0;months before and 12&#x000a0;months after the intervention period. While data on <italic>prescribing</italic> and <italic>foot examination</italic> were available in routinely collected data in patient electronic records, providing advice and updated diabetes education was known to not consistently be recorded in medical records [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Outcome data on providing advice on <italic>nutrition</italic> and <italic>physical activity</italic> and providing updated diabetes <italic>education</italic> were therefore collected from anonymized postal survey responses from a random sample of 100 patients with type 2 diabetes in each practice at 12&#x000a0;months follow-up; no pre-intervention data were collected for outcomes assessed with patient surveys. Patients reported whether they had received physical activity advice, nutrition advice and updated diabetes education in the preceding 12&#x000a0;months. We developed patient surveys based on our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and pilot-tested the surveys with our local Diabetes UK patient group. Practices managed processes relating to patient identification and questionnaire mailing to maintain patient anonymity to the trial team. One reminder was sent. Completed questionnaires were returned to the trial team with practice ID as the only identifier.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Randomization, allocation and concealment</title><p id="Par21">Practices were randomized 1:1 to intervention or control by the trial statistician using computer-generated random permuted blocks with practice roster (list) size as the blocking factor. The study research associate enrolled the clusters (practices). Baseline data collection (interviews and questionnaires) was completed before practices were made aware of their allocation. The study research associate assigned a unique study ID to each practice, and then, the trial statistician undertook the randomization of these IDs. The statistician and all trial team members except the trial research associate remained blind to practice allocation until the trial statistician completed the outcome analyses.</p><p id="Par22">For <italic>prescribing</italic> behaviours and <italic>foot examination</italic>, an independent outcome assessor extracted data on healthcare professional behaviours using computerized medical records and remained blind to allocation. Clinical behaviour outcomes assessed using patient surveys of care received involved administrative staff in each practice. This data collection occurred 12&#x000a0;months after the intervention was delivered, at which point it is likely that administrative staff were aware of the allocation of their practice. Patients were not aware of the allocation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Analysis</title><p id="Par23">We treated all six outcomes equivalently and hypothesized that each would show improvement in the intervention arm compared with control. To protect against type 1 error, our protocol pre-specified that the intervention should show a benefit on at least two behaviours to be regarded effective. We used different modelling approaches depending on characteristics of the data.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Prescribing for blood pressure and prescribing insulin for glycaemic control</title><p id="Par24">The number of patients prescribed was analyzed using separate Poisson regression models. The number of patients who met target for triggering insulin initiation and additional prescribing for blood pressure post-intervention was included as an exposure variable. Baseline performance (proportion of patients meeting target threshold in the 6&#x000a0;months leading up to the intervention) and practice size were included as covariates. The impact of the intervention (randomization group) was included as a fixed effect.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Examining feet</title><p id="Par25">The proportion of patients having their feet examined was analysed using a mixed effects logistic regression model. Fixed effects included the data time period (before or after the intervention) and the randomization group. Random effects took into account that patients were nested in practices. Additionally, an interaction between time period and group was included to test the effectiveness of the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Providing advice and education</title><p id="Par26">We fitted a multilevel logistic model with patients nested within practices for each of the three clinical behaviour outcomes assessed by patient questionnaire at 12&#x000a0;months. As pre-specified, all analyses adjusted for any difference between practices in terms of list (roster) size.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Cost analysis</title><p id="Par27">We compared intervention and control practices on total prescription costs for diabetes and hypertension medication, costs of diabetes-related health service use, and intervention-associated costs. Prescription costs were collected for each practice for 12&#x000a0;months pre- and 12&#x000a0;months post-intervention. We extracted data on medication name, size, dose and prescription date for all eligible patients included in the trial analyses of the primary outcomes. Diabetes and blood pressure medication costs were extracted from anonymised patient medical records in all 44 practices, consisting of 1,138,105 recorded prescriptions between 18 August 2012 and 28 February 2015. The total cost of prescriptions for diabetes and hypertension was calculated using the prescription length and cost of the medication. Medication costs were taken from the British National Formulary archive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and were deflated to 2012&#x02013;2013 prices and assumed the same rate of inflation for 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Service use and referral costs were calculated from patient questionnaire responses using costs data from the Unit Costs of Healthcare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and NHS reference costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and deflated to 2012&#x02013;2013 prices. Post-intervention service use costs were calculated as the post-intervention equivalized total cost per patient for each practice. This provides a cost per patient for each practice, accounting for practice size. Patients in each practice were allocated a mean cost for their practice. The intervention costs were provided for all intervention practices.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec20"><title>Recruitment</title><p id="Par28">We recruited 44 practices from March 2013 to November 2013 and randomized 22 to the intervention (153 GPs, nurses, and HCAs) and 22 (172 GPs, nurses, and HCAs) to the control.

First, recall-based measures are inherently limited by recall bias, though bias will be balanced across arms. Second, two control practices did not send patient questionnaires. Third, to maintain anonymity, practices were responsible for selecting a random sample of patients to whom to send questionnaires, potentially introducing selection bias. Fourth, the 51% response rate for the patient survey may suggest response bias; responding patients may have presented their healthcare providers more favourably, but this would be balanced across arms. A lower proportion of control patients (49%) returned a questionnaire than intervention (53%), though there is little reason to suspect their awareness of the intervention. Finally, as we only had post-intervention data for patient-reported outcomes, these analyses do not account for baseline.</p><p id="Par38">The main behaviour change technique targeting self-efficacy was &#x02018;demonstration of the behaviour&#x02019;, involving a video presenting a primary care clinician successfully performing the behaviour with a patient despite barriers. Due to time constraints, this was developed and presented only for prescribing for HbA<sub>1c</sub> and providing physical activity advice. The assumption that effects would generalize to the other behaviours was likely insufficient. Video coverage across all behaviours and more active techniques for building self-efficacy were planned, but feasibility testing showed it not to be feasible within 90&#x000a0;min.

Delivering interventions which bundle&#x000a0;behaviours reflects the realities of primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Indeed, trials of quality improvement interventions often target multiple behaviours, such as multiple drug prescriptions and processes of care targets. As some such interventions&#x000a0;are effective and others not, it does not seem that the number of target behaviours is necessarily an explanation for the lack of effect. Interventions in other settings suggest that targeting two behaviours concurrently is as effective as targeting them&#x000a0;in sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, there may be an inverse U-shaped curve where targeting an increasing number of behaviours may be beneficial only to a point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

Future interventions should investigate whether targeting behaviours in parallel or in sequence is equally effective.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Mechanisms and implications</title><p id="Par40">An intervention may fail to be effective for a range of reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]:</p><p id="Par41">(a) Theory selection -&#x000a0;The theoretical foundations may be inaccurate or inappropriate: This intervention was based on a foundation of research involving testing organizational, team and behaviour change theory, the latter providing consistent evidence of factors accounting for variability in healthcare provider behaviour, which served as the precursor to developing the current intervention. Future research could investigate alternative theories which may identify supplementary approaches that build on the present intervention&#x02019;s theoretical foundation. Rather than atheoretical interventions, which have a long history of scattered non-cumulative evidence, theory provides coherence and the capacity for developing a stronger, cumulative evidence-base (cf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]).</p><p id="Par42">(b) Behaviour change technique selection and operationalization -&#x000a0;techniques may be ineffective or may have been delivered at too low intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]:&#x000a0;The techniques in this intervention have a basis in empirical literature. However, it seems likely that delivery intensity (one 90-min session covering six clinical behaviours) may have been constrained by feasibility considerations and may have been insufficient.

This &#x02018;rising tide&#x02019; effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] was evidenced in the three behaviours for which we have pre- and post-data, where there was evidence that both intervention and control practices improved relative to baseline;</p><p id="Par45">(e) Recipients targeted -&#x000a0;may not be those delivering sub-optimum care: Eighty percent of invited GPs, nurses, and healthcare assistants in the intervention condition attended the intervention;</p><p id="Par46">(f) Fidelity of delivery -&#x000a0;the intervention may be poorly delivered or delivered with low fidelity to protocol:&#x000a0;We assessed fidelity of delivery by coding transcribed audio recordings of all intervention sessions and found that the intervention was delivered with high fidelity;</p><p id="Par47">(g) Evaluation time point&#x000a0;- follow-up period may be too long or too short to detect an effect: Given annual review GP visits, a 12-month follow-up was the most appropriate length of time.

While tempting, a longer intervention or more sessions did not fit within general practice availabilities and may have undermined recruitment and retention.

As healthcare organizations continue to develop, deliver and seek support to optimize care using outreach visits, there is a need to better understand which techniques are most effective, at what level of intensity within available practical constraints, for improving the multiple clinical behaviours involved in managing type 2 diabetes. Drawing on theory and evidence provides a basis for not only one-off evaluations, but also for developing a cumulative evidence base of how to optimize outreach-based intervention content. A commitment to robust and iterative effectiveness evaluation of techniques tested in outreach-based interventions can help to further ensure that an evidence base can accrue to support stakeholder decision-making.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec35"><p>
