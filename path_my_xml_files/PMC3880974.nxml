The study was performed at the Saiseikai Shimonoseki General Hospital during a 4-month period (May 2012 to September 2012). Sixty-six infertile women who had a thin endometrium (&#x0003c; 8&#x000a0;mm) during the standard CC treatment (50&#x000a0;mg/day on days 5&#x02013;9 of the menstrual cycle) were enrolled. The patients were randomly divided into three groups: 22 patients were given 25&#x000a0;mg/day CC on days 5&#x02013;9 (half-dose group), 22 patients were given 50&#x000a0;mg/day CC on days 1&#x02013;5 (early administration group) and 22 patients received a standard CC treatment again (control group).

CC has an antiestrogenic effect on the hypothalamus by binding to estrogen receptors. This stimulates a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulse that induces gonadotropin secretion from the anterior pituitary gland. CC is most commonly used as a first-line treatment of infertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, several adverse effects of the CC treatment have been recognized. One of them is a disturbance of endometrial growth by the antiestrogenic effect. In fact, endometrial thickness is significantly thinner in women taking CC than women not taking CC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Since a thin endometrium is recognized as a critical factor of implantation failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], preventing CC-induced thinning of the endometrium is important.</p><p>Since the endometrium grows by estrogen during the follicular phase, endometrial growth is impaired by antiestrogenic effects of CC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Impaired epithelial cell proliferation and delayed glandular maturation are often found in endometrial biopsies from patients treated with CC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Some reports also indicate that the number and diameter of the gland were lower in the CC treatment cycle than in the control cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. These results strongly suggest that a thin endometrium caused by the CC treatment is due to impaired endometrial growth and that this is a major cause of poor pregnancy rates in women who showed a thin endometrium by the CC treatment. Therefore, these patients receive the next step therapy such as gonadotropin therapy, which potentially causes multiple pregnancies or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).</p><p>To reduce the adverse effect of CC on endometrial growth, some clinical trials have been tested so far. Unfer et al. reported that ethinyl estradiol treatment reversed the antiestrogenic effect of CC on the endometrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. High dose of phytoestrogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and transdermal estradiol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] were also tested in clinical trials to improve endometrial thickness in patients undergoing CC treatment. However, there are no established treatments to reduce or to reverse the adverse effect of CC on the endometrium.</p><p>In this study, we focused on the dosage and timing of CC treatment. Reduced amounts of CC (half dose) may diminish the antiestrogenic effect of CC because the antiestrogenic effect of CC is dose-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, since the antiestrogenic effect of standard CC treatment continues until the late follicular phase when endometrial growth is still active, early administration of CC may reduce the adverse effect of CC on the endometrium. Therefore, this study was undertaken to investigate whether the modified CC treatments are useful to prevent a thin endometrium in patients undergoing CC treatments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study (UMIN000007959) is a prospective, randomized controlled study. The study was conducted according to guidelines as stated in the Declaration of Helsinki and the protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Saiseikai Shimonoseki General Hospital.

Endometrial thickness and follicular growth were assessed by vaginal ultrasonography [Aloka ProSound SSD-3500SV type of instrument and Aloka UST-984-5 (5.0&#x000a0;MHz) vaginal transducer, Aloka Co.

Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was administered to induce ovulation. After a longitudinal view of the uterus was obtained, the thickness of the endometrium was measured at the maximum distance between each myometrial/endometrial interface on the day of HCG injection. When endometrial thickness was less than 8&#x000a0;mm, the patient was diagnosed as having a thin endometrium based on our previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].

There were no difference in the age and causes of infertility among the three groups. The patients were non-smokers and free from major medical illness including hypertension; patients were excluded if they had myoma, adenomyosis, congenital uterine anomaly, or ovarian tumors. Patients were also excluded if they used estrogens, progesterone, androgens, or had chronic use of any medication, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents.

In fact, our preliminary study showed that 41 out of 100 women had a thin endometrium during a standard CC treatment cycle. Since a thin endometrium is a critical factor of implantation failure, we have to go to the next-step therapy such as gonadotropin therapy. Gonadotropin therapy not only burdens the patient with stress and medical expense but also can cause multiple pregnancy and OHSS. Therefore, preventing CC-induced thinning of the endometrium is important.</p><p>Our results showed that 14 out of 20 patients (70%) improved in endometrial thickness (&#x02265; 8&#x000a0;mm) by half-dose of CC. This result seems to be inconsistent with a previous report by Dickey et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] that endometrial thickness, determined on the day of HCG injection, was not related to the dose of CC (25&#x02013;250&#x000a0;mg).

The half dose CC treatment delayed follicle maturation compared with a standard CC treatment. However, the difference was modest to be permissible. Furthermore, serum progesterone levels during the mid-luteal phase did not differ between the half dose group and the control group, suggesting that luteal function is not affected by the half dose CC treatment.</p><p>Our results also clearly showed that early administration of CC improved endometrial thickness in 19 out of 21 patients (90.4%). The effect of the timing of CC administration on endometrial thickness has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Early administration of CC (100&#x000a0;mg CC; day 1&#x02013;5) showed higher endometrial thickness compared with the standard CC treatment (100&#x000a0;mg CC; day 5&#x02013;9), but it was not significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. These studies enrolled all the infertile women who showed and did not show a thin endometrium during the standard CC treatment. However, our study enrolled the women whose endometrial thickness was thin (&#x0003c;&#x02009;8&#x000a0;mm) in the standard CC treatment cycle. Because early administration of CC stimulates follicular growth before dominant or subdominant follicles are selected, it might increase the number of growing follicles. However, our result showed that the number of growing follicles (&#x02265; 15&#x000a0;mm) and mature follicles (&#x02265; 18&#x000a0;mm) was not increased by early administration of CC.</p><p>Recently, the efficacy of letrozole, which is an aromatase inhibitor, as an ovulation inducing drug has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. There is a possibility that letrozole can be used as an alternative ovulation inducing drug to prevent a thin endometrium. However, it is high cost, and further studies are needed on the safety of letrozole.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The modified CC treatments provide an alternative to proceeding to gonadotropin therapy for patients with a thin endometrium as a result of standard CC treatment. The present study provides important information to prevent thin endometrium in patients undergoing CC treatment. However, our ultimate goal of CC treatment for infertile patients is a successful pregnancy and live birth. Large scale-RCT will be necessary to evaluate the efficacy of the modified CC treatment on successful pregnancy in patients with a history of a thin endometrium caused by the standard CC regimen.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>AT designed the study and collected the data.
