magnetic stimulation can improve sensory recovery of the lower extremities in
subacute-stage spinal cord injury patients. [Subjects and Methods] This study was
conducted on 20 subjects with diagnosed paraplegia due to spinal cord injury. These 20
subjects were allocated to an experimental group of 10 subjects that underwent active
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation or to a control group of 10 subjects that
underwent sham repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. The SCI patients in the
experimental group underwent active repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and
conventional rehabilitation therapy, whereas the spinal cord injury patients in the
control group underwent sham repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and conventional
rehabilitation therapy. Participants in both groups received therapy five days per week
for six-weeks. Latency, amplitude, and sensory nerve conduction velocity were assessed
before and after the six week therapy period. [Results] A significant intergroup
difference was observed for posttreatment velocity gains, but no significant intergroup
difference was observed for amplitude or latency. [Conclusion] repetitive transcranial
magnetic stimulation may be improve sensory recovery of the lower extremities in
subacute-stage spinal cord injury patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation</kwd><kwd>Spinal cord injury</kwd><kwd>Sensory</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>When patients with spinal cord injuries have pain as an accessory symptom, training in the
activities of daily living (ADL) is affected and sometimes does not progress smoothly<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
pulses have been used as a noninvasive and painless means of stimulating the brains of
intact conscious human subjects through the scalp<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. TMS pulses were first used in patients with spinal cord injury
(SCI) in the early 1990<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> and are now used
most extensively in the corticospinal system because the output of the primary motor cortex
can be easily assessed in the form of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) using surface
electromyographic recording electrodes. rTMS can be applied as continuous trains of low
frequency (1&#x02005;Hz) or as bursts of higher frequency (&#x02265;5&#x02005;Hz). Generally, low-frequency rTMS
(stimulus rates &#x02264;1&#x02005;Hz) inhibits motor cortical excitability, leading to a reversible
&#x02018;virtual lesion&#x02019;, whereas high-frequency rTMS (5&#x02013;20&#x02005;Hz) usually promotes an increase in
cortical excitability<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Belci et al.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> first tested the efficacy of rTMS in
modulating corticospinal inhibition and improving functional recovery in four patients with
chronic incomplete (American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale D) cervical (C5
level) SCI. Perceptual thresholds for electrical stimulation of the skin, ASIA clinical
measures of motor and sensory functions, and times to complete a pegboard were found to
improve during the entire 3-week follow-up period. The activation of motor nerves due to
repetitive movements induces plastic changes in the primary somatosensory cortex<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> which indicates that sensory and motor
nerves are directly related with each other. Although it is relatively well known that
sensory nerves directly affect motor nerves, it has not been established whether motor
nerves affect sensory nerves. In this study, we hypothesized that high-frequency rTMS can
improve sensory recovery of the lower extremities in SCI patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Patients were recruited from the neurological physical therapy outpatient clinic of the
Faculty of Physical Therapy, Eulji University, after they agreed to participate in the
study. The Research Ethics Committee of Eulji University Hospital approved the study, and
all participants provided informed, written consent prior to enrollment. All patients had
been diagnosed with SCI, which was confirmed by computed tomography or magnetic resonance
imaging. Patients that met the following criteria were enrolled: (1) incomplete SCI (AIS C
or D) by trauma (traffic accident or fall), (2) cervical or thoracic SCI, and (3) time
elapsed since SCI of &#x0003c;6 months. Twenty SCI patients met the study criteria. After
completing initial assessments, the subjects were randomly assigned to an experimental group
(<italic>n</italic>=10) or a control group (<italic>n</italic>=10). For randomization,
sealed envelopes were prepared in advance and marked inside with A or B, indicating the
experimental or control group, respectively. Subjects in the experimental group received
rTMS and conventional rehabilitation therapy for a total of 50&#x02005;min (rTMS, 20&#x02005;min;
conventional rehabilitation therapy, 30&#x02005;min) per day, with a 10&#x02005;min rest period halfway
through the session. A Magstim Rapid2 (Magstim Co., Ltd., Wales, UK) and a figure-of-eight
coil with a diameter of 80&#x02005;mm were used to administer rTMS. In each patient, 1&#x02005;Hz rTMS was
applied to the hemispheric hotspot in 10 second trains, with 50 second intervals between
trains. Subjects in the experimental group received training five days per week for 6 weeks.
Conventional rehabilitation therapy consisted of neurodevelopmental facilitation techniques
and was administered by therapists unaware of the study protocol or group assignments. The
objectives of SCI rehabilitation were to improve functional abilities, such as, transfer,
ambulation, and balance, so as to help patients achieve earlier and/or greater independence.
Subjects in the control group received sham rTMS therapy and conventional rehabilitation
therapy for a total of 50&#x02005;min (sham rTMS, 20&#x02005;min, conventional rehabilitation therapy,
30&#x02005;min) per day 5days/week for 6 weeks; the subjects in both groups received therapy on the
sameday.</p><p>An electromyography/evoked potential system (Medelec, Oxford Instruments, Abingdon,
Oxfordshire, UK) was used for the sensory nerve conduction study (SNCS); stimuli were
applied at a position 10&#x02005;cm above the lateral malleolus, and SNCS was conducted at the sural
nerve in the lateral malleolus region. Stimuli were administered at 2&#x02005;Hz to 10 kHz and an
intensity of 10 to 20 mA, and the time was 0.5 sec<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Intragroup comparisons of variables before and after training were
made using the paired t test, whereas intergroup comparisons were performed using the
independent t-test. IBM SPSS Statistics ver. 20.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for
statistical analysis, and p values of &#x0003c;0.05 were considered significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A summary of the clinical and demographic features of the sample (n=20) is provided in

increases primary motor cortex excitability has been well established. Summers et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> reported when high-frequency rTMS was
applied to the primary motor cortex, sensory and pain threshold values increased in normal
adults and in patients with central or peripheral nerve damage. However, the mechanism
responsible for sensory nerve network reactions induced by stimulating the motor cortex has
not been clearly identified. Repeated administration of rTMS pulses can induce long-lasting
changes in the excitabilities of the corticospinal tract, M1, and spinal cord structures and
result in significant improvements in aspects of sensory and motor functions in patients
with motor disorde<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The present study
was conducted to investigate the effect of active rTMS on sensory recovery of the lower
extremities in patients with subacute SCI. According to our results, the SNCV was more
enhanced after the intervention in the experimental group than in the control group.
Furthermore, active rTMS was found to be more effective at improving sensory recovery than
sham treatment. rTMS could reduce corticospinal inhibition and thus induce motor
improvements in SCI, and it is possible that motor score improvements induced by rTMS in SCI
could be due to enhancement of descending corticospinal projections and reductions in
corticospinal inhibition<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Notably, Caria
et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> reported a direct relation
between motor and sensory nerves. Ragert et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that 5&#x02005;Hz rTMS induced sustained increases of
somatosensory cortex excitability, and Pleger et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> found that rTMS of the somatosensory cortex improved tactile
discrimination and enhanced somatosensory cortex activation and that changes in primary
motor cortex were negatively correlated with gains in discrimination ability. These results
support the notion that rTMS augments sensory recovery in subacute -stage patients when they
are treated within 6 months of SCI<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The present study has some limitations.
First, the small sample size may have adversely influenced the analysis and impacted our
results, and thus, our findings cannot be generalized to all SCI patients. Second, the
absence of follow-up after the end of the active rTMS prevented determination of the
durability of the effects of this intervention. Further studies, including a long-term
follow-up assessment, are needed to evaluate the long-term benefits of rTMS.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Suyama</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Takahashi</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Shibuta</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Pain and rehabilitation in patients with spinal cord
