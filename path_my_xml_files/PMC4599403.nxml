Supervised treadmill exercise improves walking endurance in people with PAD.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> However, most PAD patients do not participate in supervised treadmill exercise.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> This is likely because most medical insurance companies do not pay for supervised treadmill exercise in people with PAD and because traveling to an exercise facility for regular supervised exercise is burdensome.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Interventions that promote exercise outside of a supervised setting and are tailored to the individual could be effective and convenient therapy for patients with PAD. Interventions that promote unsupervised exercise at home should be more accessible and acceptable to PAD patients than supervised exercise because unsupervised exercise at home is relatively inexpensive and does not require travel to an exercise facility 3 times weekly.</p><p>Walking-related ischemic leg pain makes consistent adherence to walking exercise programs challenging for PAD patients. This may be particularly true in an unsupervised setting without encouragement from a coach. Small studies completed in the late 20th century suggested that home-based walking exercise programs had unclear or no efficacy for improving walking performance in PAD.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> An uncontrolled 6-month trial from the Netherlands showed significant improvement in treadmill walking time in PAD patients who were referred to a physical therapy program that provided supervised treadmill exercise 2 to 3 times per week, tapering over time to supervised exercise once every 2 weeks.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Three recent larger randomized trials demonstrated that interventions designed to help PAD patients adhere to home-based walking exercise improved treadmill walking performance and/or the 6-minute walk in people with PAD.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, unanswered questions remain. First, it is unclear whether unsupervised home-based exercise is sustainable. Two of the 3 recent trials were only 12 weeks in duration.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Second, the 3 recent home-based exercise trials focused on outcomes of treadmill walking performance and the 6-minute walk. Little is known about other clinically meaningful functional outcomes that may be improved by interventions that increase unsupervised home-based exercise in PAD.</p><p>We recently reported results of the Group Oriented Arterial Leg Study (GOALS), a randomized trial that demonstrated that a group-mediated cognitive behavioral (GMCB) intervention, designed to promote home-based unsupervised walking exercise, significantly increased 6-minute walk distance, treadmill walking time, and physical activity in patients with PAD.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The GOALS intervention also improved the 6-minute walk at 12-month follow-up.<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The GMCB intervention used a structured intervention to encourage exercise in an unsupervised setting near home. The intervention consisted of a minimum of 260 exercise bouts over 12 months, 90% of which occurred at or near home in an unsupervised setting. Here we report the effect of the GOALS GMCB intervention on the exploratory outcomes of participant-reported mobility loss and participant-reported gain in mobility at 6- and 12-month follow-up in participants with PAD. In contrast to objective measures obtained in controlled settings, mobility loss measures participants&#x02019; perceptions of their capacity in daily life. Mobility loss is a well-validated and clinically meaningful outcome that is associated with an increased risk of nursing home placement, depression, cognitive impairment, obesity, and chronic disease.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> We also report the effect of the GOALS exercise intervention on the objective measures of walking velocity and the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) at 6- and 12-month follow-up. Slower walking velocity and lower SPPB scores are associated with higher rates of mobility loss and/or mortality in people with and without PAD.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> We hypothesized that (1) the GMCB intervention, designed to increase home-based exercise, would prevent mobility loss and improve mobility impairment compared to the control group in people with PAD and that (2) the GMCB intervention would increase or prevent decline in walking velocity and the SPPB, compared to the control group.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Methods of the GOALS randomized trial have been reported.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The Institutional Review Board at Northwestern University approved the protocol, and participants provided written informed consent.</p><sec><title>Participant Identification</title><p>The study was performed in Chicago, IL between July 22, 2008 and May 2, 2013.

During Phase I of the trial (months 1 to 6), participants randomized to the intervention attended weekly group meetings led by a facilitator at an exercise center. Participants were instructed to walk for exercise a minimum of 5 days per week, with only 1 session per week conducted at the center with their group. During the on-site weekly sessions, group support and self-regulatory skill instructions were employed to help participants adhere to unsupervised home-based walking exercise. Participants randomized to the control group attended weekly group meetings at the medical center, during which they received educational lectures on health topics unrelated to exercise. Primary outcomes were measured at 6-month follow-up and have been reported.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> During Phase II (months 7 to 12), participants randomized to the study intervention received telephone calls from their group facilitator. Participants were encouraged to continue walking for exercise a minimum of 5 days per week. Of the minimum of 260 exercise bouts prescribed in the intervention over 12 months, only 26 of the exercise bouts took place at the study exercise center. Thus, 90% of the prescribed walking intervention sessions took place in a home-based unsupervised setting.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Participants randomized to the control group received telephone calls from a study coordinator with information related to the educational sessions in Phase I. Follow-up testing was performed at 6- and 12-month follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</title><p>All participants had an ankle brachial index (ABI) &#x02264;0.90 in either leg or a resting ABI &#x02265;0.91 and &#x02264;1.00 with a &#x02265;20% drop in ABI following a heel-rise test.<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Prior studies show that measuring the ABI after heel-rise exercises gives results comparable to measuring the ABI after treadmill testing.<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> For example, Amirhamzeh et al showed that in a group of 14 PAD patients with symptoms of intermittent claudication but ABIs &#x0003e;0.80, the ankle systolic blood pressure changes with the 2 methods were of similar magnitude, with a mean drop of 21% on the treadmill and 19% after heel-rise.<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Similarly, McPhail reported that in a study of 50 consecutive patients with suspected peripheral artery disease, the correlation between the 2 methods was outstanding, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of <italic>r</italic>=0.95 (95% CI 0.93 to 0.97). These studies demonstrate the validity of the heel-rise testing as an alternative to treadmill testing for identifying PAD. Participants with a resting ABI &#x0003e;0.90 were included if they had medical-record-documented lower extremity revascularization or evidence of PAD from an accredited vascular laboratory. Evidence of PAD from an accredited vascular laboratory consisted of an ABI &#x0003c;0.90 or a toe brachial index &#x0003c;0.70. No other vascular laboratory criteria were used to diagnose PAD.</p><p>Exclusion criteria have been reported.<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Briefly, potential participants with below- or above-knee amputation, wheelchair confinement, inability to walk at least 50 feet without stopping, significant cognitive impairment, and inability to return weekly to the medical center for the first 6 months of the intervention were excluded. However, potential participants were still included if they were able to attend most (but not all) of the weekly sessions during the first 6 months of the intervention. Individuals dependent on a walking aid other than a cane, those whose walking impairment was due to a condition other than PAD, those with severe visual or hearing impairment, those with foot ulcer or critical limb ischemia, and those who did not complete the study's run-in phase were excluded. Individuals who recently had undergone major surgery or lower extremity revascularization and those anticipating major surgery or lower extremity revascularization in the next 12 months were excluded. Participants already exercising at a comparable level to that targeted by the exercise intervention, those who required oxygen during activity or exercise, those who recently completed cardiac rehabilitation, and those with a history of Parkinson's disease were excluded. To screen for coronary artery disease prior to randomization, all participants underwent a baseline regular exercise stress test. Potential participants with an abnormal baseline exercise stress test were excluded, unless additional cardiac work-up by their individual physician showed no evidence of significant coronary ischemia.</p></sec><sec><title>ABI Measurement</title><p>A hand-held Doppler probe (Pocket Dop II; Nicolet Biomedical Inc, Golden, CO) was used to obtain systolic pressures twice in the brachial, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial arteries using established methods.<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Medical History and Body Mass Index</title><p>Medical history, race, and demographics were obtained through patient report using questionnaires administered in a standardized fashion.

Second, among participants without mobility impairment at baseline, we compared rates of cumulative mobility loss during follow-up, by reporting the proportion of participants at 12-month follow-up who reported mobility loss at either the 6- or 12-month follow-up. Third, among participants without mobility impairment at baseline, we compared the proportion of participants who reported mobility loss at both the 6- and 12-month follow-up visits (ie, persistent mobility loss).</p><p>Analyses comparing rates of regaining mobility were performed among participants who reported mobility loss at baseline (ie, those who reported inability or needing help in walking up and down a flight of stairs or walking one-quarter mile without assistance at baseline). We performed 3 sets of analyses. First, among participants with mobility loss at baseline, we compared the proportion of participants in the exercise and control groups who reported no mobility loss at the time of their 6-month follow-up visit and no mobility loss at the time of their 12-month follow-up visits, respectively. Second, among participants with mobility loss at baseline, we compared the proportion of participants in the exercise and control groups at 12-month follow-up who reported no mobility loss in at least 1 of their follow-up visits (ie, either the 6- or the 12-month follow-up visit). Third, among participants with mobility loss at baseline, we compared the proportion of participants in the exercise and control groups at 12-month follow-up with persistently improved mobility, defined as those without mobility loss at both 6-month and 12-month follow-up.</p><p>Chi-square tests and 2-sample 2-sided <italic>t</italic> tests were used to compare categorical and continuous characteristics of participants in the exercise and control groups, respectively, who completed 6- or 12-month follow-up. For mobility loss, we performed logistic regression to obtain odds ratios of mobility loss between the exercise and control groups at 6- and 12-month follow-up, among those without mobility loss at baseline. For regaining mobility, we performed logistic regression to obtain odds ratios for regaining mobility between the exercise and control groups, among those with mobility loss at baseline. The exact method is used when appropriate. Two sample, 2-sided <italic>t</italic> tests were used to compare changes in 4-m walking velocity, the SPPB, and each individual component of the SPPB between baseline and 6-month follow-up and between baseline and 12-month follow-up between the exercise and the control group. A priori<italic>,</italic> the <italic>P</italic> value considered statistically significant was <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed. These comparisons were not prespecified and no adjustment for Type I error was made despite multiple comparisons.</p><p>All participants were asked to return for follow-up measurements, regardless of their adherence to interventions. Decedents were excluded from analyses. In addition, we performed sensitivity analyses for missing data due to loss to follow-up. First, we used multiple imputation to impute the missing outcome data at 6- and 12-month follow-up, under the assumption of missing at random. Second, to examine whether the results for mobility loss are sensitive to potential informative missing due to loss to follow-up, we conservatively imputed the missing outcome data using the worst values. Specifically, the missing mobility status was imputed as mobility loss, and the missing 4-m walking velocity, the SPPB, and each individual component of the SPPB were imputed as their corresponding lowest observed values at each follow-up visit. Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>One hundred ninety-four participants were randomized to the intervention (N=97) or the control group (N=97).

However, to our knowledge, the GOALS trial is the first randomized trial to study whether any medical therapy prevents self-reported mobility loss or improves self-reported mobility loss in patients with PAD.

In addition to its effect on mobility loss, the GMCB intervention improved the exploratory outcomes of fast-paced 4-m walking speed at 6-month follow-up and the SPPB at 12-month follow-up. The SPPB is a measure of balance and lower extremity strength.

First, the first 6 months of the GOALS trial consisted of weekly visits to the medical center and consisted of a somewhat complex GMCB intervention that required both assembling a group of PAD participants and a facilitator to lead each session. For these reasons, the intervention may be difficult to implement in clinical practice. Further study is needed to determine whether the GOALS intervention is effective with fewer on-site visits. Second, the GOALS trial included a large number of exclusion criteria. Results may not be generalizable to people with PAD who were excluded from participation, including participants who were unwilling to attend weekly visits to the exercise center. Third, our analyses included multiple comparisons. Our results require confirmation in other cohorts of PAD participants. Fourth, we did not collect data on the cost of the intervention. Fifth, we did not specifically collect data from participants about the degree to which they value mobility loss.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, a GMCB intervention that promoted home-based walking exercise reduced rates of self-reported mobility loss in patients with PAD at 6-month follow-up. The home-based exercise intervention improved self-reported mobility in participants who reported mobility impairment at baseline. All of these benefits persisted at 12-month follow-up, 6 months after the intensive phase of the exercise intervention was completed. Further study is needed to determine whether interventions designed to increase home-based exercise and that have fewer on-site visits improve walking performance and prevent mobility loss in people with PAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Sources of Funding</title><p>Supported by R01-HL088589 and R01-HL107510 from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).
