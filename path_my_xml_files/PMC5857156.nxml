To analyze the telmisartan and S-amlodipine plasma concentrations using a validated liquid chromatography&#x02013;tandem mass spectrometry method, serial blood samples were collected up to 48 hours post-dose for telmisartan and 144 hours post-dose for S-amlodipine, in each period.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Forty-eight healthy subjects were enrolled, and 43 completed the study. The mean peak plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) and the area under the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curve from time 0 to the last measurement (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>) values of telmisartan were 522.29 ng/mL and 2,475.16 ng&#x000b7;h/mL for the FDC, and 540.45 ng/mL and 2,559.57 ng&#x000b7;h/mL for the individual agents concomitantly administered, respectively. The mean C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> values of S-amlodipine were 2.71 ng/mL and 130.69 ng&#x000b7;h/mL for the FDC, and 2.74 ng/mL and 129.81 ng&#x000b7;h/mL for the individual agents concomitantly administered, respectively. The geometric mean ratio (GMR) and 90% confidence interval (CI) for the telmisartan C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> (FDC of telmisartan and S-amlodipine/concomitant administration) were 0.8509 (0.7353&#x02013;0.9846) and 0.9431 (0.8698&#x02013;1.0226), respectively. The GMR and 90% CI for the S-amlodipine C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> (FDC/concomitant administration) were 0.9829 (0.9143&#x02013;1.0567) and 0.9632 (0.8798&#x02013;1.0546), respectively. As the intrasubject variability of the C<sub>max</sub> for telmisartan administered individually was 42.94%, all 90% CIs of the GMRs fell within the predetermined acceptance range. Both treatments were well tolerated in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>CKD-828 FDC tablets were shown to be bioequivalent to coadministration of the individual agents with the respective strength, in healthy subjects under fasting conditions. There was no significant difference in safety profile between the two treatments.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>fixed-dose

After a reduction of 10 mmHg in systolic blood pressure (SBP) or 5 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure (DBP), incidence of coronary heart disease and stroke have been shown to decrease by 20% and 32%, respectively, in 1 year.<xref rid="b2-dddt-12-545" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Accordingly, a reduction in blood pressure (BP) through effective pharmacotherapy significantly reduces the risk of CVD and death, irrespective of the initial BP.<xref rid="b3-dddt-12-545" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Four different classes of antihypertensive drugs are recommended as first-line therapy for hypertension: calcium-channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), and thiazide-type diuretics.<xref rid="b4-dddt-12-545" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-dddt-12-545" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Combination therapy with two or more agents from different drug classes is required to achieve BP control in the majority of patients, as hypertension is not easily controlled by monotherapy unless it is mild.<xref rid="b6-dddt-12-545" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-dddt-12-545" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Several clinical trials have demonstrated that combination therapy using two or more antihypertensive agents with complementary mechanisms exhibited greater efficacy in reducing BP, with no increase in adverse events (AEs), compared to high-dose monotherapy.<xref rid="b8-dddt-12-545" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b12-dddt-12-545" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Furthermore, fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) of two or more antihypertensive agents in a single pill can improve medication compliance by reducing the number of concomitant medications, and consequently have beneficial effects on BP control, compared to free combinations or monotherapy.<xref rid="b13-dddt-12-545" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b16-dddt-12-545" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In retrospective

ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Among the preferred combinations of classes of antihypertensive drugs, ARB/CCB combination therapy is a particularly useful option, as the addition of ARBs to CCBs has been found to reduce the incidence of peripheral edema, the most common CCB-related adverse effect.<xref rid="b19-dddt-12-545" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b21-dddt-12-545" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>Telmisartan is an ARB, with a selective type 1 receptor blockade effect.<xref rid="b22-dddt-12-545" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The antihypertensive efficacy of telmisartan, administered once daily at doses of 20&#x02013;160 mg in patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension, has been shown to be superior to that of placebo and comparable to that of other common antihypertensive agents, such as losartan, amlodipine, and lisinopril.<xref rid="b23-dddt-12-545" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The peak plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) of telmisartan has been observed to be reached between 0.5 and 1 hour after oral administration, with a bioavailability of 30%&#x02013;60%.<xref rid="b22-dddt-12-545" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b24-dddt-12-545" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Telmisartan is highly bound (&#x0003e;99%) to plasma proteins, with a very high volume of distribution (~500 L), and an elimination half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) of 21&#x02013;38 hours.<xref rid="b22-dddt-12-545" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b24-dddt-12-545" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> It is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, and most of the oral dose (98%) is excreted unaltered in feces, mainly via bile.<xref rid="b22-dddt-12-545" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>Amlodipine, a third-generation dihydropyridine CCB, is a racemic mixture consisting of the R-enantiomer and S-enantiomer in a 1:1 ratio.<xref rid="b25-dddt-12-545" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The antihypertensive effect of amlodipine through calcium-channel blocking properties is ascribed to S-amlodipine, while R-amlodipine may be responsible for the side effects of racemic amlodipine, as it has 1,000-fold lower CCB activity.<xref rid="b26-dddt-12-545" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b27-dddt-12-545" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Accordingly, an amlodipine formulation containing only S-amlodipine is more favorable, with fewer side effects than racemic amlodipine.<xref rid="b27-dddt-12-545" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b28-dddt-12-545" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Following oral administration, amlodipine shows

The lower limit of quantification was 1 ng/mL for telmisartan and 50 pg/mL for S-amlodipine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>PK analysis</title><p>PK parameters for telmisartan and S-amlodipine in plasma were estimated by a non-compartmental method using Phoenix WinNonlin version 6.4 software (Pharsight Corporation, St Louis, MO, USA). C<sub>max</sub> and t<sub>max</sub> were obtained directly from the observed plasma concentration&#x02013;time data. The area under the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curve from time 0 to the last measurement (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>) was calculated using the linear trapezoidal method. The AUC from time 0 to infinity (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub>) was calculated using the following formula: AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub> = AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> + C<italic><sub>t</sub></italic>/k<sub>e</sub>, where C<italic><sub>t</sub></italic> is the last measurable concentration, and k<sub>e</sub> is the terminal elimination rate constant determined from a linear regression line of the log-transformed plasma concentrations versus time over the terminal log-linear portion (at least three final data points). The terminal t<sub>1/2</sub> was calculated to be 0.693/k<sub>e</sub>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The sample size for the present study was calculated based on the intrasubject variability of telmisartan C<sub>max</sub> (47.5%), the largest value among AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> values, and C<sub>max</sub> values of telmisartan and S-amlodipine in earlier PK studies. In the four-period replicate design, 14 subjects per group were required to detect a difference of &#x02265;20% in the log-transformed PK parameters between the two different treatments (ie, FDC vs individual tablets) with a geometric mean ratio (GMR) of 0.9, a significance level of 0.05, and a power of 80%.<xref rid="b32-dddt-12-545" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Therefore, a total of 48 subjects were to be enrolled, assuming an estimated 40% dropout rate.</p><p>Demographics, safety data, and PK parameters were summarized using descriptive statistics. All PK parameters are presented as means &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD), except for t<sub>max</sub> values, which are expressed as the median, maximum, and minimum values. To assess the bioequivalence between T and R, the GMR and 90% confidence interval (CI) of C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> of telmisartan and S-amlodipine were calculated after natural logarithm transformation. The FDC formulation was considered bioequivalent if the 90% CI of C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> for S-amlodipine fell within a predetermined range of 0.800&#x02013;1.250, according to the standard used by the Korea Ministry of Food and Drug Safety. However, telmisartan has been reported to be a highly variable drug; therefore, the widening of the acceptance criteria for C<sub>max</sub> of telmisartan was prospectively defined in the study protocol. This was based on the intrasubject variability of the reference product obtained from this replicate design study as follows: 1) if the intrasubject variability for C<sub>max</sub> of the reference compound in the study is &#x0003c;30%, the acceptance criteria of the 90% CI for BE would be the conventional BE range of 0.800&#x02013;1.250; 2) if the intrasubject variability for C<sub>max</sub> of the reference compound is &#x02265;30%, the acceptance criteria for C<sub>max</sub> can be widened to 0.732&#x02013;1.367 (the criteria were calculated using the following formula presented in the European Medicines Agency and Korean BE study guidelines: [upper limit, lower limit] = exp[&#x000b1;k*s<sub>WR</sub>], where k is the regulatory constant set to 0.760, and s<sub>WR</sub> is the intrasubject SD of the log-transformed values of C<sub>max</sub> of the reference product).<xref rid="b33-dddt-12-545" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b35-dddt-12-545" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The conventional acceptance limit range of 0.800&#x02013;1.250 was applied to the AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> for telmisartan.

Baseline demographics showed no statistical difference between the sequence groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-dddt-12-545">Table 1</xref>). Five subjects withdrew consent during the study.

In total, 11 subjects (22.9% of 48 subjects) experienced at least one of 12 reported AEs during this study. Of all 12 AEs, four events were determined to be possibly related to the study drugs (one headache, one instance of decreased BP, and one instance of myalgia after T treatment; and one upper respiratory infection after R treatment), and three events were determined to be probably related (two instances of increased creatine phosphokinase [CPK] after T treatment; and one instance of increased CPK after R treatment).

In addition, both the FDC formulation and separate tablets of telmisartan and S-amlodipine were well tolerated in this study.</p><p>The mean ratio of AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> for telmisartan and S-amlodipine in our study accounted for 87.0%&#x02013;89.0% of the total AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub>, indicating that the sampling schedule was appropriate to provide a reliable estimate of the extent of exposure (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>/AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub> ratio &#x0003e;80%). The washout period of 14 days in this study based on the long t<sub>1/2</sub> of amlodipine (30&#x02013;50 hours) from earlier PK studies was enough to ensure complete elimination of the study drugs from the blood, as the S-amlodipine and telmisartan plasma concentrations in the pre-dose samples for periods 2&#x02013;4 were not detectable.</p><p>The intrasubject variability %CV of telmisartan C<sub>max</sub> for FDC tablets in this study was 78.72%, higher than the value we had used to calculate the sample size (47.5%). However, the sample size adjusted from the intrasubject variability in our study (about 45 subjects in total) is not much different from the number of subjects who completed this study, suggesting that the sample size was not insufficient to demonstrate the bioequivalence of telmisartan in this study.<xref rid="b33-dddt-12-545" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p><p>This four-period replicate study design enabled us to obtain repeated measures to improve the precision of the comparisons between the two treatments by using each subject as their own control, and to determine the true intra-subject variability for the T and R treatments independently. Our calculated intrasubject variability of telmisartan C<sub>max</sub> (42.94%) was comparable with the value (47.5%) that had been estimated from our earlier two-way, two-period, crossover PK study and used for the sample size calculation in this study, and was higher than the value (30%) predefined in this study protocol according to the Korean BE study guideline for highly variable drug products. Accordingly, 90% CIs of the GMR for telmisartan C<sub>max</sub> from our study (0.7353&#x02013;0.9846) fell within the widened acceptance limit of 0.732&#x02013;1.367.<xref rid="b34-dddt-12-545" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b36-dddt-12-545" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Consequently, it was verified that all GMR and 90% CI values for both telmisartan and S-amlodipine fell within the predetermined bioequivalence range for both C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>.</p><p>The source of the larger intrasubject variability %CV values of telmisartan and S-amlodipine for FDC tablets than those for individual agents coadministered in this study is unclear, but the formulation complexities might be a plausible explanation. Mitra and Wu concluded that the biopharmaceutical and PK behavior could be complicated by combining multiple active ingredients in a single FDC formulation.<xref rid="b37-dddt-12-545" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> High drug loading is required in the FDC tablet due to restrictions on its final size, leading to dissolution slowdown.</p><p>There were several limitations in this study. First, the results were obtained from healthy male subjects, who may not represent the target patients. Second, even though long-term antihypertensive treatment is required in clinical settings, only a single dose was administered in this study.</p><p>In conclusion, telmisartan/S-amlodipine FDC tablets were bioequivalent to coadministration of the individual agents with the respective strength in healthy subjects under fasting conditions. There was no significant difference in safety profile between the two treatments.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was sponsored by Chong Kun Dang Pharmaceutical
