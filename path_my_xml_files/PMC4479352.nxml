In 2012, TB affected more than 8.6 million people worldwide and resulted in 1.3 million deaths, which made it second only to HIV among leading causes of infectious disease-related deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. More than 80 % of active TB cases in the world are concentrated in 22 low- and middle-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], where 95 % of all TB deaths occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Moreover, TB is the leading cause of death among HIV patients, accounting for 20 % of all causes of deaths among HIV-infected people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Drug-sensitive strains of TB are treated with four standard first-line anti-TB drugs. Non-compliance to treatment, misuse, or mismanagement of medications may lead to relapse, development of drug-resistant (DR) TB (which requires a more expensive and intensive treatment course), and even death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. According to the 2013 World Health Organization (WHO) progress report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], each year an estimated 450,000 cases and 150,000 deaths occur globally due to multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). According to 2012 WHO data, 3.6 % of all new TB cases were MDR-TB, while the rates among previously treated patients reached 20 % [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Among those with MDR-TB, approximately 9.6 % suffer from extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains. In addition to these adverse health consequences, TB places a tremendous economic burden on individuals and societies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Current treatment approaches and alternative strategies</title><p>Currently, WHO recommends directly observed therapy (DOT) to monitor patients&#x02019; adherence to the treatment regimen, with an optimal dosing frequency of 6 days per week for new TB patients. In DOT, patients take their medications while being observed by a healthcare worker, usually a physician or a nurse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. DOT prevents patients from missing their treatment and thus reduces the development of resistance. The outpatient phase of DOT, requiring near daily visits to the health facility, introduces significant financial and time-related costs to patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], particularly in areas with poor access to health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Given such limitations, researchers have implemented and evaluated various modified or alternative strategies to improve patients&#x02019; adherence to TB treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials did not suggest enough evidence that DOT compared to self-administered treatment leads to better treatment outcomes in people receiving treatment in low-, middle-, and high-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Empowering patients is recommended as one of key components of TB treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Although several authors have documented the effectiveness of patient empowerment in TB treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], as identified in a review by Macq <italic>et al.</italic> in 2007 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], people-centered solutions have received less attention globally. In low-resource countries, as an alternative to traditional DOT, researchers have recruited family members to observe patients&#x02019; medication intake, making treatment easier and less expensive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Family members are interested in identifying noncompliance and motivated to encourage and promote treatment adherence. Several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] have documented the effectiveness of involving family members in TB treatment. Some patients value family involvement, especially if the observer is a family decision maker or is highly respected in the family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Moreover, WHO has encouraged the development of innovative people-centered care strategies that, where medically appropriate, enable patient self-management and community engagement to improve health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>In recent years, the widespread availability of mobile phones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] has spawned numerous health communications interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The Short Message Service (SMS) has been widely used as a reminder for patients to take their medications and improve treatment adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Although, SMS reminders have shown significant improvement in medication adherence among patients with HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and other conditions, a recent review paper evaluating the effectiveness of SMS reminders for treatment adherence among TB patient was inconclusive, identifying methodological limitations of prior studies and suggesting further controlled trials evaluating the role of SMS reminders for TB adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>Patient counseling and education have been found to improve treatment adherence among TB patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], which in turn, results in better treatment outcomes and improvement in the patients&#x02019; quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>Treatment adherence has been associated with many different factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], including social support, healthcare satisfaction, and disease-related knowledge. Multicomponent interventions were found to improve treatment adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Hence, our team developed a multicomponent innovative approach to TB care to enable self-administered drug intake by empowered TB patients - supervised by a trained family member and supported by patient and family counseling and reminders - to improve treatment adherence and outcome, and thereby forestall TB and multidrug resistant TB epidemics. The innovative treatment approach integrates several educational, technological, and social evidence-based components.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>The current randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an alternative multicomponent TB outpatient care strategy consisting of the following: 1) education and counseling for drug-sensitive TB patients and their family members, 2) self-administered drug-intake supervised by a trained family member, 3) daily SMS reminders to TB patients, and 4) daily phone calls to supporting family members. The research team is measuring if this alternative TB care strategy offers advantages over the regular DOT in terms of treatment outcomes, patients&#x02019; and family members&#x02019; knowledge about TB, patients&#x02019; depression status and quality of life, TB-related stigma, family social support, and self-reported adherence to TB treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Trial design</title><p>This is an open-label, stratified cluster randomized controlled superiority trial with two parallel equal arms (intervention and control) conducted in Armenia. TB outpatient centers defined the clusters, with equal numbers of clusters assigned to intervention and control arms. We performed a cluster-level random assignment of drug sensitive TB patients to intervention and control arms to mitigate potential contamination of participants in the control arm.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study setting and eligibility criteria for clusters</title><p>The intervention takes place during the continuation phase of TB treatment and is implemented through Armenia&#x02019;s TB outpatient centers. TB centers having a minimum patient load of five drug-sensitive TB patients in 2012 were included to ensure that centers with very small patient loads did not decrease the study&#x02019;s power. Out of 60 TB outpatient centers in Armenia, 52 met the inclusion criterion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Eligibility criteria for individual tuberculosis patients</title><p>Study participants are patients starting their continuation phase of TB treatment in selected outpatient TB care centers. The patient eligibility criteria are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Having a diagnosis of drug sensitive pulmonary TB,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Starting the continuation phase of TB treatment between March and-December 2014,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Being at least 18 years old at the time of enrolment, and</p></list-item><list-item><p>The ability to communicate in Armenian.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The eligibility status of each patient is subject to verification by the corresponding TB outpatient center physician and the psychologist of the National Tuberculosis Control Center (NTC).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Assignment of intervention/randomization</title><p>We stratified the TB outpatient centers (clusters) based on their drug-sensitive patient load in 2012 and their treatment outcomes (performance). We classified TB outpatient centers as small, average, or large, and performance outcomes as below average, average, or above average, yielding nine distinctive cluster categories. We applied computer-assisted block randomization to assure relatively equal number of cluster representatives from each of these nine categories in the intervention and control arms. The process yielded 26 centers in each arm.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Cluster level interventions</title><p>TB physicians in both intervention and control clusters are instructed and requested to inform the study team whenever they have a patient who meets the inclusion criteria. In addition, all TB physicians and nurses in the intervention clusters are trained on the study protocols and procedures. They are instructed to closely follow the study protocols and perform study-related paper work, including the distribution and collection of weekly side effect and medication intake forms (applicable only to intervention clusters). Physicians in the intervention clusters also are trained to provide patients with a one-week supply (6 days of pills) of TB medications using the designated pillboxes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Individual level interventions</title><p>Patients in the intervention arm are asked to identify a family member to provide support during the course of treatment. The patients, their supportive family member, and other interested family members, as permitted by the patient, participate in TB educational and psychological counseling session provided by a team of a psychologist and a nurse (interventionists).</p><p>The interventionists participated in a training-of-trainers course before starting fieldwork. The interactive TB educational and psychological counseling session covers various topics, including TB symptoms, TB route of transmission, TB treatment strategies, importance of treatment adherence, prevention and infection control, handling side effects, addressing TB-related stigma and common myths. Average duration of each session is approximately 90 minutes. The primary objective is to empower TB patients and their family members to take responsibility for the treatment.</p><p>After the educational and counseling session, patients visit their physicians weekly in the TB outpatient centers for a medical check-up and to receive the prescribed TB medication for that week. The supportive family members are responsible for following the TB patients and supporting their adherence to the treatment regimen. The supportive family members also are responsible for completing a form each week documenting medication intake and observed side effects. Patients return the completed form to the TB physician during the next week&#x02019;s visit.</p><p>Patients receive daily SMS messages each morning reminding them to take their medications on time, and weekly SMS messages reminding them to visit their TB physician for their weekly supply. The supportive family members receive daily phone calls from the research team each evening to inquire about side effects related to TB medication and to inquire if the patients are taking their TB medications on a timely basis. During these calls, patients and family members also are offered additional psychological advice and support if needed.</p><p>Patients in the intervention arm who lack a supporting family member also assume all the responsibilities defined for the supportive family member.</p><p>Patients in the control arm follow the regular DOT strategy for continuation phase, in line with the guidelines of Armenia&#x02019;s Ministry of Health and WHO recommendations: it includes taking prescribed TB medication 6 days per week while being observed by a health-care provider. The patients in this group do not receive any additional intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Outcomes and additional measurements</title><p>The primary outcome of this controlled trial is TB treatment outcome according to WHO definitions as recorded in the medical file and reported to the NTC. Treatment outcomes are classified as follows: cured, completed treatment, dead, failed, defaulted, and transferred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. A patient is considered to be successfully treated if he/she has a cured or completed treatment outcome. All other categories are considered as an unsuccessful treatment outcome.</p><p>Secondary outcome measures include patients&#x02019; knowledge, depression status, quality of life, within-family TB-related stigma, family social support, and self-reported adherence to TB treatment. In addition, we measure family members&#x02019; knowledge, depression status, social support toward TB patient, and TB-related stigma. All the secondary outcomes other than self-reported treatment adherence are measured at T0 (baseline) and T1 (follow-up). Self-reported treatment adherence is assessed only at T1. The knowledge variable is constructed from correct responses to five items adapted from previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Depression is assessed using a modified version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]; the Armenian translation is validated and the negatively formulated 16 items show high diagnostic accuracy and good factorial structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. We have used a modified version of a validated scale to measure within-family TB related stigma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and the Berlin social support scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] to measure social support of family members toward TB patients. We have applied EQ-5D to obtain data on quality of life of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p>Measurements on sociodemographic characteristics including age, gender, socioeconomic status, education, marital status, and health behavior (smoking and drinking) are obtained to verify the validity of randomization and, if necessary, to control for the potentially confounding effects of these variables on the primary and secondary outcomes.

Given the characteristics of the intervention protocol, blinding interviewers assessing secondary outcomes (knowledge about TB, depression, quality of life, within-family TB-related stigma, and family social support) at baseline is not possible. However, interviewers are blinded for the assessment of secondary outcomes at follow-up. The treatment outcome (primary outcome variable of interest) is assessed and reported by the corresponding TB outpatient center physician as part of regular reporting to the NTC; this process is completely independent of the research team.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Recruitment</title><p>The NTC informed physicians and nurses in all 52 eligible TB outpatient centers (clusters) of the study and invited them to be involved in the trial. All agreed to participate. Health-care workers in the intervention and control clusters are instructed and requested to report on all new and previously treated drug sensitive TB patients who start their continuation phase of TB treatment in the selected TB outpatient centers. The NTC psychologist, who had special training on the protocols and procedures of this study, makes the initial contact with the eligible patients following these steps: 1) the TB physicians report eligible patients to NTC, 2) the NTC psychologist contacts eligible patients over the phone, 3) the NTC psychologist verifies patients&#x02019; eligibility, 4) the NTC psychologist presents the study information briefly in a phone call and gets the patients&#x02019; consent to share their contact information with the research team, and 5) the NTC psychologist schedules a face-to-face meeting between the TB patient and the research team members.</p><p>The NTC psychologist also asks patients about household size and the number of family members aware of the TB diagnosis. If it becomes evident that all members of the patient&#x02019;s family know about his/her disease and if the patient expresses desire for family members to receive TB counseling, then the NTC psychologist arranges an appropriate place (usually home of the patient), date and time for the counseling session. We ask the patients to identify potential supporters from their family members who participate in the counseling session to support them during their treatment period. If the patient lives alone or is unwilling for any family member to support him/her during the treatment and to participate in the counseling session, we set a convenient place (usually TB outpatient center), date and time for the TB patient&#x02019;s counseling session.</p><p>Patients are enrolled within 15 days from the start of their continuation phase of treatment. The average duration of the continuation phase for the drug sensitive TB treatment is about four months. We anticipate completion of recruitment and data collection within 12 months from the start of the field work.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Sample size</title><p>We based sample size calculations for this study on the treatment outcome as the main variable of interest. In 2012, 1,200 drug sensitive TB patients received the continuation phase of their treatment in TB outpatient centers. Utilizing the 2012 data on the number of patients and outcomes at each TB outpatient center, we identified 52 eligible clusters from the 60 centers. We calculated the intracluster correlation to be 0.04 and estimated the design effect as 1.6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The initial sample size calculation used a 10 % difference in the primary outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], an alpha of 0.05 and power of 80 % and yielded a sample size of 95. Considering the potential for losses to follow-up taking a more conservative approach, we used a design effect of two; thus, the required sample size was calculated to be 190 in each arm.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Data collection</title><p>We utilize interviewer-administered face-to-face surveys to collect data on secondary outcomes.

The status of randomization (intervention/control) will be included as an independent variable; to account for the clustered design we will treat clusters as a random effect. Potential confounding variables (age, gender, socioeconomic status, and others) with significant differences across intervention and control arms will be included as fixed factors. Secondary outcomes including knowledge, depression status, quality of life, within family TB-related stigma, and family social support also will be tested using generalized linear mixed effect models using logistic regression or linear regression, as appropriate. The secondary outcome model also will include its baseline assessment as a covariate.</p><p>We will report all the descriptive and inferential statistics results with their 95 % confidence intervals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Patient safety and monitoring of adverse events</title><p>TB patients included in this trial are drug-sensitive and have completed their intensive treatment phase. We take special efforts to minimize potential adverse events. All patients in the intervention arm undergo routine medical check-ups during weekly visits to TB outpatient centers. Moreover, the side effect report form is completed daily and reported by telephone to the research team, allowing the research team to quickly report concerns to the corresponding TB physician for follow-up. Side effects among those patients in the control arm are taken care during their regular daily visits to TB outpatient centers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Research ethics</title><p>The American University of Armenia Institutional Review Board (IRB) reviewed and approved the study protocol (# AUA-2014-020).

Improved control and management of TB can lead to better treatment outcomes, thereby decreasing health inequalities, morbidity, mortality, and economic costs associated with the disease. Rigorously evaluated alternative people-centered strategies, if successful, can be implemented in countries with similar healthcare and economic profiles and help to forestall TB and multidrug-resistant TB epidemics.</p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Trial status</title><p>At the time of submission of this manuscript, the trial is ongoing; it began enrolment in March 2014.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CES-D</term><def><p>Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DOT</term><def><p>directly observed therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DR</term><def><p>drug resistant</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IRB</term><def><p>institutional review board</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MDR-TB</term><def><p>multi-drug resistant TB</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NTC</term><def><p>National Tuberculosis Control Center</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SMS</term><def><p>short message service</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TB</term><def><p>tuberculosis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p>World Health Organization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>XDR</term><def><p>extensively drug-resistant</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contribution</bold></p><p>VK drafted the manuscript.
