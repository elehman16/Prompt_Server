program for enhancement of gait function on temporal and spatial parameters of school aged
children with intellectual disabilities. [Subjects] Forty young people with intellectual
disabilities were assigned either to the balance exercise program for enhancement of gait
function group (BG group, n=19) or the control group (n=21). [Methods] The BG group
attended an 8-week balance exercise program for enhancement of gait function consisting of
two sessions a week. Gait was assessed using temporal and spatial parameters. [Results]
The balance exercise program resulted in significant improvements in participant
performance in temporal and spatial parameters. [Conclusion] A balance exercise program
for enhancement of gait function can be an effective intervention for improving functional
outcomes and can be recommended as an alternative mode of physical activity programming
for improving balance and gait.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Balance exercise</kwd><kwd>Gait</kwd><kwd>Intellectual disability</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Motor problems have been reported as common in persons with intellectual disabilities since
intellectual disabilities are conditions that affect cognitive and motor functions<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Intellectual disabilities negatively affect
the life of a person with disability also by decreasing their motor function, which is
manifested by poor visual and motor coordination, limited precision of movements,
inhibition, and difficulties in learning new forms of activities<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Alongside
impairments in cognitive and motor function, individuals with intellectual disability also
have lower levels of physical fitness at all stages of life due to inactive ways of
life<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A pervasive feature of motor skill performance in children with intellectual disabilities
that persists in adulthood is the slowness of movement<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In general, although
children with intellectual disabilities learn to walk, to reach and to grasp objects, to
feed themselves, and to perform many other fundamental skills, their movements lack in
precision and appear poorly coordinated and less efficient than the movements of normally
developing children<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Persons with intellectual disabilities are worse at performing motor tasks that require a
combination of two activities; they also often have difficulties in developing praxis
skills. Additionally, disturbed body sensibility and poor spatial orientation considerably
decrease the levels of static and dynamic balances, which is manifested by awkward movements
and increases in the risk of falls<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Falls resulting in injury are very common in individuals with intellectual
disabilities<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance and gait problems
are well-established risk factors for falling<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Some studies have indicated that persons with intellectual
disabilities have a relatively high fall rate and an increased risk of fall-related
injuries<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. For example, persons with intellectual disabilities are more at
risk of fall-related fractures because of low bone mineral density<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The rate of hospitalization because of an injury is twice
as high in persons with intellectual disabilities compared with the general population, with
most of the injuries being caused by falls<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. A good understanding of the nature of balance and gait problems
and their role in the causation of falling in persons with intellectual disability may help
to develop intervention strategies to prevent falls and injuries.</p><p>In the general population, there is convincing evidence showing that exercise programs are
effective, not only to improve balance, gait, and muscle strength capacities, but also to
reduce the number of falls<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Such
evidence is currently lacking for persons with intellectual disabilities.</p><p>Therefore, the aim of our research was to determine whether and to what extent application
of different planned activities, i.e, a specific exercise program, could assess the effects
of a balance exercise program for enhancement of gait function on temporal and spatial
parameters in young people with intellectual disabilities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The experiment was performed with a total of 42 participants with mild intellectual
disabilities, who were students of a G special-education school in Gyungi-do, Korea.
Participants were excluded if they had musculoskeletal impairments, such as the inability to
walk independently, neurological impairments, or vision impairment. Individuals who
participated in less than 80% of the training program and who were unable to perform
follow-up tests were also excluded.</p><p>All experimental protocols and procedures were explained to each subject and approved by
the institutional review board of Sahmyook University, Korea. All subjects provided written
informed consent prior to study enrollment.</p><p>Forty-two subjects who met the inclusion criteria were randomly divided into two groups,
namely, the balance exercise program for enhancement of gait function group (BG group, n=21)
and control group (n=21), using Random Allocation Software (version 1.0)<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, two subjects in the BG group
were excluded because their program participation rates were less than 80%. Accordingly, the
study cohort comprised 40 subjects: 19 in the BG group and 21 in the control group (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> Subject characteristics</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BG group</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (male/female)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19 (10/9)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21 (11/10)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.2 &#x000b1; 2.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.1 &#x000b1; 2.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">153.4 &#x000b1; 12.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">154.4 &#x000b1; 11.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">53.0 &#x000b1; 13.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">51.4 &#x000b1; 11.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Disability</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Down syndrome</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Unknown syndrome</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Level of intellectual disability</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mild</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Moderate</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Severe/profound</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are expressed as means &#x000b1; SD</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>).</p><p>The participants trained for 8 weeks. Evaluations were performed twice, a week before the
program started and a week after its completion. Demographics and gait parameters were
assessed by two different examiners. Evaluations were measured by an assessor who was blind
to the study details.</p><p>The BG group participants received 40 minutes of balance training supervised by a school
therapist that combined progressive balance and functional gait training twice a week for
eight weeks. The members of the control group did not receive any form of balance
training.</p><p>This balance exercise program was designed based on a previous study of training that has
been shown to improve balance and gait<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The exercise was conducted twice a week for 8 weeks. School therapists conducted the balance
and gait training. The balance exercise program was carried out for 40&#x02005;min. The program
included warm-up movements followed by the balance exercise program (i.e, toe-to-heel walk,
tandem standing, side walking, walking backward, with eyes opened versus closed). Balls,
foams, balloons, bands, sticks, and scarves were used in conjunction with the dynamic
exercises. In addition, general dynamic activities such as dancing, rolling a ball, pushing,
pulling, lifting, catching, and throwing were practiced in each session.</p><p>Temporal and spatial gait parameters were assessed using an electronic pressure-sensitive
walkway (GAITRite, CIR Systems Inc, Sparta, NJ, USA, 2008). The subjects were asked to walk
at their usual speed on the GAITRite walkway (5&#x02005;m length, 61&#x02005;cm wide, 0.6&#x02005;cm high) without
shoes. This test was repeated 3 times, and the results were averaged. We assessed spatial
and temporal parameters using computer analysis (GAITRite GOLD Version 3.2, CIR Systems Inc,
Sparta, NJ, USA, 2008).</p><p>Subjects practiced walking without paying attention to the board, practiced keeping their
eyes straight ahead, and practiced swinging their arms naturally. Then, the participants
were instructed to walk at a comfortable pace, as if they were walking down the street.
Subjects began walking at a starting position 3&#x02005;m before the beginning of the mat and
continued walking for 3&#x02005;m beyond the end of the mat. This enabled us to record steady-state
gait without the effects of gait initiation and termination. Values obtained during 3 trials
were averaged for analysis.</p><p>The temporal parameters measured were velocity, cadence, step time, and stride time. The
spatial parameters included step length and stride length.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS version 19.0 software. The Shapiro-Wilks
test was used to test the normal distribution of all parameters. Differences in continuous
variables between groups were tested using the two-sample Student&#x02019;s t-test, and within group
differences were tested with paired Student&#x02019;s t-test. Differences in categorical variables
were analyzed using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. P values less than 0.05 were considered
statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title> Changes in temporal gait parameters</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BG group (n=19)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group (n=21)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" colspan="1">Velocity (cm/s)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.91 &#x000b1;0.19<sup>a</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.89 &#x000b1; 0.22</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.19 &#x000b1; 0.31</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.94 &#x000b1; 0.29</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre-Post</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.28 &#x000b1; 0.31*</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.04 &#x000b1; 0.32</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" colspan="1">Cadence (steps/m)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">134.71 &#x000b1; 8.28</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">134.51 &#x000b1; 8.41</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">130.19 &#x000b1; 8.83</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">135.31 &#x000b1; 6.48</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre-Post</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;4.52 &#x000b1; 2.64*</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.80 &#x000b1; 8.48</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" colspan="1">Step time (seconds)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.57 &#x000b1; 0.04</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.55 &#x000b1; 0.04</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.56 &#x000b1; 0.03</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.56 &#x000b1; 0.13</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre-Post</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.02 &#x000b1; 0.02*</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.00 &#x000b1; 0.05</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" colspan="1">Stride time (seconds)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.13 &#x000b1; 0.07</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.12 &#x000b1; 0.07</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.09 &#x000b1; 0.07</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.13 &#x000b1; 0.06</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre-Post</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;0.04 &#x000b1; 0.04*</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.01 &#x000b1; 0.10</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are expressed as means &#x000b1; SD. * Values are significantly different between

application of a balance exercise program for enhancement of gait function in young people
with intellectual disabilities.</p><p>The results of this study showed that balance training for enhancement of gait function may
be effective in encouraging temporal gait parameters of young people with intellectual
disabilities. Moreover, the spatial gait parameters also showed significant improvement in
the BG group.</p><p>A number of gait analysis studies in persons with intellectual disability have recently
reported differences in the spatiotemporal characteristics of gait in persons with
intellectual disabilities compared with controls. The persons with intellectual disabilities
including Down syndrome displayed lower gait function, lower gait velocity, higher cadence,
shorter step length, and larger step width<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, the young people with intellectual
disability showed lower gait functions at baseline, but their gait functions showed
significant improvement after training.</p><p>Temporospatial gait parameters are now used to assess the abilities of the lower
extremities and to represent changes in gait pattern as quantifiable values after an
intervention<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The gait functions are
important requirements for independent activities of daily living, and therefore, gait speed
is an important indicator of walking disability. In this study, gait velocity showed a
significant improvement, 31%, in the BG group. Angulo-Barroso et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> found that the gait velocity significantly increased in
Down syndrome after treadmill gait training. Since Verghese et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that a 10&#x02005;cm/s decrease in velocity is equivalent
to a 10% loss of mobility in daily life, the 31% improvement observed in velocity in the BG
group shows that training enhanced subject independence.</p><p>In this study, cadence showed a significant decrease, 3.4% in the BG group. The persons
with intellectual disabilities displayed a higher cadence, and therefore, the results of
this study are meaningful.</p><p>The normal ranges of velocity and cadence for males between 15 and 17 are 1.03&#x02013;1.75 m/s and
96&#x02013;142 steps/min, respectively, and for females, they are 0.92&#x02013;1.64 m/s and 100&#x02013;144
steps/min, respectively<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although 33%
of the experimental group was in the normal velocity range before training, this increased
to 71% after training. In terms of cadence, 92% of the subjects in the experimental group
were in the normal range before training, but all were within the normal range after
treatment.</p><p>In this study, we assessed spatial gait parameters by stride length and step length.
Previous studies reported that persons with intellectual disabilities showed shorter step
lengths and shorter stride lengths compared with the control group. A short stride length
and wide step width lead to a high cadence and instability. Ulrich et al.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> and Wu et al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> also noted improvement of walking pattern and increasing
step length and stride length compared with the control group.</p><p>Because few studies have reported trainability of gait capacities in persons with
intellectual disabilities, it is very meaningful that this study suggests trainability of
gait capacities in persons with intellectual disabilities. The balance exercise programs
used in our study consisted of dynamic balance exercise, dynamic exercise, and dynamic
activity. Our program was modified from that applied in adults with mild intellectual
disabilities by Carmeli et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> They
suggested that their program improved psychological perception and dynamic balance. Brosse
et al.<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that physical activity
affects brain function as a result of its facilitation of neurotransmitter chemicals such as
dopamine and serotonin in the CNS. These factors may explain the mechanism by which a
balance exercise program can affect youth with intellectual disabilities.</p><p>Previous studies have reported the risk of falling and falling injuries in elderly with
intellectual disabilities, and some studies have indicated an increasing fall risk in
elderly individuals with intellectual disabilities<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>; therefore, development of appropriate, feasible, and reasonable
interventions for persons with intellectual disabilities is required in rehabilitation for
young people with intellectual disabilities in the future.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Rintala</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Loovis</surname><given-names>EM</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Measuring motor skills in Finnish children with
