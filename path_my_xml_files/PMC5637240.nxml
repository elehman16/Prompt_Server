Deep sedation by intravenous propofol combined with an opioid has recently become the preferred sedation technique. However, when high doses of propofol are used, side effects, namely respiratory depression, may occur. Esketamine has hypnotic, analgesic, and sympathomimetic effects. Our assumption is that a combination of propofol with esketamine reduces the dosage of individual drugs, thereby minimizing sedation side effects while keeping the same satisfaction level of patients and endoscopists.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">The study will be performed as a randomized controlled multicenter trial. Patients undergoing ERCP, &#x02265;&#x02009;18&#x000a0;years old, with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification I&#x02013;III will be randomized after written informed consent to group K (propofol/esketamine) or to group A (propofol/alfentanil). The primary outcome, reflecting effectiveness of sedation, is the total dose of propofol. Secondary outcome parameters are patients&#x02019; and endoscopists&#x02019; satisfaction with the procedure and the number of sedation-related pulmonary and cardiovascular events. Data on sedation-related events are collected by recording of oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), respiratory rate (RR), end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (etCO<sub>2</sub>), heart rate (HR), arrhythmias (electrocardiogram (ECG)), and non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) measurements. Satisfaction parameters are collected by means of questionnaires before and after the procedure and on the following day.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">Esketamine is known for its effective anesthetic and analgesic effects maintaining spontaneous breathing and airway reflexes. Due to an increase in sympathetic tone, hypotension and cardiac depression is less common. Unfortunately esketamine is also known for its psychotomimetic effects. We aim to demonstrate that the combination of esketamine with propofol for sedation in patients subjected to ERCP interventions is nevertheless superior to a combination of propofol with an opioid.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">Nederland&#x02019;s Trial Register, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=5486">NTR5486</ext-link>.

It is used for diagnostic purposes in biliary and pancreatic disease and also for therapeutic interventions such as sphincterotomy, gallstone extraction, and biliary and pancreatic duct stenting. Because any movement of the patient could importantly affect success of the ERCP, procedures are usually performed under deep sedation or even general anesthesia with the patients in the semi-prone or prone position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Over the last decade the combination of propofol and an opioid has become the preferred sedative regime during ERCP in many countries, despite known side effects.</p><p id="Par27">Esketamine, the s-enantiomer of ketamine - is not only a well-known sedative, but also has strong analgesic properties. Furthermore, its sympathomimetic qualities can counteract the hemodynamic depression of propofol and so reduce the risk of cardiovascular and respiratory depression during sedation. A potential problem of esketamine could be its psychotomimetic effects, such as visual disturbances, vertigo, or nausea that could compromise patient satisfaction. There is still little evidence of an improved safety profile of a combination of propofol/esketamine and it is still open to discussion whether esketamine psychomimetic effects play a significant role in outpatient treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aim of the study</title><p id="Par28">We hypothesize that procedural sedation with propofol and esketamine reduces the dosage of individual drugs, thereby minimizing sedation side effects while keeping the same satisfaction level of patients and endoscopists. To test this hypothesis we compare two groups. Group K receives propofol/esketamine sedation; group A receives propofol/alfentanil sedation during ERCP. Both groups receive standard deep sedation with propofol target controlled infusion (TCI) provided by specialized sedation anesthesia nurses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Trial design</title><p id="Par29">The study is designed as a prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter trial and reported following the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The sponsor of this trial is the Department of Anesthesiology of the Academic Medical Center (AMC) in Amsterdam. The sponsor is responsible for the collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report; and the decision to submit the report for publication. The study is supported by institutional funding.

A 15% reduction in propofol requirement when using esketamine instead of alfentanil would reflect a total dose reduction of propofol by up to 65%, which is not only a statistically significant but also a clinically relevant difference.</p><p id="Par31">The sample size calculation is based on retrospectively obtained observational data from previous ERCPs, collected in our hospital sedation database. The primary endpoint is the difference in the dose of propofol used. The mean dosage of propofol during ERCP was 580&#x000a0;mg, with a standard deviation of 190&#x000a0;mg. We will need to study 76 subjects in each group, given power of 0.80 and type I error of 0.05, to reduce propofol requirement by about 15%. Considering a dropout rate of 10%, the estimated sample size will be 83 patients per group, thus a total of 166 patients will be randomized.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Eligibility</title><p id="Par32">The study takes place at two centers: the Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology in the AMC of the University of Amsterdam and the Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology in the Tjongerschans ziekenhuis, Heerenveen, The Netherlands - beginning December 2015 to January 2018.

Antibiotic prophylaxis is given according to hospital standards. As a standard procedure, diclofenac 100&#x000a0;mg is administered rectally immediately before the procedure to reduce post ERCP pancreatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Procedural sedation is performed by anesthesia nurses trained in the standards of care for procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA) according to the Dutch national guidelines. An anesthesiologist is available for liaison, supervision and emergency help. Insufflation of the duodenum during ERCP is with CO<sub>2</sub> instead of air, to reduce peri-procedural pain and abdominal distension.</p><p id="Par54">Patients are asked to complete a questionnaire before the procedure to assess baseline pain, drowsiness, nausea, perception, and mood using a visual analog scale (VAS) (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;100). Baseline assessments of the Modified Observer&#x02019;s Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale (MOAA/S), the Aldrete recovery score and measurements of heart rate (HR), non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP), respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) are recorded.</p><p id="Par55">After placement of an intravenous line, an infusion of 500&#x000a0;ml NaCl 0.9% is started at the rate of 250&#x000a0;ml/h. Five minutes before insertion of the endoscope, glycopyrrolate 0.2&#x000a0;mg, and lidocaine 50&#x000a0;mg are administered intravenously. Then patients are asked to place themselves into the prone or semi-prone position. From the start of sedation till the end of the endoscopic procedure, 2&#x000a0;L/min of oxygen are administered by nasal cannula, and HR, SpO<sub>2</sub>, RR, electrocardiogram (ECG), NIBP, end-tidal carbon dioxide (etCO<sub>2</sub>) and sedation level measured by the MOAAS/S are collected at 5-minute intervals. An independent, blinded observer collects research data.</p><p id="Par56">Both groups are sedated by a propofol TCI system (Propofol 1% MCT Fresenius). TCI means a weight pre-programmed system using the Marsh pharmacokinetic model to attain a specific estimated propofol plasma target level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. We start propofol TCI in both groups with a targeted plasma level of 1.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml. Reaching this plasma level, group K is treated with esketamine (Ketanest S, Pfizer) 150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg and group A is treated with alfentanil (Rapifen, Janssen-Cilag) 2.0&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg. After 2&#x000a0;min propofol TCI is stepped up - if needed - to a maximum targeted plasma level of 2.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml.</p><p id="Par57">Before starting the endoscopic procedure, patients are assessed for their level of sedation using the MOAA/S scale yielding at a score &#x0003c;2. The modified form of the MOAA/S scale uses not only the responsiveness component of the original scale (awake (5) - unresponsive (1)) but is extended with assessment of painful stimuli. As reaction to painful stimuli are still possible at anesthetic levels that block reactions to verbal commands, prodding, or shaking they can be used to assess deeper sedation levels.</p><p id="Par58">If MOAA/S is&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;2, e.g. the patient is too responsive to tolerate the procedure; additional sedation is provided with TCI increments of 0.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml plasma target level. These very small steps are performed in order to avoid deep sedation. For every step up of propofol TCI, additional esketamine 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg or alfentanil 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg is added. Maximum dosage is 500&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg ketamine or 7.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg alfentanil.</p><p id="Par59">Total dosage of propofol, alfentanil, and esketamine and the time of the total procedure and length of time between the end of the procedure (removing the scope) till reaching an MOAAS score &#x0003e;&#x02009;4 and the declaration that the patient is ready for transport to the recovery unit, is noted.</p><p id="Par60">At arrival in the recovery room, monitoring is limited to SpO<sub>2</sub>, RR, ECG, and NIBP only. Recovery from anesthesia and the return of psychotomotoric fitness is assessed using the modified Aldrete score at arrival and 15, 30, 45, and 60&#x000a0;min later. This score describes the patient&#x02019;s motoric activity, mechanical respiratory function, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and consciousness and is designed to assess patient recovery after sedation. The total score is 10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. During the time in the recovery room patients have to complete the identical questionnaire they completed at baseline, on pain, drowsiness, nausea, perception, and mood, using a VAS (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;100). Following daily standards, post-procedural pain is indicated as VAS &#x0003e;&#x02009;40 and is treated with 2&#x000a0;mg morphine intravenously; nausea indicated by a VAS &#x0003e;&#x02009;40 will be treated with 4&#x000a0;mg ondansetron intravenously.</p><p id="Par61">Patients have to stay for at least 1&#x000a0;h in the recovery room. &#x0201c;Ready for discharge&#x0201d; is declared when an Aldrete score &#x02265;&#x02009;9 or similar to the pre-procedural score is reached.

The National Authority, the Central Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects (CCMO), performed a marginal review and there were no objections to perform this study (NL53999.018.15 BI).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par71">In recent years, the combination of propofol with an opioid for sedation has replaced the conventionally used combination with benzodiazepines, and became the standard for analgo-sedation during ERCP, with the advantage of improved titration of sedation, shorter recovery time, and better patient tolerance and satisfaction. However, a possible consequence of high-dose propofol sedation is that it may result in progression from deep sedation to general anesthesia. Cote et al. showed that hypoxemia occurred in 12.8% of 799 patients sedated for endoscopic procedures with propofol applied by trained anesthesia nurses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Minimizing these risks is therefore an important goal to make sedation procedures safer. A possible approach is to reduce the propofol dosage using a combination with other substances.</p><p id="Par72">Esketamine offers the advantages of minimizing sedation side effects, making optimal use of the concept of synergy while being an analgesic at the same time. Despite its effective anesthetic and analgesic effects, spontaneous breathing and airway reflexes are maintained and hypotension is less common due to an increase in sympathetic tone. Varadarajulu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] demonstrated that the use of ketamine in patients who were difficult to sedate during ERCP resulted in better quality of sedation and analgesia. They observed shorter recovery times compared with opiate and benzodiazepine sedation. However, they concluded that it is necessary to conduct further randomized trials. Wehrmann et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] recommended the combination of propofol with ketamine because of its analgesic properties without cardiorespiratory depressant effects.</p><p id="Par73">Mortero et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] found that the combination of propofol with small doses of ketamine during monitored anesthesia for surgical interventions reduced hypoventilation caused by propofol, induced a stable positive spirit, and provided earlier recovery of perception in comparison to propofol alone.</p><p id="Par74">The most widespread doubts about esketamine, however, correspond to its mind-altering effects in cognition. It can produce psychotomimetic effects that may be associated with symptoms similar to dissociative states of mind [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. On the other hand, Nakao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] showed that propofol used in clinical relevant dosages suppresses these effects via the activation of GABA receptors. Unfortunately, there are only a few studies with only limited significance investigating the effectiveness of a propofol/esketamine regime with emphasis on the aforementioned safety aspects during ERCP and the eventually psychotomimetic effects such as visual disturbances, vertigo, or nausea that could compromise patient satisfaction and recovery after discharge home.</p><p id="Par75">A limitation of our study could be that we based sample size calculation on the reduction of the total dosage of propofol. Probably, acute respiratory or hemodynamic adverse events would have been a more appropriate primary outcome. However, much larger-scale studies would have been necessary to address this outcome. Alongside this we defined cardiorespiratory events according to the SIVA consensus statement for standardized definitions and terminology for sedation-related adverse events. However, their clinical impact cannot be determined when a sedation specialist provides adequate rescue maneuvers during such events.</p><p id="Par76">The aim of our trial is to show that the synergy of esketamine and propofol reduces the dosage of individual drugs, thereby providing a better safety and satisfaction profile than the combination with an opioid during ERCP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par77">The first patient was included on 8 December 2015.
