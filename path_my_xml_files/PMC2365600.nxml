		<p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether
nedocromil sodium benefits urban asthmatic children
showing seasonal bronchial hyper-reactivity to ultrasonic
nebulization of distilled water (UNDW). A prospective,
randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group,
double-blind study was carried out at the outpatient
pulmonology service at a tertiary-care teaching hospital.
Twelve children living in Milan, who were 7&#x02013;17 years of
age, who were SPT and RAST-negative to perennial allergens,
who were suffering from episodic asthma, and
showing seasonal bronchial hyper-reactivity to UNDW
during winter, participated in this study. All the children
received either placebo or nedocromil sodium, 4 mg
every 6 h for 6 weeks. Spirometry and UNDW challenge
were done at the following times: day&#x02212;7; day 0; day 1; day
7; day 14; day 28; day 42. No differences were found in
the basal spirometric parameters, which were normal in
both nedocromil and placebo groups. Bronchial reactivity
to UNDW was found to be significantly decreased in
the group treated with nedocromtl starting from day 7. It
is therefore concluded that nedocromil sodium can reverse
bronchial hyper-reactivity caused by seasonal factors
such as cold, viral infections and atmospheric pollutants
in children suffering from asthma.</p>
