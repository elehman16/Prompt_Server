It occurs throughout the world in all climates and all ethnic groups. Though all the <italic>Doshas</italic> take part in the causation of this disease, <italic>Ama</italic> and vitiated <italic>Vata</italic> play the dominant role. The clinical features of rheumatoid arthritis, such as pain, swelling, stiffness, fever, and general debility, are almost identical to that of <italic>Amavata</italic>. Treatment provides symptomatic relief, but the underlying pathology remains unchecked because of the absence of effective drugs. In the management of <italic>Amavata</italic> all the acharyas have described the sequential employment of <italic>Dipana, Amapachan, Shodhan</italic>, and <italic>Shaman</italic> therapies. For this study, 118 patients of <italic>Amavata</italic> were randomly divided into two groups. The patients in group A (50 patients) were given <italic>Matra Basti</italic> with <italic>Brihat Saindhavadi Taila</italic> along with <italic>Vatari Guggulu</italic>; the patients in group B (53 patients) were given only <italic>Vatari Guggulu</italic>. All the patients responded favorably to the treatment in both the groups; however, patients treated with <italic>Matra Basti</italic> had better relief in most of the cardinal signs and symptoms of the disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Vatari Guggulu</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Matra Basti</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Amavata</italic></kwd><kwd>rheumatoid arthritis</kwd><kwd><italic>Vata</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Brihat Saindhavadi Taila</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Amavata</italic> is first mentioned as a separate disease in Madhav Nidana, where it is stated that <italic>Mandagni</italic> plays a central role in the manifestation of the disease.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] This theory is very well supported by the view of Acharya Vagbhatta that the main cause of all diseases is <italic>Mandagni</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Acharya Madhava has described the most characteristic feature of this disease: severe pain similar to a scorpion bite. <italic>Asthi</italic> and <italic>Sandhi</italic> are the chief sites of presentation of the cardinal symptoms such as <italic>Sandhishoola, Sandhigraha, Sandhi Sotha</italic>, etc. These symptoms resemble the cardinal features of rheumatoid arthritis, i.e., pain, swelling, stiffness, fever, general debility, etc.</p><p>Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic immuno-inflammatory systemic disease that affects mainly the synovial joints, with a possibility of extraarticular manifestations.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] In the management of <italic>Amavata</italic> sequential employment of <italic>Dipana, Amapachan, Shodhan</italic>, and <italic>Shaman</italic> therapies have been mentioned.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] The use of <italic>Eranda Taila</italic> for the treatment of <italic>Amavata</italic> has been emphasized by almost all the ancient <italic>Acharyas</italic>.

According to Acharya Charaka: &#x02018;As a tree irrigated in its root attains blue branches with beautiful tender leaves, flowers and fruits in time, and attains a big stature, so too the man with unctuous enema given through the rectum.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>On the action of <italic>Basti</italic>, Vagabhatta[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] says the <italic>Virya</italic> of <italic>Basti</italic> is conveyed to <italic>Apana</italic> and then to <italic>Samana Vata</italic>, which may regulate the function of <italic>Agni</italic>. It then goes to <italic>Udana, Vyana</italic>, and <italic>Prana</italic>, thus providing its efficacy all over the body. At the same time <italic>Basti</italic> by pacifying <italic>Vata</italic>, restores the disturbed <italic>Kapha</italic> and <italic>Pitta</italic> at their original seats and thus helps in breaking the pathogenesis.</p><p>Thus, according to Ayurveda, the <italic>Veerya</italic> (active principle) of the ingredients used in the <italic>Basti</italic> gets absorbed and then, through the general circulation, reaches at the site of the lesion and relieves the disease.</p><p>Modern pharmacokinetic studies have also proved that drug administration via the rectum can achieve higher blood levels of the drug than administration through the oral route due to partial avoidance of hepatic first-pass metabolism. The rectum has a rich blood and lymph supply and drugs can cross the rectal mucosa as they can other lipid membranes. Thus, un-ionized and lipid-soluble substances are readily absorbed from the rectum. The portion absorbed from the upper rectal mucosa is carried by the superior hemorrhoidal vein into the portal circulation, whereas that absorbed from the lower rectum enters directly into the systemic circulation via the middle and inferior hemorrhoidal veins. Thus, administration of drugs in the <italic>Basti</italic> form has faster absorption and provides quicker results.</p><p>The rectal wall contains neuroreceptors and pressure receptors which are stimulated by various <italic>Basti Dravyas</italic>. Stimulation results in increase in conduction of sodium ions. The inward rush of sodium ions through the membrane of the unmyelinated terminal is responsible for generating the action potential, influx of ions there by generating action potential. Generally, the action potential is initiated by an increase in permeability to sodium ions. <italic>Saindhava Lavana</italic> present in <italic>Basti</italic> probably generates the action potential and helps in diffusion and absorption of the <italic>Basti Dravyas</italic>.</p><p>The drugs, immediately after entering into the <italic>Pakwashaya</italic> (intestine), strike at the very root of vitiated <italic>Vata</italic>. By virtue of their permeability the drugs may increase the normal bacterial flora of the colon and thereby modulate the rate of endogenous synthesis of vitamins B<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>12</sub> as well as vitamin K, which are normally manufactured by bacterial flora. Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> may have a role to play in the regeneration and maintenance of nerve cells. <italic>Basti Karma</italic> also reverses the effects of degeneration by enhancing immunity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p><italic>Basti</italic> therapy may be stimulator for Gastrointestinal tract and also for whole body functions. Regulatory peptides like serotonin, enteroglucagon, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) are produced in the colon. Many of the peptides have a role in the functioning of the basal ganglia and some of the substances among them, such as (Cholecystokinin) and VIP, are stimulators of the dopaminergic neuronal system. It is possible that Basti by stimulating many factors in GIT physiology affects on regulatory functions of these peptides either by moderation or by stimulation. Thus, <italic>Basti Karma</italic> exerts a largely systemic action exerting local action in Gastrointestinal tract by operating through large intestine involving enteric nervous system. <italic>Basti Karma</italic> can activate the autonomic nervous system and thereby help in the evacuation of <italic>Basti Dravya</italic></p><sec id="sec2-8"><title/><sec id="sec3-4"><title>Doshavasechana</title><p>The effects of <italic>Basti</italic> can be encolonic (acting on the tissue of the colon), endocolonic (acting inside the colon), and diacolonic (systemic action). In the present study, <italic>Brihat Saindhavadi Taila</italic> was used for <italic>Matra Basti. Eranda Taila</italic> and most of its contents have basically <italic>Ushna, Vata-Kaphashamaka, Shothhara</italic> (anti-inflammatory), <italic>Vednasthapana</italic> (analgesic), and <italic>Deepaka</italic> properties. These properties of <italic>Basti Dravya</italic> helps overcome the obstruction and expel the morbid material from the entire body, thus interrupting the pathogenesis of disease. Therefore, we can say that <italic>Basti</italic> plays a pivotal role in the management of <italic>&#x000c0;mavata</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Probable mode of action of <italic>Vatari Guggulu</italic></title><p><italic>Vatari Guguulu</italic> contains <italic>Erand taila, Shudha gandhak, Shudha Guggulu, Haritaki, Bibhitaki</italic>, and <italic>Amalaki</italic> in equal proportions.

In the first stage of disease due to <italic>Mandagni</italic>, formation of <italic>Ama</italic> takes place and, here, <italic>Vatari Guggulu</italic> does <italic>Amapachana</italic> by the properties of <italic>Laghu, Ruksha, Tikshna Guna, Katu, Tikta Rasa, Ushna Virya</italic>, and <italic>Katu Vipaka</italic>, all of which acts against the <italic>Guru, Snigdha, Pichhila</italic>, etc. properties of <italic>Ama</italic>. Later, the imbalance of <italic>Kapha</italic> and <italic>Vata</italic> is checked by the <italic>Vata Kapha Shamaka</italic> action of the drug. Further, <italic>Ama</italic> formation is stopped by the <italic>Dipaniya</italic> action. It relieves the symptoms of <italic>Sandhishoola</italic> (pain in joints), <italic>Sotha</italic> (swelling), <italic>Aruchi</italic> (dislike for food), etc., by its <italic>Vednasthapana</italic> (analgesic) and <italic>Sothahara</italic> (anti-inflammatory) action. Also the associated symptoms like <italic>Vibandha</italic> (constipation), <italic>Anaha</italic>, etc., are reduced by <italic>Anulomana</italic> and <italic>Virechan Karmas</italic> of the drugs like <italic>Haritaki</italic> and <italic>Erand taila</italic>. Thus, due to its <italic>Deepana-Paachana</italic> and <italic>Vata Kapha Shamaka</italic> properties, it is very suitable for interrupting the pathogenesis of the disease and to combat the main culprits, i.e., <italic>Vata, Kapha (Ama)</italic>, and <italic>Mandagni</italic>, that are the root cause of <italic>Amavata</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>&#x000c0;mavata</italic> is first mentioned in Madhava-Nidana as a separate disease, and a complete picture of its <italic>Nidana, Samprapti</italic>, and <italic>Samanya</italic> as well as <italic>Pravriddha Rupa</italic> is given. It is mostly a disease of <italic>Madhyama Rogamarga</italic> with <italic>Chirakari Swabhava. Ama</italic> and <italic>Vata</italic> being contradictory in nature make it difficult to plan the line of treatment. In this study, although the improvement was statistically highly significant in both the groups, the <italic>Matra Basti</italic> group (group A) showed comparatively better relief than the <italic>Vatari Guggulu</italic> group (group B). Thus, <italic>Basti</italic> can be thought of as an ultimate solution for the eradication of <italic>Vata Dosha</italic>, after which <italic>Vatari Guggulu</italic> can maintain it by its <italic>Dipana, Amapachana</italic>, anti-inflammatory, and antiarthritic properties On comparing the effect of two therapies it can be concluded that <italic>Matra Basti</italic> provides significantly better relief than <italic>Vatari Guggulu</italic> in most of the signs and symptoms of the disease.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Rakshita</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Datta</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Vaidhya</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Madhava Nidana.
