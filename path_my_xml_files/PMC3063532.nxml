These include cardiovascular disease (doubled risk), chronic renal failure, retinal damage which can lead to blindness and is the most significant cause of adult blindness in the non-elderly in the developed world, nerve damage, erectile dysfunction (impotence), to gangrene with risk of amputation of toes, feet, and even legs. Research has shown that improved glycemic control reduces the rate and number of diabetes-related complications. Evidence suggests that patients who are more knowledgeable about diabetes self-care may be more likely to achieve better glycemic control. Although patient education is an integral component of diabetes care, there remain uncertainties regarding the effectiveness of different methods and modes of education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>).</p><p>Training in self-management is integral to the treat-ment of diabetes. Proper management requires patients to be aware of the nature of the disease, its risk factors, its treatment and its complications. Therapeutic patient education is a patient-centred approach, focussed on patients' needs, resources, values and strategies. It allows patients to improve their knowledge and skills not only concerning their illness but also their treatment. It brings a better quality of life, a greater therapeutic compliance and a reduction in complications(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). University of Venda study revealed that the outcome of diabetes depends mainly on the patient's self-management. Health care professionals therefore have a major responsibility to assist patients to acquire the essential knowledge, skills and attitudes towards self-management(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>).</p><p>The 1989 Declaration of St. Vincent was the result of international efforts to improve the care accorded to those with diabetes. Several countries established more and less successful national diabetes programmes to improve treatment of the disease(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>).</p><p>WHO has projected that diabetes as a major public health concern worldwide, will become the leading cause of global disease burden in the new millennium both in the developed and developing countries. In the developed world, the estimated increase is approximately 46%, from 55 million in 2000 to 83 million in 2030; whereas, among developing nations, the estimated increase is approximately 150%, from 30 million in 2000, to 80 million in 2030(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>).</p><p>The lack of positive attitude could be an important barrier for long term management of diabetes. This study was conducted to assess the level of awareness and perception regarding diabetes mellitus among the general population of Sikkim attending a diabetic education programme and the associations between the elements of knowledge and perception, and socio-demographic factors before and after health education intervention. So far there has been no study done in this field in the state of Sikkim in India.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study Design </title><p>An experimental study of Non-Randomised Trial. Study period: 19th September 2004 (one day activity). Setting: Central Referral Hospital (CRH) of SMIMS, Tadong in Sikkim of India. Study Population: 189 adult individuals in the age group 18 years and above from East Sikkim, who attended the &#x0201c;Diabetes Awareness Camp&#x0201d; at Central Referral Hospital, Tadong, Sikkim, India. </p><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Sampling Technique</title><p> Non-probability purposive Sampling method was applied using Snowball Technique for selecting the respon-dents. Main outcome measures: awareness and perception regarding diabetes mellitus among the general population. Content validity &#x00026; reliability of study instruments: The Health Education module on Diabetes was developed on information provided in the WHO TRS. The experts of Community Medicine assessed the content validity of the Health Education Module by pre-testing on randomly selected sample of 20 adult visitors of Central Referral Hospital (CRH) prior to the study for ensuring feasibility acceptability time management and reliability following which some of the questions from the interview schedule were modified. By initial translation, back-translation, re-translation followed by pilot study the questionnaire was custom-made for the study. In addition to demographic information, the questionnaire contained questions on knowledge related to diabetes viz., early symptoms, risk factors, body organs affected, personal precautions, diabetic foot care, self injection of insulin and warning signs of hypoglycaemia as well as questions attitude on diabetes viz., willing to get blood sugar tested after 40 years of age, if diagnosed of Diabetes anytime in life, whether the person was willing to visit doctor for regular check-up and continue taking medications for adequate control of Diabetes, if any family member becomes Diabetic anytime in life, whether the person was willing to motivate him/her to visit doctor for regular check-up and continuing prescribed medications. </p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Data collection procedure</title><p>The ethical permission to conduct the study in Central Referral Hospital was taken. All the participants were explained about the purpose of the study and were ensured strict confidentiality and then verbal informed consent was taken from each of them before the interview. The partici-pants were given the options not to participate in the study if they wanted. Then by interview technique we collected the pre-test and post-test data. Details of the questionnaire can be provided, if required. To increase the participatory response, this health education intervention programme was followed by clinical examination and estimation of blood glucose level. Referral services and medication were provided free of cost to the needy patients. </p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The data collected were thoroughly cleaned and entered into Excel spread sheets and analysis was carried out using SPSS, version 11 software.

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>Discussions</title><p>In Sikkim health care services are provided by the government health services network even in the remotest corner. There is no private nursing home in the state. Sikkim Manipal Institute of Medical Sciences with Central referral hospital has been started in the state as the only medical college in this state of Sikkim as public-private partnership. This study highlighted the need for better health information to the patient through large scale awareness interventions regarding diabetes.</p><p>Since majority attended the programme without fasting, Oral Glucose Tolerance Test could be performed on only a few participants, who were never diagnosed of diabetes previously. None of the participants were newly diagnosed of diabetes in this programme. Majority participants had poor knowledge about diabetes and negative attitude towards the disease before the health education intervention and improved after the intervention.</p><p>The study in Tamilnadu suggested that literacy, language and religion are interdependent factors associated with knowledge of diabetes and diabetic retinopathy. One useful approach may be to initiate literacy campaigns with a focus on creating awareness of health-related topics for rural populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>).</p><p>Cochrane study to assess the effectiveness of culturally appropriate diabetes health education on important outcome measures in type 2 diabetes concluded that this appears to have short term effects on glycaemic control and knowledge of diabetes and healthy lifestyles(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>).</p><p>Maryland study to determine the relationship between patients&#x02018; knowledge about their diabetes medications and their blood glucose control observed that patients with greater understanding and knowledge of their diabetes medications demonstrated better glycemic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>).</p><p>The study results in Chennai, India to determine the effectiveness of a large scale multipronged diabetes awareness program provided through community involvement conducted between 2004-2007 at various locations of Chennai as part of the Prevention, Awareness, Counselling and Evaluation [PACE] Diabetes Project were compared to a similar survey carried out, as part of the Chennai Urban Rural Epidemiology Study [CURES] in 2001-2002, which served as a measure of baseline diabetes awareness. Results showed that awareness of a condition called &#x0201c;diabetes&#x0201d; increased significantly from 75.5% in 2001-2002 (CURES) to 81% (p &#x0003c; 0.001) in 2007 (PACE). Significantly more people felt that diabetes could be prevented (p &#x0003c; 0.001), and that a combination of diet and exercise were needed to do so (p&#x0003c; 0.001). Respondents reporting obesity family history of diabetes, hypertension and mental stress as risk factors increased significantly after PACE (p &#x0003c; 0.001). More people were able to correctly identify the eyes (PACE 38.1% compared to CURES-16.1%, p &#x0003c; 0.001), kidney (PACE 42.3% compared to CURES 16.10%, p &#x0003c; 0.001), heart (PACE 4.6% compared to CURES 5.8%, p &#x0003c; 0.001) and feet (PACE 35.0% vs. CURES 21.9%, p &#x0003c; 0.001) as the main organs affected by diabetes. The study concluded that through direct public education and mass media campaigns, awareness about diabetes and its complications can be improved even in a whole city. If similar efforts are implemented state-wise and nationally, prevention and control of non-communicable diseases, specifically diabetes and cardiovascular disease, is an achievable goal in India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>).</p><p>Mass awareness and screening programs are feasible and, through community empowerment, can help in prevention and control of non-commuincable diseases such as diabetes and its complications on a large scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>).</p><p>In a systematic review to examine the clinical effective-ness of patient education models for adults with Type 2 diabetes, however, the researchers found that studies of focused educational interventions did not yield consistent results. Some effects were shown on measures of diabetic control in studies that focused on diet or exercise alone. Although the effects shown were generally small, those that were present did appear to be relatively long-lasting. Based on the evidence, it would seem that education delivered by a team of educators, with some degree of reinforcement of that education made at additional points of contact, may provide the best opportunity for improvements in patient outcomes. Educators need to have time and resources to fulfill the needs of any structured educational programme. There is also a need for education to have a clear programme at the outset. From the evidence reported it is unclear what resources would need to be directed at the educators themselves to ensure that they can deliver programmes successfully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>).</p><p>The health education module on diabetes was well accepted by the general community. The participatory response was more due to the fact that this health education intervention programme was followed by clinical examina-tion and estimation of blood glucose level. This kind of health education intervention activity coupled with clinical investigations is much accepted by the general community than health education or screening programme alone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, our structured group education programme encapsulates a patient centred approach to augment awareness on the diabetes care at a time when the global realization has reached a consensus on the aggressively medical therapies to reach glycaemic targets, This study highlighted the need for better health information to the patient through large scale awareness programmes so as to change the attitude and practices of public regarding diabetes. It has also explored several aspects of diabetes related awareness and identified the need for improvement in their practices for treating and educating diabetics. The findings also indicated that there lies an ocean of difference between the fact on diabetes and that of true life practice among general mass of the capital of this north-eastern hilly state of India. We should also have to spend some extra time in case of counselling of close associates and relatives of the diabetic patients separately to motivate them in a socio-cultural setting both inside hospital as well as in the community. Additional studies are needed to delineate these findings further.</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Strengths and limitations of the study</title><p>The limitations and difficulties of doing pragmatic intervention trials in a tertiary care setting are well recog-nised. The lack of difference in observation may result from a lack of sensitivity in the tool used as the sample size was not large enough.</p><p>The study has several strengths. The programme module was intended as the first step in an ongoing general health education programme. We applied the benefits of providing structured education. As this intervention is offered as primary prevention, it has to be developed and followed up later to understand the reason further.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-4"><title>Recommendation</title><p>Diabetes mellitus is a major public health problem and along with its complications contribute a significant amount of burden on the society. Lack of awareness has resulted in an increased number of diabetics over the years. It would be of immense impact if this activity could be replicated at other government and private health care organizations to generate awareness among people about diabetes prevention and how to live optimum quality life with the disease. Awareness and health education programmes are recommended to update the family physicians on early detection and management of diabetes.</p><p>Any future research should consider patient education within the context of overall diabetes care and as such follow guidelines for the development and evaluation of complex interventions. Good-quality, longer-term studies would be desirable, but these would require careful consideration around the nature of any control group. Information is needed to clarify the sensitivity of diabetes education programmes to the performance of the diabetes educators, in order to ensure success and cost-effectiveness of education programmes. Health education is by far the best vaccine to prevent and it needs to be strengthened. Thus, the study of understanding the various factors that could change the perception and awareness about diabetes among the general population may come out to be useful for the successful implementation of diabetes control program in the state. So far there has been no study done in this field in the state and to the horizon of our knowledge this was one of the first studies from North East part of India. India is a multi-cultural multi-lingual and geographically uneven country. Any short term solution will not help us to reach the goal of diabetes control in India in near future. The health professionals alone will not be able to meet this mammoth task.</p><p>We have to evaluate the effectiveness of the education programmes on biomedical, psychosocial, and lifestyle measures in people to generate awareness about slow epidemic of Diabetes and positive change in attitude of health planners for optimum quality life for our future generations.</p><p>Given the findings in the present study, the following recommendations are made.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-4"><title> Health education</title><p>Health education system needs to improve knowledge about Diabetes among the people with lesser educational level. It could be done by means of improving educational tools preferably based on audiovisual techniques to create wider awareness about the importance of Diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-4"><title>Removal of myths and misconceptions</title><p>The information education and communication system must have some productive advertisements to motivate the general public for Diabetes. The advertisements need to address the risk factor, which is of great concern to all the Diabetics. It also must focus on clearing the myths and misconceptions about Diabetes and keep the people well informed about the importance of prolonging life with good quality of life of Diabetics.</p></sec><sec id="sec6-4"><title>Provision of better research facilities </title><p>The results point to find out the areas which need more attention in terms of resources and planning. Making people aware of recent findings, like strict control of risk factors is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events in Diabetics is our responsibility.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group
