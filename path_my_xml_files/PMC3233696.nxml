At the end of period II, patients receiving SC abatacept continued treatment and patients on placebo were reintroduced to SC abatacept (12-week open-label period III). The co-primary end points were ELISA-detected immunogenicity rate and safety at the end of period II. Efficacy was also monitored.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 167 patients entering period I, 72% qualified for period II; during periods II and III, three patients discontinued treatment. Mean (SD) disease duration was 6.6 (6.5) years and Disease Activity Score 28 was 4.8 (0.8). The primary end point was met, with a non-significant increase in immunogenicity upon withdrawal (7/73 placebo vs 0/38 abatacept in period II; p=0.119) which was reversed upon reintroduction of SC abatacept (2/73 vs 1/38, end period III). Safety was comparable regardless of withdrawal, with no unexpected events upon reintroduction. Two patients experienced reactions at the SC injection site. On withdrawal, patients experienced slight worsening in efficacy which improved following reintroduction.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Overall immunogenicity to SC abatacept is low, consistent with intravenous abatacept, and is not significantly affected by a 3-month interruption and reintroduction. This stop&#x02013;start schedule was well tolerated, with little impact on safety and efficacy. These are important considerations for the clinical use of SC abatacept.</p></sec><sec><title>ClinicalTrials gov</title><p>Identifier NCT00533897</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) receive long-term treatment and sometimes require interruption of therapy&#x02014;for example, in the event of surgery or side effects.

On day 1, patients received a single intravenous dose of abatacept (&#x0223c;10 mg/kg based on weight range; the &#x02018;loading dose&#x02019;), followed 30 min later by SC abatacept 125 mg. The single intravenous loading dose was given to ensure target therapeutic trough concentrations were achieved as quickly as possible. Thereafter, SC abatacept 125 mg was delivered at weekly intervals for the remainder of the 12-week period. Disease activity was assessed at day 78. Patients who had achieved an improvement in DAS28 (reduction of &#x02265;0.6 from baseline; one times the measurement error and statistically considered a change) were randomised into period II; patients with DAS28 reduction &#x0003c;0.6 could directly enter the LTE.</p><p>Period II (Withdrawal) was a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled period ending on day 169, in which patients were randomised 2:1 to SC placebo or SC abatacept 125 mg/week. Patients could prematurely enter period III if RA symptoms persisted or worsened after symptomatic treatment in this period. This 12-week withdrawal period was determined to be sufficient for assessing development of immunogenicity because, at this time, serum concentrations of abatacept would be too low to interfere with the assay, and any immunosuppressive effect of abatacept that may interfere with immunogenicity would have ceased.</p><p>Period III (Reintroduction) was an OL 12-week period ending on day 253. To enter period III, patients had to have been treated in (but not necessarily completed) period II. In all patients regardless of randomisation group, OL SC abatacept 125 mg was self-administered weekly throughout period III. Patients who received SC placebo during period II were randomised (1:1) to receive either an intravenous placebo or intravenous abatacept loading dose (approximately 30 min before SC abatacept dosing at the beginning of period III (day 169)) to determine whether the administration of the intravenous abatacept loading dose affected immunogenicity upon reintroduction. Patients randomised to SC abatacept during period II received intravenous placebo loading on day 169 to maintain blinding.</p><p>A 4-week washout period was required for azathioprine, gold, etanercept or anakinra and an 8-week washout period was required for adalimumab or infliximab. Patients receiving sulfasalazine, chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine had to discontinue at screening.</p><p>Throughout the trial, low-dose (&#x02264;10 mg/day prednisone equivalent) oral corticosteroids were permitted but had to be stable for 25 of the 28 days before entry. Additionally, up to two high-dose corticosteroid courses were permitted during period II and one course during periods I and III (excluding 28 days before disease activity assessment at day 78 in period I). Biological and DMARD therapies other than MTX were not permitted. The MTX dose had to be stable (at least 10 mg/week) prior to study entry; increases in MTX dose were not permitted during the study, although decreases were allowed for toxicity.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Immunogenicity assessments</title><p>Blood samples were collected prior to intravenous infusions on days 1 and 169 and prior to SC injections on days 57, 78, 85, 113, 141, 197, 225 and 253. For the primary measure of immunogenicity, two validated ELISAs (Prevalere Life Sciences Inc., Whitesboro, NY, USA) were used; one determined the presence of antibodies to whole molecule abatacept (including both the CTLA4 and IgG portions) and one detected the presence of antibodies to the CTLA4 &#x02018;tip&#x02019; portion alone (CTLA4-T). The primary end point of the study was the immunogenicity rate, expressed as the proportion of patients with an immunogenic response (ELISA) on day 169. In addition to ELISA, an electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunoassay (Meso-Scale Discovery, Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA), which is more sensitive than ELISA, was used as a secondary assay and evaluated throughout. ELISA and ECL samples found positive in screening were verified by a second confirmatory assay and titre determination. Pharmacokinetic assessments were also made in this study and will be presented in a separate report.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Safety assessments</title><p>Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) were classified using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (Version 12.1).

Following reintroduction, all but one of these patients demonstrated an efficacy response at the end of period III based on DAS28 and/or HAQ-DI. None of these seven patients experienced SAEs or severe or drug-related AEs after reintroduction, whether SC abatacept was reintroduced with or without intravenous abatacept loading.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s18"><title>Discussion</title><p>In clinical practice, patients may experience periods when treatment is temporarily withdrawn and reintroduced. Given the risk of increased immunogenicity and the potential impact on safety and efficacy resulting from treatment withdrawal and reintroduction, evaluating these outcomes is important.</p><p>The present study showed that, following a response to SC abatacept, 3-month interruption followed by reintroduction of treatment was well tolerated without a significant impact on immunogenicity. Following withdrawal of SC abatacept, immunogenicity was observed in approximately 10% of patients, with only one showing persistent seropositivity. The increase in immunogenicity for patients withdrawn from treatment was not significantly different from that of patients kept on treatment. After reintroduction of abatacept, &#x0003c;3% of patients demonstrated immunogenicity with only one case of persistent seropositivity. Immunogenicity was low regardless of whether intravenous abatacept or intravenous placebo was administered at reintroduction. Immunogenicity also appeared to have little effect on safety and efficacy, as shown in patients in whom treatment was withdrawn and subsequently reintroduced. Importantly, these data also demonstrate that immunogenicity with SC abatacept is consistent with intravenous administration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></p><p>The low immunogenicity rates observed with SC abatacept mirror those observed in other SC abatacept studies. In a phase II study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> assessing weight-tiered versus fixed SC dosing over 4 months, only one of 51 patients demonstrated immunogenicity. This was transient and the patient was seronegative at study completion. Results from subsequent phase III studies have demonstrated low rates of immunogenicity. In a 4-month OL phase III study of SC abatacept with or without MTX, only four cases of transient immunogenicity were observed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> Immunogenicity observed with SC abatacept<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> is at the lower end of that seen with other biological agents. Immunogenicity rates of between 17% (21 patients) and 20% (46 patients) over 28 weeks have been seen with SC adalimumab,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> immunogenicity rates of approximately 6% (12 patients) over 24 weeks have been reported with SC etanercept<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> and rates of 44% (33 patients) over 24 weeks have been found with intravenous infliximab.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></p><p>The safety of SC abatacept was consistent across periods during this study. Importantly, in patients in whom SC abatacept was withdrawn and reintroduced, the frequency of AEs did not increase and no unexpected events occurred compared with those who received continuous treatment. The incidence of infection with SC abatacept was consistent with intravenous administration, with the majority of events mild or moderate.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> There were no reports of autoimmune events or malignancies. The incidence of injection site reactions was low and all events were mild-to-moderate in intensity. Previous studies with SC abatacept have also reported a low incidence of injection site reactions,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> with fewer events seen with increasing treatment exposure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></p><p>Patients who received continuous SC abatacept treatment had improvements in disease activity and physical function that were maintained over time, supporting the findings in patients with active RA who received SC abatacept with or without background MTX.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> Patients who withdrew SC abatacept treatment for 12 weeks experienced increased disease activity and slight worsening of physical function. Upon reintroduction, improvements in disease activity were noted within 1 month of re-initiation and, by the end of period III, disease activity was comparable with patients who received continuous SC abatacept. Similarly, physical function improved upon reintroduction of SC abatacept. These findings suggest that temporary short-term withdrawal of treatment has a minimal impact on sustained efficacy improvements seen in patients who respond to treatment. These are important findings, and provide some confidence for clinicians that interruption of SC abatacept treatment for up to 3 months is safe and well tolerated with a limited impact on efficacy.</p><p>Certain limitations of the study design should be considered. All patients received background immunosuppressive therapy with MTX, and caution should be used when extrapolating these conclusions to patients on monotherapy. However, a previous study determined that treatment with abatacept alone resulted in comparable immunogenicity to abatacept plus MTX, suggesting that the impact of background MTX on immunogenicity with SC abatacept is minimal.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> Patients were also permitted rescue therapy with high-dose steroids; however, the number of patients who received such rescue therapy is probably too low to influence the findings. Only one 12-week period of withdrawal was evaluated, so the impact of multiple treatment interruptions cannot be determined. However, 12 weeks is felt to be a representative length of withdrawal in clinical practice and is therefore clinically relevant. Furthermore, patients who did not experience any change in disease activity (DAS28 reduction &#x0003c;0.6 from baseline to day 78) were not randomised to the withdrawal period and entered the LTE directly. Such patients could be expected to be at a higher risk of immunogenicity, given the link between clinical response and immunogenicity seen with some biological agents.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> In this study a comparable immunogenicity profile was seen for these patients in the LTE to that seen for patients randomised and treated; this will be examined further in a future report.</p><p>It should be noted that the analyses presented here are based on as-observed data which are vulnerable to drop-outs. However, patient retention in this study was high. Lastly, the DAS28 results were based on CRP, which may yield higher responses than the DAS28 (erythrocyte sedimentation rate); however, CRP has been well validated as an outcome measure to assess disease activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> and is increasingly used in clinical trials.</p><p>In summary, 3-month interruption with subsequent reintroduction of SC abatacept was associated with overall low immunogenicity, a finding consistent with that found with intravenous abatacept. Furthermore, this stop&#x02013;start schedule was well tolerated and did not have a negative effect on efficacy. These findings are important considerations for the clinical use of SC abatacept.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Eve Guichard, Medicus International, for editorial support.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding</bold> This study was sponsored and editorial support funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Competing interests</bold> JK has received research grants from Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer, Abbott, Vertex, Astra Zeneca, Chelsea, Lilly, Roche, Centocor, Merck, Amgen, UCB, Aventis and has participated in speakers' bureaux for Amgen, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation and UCB.
