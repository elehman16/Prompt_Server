However, there is a lack of controlled studies in this area and to date no study of adequate quality on brief psychodynamic psychotherapy for depression during short inpatient stay exists. The present article describes the protocol of a study that will examine the relative efficacy, the cost-effectiveness and the cost-utility of adding an Inpatient Brief Psychodynamic Psychotherapy to pharmacotherapy and treatment-as-usual for inpatients with unipolar depression.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The study is a one-month randomized controlled trial with a two parallel group design and a 12-month naturalistic follow-up. A sample of 130 consecutive adult inpatients with unipolar depression and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score over 18 will be recruited. The study is carried out in the university hospital section for mood disorders in Lausanne, Switzerland. Patients are assessed upon admission, and at 1-, 3- and 12- month follow-ups. Inpatient therapy is a manualized brief intervention, combining the virtues of inpatient setting and of time-limited dynamic therapies (focal orientation, fixed duration, resource-oriented interventions). Treatment-as-usual represents the best level of practice for a minimal treatment condition usually proposed to inpatients. Final analyses will follow an intention&#x02013;to-treat strategy. Depressive symptomatology is the primary outcome and secondary outcome includes measures of psychiatric symptomatology, psychosocial role functioning, and psychodynamic-emotional functioning. The mediating role of the therapeutic alliance is also examined. Allocation to treatment groups uses a stratified block randomization method with permuted block. To guarantee allocation concealment, randomization is done by an independent researcher.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Despite the large number of studies on treatment of depression, there is a clear lack of controlled research in inpatient psychotherapy during the acute phase of a major depressive episode. Research on brief therapy is important to take into account current short lengths of stay in psychiatry. The current study has the potential to scientifically inform appropriate inpatient treatment. This study is the first to address the issue of the economic evaluation of inpatient psychotherapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (ACTRN12612000909820)</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Unipolar depression</kwd><kwd>Inpatient</kwd><kwd>Psychoanalytic psychotherapy</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Therapeutic alliance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Depression is the largest contributor to the burden of disease in high-income countries, with further increase expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Depression may not respond to outpatient treatment and may be so severe that hospital stay may be needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Patients with severe symptoms benefit more from acute inpatient treatment than from day-hospital care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Symptom improvement during first inpatient treatment is a significant predictor of the cumulative length of inpatient stay and the number of inpatient episodes over five years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Those results are consistent with more recent literature that recommends an intensive inpatient acute treatment of depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Due to the shift of locus of mental health care in most Western countries towards outpatient care, research on role and content of acute intensive inpatient psychiatric care have received limited attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The vast majority of depressed inpatients receive pharmacotherapy, but receive psychotherapy less frequently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Several meta-analyses support the advantage of combining pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy to treat outpatients with severe or complex depressive disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The only review of combined therapy for depressed inpatients concluded that combined treatment appeared advantageous in therapy-resistant, chronic and severe forms of depressive disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Its generalizability is limited by relatively small sample sizes and heterogeneity in diagnosis of depression, though. The best well-controlled study available in this field of research compared interpersonal psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy vs. pharmacotherapy and clinical management for 124 inpatients with major depressive disorder. This randomized controlled trial showed that inpatient depression-specific psychotherapy augmented pharmacotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Meta-analysis and mega-analysis findings support the efficacy of brief psychodynamic therapy for outpatient with depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. While yet unsufficient, research on efficacy and effectiveness of psychodynamic psychotherapy as a inpatient treatment of depression gives some indications to foster examination of its validity. In a review of 9 German studies, inpatient psychotherapy, mostly psychodynamic, demonstrated good efficacy (average effect size, d = 0.84). Depression and obsessive-compulsive disorders showed the best results, but usually for psychotherapies of longer duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. One cohort study on a sample of 83 consecutive inpatients examined the outcomes of short-term psychodynamic inpatient psychotherapy. Over the course of the 4 weeks of treatment, distress returned to normal range for 64% of patients and remained stable one year later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This study had two major limitations. It was a complete analysis and it did not compare the treatment to a valid comparator. Based on a randomized control trial with a two parallel group design, one study explored the efficacy of an interpersonal brief (5 weeks) and intensive (15 individual and 8 group sessions) psychotherapy program combined with pharmacotherapy compared to medication and clinical management. Response rate (70% vs 51%) and remission rate (49% vs. 34%) were higher for psychotherapeutic group at discharge; after the three-month follow-up the relapse rate (3% vs. 25%) also favored the psychotherapeutic group; finally between treatment effect sizes evolved from moderate (at discharge) to large during the follow-up period (3 and 12 months) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Results for a subsample of 45 patients with chronic depression revealed also a significantly greater reduction of depressive symptoms, as well as better global functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Little systematic research has been conducted into the ideal dosage of brief psychotherapy. Evidence come from the outpatient setting. Between 12 and 18 sessions of therapy are required for 50% of patients to improve, according to a clinical significance perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The Second Sheffield Psychotherapy Project found that 16 sessions were significantly more effective than 8 sessions for patients with severe depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The nature of the change aimed at should be taken into account, however [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Recovery from maladaptive interpersonal patterns, for example, typically requires higher doses of psychotherapy than does recovery from symptoms of depression or broader distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Changes at four weeks of inpatient psychotherapy are equivalent to a one-year follow-up for psychological distress but not for interpersonal problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>Inpatient psychiatric treatment has been under great economic pressure to cut costs with the result of decrease in length of stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The brevity of inpatient stay has lead to discard psychotherapy and hindered examination of its potential cost-effectiveness. Research in outpatient care has found that although the cost of combination therapy in the initial treatment is substantially higher, these costs are in part offset by lower subsequent treatment costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Improvement during the acute phase of treatment is important because it is associated with lower subsequent costs across the full range of mental health and general medical services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Currently there is no study done on the economicity of inpatient psychotherapy for depression.</p><p>In summary, current state of research support the need for well-controlled trials to examine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of inpatient acute treatment of depression, including adjunctive brief dynamic therapy to augment pharmacological treatment.</p><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The first purpose of the study is to estimate the relative efficacy of combined inpatient brief psychodynamic psychotherapy (IBPP) and pharmacotherapy compared to medication and clinical management on short- and long-term outcomes of inpatients with severe, recurrent or chronic depression (including so-called treatment-resistant) according to the DSM-IVTR. The second objective is to study the cost-effectiveness and the cost-utility of the IBPP. The third objective is to document the specific and the combined influence of the therapeutic alliance with the individual psychotherapist and with the clinical team as mediators of patient&#x02019;s change.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This trial is registered as: &#x0201c;Efficacy of an adjunctive brief psychodynamic psychotherapy compared to treatment-as-usual for psychiatric inpatients with unipolar major depressive episode&#x0201d; at the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registy (ACTRN12612000909820). It has been peer-reviewed in the successful funding selection process by the Swiss National Science Foundation (Grant 32003B_135098/1). This protocol proposes a one month randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a 12-month naturalistic follow-up. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> illustrates the two parallel group design where patients included in the study are randomized either to (1) the intervention group (adjunctive short-term dynamic psychotherapy, IBPP), or to (2) the control treatment group, which represents the best level of practice for a minimal treatment condition usually applied to hospitalized patients (treatment-as-usual, TAU). After the one month period, patients will be referred to continuation treatment as usual.

Sessions are 45 minutes long. It is based on the Bush, Rudden &#x00026; Shapiro (2004) manual of psycho-dynamic treatment of depression to help the therapy focalize on relevant depression foci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].

Both manuals were adapted to the brief inpatient setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].

It focuses on both the patient&#x02019;s conscious and unconscious motives for admission. The initial hypothesis is based on the dynamic relationship established between the therapist and the patient during the first three sessions (pre-transference), on the patient&#x02019;s present crisis, and on the dynamics that form the core of his/her depressive episode. Following sessions focalize further on helping the patient to gain a better understanding of the psychological factors that led to the emergence of depressive symptoms and to address his/her vulnerability to those dynamics.

Only the post-treatment measurement will be after one month, which is anyway close to the mean patient stay (26.2 days).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients recruitment</title><p>All patients hospitalized in the clinical unit with a diagnosis of major unipolar depression are referred to the project, interviewed for eligibility by a research assistant (RA) and then given the intake assessment battery. Patients giving informed consent (to be randomly assigned to one of the treatment settings; to participate in the diagnostic and psychometric procedure; to agree, if necessary, that psychotherapy sessions are audio recorded; and to take part in the follow-up measurements) are then randomized in one of the two treatment groups. Assessment with the same instruments are also done after one month of treatment (in a in- or partially out-patient setting), then after 3 months and 12 months follow-up. Cases will be considered as dropout if they had less than 5 sessions. Study is currently continuing follow-up. It is closed to recruitment of participants (as of June 2012).</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>Allocation to treatment groups is done using a stratified block randomization method with permuted block (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomization.com">http://www.randomization.com</ext-link>). Three stratification variables are used to ensure treatment balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]: age (two levels: x&#x0003c;=40&#x0003c;y), gender (two levels: M/F), and chronicity - that full criteria for a Major Depressive Episode have been continuously met for at least 2 years (two levels: Y/N).</p></sec><sec><title>Blinding</title><p>To guarantee allocation concealment, randomization was done by a totally independent researcher, and each allocation was given to the recruiting RA in a sealed envelope prior to seeing a new patient. The envelope was opened if and only if the patient is included in the protocol. Observers are blinded to treatment arm.</p></sec><sec><title>Rater training</title><p>DIGS are done by experienced raters working at the Epidemiology and Psychopathology Research Unit, directed by one co-applicant (Prof. M. Preisig). Extensive training is provided for the MADRS (one hour weekly during three months) for the RAs. At the end of the training, an inter-rater reliability of at least ICC(2,1) &#x0003e; .75 should be reached. Inter-rater reliability will be calculated for 20% of the cases. All raters are blind of the clinical data.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Final analyses will follow an intention-to-treat strategy comparing patients in the groups to which they were originally randomized. Clinical Significance method will be used to estimate rates of response (reliable improvement), remission (clinical significance), recovery (maintained clinical significance) and relapse (deterioration) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. For short-term outcome, repeated-measure analyses of variance (ANOVA) and analyses of covariance (ANCOVA - controlling for pretreatment scores and patient&#x02019;s age) will be used on all outcome measures. For long-term outcome, linear mixed-effects models will be preferred, as well as for therapist and alliance effects on outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) will be used for missing data when appropriate. Latent class analysis (using Latent Gold 4.5) will be done to explore the effect of moderating variables.</p><p>Cost-effectiveness analysis will be done in collaboration with the Institute of Health Economics and Management (IHEM) of the University of Lausanne. An economist at the IHEM will be in charge of the data analysis. The economic evaluation will be conducted from the perspective of the health system. Primary outcome will be remission in depressive symptomatology at 12 months. The comprehensively measured service costs between the two treatments will be compared with the difference in change in the primary outcome measure and with the difference between the treatments in QALYs gained.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Despite the large number of studies on treatment of depression, there is a clear lack of controlled research in inpatient psychotherapy during the acute phase of a major depressive episode. Research on brief therapy is important to take into account current short lengths of stay in psychiatry. The current study has the potential to scientifically inform appropriate inpatient treatment. Psychodynamic psychotherapy has shown some promising signs of efficacy but more controlled studies are strongly needed in order to be empirically validated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. This is a very important issue, at least for European countries like Switzerland, France or Germany where psychoanalytic psychotherapy remains the most practiced form of therapy. It may also provide indications of appropriate inpatient treatment to countries where inpatient psychiatric research has become difficult due to economic pressure. As for antidepressant drugs and various types of psychotherapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy is unlikely to be a universal therapy for depression and progress depends on identifying its most appropriate ecological niche [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>].</p><p>This study is the first to address the issue of the economic evaluation of inpatient psychotherapy. Psychotherapy is costly in time and money; thus evidence of the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of a short adjunctive psychotherapy as an alternative treatment to longer hospitalization or outpatient aftercare would be an important healthcare finding.</p><p>The project has a direct impact on the functioning of the inpatient clinical unit. The implementation of a manualized practice (for psychotherapy and psychiatric treatment-as-usual) will help to improve the organization of the inpatient care and to better structure the clinicians&#x02019; training.</p><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This research has notable strength in its randomized controlled design. It compares the intervention to the state-of-the-art inpatient treatment of depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Treatments are manualized and adherence to the psychotherapy is monitored. Most important potential confounders predicting depression outcome are assessed. Despite these strengths, this research has some important limitations. It doesn&#x02019;t compare the intervention to another active treatment. The intervention is added to the treatment-as-usual. One might argue that patient in the intervention arm will get more therapeutic attention. However, from a quantitative point of view, 12 hours of therapy over 4 weeks of hospitalisation doesn&#x02019;t add much of therapeutic attention. Furthermore, we believe it would be unethical to compare psychotherapy and clinical management to medication and clinical management. First, medication and clinical management is probably the most used treatment for inpatients with major depressive episode. Second, evidence suggest that a combined treatment is recommended for severe depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The 12-month follow-up is naturalistic. Most patients will benefit of ongoing pharmacological and/or psychotherapeutic treatment in both groups after hospital discharged.</p></sec><sec><title>Future research</title><p>Within a total health care delivery system, it is important to optimize the integration of inpatient and outpatient services. The next step in this project will be to select patients according to their response to the inpatient treatment and control for the outpatient psychotherapeutic after-care, as this has been neglected up till now [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>From a research perspective, if some evidence that IBPP is effective were to be found, it would then be interesting to have a better understanding of the processes by which IBPP achieves its results. The data gathered in this trial will constitute a &#x0201c;gold mine&#x0201d; for process-outcome studies in psychodynamic psychotherapy.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>IBPP: Inpatient Brief Psychodynamic Psychotherapy; TAU: Treatment-as-usual.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>All authors declare that: (1) No author has support for the submitted work; (2) Authors have no relationships that might have an interest in the submitted work in the previous 3 years; (3) their spouses, partners, or children have no financial relationships that may be relevant to the submitted work; and (4) Authors have no non-financial interests that may be relevant to the submitted work.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>JND had the idea of the research.
