increase respiratory capacity by classifying exercises into voluntary respiratory exercise
which relieves symptoms and prevents COPD and exercise using breathing exercise equipment.
But this study found changes on respiratory pattern through changes on the activity
pattern of agonist and synergist respiratory muscles and studied what effect they can have
on body function improvement. [Subjects and Methods] Fifteen subjects in experimental
group I that respiratory exercise of diaphragm and 15 subjects in experimental group II
that feedback respiratory exercise were randomly selected among COPD patients to find the
effective intervention method for COPD patients. And intervention program was conducted
for 5 weeks, three times a week, once a day and 30 minutes a session. They were measured
with BODE index using respiratory muscle activity, pulmonary function, the six-minute
walking test, dyspnea criteria and BMI Then the results obtained were compared and
analyzed. [Results] There was a significant difference in sternocleidomastoid muscle and
scalene muscle and in 6-minute walk and BODE index for body function. Thus the group
performing feedback respiratory had more effective results for mild COPD patients.
[Conclusion] Therefore, the improvement was significant regarding the activity of
respiratory muscles synergists when breathing before doing breathing exercise. Although,
it is valuable to reduce too much mobilization of respiratory muscles synergists through
the proper intervention it is necessary to study body function regarding improvement of
respiratory function for patients with COPD.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Breathing exercise</kwd><kwd>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</kwd><kwd>Respiratory muscle activity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is predicted and reported as the third cause
of death in 2030 by World Health Organization (WHO) and is receiving gaining attention due
to the increase in elderly population, in addition to the pollution worsening all over the
world. Besides, it is known that occurrence rate and death rate increases every subsequent
year this way, managing respiratory diseases is very important including COPD<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Patients with COPD have anatomophysiological changes such as a limitation in the shape of
the diaphragm and thoracic cage<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. These
make patients more seriously impaired, leading to complains about dyspnea, a symptoms caused
by airway obstruction while exercising.</p><p>As a result, it causes changes of muscle mass due to decrease of momentum and the stamina
and becomes the factor affecting respiratory muscles<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. When patients with COPD breathe, the actual respiration volume is
decreasing despite of the effort for respiration. This occurs because the demand for
respiration is not consistent with the energy ratio supplied by respiratory muscles<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. And as the disease gets worse, respiratory
failure appears and other body functions are negatively influenced due to deformation of the
ventilation mechanism by overuse of respiratory muscles synergists<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. If COPD occurs once, it is impossible to cure it
completely. Because it causes not only damage of the respiratory machinery, but also several
physical damages and affects overall life pattern and normal body function<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, fragmentary studies on
characteristics of respiratory muscles are being done to increase respiratory capacity by
classifying exercises into voluntary respiratory exercises which improves symptoms and
prevents COPD and exercise using breathing exercise equipment<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. But when the studies analyzing the respiratory muscles activity
changes are being done, it is necessary to pay attention to respiratory muscles activity
changes before and after the respiratory exercise. This research intends to examine the
effect of agonist and synergist muscles by comparing respiratory muscles activity after the
patients were submitted to respiratory exercises, as well as to find out the effective
intervention method by comparing the respiratory muscles pattern and its effects on body
functions.</p><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>This study was approved by Sehan University Center&#x02019;s bioethics Committee (IRB) (Approval

diaphragm respiration exercise and 15 subjects for experiment group II that performed
feedback respiration exercise. The mediation program was done for 5 weeks, three times a
week, once a day, and 30 minutes a session. Before doing the exercise, respiratory muscles
activity was measured with surface electromyogramand body function was measured with BODE
index using pulmonary function, 6-minute walking test, dyspnea criteria, BMI and then the
result was analyzed through comparison of the data obtained before and after the exercise
within the group and between groups.</p><p>Method of feedback respiration exercise consisted on the patient sitting straight and
holding a handle with respiration pocket, having a mouth piece in the mouth and staring at
the connector. The therapists pushed the start button of the connector. And when the
patients see the orange gradation of the body reaching the &#x0201c;in&#x0201d; mark, they inhale and when
it goes to &#x0201c;out&#x0201d; mark, they exhale. If there is a beeping sound with a green light when
orange mark is on &#x0201c;in&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;out&#x0201d;, that means normal feedback respiration exercise. Enough
explanation was given to them before doing exercise so that patients understand the method
of this exercise. It was conducted within the range not to happen hypocarbia during
inhaling and exhaling at maximum level<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Method of diaphragm respiration exercise consists on the therapists&#x02019; hands placing on
rectus abdominis located just below front costal cartilages and then they induce patients
to inhale slowly and deeply through their nose. At this time, therapists apply proper
resistance to rectus abdominis of patients when rectus abdominis rises and induce them to
inhale deeply, and patients relax their shoulder and maintain it realaxed during inhaling
deeply. Upper chest is fixed not to be moved and only rise of abdomen is allowed<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Surface EMG MP 100 system (Biopac, USA) 4 channels were used to measure muscle activity
of respiratory muscle and sampling rate for EMG signal collection was set 1000 and
frequency band filter was set 20&#x02013;450&#x02005;Hz. To minimize skin resistance of EMG signal,
subjects&#x02019; hair was removed from their skin and dead skin cells were removed using thin
sandpaper. And then their skin was rubbed with alcohol cotton and was kept in clean
conditions. Two surface electrodes of Ag/Agcl were attached to belly of each muscle in a
direction parallel to muscular fiber at 2&#x02005;cm interval. Standard electrodes were attached
to spine of 12th backbone and scapula spine that are protruding parts. EMG signals of
right sternocleidomastoid muscle, scalene muscle, external intercostal muscle and
diaphragm were collected<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Signals of measured muscle were converted to root mean
square (RMS) and EMG signal analysis was done using Acknowledge 3.9.1 software program
(Biopac, USA). Besides, root mean square was measured for 10 times by breathing naturally
after making patients sit comfortably to normalize EMG signal of subjects. Average value
of RMS of eight respirations was set as RMS when doing standard motion except RMS of first
and final respiration. In addition, subjects breathed at the level 30% of maximum
inhalation pressure using Threshold Inspiratory Muscle Trainer (New Jersey, USA) which is
an inhalation respiration exercise equipment and RMS value was quantified<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Chestgraph HI-701 (Chest, Japan) was
used to measure pulmonary function and it was measured in the way that patients hold the
respiration machine in their mouth in a sitting position and inhale at maximum level and
then exhale with all their strength. Pulmonary capacity was measured over 3 times at least
and measured figure within 200&#x02005;ml or 5% in the difference between the biggest figure and
the second biggest figure. 6-minute walk was used to measure distance traveled. It marked
the track at 1&#x02005;m interval in indoor space and measurers turned on the stopwatch designed
to be rung 6 minutes later when subjects started to walk, and when bell rang 6 minutes
later, he measured the distance calculating the intervals marked by 1&#x02005;m. BODE index is
composed of 4 items which are forced expiration capacity for 1 second (FEV1%pred),
6-minute walking distance (m), MMRC dyspnea score, BMI (BMI,&#x02005;kg/m). Each item was
evaluated with 0&#x02013;3 score and then the total score was added for measurement<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>SPSS 18.0 for window was used as data processing method and Shapiro-Wilk was used to test

respiratory muscles caused by mechanical problems of worsening respiration patterns.
Duiverman et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> found that activity of
sternocleidomastoid and scalene muscles in patients with COPD increases a lot when compared
to normal adults while exercising. This finding was a result of comparing muscle activity
and dyspnea after a particular set of exercises performedfor 10 minutes targeting patients
with COPD. This result was related to the increase of dyspnea. As Tomich et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> observed, the air-centered activity of
sternocleidomastoid muscle in the exercises performed is a result of its activity. The
movements of chest and abdomen observed while conducting respiratory exercises with
diaphragm respiration, air-center and capacity-center have identified 17 normal people. In
this research, we could see that activities of sternocleidomastoid and scalene muscles
decrease in the group performing feedback respiration exercise when compared to the group
performing diaphragm respiratory exercise. Deep and slow inhalation, as done in feedback
respiratory exercise decreases activity of sternocleidomastoid muscle. So, it is effective
to inhibit overusing synergists of respiratory muscle. Chiti et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> found that activity of scalene muscle was increased in
dyspnea, inhalation induction, inhalation effort and it would be useful to reduce synergist
muscle activity such as scalene muscle during mechanical ventilation. Loring et al.<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted a research in which 12 healthy
people performed 2 sets of 30 repetitions each with 40% of initial maximum inspiratory
pressure and as a result, muscle activity of diaphragm that is agonist of the respiratory
muscles was greatly increased when inhaling. Changes in muscle activity of diaphragm were
shown to improve respiratory ability because of its synergy effect while these two muscles
are doing inhalation. These findings and supported this research, so He can see that
increase of activity by feedback respiration exercise is effective to reduce mechanical
respiratory load.</p><p>COPD makes respiration hard due to decrease of lung capacity caused by deformation of
thoracic cage by mechanical dynamics. Thus, the respiratory synergists play an important
role in the maintenance of pulmonary function in these patients<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. To COPD patients, body function&#x02019;s state forms very close
relation in conducting daily routines and 6-minute walk and BODE index are meaningful in
comparing the effect that indicates functional activity by mediation of lung<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Alexandra et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> found that level of 6-minute walking and functional
activity have increased in the group that has performed mobile feedback every day for 2
weeks targeting COPD patients. And Mei<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>
mediated respiration pursing up lips that can heighten the activity of respiratory synergist
in daily routine movements and exercise training by session targeting 101 COPD and after
this mediation, BODE index and daily routine function were improved. This research could
also see that 6-minute walk and BODE index have increased significantly in group for
feedback respiratory exercise in comparison to the group for diaphragm respiratory exercise.
Yamaguti et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> mediated diaphragm
respiratory exercise for a total of 45 minutes repeating 3 sets a session of 10 repetitions
each, three times a week for 4 weeks targeting 30 patients with COPD and there was a
meaningful difference in 6-minutes walking test and motility of diaphragm 4 weeks later. But
there was no meaningful difference in BODE index and this fact supported this research. The
reason is that respiratory muscle exercise can obtain inhalation flow or inhalation pressure
set as aims using resistant respiration during training for improvements of respiratory
function<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Especially feedback
respiratory exercise helps to improve endurance and strength of muscle by applying load to
inhalation synergist and diaphragm<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. So,
feedback respiratory exercise mobilizing respiratory synergist when compared to respiratory
exercise of diaphragm is considered to help to improve body function. Watz et al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> say that another problem of COPD which is
not researched is the difference between different physical activities at severe stage of
COPD. Although symptoms are weak, it is difficult to recover after there was a lung damage
and the progress of symptoms can change the functional pattern of life with structural
problems, it implies importance of breathing exercise before reaching severe levels of
damage.</p><p>This research found that of respiratory muscles synergists activities in patients with mild
COPD decreased because deformed thoracic cage and contraction of peripheral muscles were
solved by mechanical advantage and it worked as a necessary factor for maintenance of
respiratory function. It was possible to see the significant improvement in activity of
synergists of respiratory muscles when breathing before doing breathing exercises, but it is
valuable to reduce too much mobilization respiratory muscles synergists through the proper
intervention. It is considered that it is necessary to study body function for the
improvement of respiratory function for patients with COPD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This paper was supported by the Sehan University Research Fund in 2016.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">WHO: Chronic obstructive
