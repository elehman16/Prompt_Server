This effect appears most robust when a low energy dense preload is consumed before meals. Yet, much discussion continues regarding the optimal form of a preload. The purpose of the present study was to compare effects of a solid (grapefruit), liquid (grapefruit juice) and water preload consumed prior to breakfast, lunch and dinner in the context of caloric restriction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Eighty-five obese adults (BMI 30-39.9) were randomly assigned to (127 g) grapefruit (GF), grapefruit juice (GFJ) or water preload for 12 weeks after completing a 2-week caloric restriction phase. Preloads were matched for weight, calories, water content, and energy density. Weekly measures included blood pressure, weight, anthropometry and 24-hour dietary intakes. Resting energy expenditure, body composition, physical performance and cardiometabolic risk biomarkers were assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The total amount (grams) of food consumed did not change over time. Yet, after preloads were combined with caloric restriction, average dietary energy density and total energy intakes decreased by 20-29% from baseline values. Subjects experienced 7.1% weight loss overall, with significant decreases in percentage body, trunk, android and gynoid fat, as well as waist circumferences (-4.5 cm). However, differences were not statistically significant among groups. Nevertheless, the amount and direction of change in serum HDL-cholesterol levels in GF (+6.2%) and GFJ (+8.2%) preload groups was significantly greater than water preload group (-3.7%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These data indicate that incorporating consumption of a low energy dense dietary preload in a caloric restricted diet is a highly effective weight loss strategy. But, the form of the preload did not have differential effects on energy balance, weight loss or body composition. It is notable that subjects in GF and GFJ preload groups experienced significantly greater benefits in lipid profiles.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00581074">NCT00581074</ext-link></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>As the clinical and economic burden of obesity grows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], practical interventions for weight management offer considerable therapeutic and cost containment advantages. Dietary strategies range from restricting calories, manipulating macronutrient composition or enhancing single nutrients, to altering energy density. Accumulating evidence indicate that reducing dietary energy density (kilocalories per gram of food) increases satiety and decreases energy intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This effect appears most robust when a low energy dense preload is consumed before meals. For example, women who consumed a low energy dense soup preload rated their hunger and prospective food consumption significantly lower and consumed 26% fewer calories in subsequent meals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In another experiment, women reported feeling more full and consumed 7-12% less calories from lunch after a low energy dense salad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. While some studies indicate that solids have greater effects on reducing food and energy intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], others demonstrate that liquids can be as effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Thus, the evidence on the optimal form of a preload, i.e. solid, semi-solid or liquid, remains inconclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>While it appears that the water content of the item predominately determines its energy density and effects on intakes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], few studies have been conducted with foods that have naturally high water contents - like fruit. Fruit is also informative because it is readily available in solid, semi-solid and liquid forms. A series of experiments demonstrated significantly less hunger and greater satiety after consuming whole apple, orange and grape compared to apple, orange and grape juice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Further, when matched by energy density, whole apple reduced lunch meal energy intakes more than apple sauce and juice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].Yet, all three forms reduced lunch meal energy intakes compared to no preload. Notably, the above studies were conducted with healthy normal-weight adults. When lean and obese adults were included, the three forms of apple elicited different appetite ratings, but energy intakes did not differ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>The present study was designed to compare the effects of consuming solid and liquid forms of a fruit preload on energy balance, body weight and composition, and cardiometabolic risk factors in free-living obese adults who were prescribed caloric restriction. We chose grapefruit as the preload because grapefruit (GF) and grapefruit juice (GFJ) have high (~91%) water contents. Moreover, consumption of GF and GFJ has been widely publicized in the lay media as an effective strategy for achieving weight loss for over four decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. To rigorously compare preload forms, we matched GF and GFJ preloads by weight, calories, water content, and energy density. In addition, GF and GFJ preloads were compared to a water preload matched by weight (as water has no calories or energy density).</p><p>Since dietary fiber content should reduce energy intake by slowing gastric emptying and inducing early satiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], we hypothesized that subjects consuming GF preloads would experience greater weight loss due to the potential combined effects of low energy density and higher fiber content. We further hypothesized that subjects consuming the GFJ preload would experience greater reductions in cardiometabolic risk due to the potential combined effects of low energy density with higher bioflavonoid content, which is associated with influencing lipoprotein dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subject recruitment and enrollment</title><p>Adults aged 21 to 50 years who responded to print and electronic advertisements were screened by telephone to exclude diabetes, cardiovascular, liver or kidney disease; medications for estrogen replacement, thyroid disease, depression, gastrointestinal disorders; medications metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]; orexigenic agents; and food allergies or medically restricted diets. The Vanderbilt University Institutional Review Board approved the study protocol which was registered in the U.S. National Institutes of Health ClinicalTrials.gov registry (NCT00581074). The study opened for accrual in March 2006 and enrollment closed in January 2007. One hundred seventeen individuals were scheduled for further eligibility assessment by Registered Dietitians (RD) trained in anthropometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and the U.S. Department of Agriculture multi-pass 24-hour diet recall methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].

They were trained to use two-dimensional food portion estimation posters (2D Food Portion Visual, Nutrition Consulting Enterprises, Framingham, MA) and measuring utensils to quantify dietary intakes. Between enrollment and the first clinic visit, RDs conducted unannounced telephone-administered diet recalls to capture 24-hour intakes on two nonconsecutive weekdays and one weekend day determined by a computer-generated randomization scheme.</p></sec><sec><title>Caloric restriction phase</title><p>At the first clinic visit, subjects were prescribed a diet plan providing a 12.5% calorie restriction compared to individual average baseline energy intakes. The macronutrient composition complied with the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges of 30% fat, 50% carbohydrate and 20% protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Meal plans and sample menus were designed by distributing calorie and macronutrient prescription into 3 meals and 3 snacks daily using Exchange Lists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The number of servings for each food group complied with the <italic>Dietary Guidelines for Americans</italic>, 2005. RDs demonstrated meal plan portions using Life/form<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>food models (NASCO, Fort Atkinson, WI). Since meal plans included 3 fruit servings daily, subjects agreed to avoid consuming GF or GFJ during the next two weeks. Subjects also avoided taking dietary supplements throughout the study. As responses to the Baecke questionnaire indicated subjects were sedentary, they were also instructed to maintain usual activities and wear pedometers (Accusplit Eagle 120XL, HRM USA, Levittown, PA) to count steps walked daily. Before scheduling individual counseling sessions for the end of study weeks 1 and 2, RDs demonstrated how to complete daily diet, exchange list and pedometer logs.</p></sec><sec><title>Caloric restriction + preload phase</title><p>Of the 95 enrolled subjects, 85 submitted logs indicating meal plan compliance during the 2-week caloric restriction phase. These 85 were randomized in an open-label, parallel-arm design to one of three preload conditions for the next 12 weeks. The GF group was instructed to consume 1/2 grapefruit (Florida lot 4281, size 36, 256 g unit weight) before breakfast, lunch and dinner. They were trained to cut, peel and portion GF to exclude only the rind. The GFJ group was trained to portion 127 g GFJ (Ocean Spray unsweetened 100% white GFJ) in pre-measured plastic drinking cups. The GF and GFJ preloads were matched for energy density by weight, kilocalories, water and vitamin C contents, but GF provided more fiber and GFJ more bioflavonoid (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The water group was trained to portion 127 g of bottled water (Nestl&#x000e9; Pure Life, Greenwich, CT) in pre-measured cups. Subjects were instructed to consume preloads entirely starting 20 minutes before meals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. During the caloric restriction + preload phase, meal plans for GF and GFJ groups were adjusted by substituting the GF or GFJ preloads for the three daily fruit servings. At weekly clinic visits, RDs collected empty GF, GFJ and water containers, obtained weight and blood pressure, reviewed logs and counseled subjects to facilitate diet adherence, and distributed preload supplies.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Preload Properties *</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th align="center">Weight</th><th align="center">Energy</th><th align="center">Energy Density</th><th align="center">Water</th><th align="center">Vitamin C</th><th align="center">Fiber</th><th align="center">Naringin**</th></tr><tr><th/><th align="center">(g)</th><th align="center">(kcal)</th><th align="center">(kcal/g)</th><th align="center">(g)</th><th align="center">(mg)</th><th align="center">(g)</th><th align="center">(mg)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Grapefruit</td><td align="center">128</td><td align="center">42</td><td align="center">0.331</td><td align="center">115.8</td><td align="center">42.3</td><td align="center">1.13</td><td align="center">27.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Grapefruit Juice</td><td align="center">127</td><td align="center">46</td><td align="center">0.370</td><td align="center">115.0</td><td align="center">48.3</td><td align="center">0.13</td><td align="center">39.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Water</td><td align="center">127</td><td align="center">0</td><td align="center">0</td><td align="center">127.0</td><td align="center">0</td><td align="center">0</td><td align="center">0</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>*The amounts of each variable are based on averaging several pieces of fruit and juice using values obtained from NDS-R, Bowes &#x00026; Church's [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and data provided by the State of Florida Department of Citrus.</p><p>**Naringin content was chosen to represent bioflavonoid content as it comprises the majority of total flavanones in GF and GFJ, and has been associated with changes in cardiometabolic risk factors.

After weight and vital signs were obtained, visual analog scales (VAS) were administered for subjects to rate hunger, thirst, satiety (amount that could be consumed), appetite (desire for food) and fullness by marking "x" on a 100-mm line anchored with extremes such as "nothing at all" and "an extremely large amount" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. For measurement of resting energy expenditure (REE), subjects laid supine, room lights were dimmed, and subjects were habituated to breathing under the canopy in thermoneutral conditions.

The study is unique because: 1) we utilized solid and liquid forms of a fruit preload that were matched for weight, energy, water contents, and thus, energy density; 2) GF and GFJ preloads were compared to a water preload matched by weight (127 g) since the composition of GF and GFJ is ~91% water; and 3) preloads were ingested 20 minutes before meals to avoid potential confounding effects of orogastrointestinal satiety signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Thus, any differential responses to the preload strategy would result from the higher fiber content of GF or higher bioflavonoid content of GFJ.</p><p>Under these conditions, dietary energy density reduced 20-28% and total energy intakes decreased 21-29% after preloads were incorporated into the meal plan. Interestingly, reduced energy intakes were not associated with higher VAS ratings of hunger, indicating that subjects remained satiated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. If the amount (grams) of food consumed is a determinant of hunger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], the lack of perceived hunger may be explained by the consistent amount of food consumed throughout the study. It is intriguing that subjects not only adjusted the total amount of their food intakes to incorporate the amount of the preloads, but also compensated for the energy content of the preloads by decreasing energy intakes from meals and snacks to achieve an overall reduction in total energy intakes.</p><p>The reduction in dietary energy density and energy intakes achieved represents an 8.5-16.5% (~250-500 kcal/d) greater reduction in calories consumed during the caloric restriction + preload phase than the 12.5% reduction prescribed during the caloric restriction phase. This finding is consistent with other community-based interventions in which consumption of a low energy dense diet has led to substantial reductions in energy intakes and body weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. In the present study, while the overall weight loss of 7.1% of initial body weight was not statistically different among groups, weight loss was clinically meaningful based on current consensus that 5-10% weight loss decreases cardiometabolic risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>Notably, the additional 8.5-16.5% reduction in energy intakes during the caloric restriction + preload phase was physiologically consistent with the 13.3% increase in the rate of weight loss during that phase. The compensation observed contrasts with some basic science models of energy balance utilizing the concept of negative adiposity feedback signaling to the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and data suggesting that obese individuals would defend adiposity and compensate for weight loss by increasing intakes of energy dense foods or total calories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Nevertheless, our findings are consistent with the ability of individuals at lower BMI to respond to the energy content of an ingested preload [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. That our obese subjects exhibited such a response in the setting of negative energy balance and weight loss suggests that utilization of a low energy dense preload may fundamentally influence mechanisms involved in energy homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>The present data indicate that preload weight and low energy density, not form (solid <italic>vs </italic>liquid), fiber or bioflavonoid content promoted the greater reductions in dietary energy density, total energy intakes, and body weight. While this contrasts with laboratory-based experiments that show differential effects on energy intakes at a meal based on the physical form of food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], it is consistent with data outside of the lab setting where subjects who logged 24-hour food diaries showing no differences in total energy intakes when consuming solid and liquid preloads of several different food items [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>It is also intriguing that the water preload was equally efficacious for reducing energy intakes and body weight. This finding also suggests that it was preload consumption that affected dietary energy density and total energy intakes during the caloric restriction + preload phase. Since water adds weight (and volume) without energy, increasing the amount of water in a food or beverage item is a common method for manipulating energy density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] and incorporating water into beverage, soup and casserole preloads has reduced subsequent lunch meal energy intakes by 7-20% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. In addition, subjects who drank water with breakfast reported less hunger and greater satiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>], and when drinking water replaced caloric beverages energy intakes decreased and subjects lost weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].</p><p>Though improvements in insulin sensitivity and lipoprotein profile frequently occur during weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], we did not detect significant changes in glucose, insulin, or total and LDL-cholesterol. A plausible explanation is that the small changes observed reflect a low level of insulin resistance in these relatively healthy obese subjects. It is striking that HDL-C levels increased up to 8.2% from baseline in GF and GFJ groups, a significant change compared to decreased HDL-C in the water preload group. Since epidemiological evidence indicates that raising HDL-C by only 1 mg/dL reduces cardiovascular risk by 2-3%, this finding supports earlier evidence of potential anti-atherosclerotic effects of GF or GFJ consumption. A possible explanation for the rise in HDL-C is increased antioxidant activity from greater vitamin C and/or flavonoid (ie, naringin) intakes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>], although oxidative stress was not directly measured in the present study.</p><p>While the present study was carefully designed to compare the effects of GF, GFJ and water preloads, limitations are worth considering. In contrast to laboratory-based feeding, it was not possible to blind study RDs and subjects to preload assignment in this community-based dietary intervention. Second, there is no food or beverage that functions as a completely inactive comparator as even water may have metabolic effects under certain conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Yet, the high (~91%) water content of GF and GFJ made the water preload an appropriate control for analytic comparisons. Moreover, including water allowed all groups to experience similar behaviors and orogastric sensations while preloading three times daily for 12 weeks. Third, while we acknowledge that obese adults usually underreport energy intakes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>], the potential for underreporting should be equivalent among subjects as there were no differences by group in baseline BMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Even so, to compensate for potential bias, RDs conducted unannounced randomly scheduled 24-hr recalls by telephone using validated methods and standardized scripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Further, subjects were trained to estimate portion sizes using visual aids designed to improve recall accuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. Additionally, our 24-hr recall and food log data agreed with the expected changes in dietary energy, fiber and vitamin C intakes. These improvements in nutrient intake profiles indicate reliable reporting as well as evidence of high compliance with the dietary protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings complement the accumulating body of evidence demonstrating that clinically significant weight loss can be achieved when consuming a low energy dense preload before meals. Notably, we demonstrate that this type of dietary intervention can occur without decreasing the total amount of food consumed, and thus, without inducing the hunger and dissatisfaction often associated with restrictive diets. Compared to pharmacological trials in free-living obese adults where attrition rates range from 30-40% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>], we achieved a high completion rate (80%), further indication that subjects found the preload strategy satisfying, and they may have gained intrinsic value from interactions with study RDs.</p><p>Further, we extend the evidence by showing that the preload strategy can reduce dietary energy density and total energy intakes in obese adults in free-living conditions regardless of the form of the preload. Obese individuals such as these might be more inclined to utilize the concept of "volumetrics" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>] if encouraged to choose the form of their low energy dense preload based on individual preference. Our data supports such choice in the context of a dietary weight loss intervention and suggests that such interventions have a fundamentally physiological basis.</p><p>Importantly, the bioactive components of some preloads, like GF and GFJ, may confer additional cardiometabolic benefits as evidenced by the very significant increases in serum HDL-cholesterol concentrations in the present trial. Clearly, additional clinical research is needed to investigate the mechanisms by which fruit, juice and water influence energy intake regulation and lipid metabolism.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HJS obtained primary funding for the study, designed and conducted the study, participated in statistical analysis, and conceived of and wrote the article.
