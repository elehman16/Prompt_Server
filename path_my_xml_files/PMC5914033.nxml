Furthermore, discharge from hospital is associated with high risks of social isolation and suicide. This intervention development study aims to describe the rationale, methods and processes of developing an intervention for adults with a diagnosed psychotic disorder following discharge from hospital. The intervention aims to increase participation in self-care and leisure, wellbeing and quality of life and reduce crisis service use.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The UK Medical Research Council framework for the development of complex interventions was used to guide the process of developing the intervention to ensure the developed intervention is empirically justifiable and evidence based. The development involved a systematic and literature reviews and focus groups with people with psychosis and clinical staff to understand the problems the intervention should address and approaches to resolving these.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">A manualised 4-month intervention named Graduating Living skills Outside the Ward (GLOW) was developed for use by occupational therapists for people with a diagnosed psychotic disorder following discharge from hospital. The one-to-one stepped intensity intervention is of 4&#x000a0;months in duration and takes place in the person&#x02019;s home and in community locations. The intervention aims to increase occupational performance of domestic and personal self-care, leisure and some productive roles.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">The intervention developed in this study has potential to improve the efficiency of community mental health services following discharge from hospital as it is evidence-based, time-limited and manualised and aims to reduce hospital admissions and crisis service use. The intervention will be tested to assess its clinical and cost effectiveness in a randomised controlled trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s40814-018-0267-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Community mental health</kwd><kwd>Hospital transition</kwd><kwd>Leisure activities</kwd><kwd>Productive occupations</kwd><kwd>Self-care</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Birken</surname><given-names>Mary</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par13">The current estimated prevalence of psychotic disorders in the UK is 0.7% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and approximately 220,000 people are treated for schizophrenia in the UK by the NHS at any one time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Having schizophrenia is associated with high levels of unemployment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], discrimination and social isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It is the most common diagnostic group to be admitted to acute mental health inpatient services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. An estimated 42,000 people with a diagnosed psychotic disorder are admitted to hospital each year with a median length of stay of 38&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, having a psychotic illness is costly due to the associated high use of services and high rates of unemployment.</p><p id="Par14">On discharge from an acute mental health hospital, people can experience social isolation, financial problems and difficulty looking after themselves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Also, the period following discharge from hospital is a period of high risk of suicide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, losing a job, having relationship problems and living alone have been found to be risk factors for committing suicide following discharge from hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This supports the view that being able to take part in daily life is important for health and recovery from a relapse following discharge from hospital.</p><p id="Par15">Unmet needs of people with mental health problems post-discharge from an acute mental health ward have been identified regarding day time activities (26%, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;45), food (12%, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20) and looking after their home (5%, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Additionally, people with a diagnosed mental health problem reported that they experienced stigma, had low self-esteem, avoided social contact and lost friendships following discharge from hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, service users have identified that there is a lack of follow-up after discharge regarding daily activities, and that a stepped approach to discharge would support their return to cooking and domestic activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">The need to use a more proactive approach to reduce the long-term impact of mental ill-health for the individual and to reduce costs for the NHS has also been emphasised by the government in their 5-year forward view for mental health document published in 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Currently, intervention post-discharge from an acute mental health ward in the UK routinely focus on medication and monitoring of mental health symptoms, and includes crisis and home treatment team and/or a 7-day follow-up visit or phone call [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. An intervention, following discharge from hospital to support participation in daily activities, has the potential to improve the transition by supporting the reorganisation of daily tasks in a timely manner, reducing relapse in mental illness and readmissions to hospital. Receiving such an intervention also has the potential to reduce long-term disability and increase quality of life and wellbeing. This paper reports the process of developing an intervention called GLOW (Graduating Living skills Outside the Ward), for people with a diagnosed psychotic disorder post-discharge from hospital to increase self-care and leisure and increase wellbeing and quality of life. This study lays the foundation for feasibility and piloting of the developed intervention by providing a transparent and comprehensive report of the method and process of the development of an evidence-based intervention.</p><p id="Par17">Occupational therapists hold skills and knowledge regarding increasing participation in daily activities and are therefore best placed to provide such interventions post-discharge from hospital as part of multidisciplinary community mental health care. Currently, occupational therapists may work with people with a diagnosed mental illness post-discharge from hospital, using their unique tacit knowledge, published theories and models of practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, there is no evidence regarding the effectiveness of occupational therapy in this context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] or published best practice. An evidence-based intervention manual would support assessment of the clinical and cost effectiveness of the occupational therapy intervention for people with a diagnosed mental illness, an identified priority by clinicians, managers and health service commissioners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">People with a diagnosed psychotic disorder have severe problems in more areas of occupational performance than adults with non-psychotic disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and high rates of admission; therefore, the intervention targets people with a diagnosed psychotic disorder.</p><p id="Par19">The aim of this intervention development study was to describe the rationale, methods and processes used to develop an intervention for adults with a diagnosed psychotic disorder following discharge from hospital.

No studies focused on post-discharge from hospital.<break/>Key findings<break/>The literature review identified that people with psychosis with higher levels of information-processing skills were more independent in their living skills. Reduced motor and process skills impacted on their ability to carry out daily activities, in addition to skill development being disrupted at onset of psychosis. People with psychosis have been identified as being under occupied and describe a lack of routine and problems with personal activities of daily living. A lack of social contacts has been identified as a barrier to leisure.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par27">The literature review found both qualitative and quantitative studies relating to occupational performance of people with a diagnosed psychotic disorder but found no studies focusing on occupational performance following discharge from hospital; therefore, new knowledge was required and was generated in the focus groups.

The developed intervention was named Graduating Living skills Outside the Ward (GLOW), by the service users who participated in the development of the intervention. GLOW is underpinned by a comprehensive understanding of occupational performance that is achieved during occupational therapy training; therefore, GLOW is designed to be delivered by occupational therapists. GLOW is a ten-session one-to-one intervention. It aims to increase occupational performance of self-care, leisure and productive roles that is, an improvement in the &#x0201c;doing&#x0201d; of these occupations following discharge from hospital, and in doing so increase wellbeing and quality of life. It is anticipated that these changes will reduce further relapses of mental ill-health and reduce admissions to hospital.

Use of the MRC framework in this study ensures the intervention developed is empirically defensible and developed sufficiently to be tested in a feasibility study. The MRC framework offered a formal and recognised structure to the development of the intervention, and this rigorous approach resulted in the development of an evidence-based intervention with a theoretical underpinning. Use of this structured approach and manualisation of the intervention supports internal validity of a future randomised controlled trial at the evaluation stage of the intervention within the MRC framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par65">Since the development of GLOW, there has been an increase in knowledge and formal frameworks regarding health intervention development, for example, Intervention Mapping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].
