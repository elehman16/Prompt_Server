Thermometry, measuring the temperature of the feet, is a promising emerging modality for diabetic foot ulcer prevention. However, patient compliance with at-home monitoring is concerning. Delivering messages to remind patients to perform thermometry and foot care might be helpful to guarantee regular foot monitoring. This trial was designed to compare the incidence of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) between participants who receive thermometry alone and those who receive thermometry as well as mHealth (SMS and voice messaging) over a year-long study period.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is an evaluator-blinded, randomized, 12-month trial. Individuals with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus, aged between 18&#x02013;80 years, having a present dorsalis pedis pulse in both feet, are in risk group 2 or 3 using the diabetic foot risk classification system (as specified by the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot), have an operating cell phone or a caregiver with an operating cell phone, and have the ability to provide informed consent will be eligible to participate in the study. Recruitment will be performed in diabetes outpatient clinics at two Ministry of Health tertiary hospitals in Lima, Peru.</p><p>Interventions: participants in both groups will receive education about foot care at the beginning of the study and they will be provided with a thermometry device (TempStat&#x02122;). TempStat&#x02122; is a tool that captures a thermal image of the feet, which, depending on the temperature of the feet, shows different colors. In this study, if a participant notes a single yellow image or variance between one foot and the contralateral foot, they will be prompted to notify a nurse to evaluate their activity within the previous 2&#x000a0;weeks and make appropriate recommendations. In addition to thermometry, participants in the intervention arm will receive an mHealth component in the form of SMS and voice messages as reminders to use the thermometry device, and instructions to promote foot care.</p><p>Outcomes: the primary outcome is foot ulceration, evaluated by a trained nurse, occurring at any point during the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study has two principal contributions towards the prevention of DFU. First, the introduction of messages to promote self-management of diabetes foot care as well as using reminders as a strategy to improve adherence to daily home-based measurements. Secondly, the implementation of a thermometry-based strategy complemented by SMS and voice messages in an LMIC setting, with wider implications for scalability.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This study is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov: Identifier <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02373592">NCT02373592</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-016-1333-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Diabetic neuropathies</kwd><kwd>Thermometry</kwd><kwd>Diabetes mellitus</kwd><kwd>Type 2 ulcer</kwd><kwd>mHealth</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Institutes of Health (US)</institution></funding-source><award-id>R21TW009982</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miranda</surname><given-names>J.

Diabetic foot neuropathy (DFN) is a frequent complication and has enormous impacts on patients, families, and society. According to information from the US, 60&#x02013;70&#x000a0;% of people with diabetes will develop peripheral neuropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and, of those, up to 25&#x000a0;% will develop a foot ulcer (DFU), a significant prognostic factor for future foot amputation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>While data from Peru is limited, our preliminary study found a 57&#x000a0;% prevalence of DFN at a National Public Hospital, 20&#x000a0;% of whom are considered to be high-risk for developing a DFU due to the presence of deformities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition, the economic burden associated with DFUs &#x02013; a mostly preventable condition &#x02013; is enormous. Some projections indicate that the cost of treating one case of DFU with surgical debridement ranged between US$1,022 and US$1,404 in Peru, which is 200&#x000a0;% of the average monthly family income in Lima, Peru [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. To avoid these preventative and costly complications, necessary strategies including patient education, foot care, and the promotion of appropriate footwear are needed.</p><p>Tools to identify early signs of foot damage or inflammation have the potential to reduce the incidence of foot ulceration and amputation. Thermometry, for example, measures superficial skin warmth and is a promising emerging modality to evaluate and manage early signs and help to prevent DFUs. In three independent clinical trials, Lavery and Armstrong found that utilization of thermometry among individuals with diabetes at high-risk of developing a DFU reduced rates of recurring ulcers four- to ten-fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Moreover, a systematic review indicated that the use of temperature monitoring is an effective way to predict and prevent diabetic foot ulceration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Recently, a novel self-assessment device, TempStat&#x02122; (Visual Footcare Technologies, LLC, South Salem, NY, USA), a plastic panel with two polycarbonate plastic pads, has become available. The plastic pads are constructed of liquid crystalline cholesteric esters that react to skin surface temperature and change color to reflect temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Frykberg et al<italic>.</italic> showed that TempStat&#x02122; can detect &#x0201c;alarm signs,&#x0201d; represented by a yellow color change, and the results positively correlate to temperature findings of infrared thermometer, the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; of thermometry devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. As such, the use of TempStat&#x02122; is a low-cost, at-home, and patient-friendly way to prevent the development of DFUs and other complications such as amputation. The caveat for any thermometry device, however, is that the patient is required to adhere to self-assessment to achieve the observed efficacy; i.e., published results suggest that participants needed to evaluate their foot temperature on at least 50&#x000a0;% of the days to reduce the risk of foot ulceration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>In Peru and many other LMICs, clinical consultations are very short, lasting on average 10&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;15&#x000a0;minutes, which minimizes the time allowed for patient education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, there are significant barriers in physician-patient communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and medical treatment adherence is complicated by poor patient literacy and low socioeconomic status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The lack of resources for specialized diabetic follow-up programs leaves patients without knowledge of their disease process and unable to engage in self-care decision-making. Because of these problems, we need to identify ways to facilitate improved patient education and self-management for prevention of diabetic complications.</p><p>mHealth &#x02013; the use of mobile technology to promote wellness &#x02013; can close the gap between patient behaviors and the healthcare system. The use of Short Message Service (SMS) for diabetes management was evaluated by two systematic reviews, noting that patients with T2DM who received text message interventions showed improvements in Self-Efficacy for Diabetes and Diabetes Social Support Interview scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and thus could improve clinically diabetes-related health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Thermometry and SMS have independently demonstrated enormous potential to lead to positive diabetes-related outcomes in high-income countries. To strengthen these approaches in a LMIC in South America, we propose to use both modalities to evaluate the efficacy of a combination of foot thermometry with mHealth reminders, using SMS and voice messaging, in reducing the risk of foot ulceration in Peru.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives</title><p>The main objective of this study is to compare the 1-year incidence of DFU in two arms: the intervention arm, receiving thermometry and mHealth reminders; and the control arm receiving thermometry alone.

Additionally, we will compare patient compliance with thermometer use in both arms with a temperature-recording logbook.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Primary specific aim</title><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Compare the incidence of DFU during the study period between those who receive thermometry alone and those who receive thermometry plus SMS and voice messaging</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Secondary specific aims</title><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Compare the compliance of foot thermometer use between the two study arms</p></list-item><list-item><p>Compare the frequency of alarm signs reported to the study nurse between the two study arms</p></list-item><list-item><p>Compare the frequency of alarm signs reported in the patient&#x02019;s temperature-recording logbooks between the two study arms</p></list-item><list-item><p>Compare the incidence of DFU according to pre-specified sub-groups: caregiving status, use of insoles and/or orthopedic shoes</p></list-item><list-item><p>In the intervention-only arm, compare the incidence of DFU by recipient of the messaging intervention (patient versus caregivers)</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study design</title><p>This is a physician- and evaluator-blinded, 1-year, randomized clinical trial with two parallel groups, and a 1:1 allocation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Participant recruitment and selection criteria</title><p>Recruitment will be performed in the outpatient clinics of the aforementioned hospitals.

Briefly, all study participants will receive education about foot care at the beginning of the study and they will all be provided with a thermometry device (TempStat&#x02122;, Visual Footcare Technologies, LLC, South Salem, NY, USA). Participants in the intervention arm will receive, in addition to thermometry, an mHealth component as reminders in the form of SMS and voice messages.</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Physical and informational materials</title><p>Videos were the chosen mechanism to standardize the education about foot care at the beginning of the study, and also to standardize the information about use of the TempStat&#x02122;. In order to develop the content of our information materials, a communicator initially prepared a questionnaire to assess preferences about education on healthy habits through audiovisual media and to assess preferences related to video format. This was accomplished through a small pilot study conducted in diabetes outpatient clinics, with 30 volunteers, over a 2-week-long period. In parallel, a literature search was conducted to gather information to explain the etiology and risk factors for the development of neuropathy and ulcers, as well as to obtain recommendations for foot care practices and early signs of ulceration. After these procedures, three guides were prepared, two focused on foot care and one guide was oriented to provide instructions on the use of the TempStat&#x02122; device. Each of the guides was then used to generate three videos, all of them produced by an audiovisual specialist. All videos were validated by physicians and patients with T2DM. The two videos about foot care are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://youtu.be/qZm2z5Wbwg0">https://youtu.be/qZm2z5Wbwg0</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://youtu.be/3o0CkEmWeXk">https://youtu.be/3o0CkEmWeXk</ext-link>, and the one on how to use the TempStat&#x02122; device is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://youtu.be/KotgANRXoIw">https://youtu.be/KotgANRXoIw.</ext-link></p><p>In addition to the videos, all study participants will be provided with a TempStat&#x02122; foot thermometer device. They will be instructed to use the device daily and will be asked to record their measurements in a temperature-recording logbook to be provided by the study nurse.</p><p>Finally, on the mHealth intervention arm only, SMS and voice messages will be sent to participants.

All of these procedures occur at the same visit, also known as the pre-screening and enrollment visit. The two videos about foot care will be shown to participants during enrollment (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Visit 1</title><p>One week after enrollment (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), the TempStat&#x02122; will be provided to each participant together with a video about its use. Participants&#x02019; usage of the TempStat&#x02122; will be observed by a study nurse to verify that they use it adequately. Some alarm signs have been pre-defined on the TempStat&#x02122; and the study nurse will train participants to detect them. These include: (1) yellow spots in any area of any feet for two consecutive days, (2) different colors in contralateral areas of the feet for two consecutive days, or (3) a dermal lesion. In any of these three scenarios, subjects will be instructed to contact the study nurse by phone or SMS. For the first two types of alarm signs, the contact nurse will ask about the presence of any lesions as well as the patient&#x02019;s activity in the last 2&#x000a0;weeks. The nurse will also provide recommendations on how to decrease activity until temperatures normalize. If alarm signs continue for more than 1&#x000a0;week after the telephone consultation, a face-to-face evaluation will be requested to assess the patient for infection and/or a masked injury. If a dermal lesion is present, participants will be asked to be evaluated promptly by a nurse blind to the intervention. When a DFU, the main outcome, has been confirmed, the study nurse will direct the patients to receive professional specialty care.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Intervention arm</title><p>In the intervention arm, which includes an mHealth component, participants will receive two reminder messages and six foot-care promotion messages during the study period. The content of these eight messages has been developed and validated through both via SMS and voice messaging (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). During the first 2&#x000a0;weeks of the intervention, daily reminders to use the TempStat&#x02122; will be sent Monday to Friday via both SMS and voice messaging. Thereafter, for the remaining 50&#x000a0;weeks, patients will only receive two messages per week: one SMS and one voice message with the content alternating between reminders to use the TempStat&#x02122; device and promotion of foot care.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Intervention provider</title><p>Each participating site will have two study nurses and one study coordinator.</p><p>Nurses will have between 1 and 5&#x000a0;years of previous experience in diabetes care and will receive, as part of this study, a specific 2-day training in foot care, foot evaluation &#x02013; vibration perception threshold (VPT), SWF, and pulse evaluation &#x02013; as well as a description of the study procedures.</p><p>The study coordinator, an early career physician, will act as study coordinator and will provide support during the recruitment process.

Each hospital will follow their standard of care for diabetes management without restrictions. Also participants will be asked to visit the diabetes clinic every 2&#x000a0;months for a general checkup and lower extremity evaluation by a nurse evaluator. If the nurse identifies an ulcer or any diabetic complication in a patient, the patient will receive conventional hospital treatment. At each 2-month visit, participants will: (1) complete a questionnaire about diabetes treatment, caregiver presence, and use of insoles and/or orthopedic shoes, and (2) have their weight and blood pressure measured. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) will be measured at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months.

The researchers considered that the evidence available on the efficacy of thermometry interventions for the prevention of foot ulcers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] was sufficient to incorporate it as part of the standard of care. This decision was made despite the fact that such practice is not currently available in the study setting or in many LMICs, thus favoring potential benefits rather than harms. Designing a randomized trial where the control group would not receive a thermometry device would be accompanied by a higher incidence of DFU in this group, a fact that was deemed not appropriate or ethical. Therefore, the decision was to standardize the provision of the thermometry device to all study participants where the only difference between study arms was the mHealth component, SMS and voice reminders, assigned only to one of the study arms.</p><p>The study protocol, informed consent templates, and questionnaires have been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board at Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia in Lima, Peru. In addition, participating hospitals in the study will receive the protocol and consents for approval.</p><sec id="Sec28"><title>Monitoring, quality control and data management</title><p>Standard policies of the Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia for the development and review of the protocol will be followed, as well as policies related to adherence, safety procedures and information management. The Trial Steering Committee will be composed of the study coordinator, co-investigators, principal investigators and the Institutional Review Board of the Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, who will provide trial oversight.</p><p>According to our Data Monitoring Plan, we will perform quality control at multiple stages, which include: (1) the use of manuals for data collection, (2) weekly meetings with study nurses, (3) updates training about protocol procedures, (4) duplicate data entry to the database, and (5) the ongoing review of the descriptive statistics of the trial data by the principal investigators with quality control review of selected data, looking for inconsistency, missing data and outliers. The databases will be encrypted and password-protected to ensure confidentiality. Close cooperation between the study coordinator, the data manager, and other members of the study team will be established to allow the tracking of the progress of the study to solve problems that arise during implementation and to address other issues on time.</p><p>With regards to data monitoring, given the pragmatic nature of the intervention, we will not establish an independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB), as guidance indicates that a &#x0201c;DSMB is specifically required for multi-site clinical trials with interventions that entail risk(s) to participants&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

First, the introduction of using messages to promote self-management of foot care in diabetes as well as using reminders as a strategy to improve adherence to daily home-based measurements. Secondly, the implementation of a thermometry-based strategy complemented by SMS and voice messages in an LMIC setting, with wider implications for scalability.</p><p>A recent systemic review found that, to date, a few studies with high-quality evidence show that DFUs can be prevented by complex interventions. Our proposal uses thermometry to reduce the incidence of foot ulcers in high-risk diabetic patients, which is an innovative and cost-effective preventative approach that promotes self-care at home to empower patient health-management with recognition of local cultural and economic limitations to healthcare access. Despite its promising expectation, patient compliance to at-home monitoring is an expected area of concern.</p><p>To address these concerns, we propose concurrent use of SMS and voice messages to remind patients to perform thermometry and then to assess how messages impact the progression to foot ulceration. SMS, an mHealth tool, has been shown to have better health outcomes for various diseases. A recent systematic review found that SMS reminders were useful in several clinical applications: adherence to antiretroviral and tuberculosis medications, and smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Data from Peru show some patients with chronic disease had difficulties reading SMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], thus we decided to additionally use voice messages to evaluate the impact of these communication strategies in prevention of ulceration of the diabetic foot.</p><p>Thermometry and SMS technologies have both been shown to have enormous potential in high-income countries, thus we propose to evaluate their utility in Peru, while combining the modalities to further enhance their impact. Our proposed methodology creates an early warning system for DFUs using few healthcare resources, which is a critical attribute for success in LMIC settings. We take advantage of the relatively high penetration of mobile phone technology &#x02013; SMS are free for receivers, i.e., study participants &#x02013; and our ability to deliver a low-cost thermometry device directly to our most at-risk patients. These tools have the potential to replace conventional diabetic care approaches in LMICs and to provide wide coverage in both urban and rural areas. We strongly believe that interventions such as the one proposed in this study may be able to extend &#x0201c;ulcer-free days&#x0201d; in patients in diabetic foot remission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>This project is being conducted as part of the The Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases (GACD) Diabetes Program, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gacd.org">www.gacd.org</ext-link>.
