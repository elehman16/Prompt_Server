Stigma and poor communication between patients and their providers result in low use of antidepressant medications and early treatment withdrawal. Cultural factors which influence treatment decisions among Hispanics include fears about the addictive and harmful properties of antidepressants, worries about taking too many pills, and the stigma attached to taking medications. Primary care settings often are the gateway to identifying undiagnosed or untreated mental health disorders, particularly for people with co-morbid physical health conditions. Hispanics, in particular, are more likely to receive mental healthcare in primary care settings. Recent recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force are that primary care providers screen adult patients for depression only if systems are in place to ensure adequate treatment and follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We are conducting a randomized controlled trial among 150 depressed adult Hispanics in a primary care safety net setting, testing the effectiveness of a culturally appropriate depression education intervention to reduce stigma and increase uptake in depression treatment among Hispanics, and implement a Measurement-Based Integrated Care (MBIC) model with collaborative, multidisciplinary treatment and culturally tailored care management strategies.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This study protocol represents the first randomized control trial of the culturally adapted depression education <italic>fotonovela</italic>, <italic>Secret Feelings</italic>, among Hispanics in a primary care setting.

Effective treatment of chronic illness is complicated and requires significant investment on the part of the patients and their families. More than 300 million people worldwide were living with depression in 2015, making it the leading cause of medical disability in the world, causing significant disease burden and medical cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. One in six Americans is afflicted in their lifetime and chronicity is common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Adults with chronic medical conditions have high rates of depression and anxiety which often impair self-care and compliance with treatment of their disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. For patients with diabetes, depression severity is associated with diabetes complications, medical co-morbidity, greater anxiety, dysthymia, financial worries, social stress, and poorer quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Major depression increases the burden of chronic illness by increasing perception of symptoms, causing additional impairment in functioning, and increasing medical cost through over-utilization of the healthcare system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Many patients with co-morbid depression and chronic disease may sabotage their own treatment by &#x0201c;focusing on the physical&#x0201d; and delaying treatment of mental health concerns for weeks or months. Such delays in addressing the underlying depression cannot only make remission difficult, but can make treatment of the physical condition challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Risk factors for Hispanics and depression</title><p id="Par31">A national sample of Hispanics has estimated the prevalence of depression among the population to be 27% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Hispanics have double the risk of co-morbid depression and diabetes, with rates as high as 33%, compared with the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Response to depression treatment in Hispanics is slow and relapse rates are high, which may explain the early discontinuation of medication without consulting their provider [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Hispanic patients often voice fears about the addictive and harmful properties of antidepressants, worries about taking too many pills, and the stigma attached to taking medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In the context of co-morbid chronic disease, depression can be difficult to detect by primary care providers, especially where screening for depression is inconsistent, creating further barriers to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">Lack of English fluency is associated with reduced healthcare use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Limited English proficiency (LEP), limited health literacy, geographic inaccessibility, and lack of medical insurance are all more common among immigrants, minority populations, individuals of low socioeconomic status, and people in rural areas. The citizenship, or legal status of an individual, impacts the extent to which they can secure quality healthcare, as does the level of acculturation and duration of residence in the U.S. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Individuals with LEP are less likely to self-identify a need for mental health services, which subsequently predicts lifetime mental healthcare use, and results in longer duration of untreated disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Integrated care</title><p id="Par33">Integrated care is a systematic approach to the treatment of depression in primary care that involves systematic screening for depression, the integration of a care manager, with primary care provider oversight and psychiatric consultation, as needed, to more proactively treat mental health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The primary function of the care manager is to manage the mental health disorders of the patients, monitor their response to treatment, and facilitate communication between the patient, the primary care providers, and the consulting psychiatrist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The functions of the care manager can address significant barriers to treatment such as stigma, limited knowledge of mental health disorders, poor doctor&#x02013;patient communication, and treatment engagement and adherence, which disproportionately affect racial and ethnic minorities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, those functions may be limited unless culture specific strategies are employed to engage and retain minority patients and those with LEP in treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Patient education</title><p id="Par34">While patient education has been established as essential in chronic disease management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], less is known about its role in engagement and improved outcomes for mental disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Low health literacy is related to poor management of chronic diseases, lack of basic knowledge about medical conditions and treatments, less understanding and use of preventive services, worse health outcomes, and higher rates of hospitalization and emergency care use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, qualitative evaluation of conceptual models which include comprehensive educational interventions for depressed Hispanics have found patients were optimistic about the benefits of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], especially those which adapt materials for literacy and cultural content, and include homework materials that are linguistically and idiomatically appropriate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p id="Par35">The study aims to examine a novel culturally adapted patient education intervention to increase engagement by Hispanics in depression treatment.

The center offers a full range of comprehensive primary and preventive services, including childhood immunizations and physical exams, adult physical exams, management of chronic illnesses, family planning services, maternity care services, and health education promotion. In 2015, the center served 11,895 unduplicated patients for a total of 25,362 patient visits. Of those patients, 90% were Hispanic and the majority did not speak English. There are currently five physicians and four mid-level providers (physician assistants and nurse practitioners) working at the center.</p><p id="Par40">The target enrollment is 150 patients over the 24-month enrollment period. All adult primary care patients at the center will be asked to participate in screening for depression with the iPad Depression Screening application (universal screening). After being informed about the expectations for participation in the study and the compensation payments, it is expected that a minimum of 2&#x02013;3 patients per week will agree and be enrolled in the study. Patients who meet study inclusion criteria will be enrolled on a first-come, first-serve basis until the target of 150 patients is reached. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Texas at Arlington.

</p><p id="Par43">The DEF is designed to enhance the awareness and understanding of depression, its role in chronic disease, its impact on Hispanic populations, and the multitude of barriers to effective treatment in a culturally meaningful way. The <italic>fotonovela</italic> has demonstrated significant improvements in depression knowledge and reductions in stigma toward antidepressants and mental health treatment in a community education setting and a multiservice community clinic setting but has not been tested as a depression treatment engagement in a primary care setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Measurement-based integrated care</title><p id="Par44">This project will implement MBIC, which synthesizes the science of integrated healthcare and incorporates the strategies of measurement-based care, often missing from existing models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The MBIC intervention is based on the principles of collaborative care developed by Unutzer and Katon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] at the University of Washington and adapted to include measurement-based treatment strategies developed by Trivedi and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Abundant evidence supports the conclusion that a measurement-based approach significantly improves outcomes and lowers costs, especially when coupled with care managers. Although Trivedi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] have led successful development of measurement-based strategies, measurement-based care is still seldom used in treating patients with depressive disorders. The concept of MBIC for the treatment of depression includes: the systematic assessment of symptoms; antidepressant treatment side effects and medication adherence; and the incorporation of a depression care manager (DCM) to track patients and keep them engaged in care using behavioral interventions.</p><p id="Par45">In this study, a DCM will engage the patient in treatment, assess barriers to treatment, and develop solutions to barriers. The DCM will be a bilingual, licensed Masters level clinical social worker (LCSW) and have specialized training in brief psychotherapy and interventions demonstrated effective in primary care settings, such as Problem Solving Treatment for Primary Care (PST-PC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and Behavioral Activation (BA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The DCM will also work closely with the patients&#x02019; primary care provider (PCP) in the development and execution of treatment plans which will include counseling and/or pharmacotherapy. Using measurement-based care treatment principles, patients&#x02019; depressive symptoms will be measured at defined intervals, along with antidepressant treatment side effects and treatment adherence (if applicable). Measuring mental health symptoms at the start of a patient&#x02019;s treatment and regularly thereafter facilitates treatment planning and adjustment, indicates when it is time to start or change medications, avoids patients staying on ineffective treatments for too long, and assists PCPs in knowing when to refer for consultation or get additional help.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Study procedures</title><sec id="Sec16"><title>Universal screening with iPad technology</title><p id="Par46">The project will utilize a novel technology to systematically identify depressed patients, quantify the severity of their depression, and guide treatment recommendations. The web-based software platform is designed to support the use of MBIC by providing feedback to providers at the point of care. All adult primary care patients will be asked to complete the iPad Depression Screening (universal screening) at the annual visit and at new/non-acute visits. During the routine intake process, designated clinical staff will give the patient the iPad and ask them to complete the screening for depression. The iPad Depression Screening will be presented in English or Spanish, depending on the patient&#x02019;s preference. The first screen in the iPad application is presented to record consent and the patient will be informed that refusal to consent for screening will have no effect on the care they receive at the clinic. If the patient does not consent, the screening process will be terminated and the patient will continue with their scheduled visit.</p><p id="Par47">The iPad Depression Screening application begins with the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. If the patient screens positive for depression, indicated by a score of&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;5, the screening application immediately offers the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] anxiety measure. Once completed, an electronic notification is generated to the DCM and patient&#x02019;s PCP and the application screen will lock with a message to return the iPad to a clinic staff member.</p><p id="Par48">Immediately after a patient screens positive for depression, the medical assistant will document the PHQ-9 score in the patient&#x02019;s electronic health record (EHR) and will inform the provider that the patient screened positive for depression to enable the provider to interpret the depression score. Patients who screen positive for depression but previously had a diagnosis of depression and are in treatment will be excluded from enrollment in the study.

The target of the three-part design is to improve detection, diagnosis, and increasing uptake in depression treatment among Hispanics in an integrated care model in a community-based health center. This study addresses the need for both identification and elimination of the barriers to treatment for the most common mental health condition affecting Hispanics. Various other design options were discussed, including testing the <italic>fotonovela</italic> as a discrete intervention, without the context of integrated care. However, with the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation for universal screening for depression in primary care settings and the emphasis on systems to address positive screens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], the rationale for testing an innovative technology to facilitate screening and implementing an evidence-based treatment model for which there is a lack of studies among minority populations offers a greater opportunity to translate established research into clinical practice. The rationale for designing a complete intervention, while still testing a specific element for which cultural values about mental health may be distinct, appears scientifically feasible, and shows scientific promise.</p><p id="Par82">The strengths and weakness of using a SE control group were carefully considered prior to selection. The primary benefit of the SE control group is that it ensures a comparable contact across the two interventions. As a result, a significant effect observed in the <italic>fotonovela</italic> condition cannot be attributed to differences in contact or participation outcome expectations. A potential concern with the control group is a threat to internal validity due to lack of treatment fidelity and interventionist allegiance. To reduce these concerns, the SE intervention will be manualized (based on NIMH education materials) and intervention fidelity procedures will be the same across the two interventions.</p><p id="Par83">The scope of this project is ambitious, in that we aim to change provider behavior and screen all adult primary care patients for depression. With that in mind, we realize that we will identify a large number of patients whose depression was previously unrecognized. For busy primary care practitioners, this will undoubtedly increase their workload. However, with the support of the DCM and MBIC, the burden of systematic measurement, education about the disease and tracking of outcomes will be reduced. Additionally, we look to offset the potential treatment burden by training the PCPs and their clinic staff in evidence-based treatment guidelines, and through the use of the iPad Depression Screening and Monitoring application. It is anticipated that the recognition and treatment of depression will improve other co-morbid chronic disease and ultimately reduce the overall burden of disease management on the primary care practice.</p><sec id="Sec32"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par84">Enrollment for METRIC commenced in February 2016.
