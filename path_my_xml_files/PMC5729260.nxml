Data about correlation between COF and neointimal hyperplasia in humans are currently lacking. The objective of the BIOFLEX-COF trial is to prospectively investigate differences in formation of intimal hyperplasia at 1 and 2 years after implantation of nitinol stents with high versus low COF in de novo femoropopliteal occlusive arterial lesions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The BIOFLEX-COF trial is a prospective, quantitative, randomized study. Eighty subjects with symptomatic peripheral arterial lesions eligible for endovascular stent implantation will be enrolled and randomly assigned to either a high COF group (LifeStent Flexstar, Bard Peripheral Vascular Inc., Tempe, AZ, USA) or low COF group (Pulsar, Biotronik AG, B&#x000fc;lach, Switzerland) using an online randomization program to generate a random 1:1 group allocation (block randomization).

While the surgical techniques have been optimized previously and not undergone extensive changes over the last years, endovascular techniques have been characterized by rapid revolution of a broad variety of endovascular devices that facilitate vascular access, lesion recanalization, and treatment efficacy. Simple balloon angioplasty was complemented by stent deployment and a multitude of other technologies, and reported patencies were constantly increasing. Third-generation nitinol stents show markedly improved patency compared to their early predecessors and are today used alongside stent grafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], drug-eluting stents and drug-coated balloons. This ever-increasing efficacy and safety of endovascular treatment in the femoropopliteal segment was reflected both in clinical practice, scientific research data, society recommendations, and patient preference by allocating ever more severe occlusive lesions to an &#x0201c;endo-first&#x0201d; strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Unfortunately, the introduction of many new endovascular devices and techniques did not lead to a sufficient body of scientific evidence (let alone level 1 evidence) that would aid in the decision when and how to use it and which one to prefer over another. For example, indications that primary nitinol stenting is superior to balloon angioplasty and provisional stenting is based on solely three randomized control trials (RCTs) that showed superiority of primary stenting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and one RCT that showed a trend to increased patency in the stent group in short lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The notion that drug eluting-stents might be superior to plain nitinol stents is currently based on only a single RCT in which a secondary randomization was performed between nitinol stent and drug-eluting stent after failed balloon angioplasty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] although more studies are ongoing. Lastly, there exists not a single randomized study comparing primary nitinol stenting versus drug-covered balloon angioplasty to this day. Despite this, many researchers advocate drug-covered balloons over nitinol stents as treatment of choice in shorter lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">The current study was planned out of a desire for more insight in how to optimally select and size a nitinol stent in the femoropopliteal segment. In contrast to drug-coated balloons or bio-absorbable devices, nitinol stents will interact with the vessel wall for the whole duration of their patency. Since nitinol stents are self-expanding, they must be oversized at least by a minimal amount to ensure contact with the vessel wall and prevent migration. Once the stent is thus deployed, the stent struts exert a continuous force upon the vascular wall, termed chronic outward force (COF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Concept of chronic outward force (COF)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2338_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par20">If in cases where the artery is compressed circumferentially from the outside (such as in the adductor canal) an even higher force between the stent and the vessel wall needs to be effected before the stent gives way to the external compression and is temporarily compressed. This force is called radial resistive force (RRF), see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Concept of radial resistive force (RRF)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2338_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par21">Chronic outward force depends on two factors: (i) the oversizing of the stent compared to the diameter of the target vessel (i.e., how much bigger is the nominal diameter of the stent compared to the vessel) and (ii) the spring constant (&#x0201c;stiffness&#x0201d;) of the stent material (i.e., how steep the COF increases if the stent is not allowed to expand fully to its nominal diameter) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In several animal studies, groups with high versus low oversizing of self-expanding nitinol stents have been compared. The majority of the studies found a markedly increased neointimal hyperplasia in the group with high oversizing and thus high COF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, two studies found no significant difference between study groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Data about COF and neointimal hyperplasia in humans are currently lacking. There is only one post hoc analysis of data from the VIPER study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] that investigated patency after implantation of stent-grafts in the superficial femoral artery (SFA). At the time of the study the smallest available device was 6 mm in diameter and was implanted in vessels between 3 and 4 mm in diameter, resulting in an unusually high degree of stent oversizing. A subgroup analysis of this study collective revealed that patients with stent-grafts which had been oversized by more than 20% had 70% patency at 1 year, whereas patients with oversizing below 20% had 88% patency at 1 year (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.047).</p><p id="Par23">The objective of the BIOFLEX-COF trial is to investigate differences in formation of intimal hyperplasia at 1 and 2 years after implantation of nitinol-stents with high versus low COF in de novo femoropopliteal occlusive lesions in patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. The low COF group will receive a thin strut-stent with marginal oversizing, whereas the high COF group will receive a thicker strut, stiff-stent with generous oversizing. All employed stent types and sizes are approved for clinical use for the respective anatomical sides, lesions, and indications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par24">The BIOFLEX-COF trial is a monocentric, prospective, quantitative, randomized study which received approval from the Ethics Committee of the Medical University of Vienna (EK Nr. 1026/2015, Ver.5.0, October 2015).

The diameters for the pre- and post-dilatation balloon and the stent diameter will be determined after measuring the diameter of the non-diseased SFA at the proximal end of the intended treatment site.

Very few studies have been successful in this respect, and there are ongoing studies facing this challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], where it remains to be seen whether their sample size calculation can stand up to reality. Consequently, there are currently no prospective studies comparing self-expanding stents with different COF.</p><p id="Par96">The authors believe that in such studies (where a binary endpoint event occurs quite infrequently and in a very similar proportion of patients in either group), binary endpoints do not provide enough power for successful completion without demanding unreasonably high patient numbers. To optimize the power of this study, we dropped both clinical TLR and binary re-stenosis at color-flow Doppler ultrasound (CDUS) as primary endpoints. TLR is a parameter prone to bias, especially if the study team themselves schedule patients for re-intervention, and in claudicants it is further biased on purely subjective estimations by the patient (pain) and by the physician (urgency and resource availability). CDUS is in addition highly operator- and patient-dependent and both parameters are only binary. We selected as outcome parameter the amount of neointima inside the stent accessed by CT angiography. Neointimal volume is calculated based on 20 to 160 individual levels (depending on total stent length every 2 mm along the stent longitudinal access), with each level consisting of four individual measurements (stent diameter in two directions, lumen diameter in two directions). By using the difference between the stent diameter and lumen diameter in a multitude of data points, normal distributions of the results even from skewed data is likely, and the accuracy of the end result as the average of n independent measurements will (theoretically) be improved over the native resolution of a single CT measurement by a factor of &#x0221a;n. Furthermore, in-stent neointima can be detected with CT angiography in virtually every patient after 1 year post implantation, since the detection threshold of the CT is estimated to be at 0.5 mm of luminal narrowing.</p><p id="Par97">A further advantage of CTA assessment of in-stent neointima is the option to locally compare different areas of COF (e.g., in places where some residual stenosis leads to higher compression of the stent and thus to higher chronic outward force, while in other regions where the stent is near its nominal diameter COF might be locally low). The stent diameter (and COF), as well as the amount of neointima, is known every 2 mm along the stent longitudinal access, therefore in-group and in-patient correlations of COF and neointima are possible in post hoc evaluations. If neointima formation is highest at the very same location as high COF, a direct activation of muscle cell proliferation may be assumed. Conversely, if neointima formation occurred downstream from areas with high COF, humoral or paracrine stimulations might be possible.</p><p id="Par98">The study differs further from some similar previous trials in its generous inclusions criteria. Claudicants, patients with tissue loss, as well as diabetic patients are included; inflow and outflow lesion treatment is permissible, TASC A-D lesions are included. This was done in effort to perform the trial on a patient sample that closely represents real-world patients of a specialized endovascular center. The authors believe that it makes little sense to perform trials only on a highly selected collective of participants (representing possibly 1% of all patients) if then (as it is often the case) the conclusions drawn from such selective cohorts are then only generalized to the public anyway.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par99">Recruitment has started in October 2015 and is estimated to be completed in December 2017.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec19"><p>
