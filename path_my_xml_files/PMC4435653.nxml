There has also been a recent call to make psychological treatments more widely available by using strategies to make them affordable and scalable, with the possibility of a wide reach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. One strategy for meeting these needs involves sharing information and behaviour change skills through guided self-care interventions. This approach has previously demonstrated benefit for people with bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder in terms of symptom change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and motivation to change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, there is much variability in terms of effect sizes and the acceptability of these interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Although self-care strategies have been less studied for anorexia nervosa, two studies in which they were used as additional steps, either before inpatient admission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] or after hospital treatment, reported improvements in symptom change and service use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The next step, therefore, involves extending these findings to examine whether or not guided self-care strategies can enhance outpatient care in anorexia nervosa.</p><p>We have developed a six-week guided self-help intervention for anorexia nervosa (<italic>Recovery</italic> MANTRA), which consists of a self-care workbook, a series of short video clips, and weekly guidance from peer mentors with personal experience of recovery from an eating disorder. <italic>Recovery</italic> MANTRA is a guided self-care module extension of the Maudsley Model of Treatment for Adults with Anorexia Nervosa (MANTRA), which integrates principles from several related theoretical approaches. These theoretically derived principles are translated into specific behavioural change strategies, such as psychoeducation, specific prompts for instruction and practice and explicit tools for encouragement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], which participants can use to counteract unhelpful automatic attitudes and behaviours associated with their eating disorder. Preliminary data on the effectiveness of MANTRA (compared with specialized supportive psychotherapy) show that the intervention is rated favourably by participants and associated with a trend for greater benefit (that is, weight gain) in underweight participants (Schmidt <italic>et al.</italic>, unpublished date).</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Theoretical underpinnings for <italic>Recovery</italic> MANTRA</title><p>According to the cognitive-interpersonal model of eating disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], abnormal eating behaviours in anorexia nervosa are maintained through four factors: (a) positive beliefs about the utility of the illness; (b) a rigid, detail-focused thinking style; (c) avoidance of the experience and expression of emotion; and (d) problematic interpersonal relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These elements are thought to develop into habits through a process of neuroadaptation to the illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The <italic>Recovery</italic> MANTRA manual offers a shorter and more focused version of the workbook originally developed for the Maudsley Model of Treatment of Adult Anorexia Nervosa (MANTRA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The <italic>Recovery</italic> MANTRA programme consists of four different intervention modules that target difficulties associated with cognitive processing, emotional functioning, interpersonal style, and poor nutrition. The overall content is aimed at reversing eating disorder habits by making non-eating disorder behaviour more automatic through processes that increase awareness, planning and behavioural experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] delivered through a motivational interviewing framework. Moreover, intervention materials are available for delivery in &#x02018;real time&#x02019; (as and when desired) through mobile-optimized materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], which might enhance the generalizability of learning across new contexts.</p><p>It has been suggested that a successful method of enhancing access and availability of psychological interventions is to implement &#x02018;task-shifting&#x02019; or &#x02018;task-sharing&#x02019; strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. These involve training nonspecialist individuals (such as peers or non-mental health professionals) to deliver psychological interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. We have successfully implemented this approach in the treatment of anorexia nervosa by having people with caregiving experience share their skills with other families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The positive results from this approach support the use of peer-based guidance or mentorship as part of a self-care intervention for anorexia nervosa. This strategy is consistent with the philosophy of the <italic>recovery approach</italic>, which has been embraced as national mental health policy in England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and Scotland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. According to this approach, peer support is one of the five main processes of recovery, alongside hope or optimism about the future and confidence to change, development of identity, having a sense of meaning in life, and experiencing empowerment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Connecting with others with similar problems, sharing skills and choosing recovery goals are key processes within this approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The use of peer support is also advocated by self-determination theory, which posits that autonomy, self-competence and relatedness to others are the bases that drive internal motivation and growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Research in eating disorders has linked perceived autonomy support from parents, staff and treatment peers to higher motivation to change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and greater self-compassion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], whereas low self-efficacy impairs treatment outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Relatedness is also gravely compromised in anorexia nervosa, with loneliness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and poor social relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] serving as causal and maintaining factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Thus, the use of peer mentors is not only linked with increased access and availability of interventions, but also offers a theoretically grounded approach for helping individuals with anorexia nervosa.</p><p><italic>Recovery</italic> MANTRA integrates two novel strategies to provide peer support to individuals with anorexia nervosa. The first strategy involves offering a library of recorded personal recovery narratives (derived from interviews with formerly ill individuals) that describe successful change steps and the nonlinear process of recovery. A feasibility and acceptability study of an early prototype of the guided self-help intervention in a community sample of participants with anorexia nervosa was promising; participants exhibited weight increases and symptom improvement subsequent to the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Previous test trials have demonstrated that watching similar video podcasts (&#x02018;vodcasts&#x02019;) to support eating or improve positive mood lead to increases in test meal consumption and reductions in anxiety and negative thoughts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Feedback from participants, carers, and professionals has led to improvements in these materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>The second strategy to provide peer support in <italic>Recovery</italic> MANTRA involves weekly text-based guidance from peer mentors with personal experience of eating disorders. These online guidance sessions are designed to enhance motivation and complement the participant&#x02019;s use of a self-care workbook. Preliminary evidence regarding the use of peer mentors for psychological interventions is encouraging. For instance, a Cochrane systematic review examining evidence of the effectiveness of consumer providers of care concluded that these providers were as effective as statutory mental health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Moreover, the use of peer mentors as support for people with eating disorders has been found to improve these people&#x02019;s quality of life and increase adherence with services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, the quality of the guidance has been found to be an important factor in shared information approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and thus rigorous, standardized training and supervision of peer mentors is an integral component of delivering an efficacious intervention. Indeed, research suggests that training of nonspecialized professionals is an important factor in enhancing feasibility of task-sharing interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. We have previously had success in training people with experience of eating disorders (mainly as caregivers) to provide a form of motivational interview-based support to other families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and will therefore follow the same strategy for training peer mentors in <italic>Recovery</italic> MANTRA.</p><p>The objectives of the aforementioned strategies for peer mentorship are to inspire, illustrate and model change for individuals with anorexia nervosa. These strategies focus <italic>Recovery</italic> MANTRA intervention efforts on modifiable processes, such as motivation and confidence to change, adherence to treatment, social adjustment, and mood early in treatment, and may therefore enhance treatment outcomes as compared with treatment as usual.

Develop a set of personal resources (for example, vodcasts, written materials) to maintain change over time.</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>APT, &#x02018;awareness, planning, try it&#x02019;.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>The workbook is organized into six sections: introduction to the intervention; separate modules detailing cognitive, emotional, social or interpersonal, and nutritional factors; and a summary section for future planning and integration of content. Each section follows a similar format and includes &#x02018;<italic>awareness</italic>, <italic>planning</italic> and <italic>try it</italic>&#x02019; (APT) sections. <italic>Awareness</italic> includes psychoeducation and reflective exercises. <italic>Precise planning</italic> includes implementation of intention strategies for specific, foreseeable obstacles, in order to keep the overall goal of change in mind (in the form of &#x02018;if&#x02026; then&#x02019; statements) and using daily living prompts as hooks for new habits. <italic>Try it</italic> exercises include small behavioural experiments that encourage patients to take small, manageable risks in challenging thoughts, behaviours, and patterns related to eating disorders as they work toward recovery. The workbook is therefore customizable to meet individual needs; the chapters are allocated one to a week but may be utilized in whichever order participants see fit (except for the introductory and concluding chapters), based on level of confidence and sense of priority. The introduction section includes exercises focused on evaluating and increasing readiness to recover and identifying priorities and reasons for change, followed by APT goals setting. The summary section includes exercises for reflecting on the skills learned in the previous sections, the progress that has been made and re-evaluating the reasons for and one&#x02019;s confidence to change. Each of the cognitive, emotional, social and nutritional modules target the difficulties a patient might experience in the respective area through various engaging exercises (for example, <italic>cognitive module</italic>: practising comprehensive, flexible thinking; <italic>emotional module</italic>: attending to positive emotions and building self-compassion; <italic>social and interpersonal module</italic>: strengthening relationships; <italic>nutritional module</italic>: confronting avoidance and managing cravings and purgative impulses; see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p>A total of 60 vodcasts are downloadable from a secure website (Ieso Digital Health; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iesohealth.com/">http://www.iesohealth.com/</ext-link>) and participants are encouraged to save these locally on internet-capable mobile devices, such as iPods, iPhones, or Android phones. Consistent with the organization of the accompanying workbook, vodcasts are organized into six categories (that is, one set of vodcasts for each workbook section), and each vodcast lasts approximately 90 to 180&#x000a0;seconds. The &#x02018;recovery narrative&#x02019; vodcasts were recorded via semistructured interviews conducted with recovered patients as they described what was helpful for their recovery, what they wished they had known at the time of their illness, and their descriptions of the nature of their recovery experiences. Nondistracting, soothing animations were added to complement the recovery narratives. Finally, each vodcast ends with a brief, written prompt that is directly linked to the content of that vodcast as a way to promote additional reflection, planning and active behaviour change.</p><p>In addition to the recovery narratives, the vodcast directory includes &#x02018;skills-sharing&#x02019; vodcasts that are focused on helping patients gain specific skills for changing eating disorder behaviours (for example, managing food cravings, mindful eating, managing distressing emotions, focusing on the bigger picture and flexible thinking, and building self-compassion). Participants are also advised to download their own relaxation, mindfulness, and distraction podcasts in addition to those provided within the collection of vodcasts.</p><p>In total, 10 to 15 peer mentors will be trained, to allow for attrition. The purpose of the guidance is not to provide an additional stand-alone intervention, but rather, to offer support to patients in using the self-help materials effectively and purposefully. Peer mentors are individuals with past experience of eating disorders who have sufficient time for training, supervision and coaching and are trained in professions allied to medicine or equivalent (psychology, counselling) or teaching. Individuals with clinically significant levels of baseline anxiety, depression or eating disorder symptoms are excluded. Comprehensive training for task-sharing interventions involves three important components: participation in an introductory workshop delivered by an expert, reading or review of workbooks or other written materials that detail the intervention, and administration of the intervention under close supervision of treatment experts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Peer mentors will receive all of these training components prior to delivering the <italic>Recovery</italic> MANTRA intervention.</p><p>The curriculum currently used for training and supervision of carer coaches will be adapted for training peer mentors. In particular, the peer mentors will receive three days of training in motivational interviewing, during which they will also become familiarized with the <italic>Recovery</italic> MANTRA materials and practise using the online text-chat delivery system. For the duration of their involvement in the project, the peer mentors will also receive weekly clinical supervision and will undergo regular assessment of their eating disorder symptoms and mood. Copies of the text-chat messages between the peer mentor and the participant will be used for supervision and to assess treatment quality and fidelity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Fidelity and adherence to model</title><p>Peer mentors will be assigned study participants only after they have demonstrated sufficient competence with training samples (that is, the training samples will have details of patients who will not be used within the study). Adherence and fidelity to the motivational interviewing model will be monitored by an analysis of a random selection of transcripts (sessions 2 to 5) using the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity rating system, a validated and reliable behavioural coding system used to measure treatment integrity in motivational interviewing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. A simplified version of the Revised Cognitive Therapy Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] will be adapted specifically for this intervention to address the more goal-driven aspects of the programme.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Patient assessments</title><p>The assessments will be conducted at different time points (that is, baseline, daily, 6-weeks, and 6-month follow-up; see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for the assessment schedule).

We will also use an adapted form of the Client Service Receipt Inventory (a well-established tool used in health economics) to track the amount of treatment received over the year.

The hypothesized mediators and moderators of primary and secondary outcomes include mood (DASS-21), perceived work or social adjustment (Work and Social Adjustment Scale), motivation and confidence to change (visual analogue scale and ACMTQ), cognitive flexibility, and perceived alliance with therapist and peer mentor. Moreover, the trajectories of change in eating disorder symptoms (weekly EDE-QS), perceived alliance with peer mentors (assessed weekly), and mood, confidence or motivation, connection to others, hope and adherence or satisfaction with treatment plan (assessed daily via ultra-brief surveys) will predict the primary and secondary outcomes. Exploratory outcomes include the impact of guidance delivery on peer mentors&#x02019; eating disorder symptoms and mood (assessed via a feedback form) and treatment adherence or fidelity and acceptability (assessed via a feedback form) on secondary outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Expected results</title><sec id="Sec23"><title>Quantitative data analysis</title><p>This exploratory hypothesis testing study is designed to assess our theorized model of maintenance and change in anorexia nervosa (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The time trend in weight and symptoms of anorexia nervosa over 6&#x000a0;months for each person will be estimated using mixed-effects regression models with structured covariance patterns to account for autocorrelation of repeated measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].

The process of therapy has been informed by the recovery approach in that people with personal experience of eating disorders are recruited as peer mentors and &#x02018;vodcast&#x02019; narratives from people who have recovered are used to describe strategies to implement change. We are using new technologies, such as computerized assessment and feedback, live text-chat support and prompts to change that are accessible by mobile phones.</p><p>Although there has recently been a proliferation of mobile applications designed to assist with behaviour change among those with eating-related difficulties, there has been inadequate discussion of the practical, ethical and conceptual considerations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and a suggestion that extant eating disorder intervention applications minimally follow evidence-based principles for treatment and fail to capitalize on the unique features of mobiles, such as opportunities for repeated self-assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Thus, assessment of a theoretically grounded and novel mobile-delivered intervention such as <italic>Recovery</italic> MANTRA could make a significant contribution to the limited evidence base for the use of technology to support recovery from eating disorders.</p><sec id="Sec29"><title>Limitations and challenges</title><p>This will be a pragmatic trial and will examine the impact of the addition of the <italic>Recovery</italic> MANTRA intervention to treatment as usual in a variety of treatment settings. Although it might be difficult to capture the exact nature of treatment as usual in each centre, our strategy of randomization stratified by centre will minimize any bias that might be caused by site-related differences. A key advantage of the current design is that we can examine how feasible and acceptable this intervention is in standard treatment settings. Although we have previously used peer support in the context of interventions for carers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and frequently employ such individuals in our inpatient setting to help with teaching and various aspects of the therapeutic environment, we have not yet employed recovered individuals exactly in the capacity as in the <italic>Recovery</italic> MANTRA intervention. We will thus examine whether this form of task-sharing is feasible. We will also pay close attention to the well-being of these individuals and use their feedback to inform this recovery approach strategy. Notably, our use of audio recordings from recovered individuals as therapeutic prompts maximizes the power of the recovery approach and self-determination theory. Following our pilot testing of these recovery narratives, we decided to anonymize the vodcasts by substituting the images of the narrators with secondary images. This strategy reduced the resources required to disseminate the materials, retaining their appeal due to authenticity while allowing them to be more generally distributed without privacy concerns. Finally, the technology platform that we are using (Ieso Digital Health) has been successfully used to deliver cognitive behaviour therapy in the context of IAPT (Improving Access to Psychological Therapies) services in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], but we are not aware of this type of approach being used for people with eating disorders as yet.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Trial status</title><p>The study started in November 2014.
