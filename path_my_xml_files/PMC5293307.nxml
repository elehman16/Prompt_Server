The trial was divided into 3 outcome stages for ease of analysis and reporting: stage I: from time of mastectomy/tissue expander placement to definitive reconstruction (including tissue expansion, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy), stage II: from time of removal of tissue expanders and placement of a definitive implant or autologous reconstruction to 3 months postoperative, and stage III: from 3 months postdefinitive reconstruction to 2 years postoperative. The goals of the trial were to prospectively follow the outcomes of breast reconstruction utilizing acellular dermal matrix (ADM); to compare complications between AlloDerm and DermaMatrix groups; and to analyze the impact of age, body mass index, smoking, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy on clinical outcomes and histological analyses. The design of the trial<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and stage I outcomes<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> have been reported previously.</p><p>Results from stage I of the BREASTrial demonstrated a 36.2% overall complication rate with a higher tissue expander loss rate for the DermaMatrix group (11.2% vs 5% in the AlloDerm group), although this was not significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.11). Other complication profiles were similar between groups. The time to full expansion was nearly twice as long in the DermaMatrix group (70 vs 42 days, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001). Of note, there were more smokers (9.4% vs 0%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.01) and more patients who received radiation therapy (50% vs 31.3%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.03) in the DermaMatrix group. On multivariable regression analysis of the trial data, obesity was associated with a 7-fold increased risk of poor ADM integration (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001) and a 22% increased time until drain removal, both which were associated with tissue expander loss (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.01).<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Chemotherapy and radiation treatment did not increase the risk of complications in stage I (expansion phase) of the trial.</p><p>The purpose of this study is to report the outcomes from stage II of the trial, which will capture the complications from the time of tissue expander removal and conversion to a permanent implant and/or autologous tissue reconstruction until 3 months postoperative. Stage III and histological outcomes are forthcoming.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>Complete details of the study design and methods have been previously published.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> After institutional review board approval and obtaining written informed consent, patients undergoing mastectomy and immediate tissue expander reconstruction at the University of Utah and Huntsman Cancer Institute were randomly assigned to either freeze-dried AlloDerm (Lifecell, Branchburg, N.J.) or freeze-dried DermaMatrix (Synthes, West Chester, Pa. and Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation, Edison, N.J.) (6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;16&#x02009;cm, thick). Tissue expansion proceeded with outcomes reported previously.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Definitive reconstruction with a permanent implant and/or autologous tissue was then performed after expansion was complete no sooner than 3 months after mastectomy, 3 weeks after final chemotherapy dose, and 12 weeks after completion of radiation therapy. All patients who required radiation therapy or those with significant skin necrosis/wound healing problems during stage I were recommended to undergo autologous reconstruction. Otherwise patients proceeded with implant-based reconstruction.

Secondary outcome measures included the impact of matrix type, age, obesity, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and type of reconstruction (implant vs autologous) on complication rates. All complications were recorded and graded on a scale from 0 to 4 depending on the intervention required (0 = none, 1 = dressing changes, increased clinic visits/procedures, 2 = hospital admission, intravenous antibiotics/pain control, 3 = surgical intervention in operating room, or 4 = implant removal).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed by using Fisher&#x02019;s exact test (if n &#x02264; 5) and chi-square test (if n &#x0003e; 5) for nominal variables (ie, complication yes vs no) and Mann-Whitney U tests for ordinal variables (ie, complication grade 1&#x02013;4) to compare differences in complications between groups.

Results of stage II of the trial demonstrate an acceptable complication profile in the early postoperative period (3 months) after definitive breast reconstruction with no differences between AlloDerm and DermaMatrix groups or between implant and autologous reconstruction groups. Although there were more patients who received chemotherapy and radiation therapy in the DermaMatrix by random chance in the study, regression analysis showed that chemotherapy/radiation therapy did not increase the risk of complications in the 3-month postoperative period in the overall cohort. This is counterintuitive since radiation therapy is known to be a risk factor for complications in breast reconstruction; however, since the follow-up is only 3 months in stage II for the trial, many of the complications may be yet to occur in the radiated cohort.</p><p>It was not surprising that on regression analysis obesity was associated with increased complications in the trial, as obesity is a known risk factor for complications in breast reconstruction both with<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and without<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> ADM. Although there was no direct association between obesity and an increased complication rate in stage I of the trial, we did discover that obesity was a predictor for poor ADM biointegration and longer drain time. These 2 factors were associated with increased complication rates, therefore conferring an indirect association between obesity and complications. This has led us to use ADM sparingly in the obese patient (body mass index &#x02265; 30&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) in our breast reconstruction practice.</p><p>Regression analysis of stage II data showed no association between type of reconstruction (implant vs autologous) and complication rates. This finding is in contrast to recent data including a meta-analysis<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> that demonstrates decreased complication rates, less reconstructive failures, shorter time to complete reconstruction, and a trend toward lower costs for autologous breast reconstruction.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Our similar complication profile between autologous and implant-based reconstruction patients is likely because of short-term follow-up (3 months) and the fact that disease severity was higher and there was more postoperative radiation therapy in the autologous reconstruction group. Subgroup analysis from the forthcoming stage III (2 year) follow-up data from the trial may further clarify these findings.</p><p>Despite a known association with increased complications rates,<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> ADM continues to be popular in breast reconstructive surgery. Advocates of ADM use in breast reconstruction cite decreased capsular contracture rates, decreased implant malposition, and improved aesthetic outcomes as advantages that potentially outweigh its risks.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> One area of recent significant interest is utilizing ADM in immediate single-stage direct-to-implant breast reconstruction. Proponents to this approach have noted it to be cost-effective, to be safe, and to have a reasonable complication profile.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> A current ongoing randomized trial comparing BREAST-Q and other outcomes between single-stage and 2-stage ADM breast reconstruction<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> should provide additional high level of evidence data to the current ADM breast reconstruction literature. Another area of recent interest in the literature is the use of terminally sterile ADMs, which may help mitigate the higher complication rates that ADM confers on breast reconstruction. However, a recent meta-analysis<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> and updated literature review<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> of sterile versus aseptic ADMs demonstrated no difference in complications rates. Randomized trials are needed to further define the benefit of sterile ADMs.</p><p>Limitations of the BREASTrial include lack of a total submuscular group, which would allow for a non-ADM control group comparison of the complications directly related to ADM. To date, only one other randomized trial has been completed that compared an ADM group with a total submuscular group.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> This study focused mostly on pain outcomes and did not assess other outcomes of interest. The BREASTrial focused on comparing 2 commercially available and widely used ADMs of the time. New and improved products are coming to the market all the time including fenestrated, preshaped, and prehydrated ADMs. DermaMatrix has been superseded by its close sister product FlexHD Pliable (Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation, Edison, N.J.). Our impression, based on this study, the current literature, and unpublished data from our laboratory, is that all ADMs perform similarly and that surgeons should choose the product that performs best in their hands. Use of nonbiologic meshes in breast reconstruction will also continue to evolve and may prove to be a cost-effective alternative to ADM in the future.</p><p>Another limitation of the study is that disparities exist between the 2 groups, even though patients were randomly assigned in a blinded fashion. The DermaMatrix group had more smokers, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, even though overall cancer stage (0&#x02013;IV) showed no statistical difference between groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.15). There does appear to be a trend of more advanced disease (stage III&#x02013;IV) in the DermaMatrix group, which makes type II error a possibility. This led to a trend of more autologous reconstruction in the DermaMatrix group. Disparities such as these were able to be accounted for in stage I of the trial through multivariable regression because of adequate power. In stage II of the trial, with fewer patients, and fewer complication events, there is not adequate power to correct for disparities or to perform robust subanalyses. However, the general outcome trends are still important to report and will assist plastic surgeons in making evidence-based decisions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Stage II outcomes (from definitive reconstruction to 3 months postoperative) from the BREASTrial demonstrate a significant but acceptable complication profile.
