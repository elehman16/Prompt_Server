Acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) has been found to be an effective alternative in major surgeries where we are expecting major blood loss.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Patients and Methods:</title><p>A prospective comparative study was designed to evaluate the utility of ANH patients (patients receiving autologous blood) during major operations done at MRA Medical College Ambedkar Nagar, Uttar Pradesh, India. during from September 2015 to September 2016. A total of 60 patients undergoing major surgeries were randomly assigned into two groups of thirty patients&#x02019; each. Group I received homologous blood intraoperative only when required. In Group II ANH was initiated to a target hematocrit of 30% after induction of anesthesia. Various parameters such as demographic, biochemical, and hemodynamic were compared.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The mean value of blood withdrawn in ANH group was 650.5 &#x000b1; 228 ml and it was replaced with an equal volume of 6% hydroethyl starch. There was no statistically significant variation in mean hemocrits levels in both the groups at various stages of the study. Hematocrits decreased significantly in both the groups at various stages as compared to preoperative values. The heart rate and mean blood pressure were almost similar and without statistically significant differences in both groups. Surgical blood loss in Group I was 895.29 &#x000b1; 568.30 ml as compared to 765 &#x000b1; 506 ml in Group II. The difference was statistically insignificant (<italic>P</italic> &#x02265; 0.05).

Various complications of homologous blood transfusion such as mismatched transfusion risk of infection, transmission of many diseases can be minimized using these alternatives.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>In ANH patient's blood is removed in anticoagulant containing blood bags, either immediately before or shortly after induction of anesthesia and is simultaneously replaced with an appropriate volume of crystalloids and/or colloids to maintain normovolemia using Formula of Gross.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Crystalloid in the ration of 3:1 and colloid in the ration of 1:1 using the original equation of Gross.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="AER-11-909-g001.jpg"/></p><p>Where VL = blood volume (ml) to be withdrawn, EBV = estimated total blood volume of the patient (ml), PCV0 = initial PCV (%), PCVF = patient&#x02019; minimal allowable PCV and PCVAV = average.</p><p>Appropriate patient selection, proper monitoring, and adequate intraoperative volume replacement are mandatory for this technique to be carried out safely.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>P<sc>ATIENTS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>With the approval of the Institutional Ethics Committee, we conducted a prospective randomized study of adult patients who were scheduled for an elective major head and neck surgery, orthopedic surgeries to be done in general anesthesia.

Patients who participated in the study were randomly divided into two groups, using sealed envelope method: Group 1 &#x02013; control group, Group 2 &#x02013; ANH group.</p><p>In the ANH group, after induction of general anesthesia, the blood (amount is expecting blood loss) intermittently was withdrawn from the patients and were stored in a routine blood bag to prevent clotting. At the end of the operation or in the recovery room, the collected blood was re-transfused to the patients. For both groups, normal aseptic guidelines were followed during harvesting. The blood was kept at room temperature to keep the platelet function as optimal as possible. An equal amount of blood was replaced by 6% hydroxyethyl starch (HES) to the patients in ANH group. The targeted hematocrit level for hemodilution for all patients was 30%. The need for fluid infusion was closely monitored. If necessary autologous blood was infused. In the control group, there was no autotransfusion, and just homologous blood (blood of same blood group) was used as needed.</p><p>Hematocrit before the operation, during operation and 24 h after the operation were checked. Hemodynamic studies such as blood pressure, pulse rate, and electrocardiogram were monitored during operations and at the end of operation.
