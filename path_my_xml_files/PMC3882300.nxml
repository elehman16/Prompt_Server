MGU was assessed with GLP-1 or saline infusion during pituitary-pancreatic normo- (plasma glucose (PG): 4.5 mM, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10) and hypoglycemic clamps (PG: 3.0 mM, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8) by positron emission tomography with <sup>18</sup>fluoro-deoxy-glucose (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG) as tracer.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the normoglycemia study mean (&#x000b1; SD) age was 25&#x000b1;3 years, and BMI was 22.6&#x000b1;0.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and in the hypoglycemia study the mean age was 23&#x000b1;2 years with a mean body mass index of 23&#x000b1;2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. GLP-1 did not change MGU during normoglycemia (mean (+/&#x02212; SD) 0.15+/&#x02212;0.04 and 0.16+/&#x02212;0.03 &#x000b5;mol/g/min, P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.46) or during hypoglycemia (0.16+/&#x02212;0.03 and 0.13+/&#x02212;0.04 &#x000b5;mol/g/min, P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.14). However, the effect of GLP-1 on MGU was negatively correlated to baseline MGU both during normo- and hypoglycemia, (P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.006, r<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.64 and P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.018, r<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.64, respectively) and changes in MGU correlated positively with the level of insulin resistance (HOMA 2IR) during hypoglycemia, P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.04, r<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.54. GLP-1 mediated an increase in circulating glucagon levels at PG levels below 3.5 mM and increased glucose infusion rates during the hypoglycemia study. No differences in other circulating hormones or metabolites were found.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>While GLP-1 does not affect overall MGU, GLP-1 induces changes in MGU dependent on baseline MGU such that GLP-1 increases MGU in subjects with low baseline MGU and decreases MGU in subjects with high baseline MGU.

The GLP-1 conditioned MGU is negatively correlated to baseline MGU such that GLP-1 increased MGU in subjects with low baseline MGU and decreased MGU in subjects with high baseline MGU during both normo- and hypoglycemia. This alteration correlated with the grade of insulin resistance of the subjects in the hypoglycemia setup. Moreover, the glucose infusion rate was increased with GLP-1 despite increased glucagon secretion during hypoglycemia.</p><p>In a healthy heart, the substrate preferences are flexible. In normal conditions a minimum of 60% of ATP is derived from the oxidation of free fatty acids, and the rest from the oxidation of glucose. In the diabetic heart, ATP is predominantly derived from myocardial fatty acid oxidation <xref rid="pone.0083758-vandenBrom1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. This has been associated with increased myocardial oxygen consumption and decreased mechanical efficiency <xref rid="pone.0083758-Lopaschuk1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. During hypoxia, energy metabolism shifts toward a greater oxidation of glucose to maintain myocardial viability, as the oxidation of glucose consumes less oxygen than oxidation of free fatty acids. Clinical and experimental studies have shown that increased glucose uptake during acute myocardial ischemia is associated with preserved cardiac function <xref rid="pone.0083758-Owen1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083758-Mallet1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Hyperglycaemia is an independent predictor of cardiovascular risk, infarct sizes are reported to be directly related to the severity of hyperglycaemia and the glycometabolic state is associated with the mortality risk in T2D patients with acute myocardial infarction <xref rid="pone.0083758-vandenBrom1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The beneficial effect of lowering blood glucose to very low levels, however, is controversial, one of the major problem being the increase in the number of hypoglycemic events <xref rid="pone.0083758-Finfer1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. However, the studies also showed that the currently available anti-diabetic treatments fail to reach acceptable glycemic control in the majority of patients. Therefore treatment strategies with beneficial effects toward reducing macrovascular complications (e.g., stroke, myocardial infarction) and with a low risk of adverse hypoglycemic events are being tested and although hypoglycemic events are reported in patients with heart failure <xref rid="pone.0083758-Sokos1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083758-Nielsen1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, GLP-1 analogues are considered agents with low risk of hypoglycaemia. GLP-1 inhibits glucagon secretion from the pancreatic &#x003b1;-cells at fasting and elevated glucose concentrations, whereas hypoglycemia induced glucagon secretion is not inhibited - the mechanisms are not fully understood <xref rid="pone.0083758-Nauck2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. GLP-1 infusion resulted in pharmacologically relevant plasma concentrations of the intact hormone in both studies <xref rid="pone.0083758-ToftNielsen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Slightly higher glucagon levels during hypoglycemia in the GLP-1 group compared to the control experiments were previously found in studies with native GLP-1 <xref rid="pone.0083758-Gejl2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, with the GLP-1 analogue exenatide <xref rid="pone.0083758-Degn1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and the the DPP-IV inhibitor vildagliptin <xref rid="pone.0083758-Ahren1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. We found an increased secretion of glucagon during hypoglycemia despite somatostatin infusion with GLP-1 infusion and furthermore glucose infusion rates increased in the hypoglycemia study with GLP-1. Together the latter indicate a possible mechanism for alleviation of hypoglycemia by GLP-1. In the PET studies, increased levels of cortisol were observed with GLP-1 infusion during the clamp from time 120&#x02013;150 min after which cortisol levels were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083758-g003">figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083758-g004">4</xref>). This increase in cortisol is consistent with previous observations <xref rid="pone.0083758-Vella1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083758-Vella2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> and may indicate an activation of hypothalamic neuroendocrine neurons by GLP-1 <xref rid="pone.0083758-Ryan1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Central administration of GLP-1 activates the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis primarily through stimulation of corticotropin releasing hormone neurons <xref rid="pone.0083758-Larsen1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Myocardial glucose uptake is not correlated to cortisol levels as reported in <xref rid="pone.0083758-Choi1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, and cortisol might even decrease MGU primarily by stimulating lipolysis and by elevating FFA concentration. However; cortisol levels were similar 1 hour prior to and during the PET scans and therefore the observed effects of GLP-1 on myocardial observed are most likely not influenced by cortisol.</p><fig id="pone-0083758-g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0083758.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Hormones and metabolites - hypoglycemia study.</title><p>Plasma glucose, glucose infusion rates (GIR), total GLP-1, insulin, cortisol, free fatty acid (FFA), glucagon and epinephrine concentrations during GLP-1 (black dots) and placebo infusion (white dots).

The exact mechanisms have never been fully elucidated, although many mechanisms have been proposed (e.g. increased MGU, reduction of oxidative stress and proapoptotic kinase, activation of prosurvival kinase, and attenuation proinflammatory cell activation) <xref rid="pone.0083758-Chinda1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The GLP-1R agonists reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury by reducing infarct size and improve left ventricle function <xref rid="pone.0083758-Chinda1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, and long term studies show that patients treated with the GLP-1 agonist exenatide are less likely to record a CVD event <xref rid="pone.0083758-Best1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. However, the impact of these so-called cardioprotective effects of GLP-1 is still less well established. The most comprehensive meta-analysis of the GLP-1 analogues did not find any significant GLP-1 effect on CVD events as a whole <xref rid="pone.0083758-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Therefore, although several possible mechanisms have been put forward suggesting that GLP-1s could have a protective effect on the cardiovascular risk profile (e.g., reductions of blood glucose, body weight, and blood pressure, improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction, changes in cardiac metabolism, lipid metabolism, arthrosclerosis development and endothelial function and the response for ischemia-reperfusion injury <xref rid="pone.0083758-Sivertsen1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>), reasons for a (possible) decreased risk of developing CVD are still poorly understood. Interestingly, Kim et al <xref rid="pone.0083758-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> demonstrated that the receptor is localized predominantly in the cardiac atria and that GLP-1 stimulates the secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). In rat neonatal cardiac myocytes, hypoxia significantly increased glucose uptake stimulated by ANP, but ANP did not affect basal glucose uptake under normoxic conditions <xref rid="pone.0083758-Kudoh1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> as examined in the present study and in a similar study of patients with T2D <xref rid="pone.0083758-Gejl1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> where no direct effect on MGU are demonstrated despite a 24% increase in myocardial blood flow. The T2D study revealed that the acute stimulation of GLP-1R did alter the myocardial glucose metabolism dependent on the baseline myocardial glucose metabolism and hence level of insulin resistance <xref rid="pone.0083758-Gejl1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, consistent with the findings in the present study. A recent paper reports an increase in MGU in healthy lean subjects with GLP-1 infusion <xref rid="pone.0083758-Moberly1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. The study differs from the present studies by not having clamped the participants and consequently not having completely comparable PG, insulin, and FFA between the groups as well as non-suppressed FFA. Furthermore, they infused a GLP-1 at a higher rate (1.5 pmol/kg/min).Hypoglycemia is associated with increased mortality rates in diabetic patients after ischemia and reperfusion and the underlying mechanisms may involve reduced capacity for preconditioning. As the salvage of the myocardium is associated with increased MGU during reperfusion, cardioprotection is thought to be linked to glucose metabolism <xref rid="pone.0083758-Nishino1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. An important mechanism of the beneficial cardiovascular effect of GLP-1 may be the increase of MGU in the subjects with the lowest baseline MGU &#x02013; the most insulin resistant subjects, regardless of glycemia. Glucose mainly enters myocardial cells via the facilitative glucose transporters, GLUT1 and GLUT4. As most of the glucose transported across the GLUT1 and GLUT4 into the myocardium is metabolized due to high hexokinase affinity, our results support that transport across the cell membranes is affected by acute infusion of GLP-1 as indicated in <xref rid="pone.0083758-Gejl1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The regression estimates indicate that GLP-1 raises GLUT translocation in subjects with low baseline GLUT activity and lowers the activity in subjects with high baseline GLUT activity. Thus, it seems that the baseline activity of glucose transporters and hence level of insulin resistance influences the GLP-1 mediated action of K and MGU in cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, the effects of GLP-1 on K and MGU regress positively with HOMA2 IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083758-g002">figure 2I and J</xref>). This is in accordance with observations in models of T2D where reduced translocation of GLUT1 and GLUT4 is found in the heart <xref rid="pone.0083758-Kainulainen1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> and, the GLUT1 and GLUT4 protein levels in the membrane are related to fasting glucose levels, the higher the fasting glucose are, the lower glut concentration in the membranes of the cardiomyocytes <xref rid="pone.0083758-Hall1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Fasting glucose and IR are highly correlated. Growing evidence <xref rid="pone.0083758-Bhashyam1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083758-Vyas1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083758-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> indicates that GLP-1 and analogues enhance GLUT1 translocation in myocardial cell membranes and GLUT4 protein levels of the myocardium, but no reports support hexokinase activity to be directly influenced by GLP-1 in contrast to glucokinase activity in &#x003b2;-cell lines <xref rid="pone.0083758-Ding1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>.</p><p>Although the mechanism is not clear, it is speculated that signaling through the GLP-1R facilitates activation of Akt or AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and consequently GLUT4 translocation <xref rid="pone.0083758-Vyas1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Alternatively that stimulation of translocation of GLUT1 and GLUT4 is mediated by increased myocardial NO production <xref rid="pone.0083758-VanDyke1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083758-Etgen1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> - facilitated by activation of the GLP-1R <xref rid="pone.0083758-Bhashyam1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. GLUT1 is reported to be controlled partly by levels of plasma glucose and GLP-1 in other tissues, e.g. in the blood brain barrier in various cerebral regions <xref rid="pone.0083758-Gejl2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083758-Gejl3" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. The mechanism of the dual effect of GLP-1 and the analogue exenatide remains unclear but may be caused by receptor-mediated changes or may be a general feature of intracellular IR. The duality may be beneficial because glucose transport and uptake are stabilized by GLP-1R activation in subjects with low insulin sensitivity.</p><p>The practical implications of these findings are most importantly that GLP-1 preserves myocardial glucose metabolism during hypoglycemia in insulin resistant subjects.</p><p>Limitations: In the intact human organism, the cardiac lumped constant varies with the metabolic condition <xref rid="pone.0083758-Botker1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083758-Botker2" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Lumped constant was predefined to 1. This may underestimate the MGU, but the underestimations are the same in the groups due to the cross-over design of the study and as the subjects were clamped in both settings. GLP-1 and the analogue exenatide do not seem to affect lumped constant in the preceding brain scan or in previous myocardial <sup>18</sup>F-FDG scans <xref rid="pone.0083758-Gejl1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083758-Gejl2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083758-Gejl3" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Comparisons of absolute MGU between the normoglycemia and the hypoglycemia state could be compromised by the different methods used for determination of the input curve. This was not the case for comparisons between GLP-1 and placebo within the normo- or hypoglycemia groups.</p><p>In conclusion GLP-1 does not enhance MGU overall. GLP-1 increases MGU in subjects with low baseline MGU and decreases MGU in subjects with high baseline MGU. During hypoglycemia the most insulin resistant subjects increased their MGU. The GLP-1 induced increased secretion of glucagon and glucose infusion rates during hypoglycemia despite somatostatin indicate a possible alleviation of hypoglycemia by GLP-1. Studies addressing MGU in both the hypoxic state (under possible influence of ANP) and long-term studies are needed to provide more profound knowledge regarding the potential beneficial impact of GLP-1R stimulation on MGU.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0083758.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>
