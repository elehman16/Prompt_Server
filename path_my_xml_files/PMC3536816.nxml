In this context methods to induce changes in the pain-related neural network can alter pain perception. The somatosensory system has been a traditional target for modulation of pain perception. Transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS) is an example of an intervention that targets the peripheral sensory system leading to changes in pain perception. Pain modulation with TENS is hypothesized to induce effects at spinal and also thalamic levels <xref rid="pone.0052968-Sluka1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Although extensive data from TENS studies have confirmed the notion that modulation of somatosensory system at peripheral level leads to a change in pain perception, one important question is whether behavioral tasks involved with somatosensory processing would have significant effects in pain processing.</p><p>It is known that the sensory system is functionally and structurally connected to the motor system. This is why treatments aiming at increasing motor control can be used for pain control <xref rid="pone.0052968-Busch1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052968-vanVliet1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Moreover, recent data has shown that also cortical structures such as the primary motor cortex (M1) can reduce pain significantly <xref rid="pone.0052968-Fregni1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. This raises another question, whether sensory behavioral tasks would have an effect on motor cortex plasticity. Moreover, Ostry et al. showed that also learning tasks with motor component are not only related to changes in motor areas but also in brain areas that mediate sensory changes, including primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortices <xref rid="pone.0052968-Ostry1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. This is likely mediated by ipsilateral corticocortical pathways connecting motor and somatosensory areas <xref rid="pone.0052968-DarianSmith1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052968-DarianSmith2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Furthermore, recent studies showed that the sensory-discriminative dimension of pain is related to pain processing and its modulation in S1 and S2 cortices <xref rid="pone.0052968-Sewards1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052968-Price1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052968-Vogt1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052968-Sewards2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052968-Vogt2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, which project through the lateral thalamic nuclei and other brain areas forming the lateral pain system <xref rid="pone.0052968-Xie1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Therefore, we aimed to explore if somatosensory input can modify pressure pain thresholds through modulation of sensory and/or motor cortical areas, which can secondarily lead to inhibition of other structures mediating pain processing such as thalamus. Furthermore, we hypothesized that they may change S1 and M1 excitability, respectively, as they require sensory-motor integration.</p><p>We therefore measured three tasks involved with somatosensory activation. In two of them we aimed to induce a significant component involved with cortical processing as tasks were associated with somatosensory learning with and without visual feedback <xref rid="pone.0052968-Staines1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052968-Merabet1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> while in the third task there was only passive activation of the somatosensory system. In addition we measured motor cortex plasticity as the motor cortex is an important target involved in pain control. In fact, M1 appears to be the best cortical target for pain control when using neuromodulatory techniques <xref rid="pone.0052968-Fregni2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052968-Fregni3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052968-Lefaucheur1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052968-Hirayama1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. However, the underlying mechanisms of the analgesic effects remain unknown. On one hand, there is recent evidence showing that changes in pain perception and changes in motor-cortical excitability are dissociated <xref rid="pone.0052968-Volz1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. But on the other hand, there is the idea that the altered activity in M1 might be a marker of chronic pain. The study by Lefaucheur et al. (2006) has shown that chronic neuropathic pain is correlated with changes in motor cortex excitability, particularly a decreased inhibition, suggesting impaired GABAergic neurotransmission <xref rid="pone.0052968-Lefaucheur2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate the effects of different somatosensory tasks on pain perception and motor cortex excitability in healthy male individuals as to compare tasks involved with and without cortical processing vs. a control condition. For that reason, the local vs. distant effects were measured in this study: pressure pain threshold in both hands and neurophysiologic measures of cortical plasticity as assessed by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).</p><p>Our initial hypothesis is that somatosensory tasks are capable of changing both pressure pain threshold and motor-cortical excitability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Design</title><p>We conducted a randomized parallel designed trial to determine the effects of three different somatosensory tasks on pressure pain threshold and M1 excitability in healthy male volunteers. This study was approved by the local ethics review board of Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital (Boston, USA) and was carried out according to the tenants of the Declaration of Helsinki. Subjects read and signed written informed consent form before participating in this study.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Subjects</title><p>Forty healthy right-handed male subjects (mean age: 25.9 years, SD: 7.79, range: 18&#x02013;48 years) were recruited by postings in universities, the internet and public places around the Boston area. Subjects were enrolled in the study if they fulfilled the following criteria: (1) adult males; (2) right-handed (confirmed by Edinburgh Handedness Inventory <xref rid="pone.0052968-Oldfield1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>); (3) no use of central nervous system-effective medication; (4) no clinically significant or unstable medical, neurological or psychiatric disorder (assessed with Beck Depression Inventory <xref rid="pone.0052968-Beck1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>); (5) no rheumatologic disease (6); no history of alcohol or substance abuse within the last 6 months; and (7) no contraindication to TMS <xref rid="pone.0052968-Rossi1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. All subjects gave written, informed consent. Since it is known that high age and the menstrual cycle modulates cortical excitability <xref rid="pone.0052968-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052968-Freitas1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, we enrolled only adult male participants (age range in the study varied from 18 to 48 years old). Moreover, we only included right-handed subjects in order to test the right non-dominant hemisphere. The non-dominant site was chosen for several reasons: firstly, we assumed that the effects of somatosensory learning may be larger for the non-dominant hemisphere as this is known for motor tasks (thus we aimed to avoid ceiling effect), secondly, we thought that the analgesic effects would be greater in the non-dominant hand since it appears to more sensitive to stimuli as compared to the dominant hand.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Experiment</title><p>Subjects were randomized into one of four study arms; thus, each intervention was completed by ten subjects. Every visit included the same assessments and only the 20-minute task - which was performed with subjects&#x02019; left hand - was different (SL<sub>sighted</sub>, SL<sub>blindfold</sub>, S<sub>activation</sub>, control, see below). Pressure pain threshold levels were assessed for both hands before and after the task, as well as TMS measures. The investigator assessing the outcomes was blinded to the intervention and although subjects were not blinded as the tasks consisted on different behavioral interventions (not possible to blind), they were not told whether any specific task would be associated with an effect on pain threshold and/or cortical excitability. The left non- dominant hand received the sensory tasks, which means that the task targeted that hand, whereas the right hand was not targeted by the intervention and did not receive any sensory stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Somatosensory Tasks</title><p>All subjects were seated in the same chair and asked to position their left hand on a table supported with a towel underneath to avoid an uncomfortable arm position. Subjects were instructed not to move their fingers or wrists. In case a participant moved three or more times, which was visually monitored by an investigator, their data were excluded from analyses to control for a pure effect due to somatosensory activation. In total, there were ten subjects randomized in each of the following groups:</p><sec id="s2d1"><title>Somatosensory Learning with visual feedback (SL<sub>sighted</sub>)</title><p>This tactile pattern discrimination task consisted of recognizing embossed raised dot patterns. Similar tasks have been described before <xref rid="pone.0052968-Merabet1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052968-Lane1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The tactile patterns used in the task corresponded to Braille print symbols (produced with a Braille embosser). The recognition of these tactile patterns required sensory and spatial integration <xref rid="pone.0052968-Heed1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The tactile task was subdivided into four 5 min blocks. Before each block, subjects could view and memorize the pattern and its corresponding name. The sheets with raised patterns were then swept underneath the subject&#x02019;s left finger in a standardized vertical movement (by an experienced experimenter) keeping the same speed throughout the task. Participants had to name each letter, before the next letter was presented. Furthermore, they were not able to view the shape of the patterns, which was ensured using a blind, however subjects kept visual feedback. To promote continuous learning effects, task difficulty was increased over time by adding patterns of greater complexity. Somatosensory learning (SSL) component was measured by comparing the number of correct letters of the first and last block, which included the same battery of letters.</p></sec><sec id="s2d2"><title>Somatosensory Learning without visual feedback (SL<sub>blindfold</sub>)</title><p>This task involved exactly the same procedure as SL<sub>sighted</sub>. The only difference was that the subject wore a specially designed blindfold to ensure no visual input.</p></sec><sec id="s2d3"><title>Simple somatosensory activation (S<sub>activation</sub>)</title><p>Participants&#x02019; left index finger was excited with items of different texture to activate the somatosensory cortex without the involvement of a learning component. S1 activation and attention was secured by alteration of different textures. Participants were instructed to concentrate on the stimulated finger in order to ensure the same level of vigilance as it was during the learning tasks.</p></sec><sec id="s2d4"><title>Control</title><p>The subjects in this group were positioned similarly to the other groups; however, they did not receive any somatosensory input (SSI). Moreover, they were instructed not to talk and to remain attentive, and not to move the hand or finger to exactly mimic the testing conditions of the other tasks. It was visually monitored that participants had a uniform level of attention compared to the other tasks in order to secure comparability of experimental setting.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Pain Assessment</title><p>Pressure pain thresholds were evaluated with an algometer device (model commander, J Tech Medical Industries, USA). This device has a 1-cm<sup>2</sup> rubber probe, which was pressed against the palmar side of the hand. Subjects were instructed to signal when the stimulus became painful <xref rid="pone.0052968-Chesterton1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Threshold levels were assessed before and after the intervention, and the average of three measures were calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)</title><p>TMS was assessed before and after the intervention. It was performed using a Bistim2 stimulator and a figure-of-eight coil (Magstim Company LTDA, UK). Silver/silver chloride electrodes were placed over the first dorsal interosseus (FDI) muscle belly and its corresponding tendon on the distal phalanx of the index finger. Motor-evoked potentials (MEP) were processed through Powerlab 4/30 (ADinstruments, USA) with a band pass of 20&#x02013;2000 kHz. Recordings were saved on a computer and off-line analyses were performed with data collection software LabChart (ADinstruments, USA).</p><p>TMS assessments were performed on the right hemisphere before and after the intervention. Responses to stimuli were recorded from the contralateral FDI. First, motor threshold (MT) was determined, which was defined as the lowest intensity eliciting 3 out of 5 MEP with an amplitude of 100 &#x000b5;V. MEP were recorded at an intensity that could elicit a MEP of 1 mV (peak-to-peak amplitude). Furthermore, single-pulse measures included cortical silent periods (CSP) at intensities of 110%, 120% and 130% of the MT. During recording, subjects were instructed to perform isometric voluntary contraction with approximately 10% of maximal contraction as ascertained and controlled with a mechanical pinch gauge (Baseline&#x000ae; Evaluation Instruments). Thirty CSP were elicited in a random order. Relative CSP were analyzed, i.e. the entire duration of the last MEP followed by the silent period. Paired-pulse measures included short intracortical inhibition (SICI) with interstimulus interval (ISI) of 3 ms, and intracortical facilitation (ICF) with ISI of 10 ms. The first subthreshold stimulus was set at 70% of the individual MT and the second suprathreshold stimulus at MEP intensity. Forty-five recordings were made in random order having an interval of approximately 8 seconds between each pulse. Paired-pulse measures were analyzed calculating their individual index (SICI or ICF/MEP).</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>Analyses were done with STATA (v11.0, College Station, Texas, US) and graphs were generated by GraphPad Prism version 4.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, USA).</p><p>To assess the learning component of the two tasks SL<sub>sighted</sub> and SL<sub>blindfold</sub>, ANOVA was performed. Moreover, post hoc paired two-tailed t-tests were done separately for each task (SL<sub>sighted</sub> and SL<sub>blindfold</sub>) to compare the results of the first and last sequence of the tactile task. Thus, these analyses can reveal the change of performance over time and can detect a potential learning experience.</p><p>For the main outcome of pressure pain threshold levels, several models of mixed ANOVA were performed as to investigate the effects of hand, time, task and the interaction of time and hand. Subsequently we tested the results of each hand separately and also compared the effects of active tasks (SL<sub>sighted</sub>, SL<sub>blindfold</sub>, S<sub>activation</sub>) together vs. control and separate effects of the sensory tasks. When appropriate, post hoc analyses were done using paired and unpaired two-tailed t-tests to compare changes in pain thresholds within (against baseline) and between groups. In detail we did following analyses: (i) We conducted an ANOVA model to reveal the effects for the interaction of hand and time, (ii) we then conducted separate ANOVAs for the left and right hands comparing active vs. control tasks, (iii) we then ran an ANOVA to test whether the three active sensory tasks (SL<sub>sighted</sub>, SL<sub>blindfold</sub>, S<sub>activation</sub>) induced differential effects compared to controls.</p><p>To analyze TMS data, we performed a mixed ANOVA model in which the dependent variables were the measures of cortical excitability (MTs, MEPs, SICIs, ICFs, CSPs) and the independent variables were groups (SL<sub>sighted</sub>, SL<sub>blindfold</sub>, S<sub>activation</sub>, versus Control), time (pre, post) and the interaction of group and time. Moreover, we performed post hoc t-tests to reveal differences within (against baseline) and between groups. Firstly, we conducted an ANOVA for the interaction between task and time comparing somatosensory tasks vs. control. To reveal the direction of changes in cortical plasticity (increase or decrease), we ran post hoc t-tests for all sensory tasks and controls comparing the value before vs. after the intervention. After that, we conducted an ANOVA to reveal potential differences across the three sensory tasks.</p><p>Statistical significance and trend refer to a p-value &#x0003c;0.05 and &#x0003c;0.1, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>All 40 enrolled subjects completed the study and no adverse effects were experienced throughout the study.

Additionally, TMS measurements showed that somatosensory input (SSI) generally decreased motor cortex excitability over time indexed by significantly reduced amplitudes of MEP and a trend for increased SICI. Interestingly, although the three sensory tasks similarly impacted pain thresholds and motor cortical excitability, only the task with visual feedback showed significant somatosensory learning (SSL). This evidence together with the lack of correlation between motor cortex plasticity and pain thresholds suggests that the effects of SSI on pain threshold were independent of motor cortical neural mechanisms.</p><p>One potential limitation of this investigation was that the assessment to measure pain (pressure pain threshold) does not measure cutaneous pain receptors only as it also measures deep muscular pain. The pressure pain threshold test rather evaluates the combined pain threshold of cutaneous pain receptors and also deeper pain receptors such as from the periost and muscular receptors <xref rid="pone.0052968-Imamura1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052968-Knudsen1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052968-Reeves1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052968-Fischer1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Although this may be interpreted as a limitation, our goal was to use an outcome measure that could differentiate at least at some extent the assessment of pain and the intervention tasks consisting of light sensory touch. This is why we utilized pressure pain threshold rather then a cutaneous pain assessment to assess pain. However, different effects then those we revealed could be possible using cutaneous assessments.</p><p>Nevertheless, in our experiment, somatosensory tasks changed pressure pain threshold. This is in line with results from other studies using other types of somatosensory stimulation <xref rid="pone.0052968-Dietrich1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052968-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, thus provide further evidence that sensory stimulation can change pain perception. For instance, for the treatment of pain it was found that prosthesis with sensory feedback as well as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) reduced pain <xref rid="pone.0052968-Dietrich1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052968-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052968-Mulvey1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. In the present study, we tested pure SSI without any motor involvement as visually controlled and monitored by an experimenter. Since some previous studies testing somatosensory training had also a motor component that could explain effects on pain, we aimed to isolate the somatosensory involvement. We discuss then potential mechanisms to explain the sensory effects on pain threshold based on the main results we found and summarized here: (i) the effects were specific for location of stimulation (hand-specific); (ii) effects did not depend on the somatosensory task (learning-based sensory task was not different than simple sensory activation task); (iii) there was a significant decrease in motor cortical excitability.</p><p>Initially, we discuss the mechanistic insights with our first finding: <italic>somatosensory tasks led to an increase in pain threshold in the left trained hand and an opposite effect on the untrained hand.</italic> This finding supports the clear notion that somatosensory tasks have a hand specific effect on pain thresholds. Since, somatosensory peripheral stimulation leads to broad activation of bi-hemispheric structures <xref rid="pone.0052968-Pleger1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, it might be possible that the modulation induced by the sensory tasks leads to a similar neuronal activation profile. Based on bilateral activation with sensory stimulation, it is likely that neural mechanisms besides cortical structures may explain this laterality specific effect (for instance subcortical structures such as thalamic nuclei). Supporting this conclusions are the results of a recent study in monkeys reporting that ipsilateral tactile stimuli resulted in reduced responses to stimuli on the contralateral hand (and increased in the ipsilateral hand) <xref rid="pone.0052968-Reed1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><p>Our second finding strengthens the hypothesis of the involvement of non-cortical neural mechanisms as here we showed that a learning based somatosensory task had the same effect on pain processing as a simple somatosensory task. To confirm cortical involvement of the learning task, we have shown that a significant learning occurred with the sighted task. This can be explained by neuronal processing on a cortical level, since it demanded a higher level of cortical activation and processing. As all tasks led to similar effects in pain alleviation of the ipsilateral left hand and pain sensitization of the contralateral right hand, this suggest that a simple level of sensory stimulation is the only requisite to modulate pain-related neural circuits; thus subcortical structures are likely responsible for this effect. Indeed, the somatosensory learning task was likely associated with significant cortical activation as indicated by a fMRI study in which combined visual and somatosensory input increased blood oxygenation level in certain cortical areas compared to only one of the stimuli <xref rid="pone.0052968-Dionne1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.</p><p>The third finding that supports our proposed mechanism of subcortical involvement is the lack of correlation between pain measurements and cortical plasticity as measured by TMS. Indeed, we found a decrease in motor cortical excitability as indexed by significantly reduced amplitudes of MEP and a trend for increased SICI. This result by itself was unexpected since we hypothesized that sensory tasks would induce increased excitability of the motor cortex <xref rid="pone.0052968-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. This potentially conflicting result suggests that motor cortical excitability changes in our study as indexed by TMS might be an epiphenomenon and not the cause of the changes in pain threshold <xref rid="pone.0052968-Lefaucheur3" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Furthermore, since only MEP was changed and no other intra-<bold>cortical</bold> measurement revealed a significant change, this provides further evidence that changes in M1 are due to secondary, non-cortical effects. In line with our findings, a study using electrical stimulation of the median nerve and digital nerves of fingers showed that motor cortical excitability decreases <xref rid="pone.0052968-Tokimura1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Nevertheless, the limitation in comparability needs to be mentioned as the study assessed changes in motor cortical excitability only immediately after stimulation. Finally we did not find a significant correlation between the decrease in cortical excitability in M1 and pain perception changes, strengthening the notion that analgesic effects due to the sensory behavioral tasks in the present study are not mediated through M1.</p><p>In conclusion, our experiment showed that sensory behavioral tasks decreased pain perception of the ipsilateral hand and increased it in the contralateral hand. Based on the hand specific effects, the lack of differences between the learning-based task and the other somatosensory tasks, and results showing a reduction of cortical excitability in the motor cortex along with no correlation with pain thresholds, it is likely that these effects on pain threshold are independent from the motor cortex and its increased excitability. It might be possible that subcortical mechanisms (potentially at thalamic or spinal cord level) are mediating these effects. Future research should then use other methods to localize specific subcortical targets associated with potential analgesic effects of somatosensory modulation as well as test these effects in patients with pain and potentially combine with top down techniques such as brain stimulation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The study and its results are part of the MD thesis of Volz MS.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0052968-Sluka1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
