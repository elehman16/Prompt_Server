This randomized, open-label, multicenter study aimed to explore whether dose-escalation of gefitinib would improve response and survival in NSCLC patients who achieved SD after one-month of standard gefitinib dosage. Between May 2009 and January 2012, 466 patients were enrolled and 100 eligible patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either a higher dose (500 mg/d; H group) or to continue standard dose (250 mg/d; S group) of gefitinib. Objective response rate (ORR) was similar between the two groups (12.5% vs 12.5%, <italic>p</italic> = 1.000). There were no significant differences regarding progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) between both arms (H group vs S group: median PFS, 5.30 months vs 6.23 months, <italic>p</italic> = 0.167; median OS, 13.70 months vs 18.87 months, <italic>p</italic> = 0.156). Therefore, dose-escalation of gefitinib does not confer a response or survival advantage in patients who achieve SD with one month of standard-dose gefitinib treatment.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Although chemotherapy remains the mainstream treatment of NSCLC, the emergence of targeted therapy has led to tremendous advancement. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations play an important role in driving the growth of NSCLC. The most commonly detected drug-sensitive mutations are deletions in exon 19 and point mutations in exon 21. EGFR mutations have been confirmed as a predictive biomarker for EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) treatment in several clinical trials<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.</p><p>Currently, gefitinib and erlotinib are approved for the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC with sensitive EGFR mutations. However, the routine clinical dose of gefitinib (250&#x02009;mg/day) is only one-third of its maximum tolerated dose (MTD) while the dose of erlotinib (150&#x02009;mg/day) is at its MTD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Until now, no head-to-head trials have been available to determine whether erlotinib is superior to gefitinib in terms of response rate or survival. Therefore, dose escalation of gefitinib is feasible and warrants further investigation. Some previous studies have showed that higher drug exposure of gefitinib was associated with better clinical outcomes, especially in patients with wild type EGFR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. However, other studies found that gefitinib dose-escalation did not show superior efficacy in nonselective population<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. We assume that a portion of specific patients may benefit from higher drug dosage. Kaira <italic>et al.</italic> analyzed eleven published reports about the effectiveness of erlotinib re-challenge (may be considered as an EGFR-TKI dose-escalation) after previous gefitinib failure in advanced NSCLC patients and revealed that patients who had stable disease (SD) but not those with a complete response (CR) plus partial response (PR) or progressive disease (PD) for gefitinib benefited from erlotinib. Thus, the patients who achieved CR+PR or PD with gefitinib were either most sensitive or primarily resistant to initial EGFR-TKIs. Those who achieved SD may be the target patients who will benefit from higher dose EGFR TKIs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Currently, no consensus has been reached on the optimal treatment of these SD patients. Whether these patients should switch to other anti-cancer drugs or have more intensive dose of initial drugs to achieve PR or CR remains controversial. A phase II trials assessing chemotherapy continuation vs switch in advanced NSCLC patients with SD after two course of chemotherapy found no difference in response rates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. However, no studies have investigated the efficacy of gefitinib dose-escalation in these SD patients after one month of standard gefitinib dosage.</p><p>Based on previous studies, we postulated that gefitinib drug escalation of gefitinib may improve response and survival in NSCLC patients who achieved SD after one month of standard gefitinib dosage.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Patients</title><p>Between May 2009 and January 2012, 466 patients treated with gefitinib (250&#x02009;mg/d) were enrolled from 10 centers in China.

In addition to our previous study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, Nakamura <italic>et al.</italic> also assessed the relationship between the plasma gefitinib concentration and its efficacy in patients with advanced NSCLC. In subgroup analysis, median PFS was similar between EGFR MT patients and WT patients in the high D8/D3 group, whereas the WT EGFR patients in the low D8/D3 group showed the worst median PFS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Nakamura <italic>et al.</italic> concluded that better survival was correlated with a higher drug plasma concentration in WT EGFR patients. However, in two randomized phase II trials (IDEAL 1 and 2), gefitinib 250&#x02009;mg/d was as effective as, and better tolerated than, gefitinib 500&#x02009;mg/d<sup>10,11</sup>. Moreover, Hirano <italic>et al.</italic> found that the Cmax of gefitinib in patients with PR was significantly lower than that of patients with SD (median Cmax: 278 vs 588&#x02009;ng/mL, respectively; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). A significant negative correlation was found between the area under the plasma concentration time curve (0 -24&#x02009;h) of gefitinib and survival (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. They concluded that a high plasma concentration of gefitinib does not guarantee long-term therapeutic effects in MT EGFR patients.</p><p>The current study describes the unique multicenter randomized study that explores the hypothesis that better treatment outcome of EGFR TKIs could also be attributed, in part, to higher drug exposure in patients with advanced NSCLC. Our study differed from the IDEAL 1 and 2 studies. In IDEAL 1 and 2, the patients were randomly assigned two dose levels of gefitinib (250 versus 500&#x02009;mg/d) at treatment initiation, whereas only patients who achieved SD after one month of treatment with 250&#x02009;mg/d gefitinib were randomly assigned to 250&#x02009;mg/d versus 500 mg/d of gefitinib in the present study. The present study is likely to enrich a more homogeneous group of patients, is expected to minimize the dilution effect, and may maintain practical and feasible patients&#x02019; accrual levels. In our study, gefitinib dose escalation significantly increased the drug plasma concentration. However, this increase did not translate into the improvements in patient&#x02019;s response or survival. The result was consistent with those in previous studies showing that 500&#x02009;mg gefitinib did not provide additional benefits. Patient selection provides one possible explanation for this. It may be that only a specific population benefits from dose escalation, but in the current study, the clinical characteristics of &#x0201c;SD after one-month gefitinib treatment&#x0201d; were insufficient to select these patients from the entire population. In another study by Yeo <italic>et al.</italic>, a decrease dose of erlotinib from 150&#x02009;mg/d to 25&#x02009;mg/d (equivalent to gefitinib 250&#x02009;mg/d) in MT EGFR NSCLC patients showed a similar response rate but fewer side-effects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Therefore, erlotinib 25&#x02009;mg/d could be an alternative dosing scheme. Taken together, these results imply that gefitinib 250&#x02009;mg/d is currently the lowest and clinically active dose in SD patients and that a dose-escalation of EGFR-TKIs within the MTD might not improve clinical outcomes.</p><p>Whether skin rash predicted the outcome of patients treated with EGFR TKI remains controversial. In our study, patients were grouped into those presenting &#x02265; grade 2 rash and those presenting grade 0-1 rash. Although patients with severer rash tended to have longer PFS, this was not significant via multivariate analysis. Few patients in our study had &#x02265; grade 2 rash even in the H group, a finding that was consistent with that in the study by Rukazenkov <italic>et al.</italic> They found that gefitinib was significantly accumulated in tumor tissue; thus, the plasma concentration was lower than that of erlotinib, providing the concentration needed at its target to achieve effective EGFR inhibition in the tumor while causing less skin toxicity than erlotinib<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p><p>There were several limitations in the present study. Firstly, because it was not a double-blinded trial, there may be bias in the evaluation of efficacy and toxicity. Secondly, caution should be exerted regarding the small number of patients in our study. Thirdly, the enrollment was based on the clinical response and not the EGFR mutation status; thus, the patient selection was suboptimal. Nevertheless the clinicopathologic characteristics of the two groups were balanced in two groups and we believe the results are still reliable.</p><p>In summary, gefitinib 500&#x02009;mg/d does not confer a response or survival advantage over gefitinib 250&#x02009;mg/d in patients with advanced NSCLC who achieved SD with one-month of gefitinib 250&#x02009;mg/d. Given the cost-effect ratio and safety concerns, routine application of gefitinib dose-escalation is not recommended in such a population.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Patient eligibility</title><p>Eligibility criteria included histological or cytological confirmation of advanced NSCLC; recurrent or refractory disease after at least one previous regimens; achievement of SD after one-month of gefitinib 250&#x02009;mg/d therapy; measurable lesions defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 to 2; and satisfactory renal, hematological and cardiac function.

Quantitative variables were compared with Student&#x02019;s t test or Wilcoxon&#x02019;s test for unpaired series when the variables were not normally distributed. PFS and OS were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology. The log-rank test was used to compare survival between the two treatment groups. All of the statistical tests were performed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) version 21.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL). A two-tailed <italic>p</italic> value of less than 0.05 was deemed significant.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Xue, C. <italic>et al.</italic> Randomized, Multicenter Study of Gefitinib Dose-escalation in Advanced Non-small-cell Lung Cancer Patients Achieved Stable Disease after One-month Gefitinib Treatment. <italic>Sci.
