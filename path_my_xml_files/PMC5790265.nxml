We observed the efficacy of a modified Valsalva maneuver (MVM) in VVS patients. 72 VVS patients with syncope history and positive head-up tilt table testing (HUTT) results were randomly divided into conventional treatment group (NVM group, n = 36) and conventional treatment plus standard MVM for 30 days group (MVM group, n = 36). Incidence of recurrent syncope after 12 months (6.5% vs. 41.2%, P&#x0003c;0.01) and rate of positive HUTT after 30 days (9.7% vs.79.4%, P&#x0003c;0.01) were significantly lower in MVM group than in NVM group. HRV results showed that low frequency (LF), LF/ high frequency (HF), standard deviation of NN intervals (SDNN) and standard deviation of all 5-min average NN intervals (SDANN) values were significantly lower in the NVM and MVM groups than in the control group at baseline. After 30 days treatment, LF, LF/HF, SDNN, SDANN values were significantly higher compared to baseline in MVM group. Results of Cox proportional hazard model showed that higher SDNN and SDANN values at 30 days after intervention were protective factors, while positive HUTT at 30 days after intervention was risk factor for recurrent syncope. Our results indicate that 30 days MVM intervention could effectively reduce the incidence of recurrent syncope up to 12 months in VVS patients, possibly through improving sympathetic function of VVS patients.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province, China</institution></funding-source><award-id>2013CFB364</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Lun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Foundation of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China</institution></funding-source><award-id>WX15A07</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province, China (Grant No. 2013CFB364) and the Foundation of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China (Grant No. WX15A07).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Vasovagal syncope (VVS) is a clinical syndrome resulting from systemic hypotension due to transient global cerebral hypoperfusion, and characterized by rapid onset, short duration and spontaneous complete recovery [<xref rid="pone.0191880.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. There are three types of VVS: vasodepressor syncope, cardio-inhibitory syncope and mixed syncope. Although not directly responsible for increased mortality, VVS could have a tremendous deleterious impact on the daily quality of life of patients in terms of physical symptoms and injury as well as psychological impact from living in fear of the next syncopal episode [<xref rid="pone.0191880.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191880.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Therapeutic options for VVS remain challenging and far from optimal now [<xref rid="pone.0191880.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191880.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Nowadays, following strategies were attempted to reduce syncope recurrences in VVS patients with variable efficacies: 1) physical techniques to improve orthostatic tolerance; 2) pharmacologic interventions to prevent depletion of intravascular volume and/or enhance arterial and venous tone; 3) cardiac pacing to avert bradycardia [<xref rid="pone.0191880.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191880.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; and 4) anatomically guided endocardial catheter ablation of ganglionated plexi in left atrium [<xref rid="pone.0191880.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Among above mentioned therapy options, non-pharmacological therapies, especially the physical maneuvers, are viewed as important and promising strategies for reducing the syncope recurrences [<xref rid="pone.0191880.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In a previous study, Krediet and colleagues demonstrated beneficial effects of leg crossing and muscle tensing in VVS patients [<xref rid="pone.0191880.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Brignole et al. also reported a comparable effect of isometric arm counterpressure maneuvers to abort impending VVS [<xref rid="pone.0191880.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In another study, van Dijk et al. showed that physical counterpressure maneuvers were effective in preventing vasovagal syncope [<xref rid="pone.0191880.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Head-up tilt testing (HUTT) is a usual medical procedure to diagnose VVS and to define potential causes of syncope. Previous report showed that Valsalva maneuver (VM) could induce syncope in volunteer subjects [<xref rid="pone.0191880.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and the abrupt reduction in mean arterial blood pressure and subsequent reduction of cerebral perfusion during phase III of VM might be responsible for VM-induced syncope [<xref rid="pone.0191880.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Based on these reports, we once asked patients with suspected syncope to perform the classic VM for several times at the beginning and during HUTT in an attempt to increase the positive rate of HUTT in these patients. To our surprise, post VM, the HUTT result became negative in 4 out of 8 patients with previous positive HUTT results. This finding encouraged us to test if VM could have therapeutic effects in syncope patients, and two aged (&#x0003e;65 years) hospitalized male patients with recurrent in-hospital syncope was instructed to perform the classical VM 2 times per day for 5 days under supervision of medical staffs, no syncope occurred during the subsequent hospital stay and these two patients were discharged after 1 week and were asked to perform the VM once daily for 30 days at home, syncope did not occur thereafter. In spired by above observations and we started a literature search to find out if there was a potential link between VM and VVS [<xref rid="pone.0191880.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Quantified the individual roles of the cardiovascular system and the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in the hemodynamic regulations during the VM and found that hemodynamic responses to the VM were not only determined by the ANS-mediated cardiovascular regulations, but also significantly affected by the postural-change-induced hemodynamic alterations preceding the VM. We therefore assumed that the beneficial effects of VM observed in above circumferences might be related to the modulating role of VM on autonomic nervous function of VVS patients and we therefore designed present study to test if VM could be an eligible therapeutic option for VVS patients and observed the autonomic nervous function change post VM in VVS patients. To reduce the likelihood of inducing syncope by classical VM, a modified step-up graded VM (MVM) was proposed and patients were trained to perform the MVM in two phases: accommodation phase (&#x02264; 10 days) and 30 days standard therapy phase with fixed time and strength schedule. Incidences of positive HUTT and recurrent syncope were compared in VVS patients with or without MVM intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study population</title><p>Adult (aged between 18 to 80 years old) patients with recurrent VVS and recognizable prodromal symptoms were eligible for inclusion in our hospital. The diagnosis of VVS was based on the definition of the European Society of Cardiology guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0191880.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Briefly, the diagnosis was considered certain with a typical history with episodes triggered by prolonged upright position, pain, or emotional events and accompanied by lightheadedness, sweating, pallor, and/or nausea/vomiting. Presyncope was defined as near loss of consciousness. From October 2012 through May 2015, we recruited patients with at least three lifetime syncopal spells associated with positive HUTT, and &#x02265; 1 syncope recurrence within 2 weeks and follow-up for one year after 30 days treatment. Patients with other causes of syncope, such as cardiac, cerebral, pulmonary, and metabolic diseases, were excluded by medical history, 12-lead ECG, skull CT scanning, chest x-ray, echocardiography and routine laboratory tests. Patients suffered from serious liver and renal diseases as well as moderate and severe anemia were excluded from this study (Biochemical parameters were listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0191880.t001">Table 1</xref>). Finally, 72 consecutive patients with recurrent VVS and positive HUTT test were recruited and randomly divided into MVM and NVM groups by biased coin design randomization method[<xref rid="pone.0191880.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] (n = 36 each. We planned to recruit 30 for each group in our trial protocol. During the trial period, we recruited 36 patients for each group to ensure the required statistical power in case of loss of patients). (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191880.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Conventional therapy included: 1) patient education for the pathophysiology and the benign nature of VVS and the importance of taking enough dietary salt and fluid in daily life; 2) avoiding medications which might precede VVS, like diuretics, and vasodilators. Thirty age and gender matched healthy volunteers were enrolled as normal controls. Twenty-four-hour Holter monitoring was performed before HUTT test and after 30 days standard MVM or NVM treatment. All patients gave informed consent for participation in this study, and written consent was obtained from each participating patient. The study protocol was approved by the ethical committees of Puai Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.

Although repeated HUTT was not recommended to assess the therapeutic effects of various strategies in VVS patients [<xref rid="pone.0191880.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], our results suggested positive HUTT was related significantly higher risk for recurrent syncope, indicating the value of repeated HUTT for predicting therapy efficacy in selected patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191880.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Our study also demonstrated that recurrent syncope of mix syncope was significantly reduced in MVM group compared to NVM group during 12 months follow-up, which implied that mix syncope would benefit most from MVM treatment. Our results showed that MVM practiced in this study setting was safe, inexpensive and easy to perform, well tolerated and associated with good compliance (except one patient lost to follow up in MVM group, none of the rest patients in MVM group discontinued the MVM and none of the VVS patients in MVM group experienced syncope during the 30 days standard MVM intervention), therefore, MVM might serve as a feasible and effective therapeutic alternative option for VVS patients. Moreover, after the accommodation phase, which was performed under the supervision of medical staffs, this MVM was safely practiced by patients themselves at outpatient clinics, home or office during the standardized MVM phase. Above points might be responsible for the good compliance of MVM observed in this VVS patient cohort.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Methodological viewpoint of the MVM</title><p>In our experience, the step-up procedure, in that the classic VM was divided into A1 to C2 levels (6 sub-levels, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191880.g002">Fig 2</xref>), and patients were trained to increase the expiration strength and length of VM from A1 to C2 under the supervision of medical staffs during the around 10 days accommodation phase, then perform 15 MVM daily for another 30 days at C2 level, serves as the key points responsible for the satisfactory compliance and safety of MVM in this VVS patient cohort. In fact, except the unknown situation of the one lost to follow up patient, no patient experienced syncope during the MVM procedure. It is known that classical VM might &#x0201c;proceed&#x0201d; rather than treat VVS. In fact, the &#x0201c;begin low and go slow&#x0201d; principle applied in the present MVM works well in studied VVS patients, the gradually increased expiration strength and length of VM might therefore be crucial to avoid the unwanted impact of classical VM on hemodynamic and ANS in VVS patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Potential mechanism of MVM on VVS</title><p>Although we observed satisfactory effects of MVM in studied VVS patients, the underlying mechanisms is not fully clear now and could not be proved with certain by present study, as fairly pointed out by Coffin et al [<xref rid="pone.0191880.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. VVS is now recognized as a disease related with autonomous neural disorder [<xref rid="pone.0191880.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and HRV is a commonly used method to evaluate the autonomic nervous function nowadays [<xref rid="pone.0191880.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].

Present results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191880.g005">Fig 5</xref>) found that HF, rMSSD and pNN50 (parameters reflecting the parasympathetic activities) were similar among control and syncope patients, suggesting the parasympathetic function was normal during the non-syncopal period of VVS patients. However, SDNN (reflecting total sympathetic and parasympathetic activity), LF (reflecting combined action of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity), LF/HF (reflecting the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic function) and SDANN (reflecting sympathetic function) were all reduced in syncope patients compared to control subjects, indicating abnormally increased sympathetic activity in VVS patients during the non-syncopal period. LF and LF/HF values were similar between MVM group and CON group after 30 days treatment, indicating sympathetic activity returned to normal after 30 days MVM therapy. Previous studies showed that HRV results could be significantly affected by beta-blockers [<xref rid="pone.0191880.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], our results showed that SDNN and SDANN values at 30 days post intervention were increased in VVS patients allocated to MVM group and results of Cox proportional hazard model indicated that higher SDNN and SDANN values at 30 days post intervention are protective factors for recurrent syncope, before and after adjusting for gender, age and beta-blockers use. Therefore, the difference in SDNN and SDANN values between VVS patients with NVM and MVM groups were unlikely induced by beta-blockers. SDNN &#x02265;129 at 30 days post intervention was related to less syncope up to 12 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191880.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Thus, our results might hint, to some extent, that the observed efficacy of MVM might at least partly be associated with the impact of MVM on autonomous nervous tone, in favor of improved sympathetic function, in VVS patients. Clearly, future studies comparing the effects of previously reported physical training [<xref rid="pone.0191880.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191880.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and present MVM in VVS patients and studies aiming to exploring the underlying working mechanisms of MVM are warranted.</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Limitations</title><p>Firstly, this is a single-center study with a small patient cohort. Studies with larger patient cohort are needed to validate the results of present study. Secondly, Holter monitoring and HRV analysis were not performed at 12 months after treatment to observe autonomic nervous function in VVS patients. Thirdly, the underlying working mechanisms of MVM in VVS remain largely unknown now and need to be explored in future studies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec025"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study results suggest that MVM therapy strategy is safe and associated with satisfactory short- and long-term effects in this VVS patient cohort. Our results further hint a role of improved sympathetic function in VVS post MVM. Future multi-center studies are warranted to validate results shown in the present study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec026"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0191880.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0191880.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0191880.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Raw data of baseline characteristics.</title><p>Raw data of all baseline characteristics for each patient in three groups.</p><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0191880.s002.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0191880.s003"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Raw data of HUTT.</title><p>The raw data of HUTT for each patient in NVM and MVM groups at baseline and after 30 days treatment.</p><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0191880.s003.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0191880.s004"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Raw data of recurrent syncope incidence.</title><p>The raw data of recurrent syncope incidence for each patient in NVM and MVM groups during 12 months follow-up.</p><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0191880.s004.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0191880.s005"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Raw data of HRV.</title><p>HRV raw data of each patient in three groups at baseline and after 30 days treatment.</p><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0191880.s005.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0191880.s006"><label>S1 Clinical Trial Protocol</label><caption><title>Clinical trial protocol in Chinese.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0191880.s006.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0191880.s007"><label>S2 Clinical Trial Protocol</label><caption><title>Clinical trial protocol in English.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0191880.s007.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0191880.s008"><label>S1 Ethics Committee Approval Document</label><caption><title>Ethics committee approval document in Chinese.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0191880.s008.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0191880.s009"><label>S2 Ethics Committee Approval Document</label><caption><title>Ethics committee approval document in English.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0191880.s009.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>No other persons have made substantial contributions to the manuscript.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0191880.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Fenton</surname><given-names>AM</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hammill</surname><given-names>SC</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Rea</surname><given-names>RF</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Low</surname><given-names>PA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>WK</given-names></name>. <article-title>Vasovagal syncope</article-title>. <source>Ann Intern Med</source>. <year>2000</year>;
