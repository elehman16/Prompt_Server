Studies in high-risk populations have demonstrated that during progression to diabetes, &#x003b2;-cells have declining function and lose the first phase of insulin secretion, resulting in less than adequate suppression of hepatic glucose production following meals. In addition, oscillations of insulin secretion become unmatched from their normal coupling with glucose. Several mechanisms are thought to be responsible for impaired &#x003b2;-cell function, including glucose toxicity and lipotoxicity and potentially contribute to &#x003b2;-cell loss.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>Type-2 diabetes mellitus is one of the most prevalent life style disorders in today's era.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Ayurveda, the science of life mentions <italic>Apathyanimittaja Prameha</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] which resembles type-2 diabetes mellitus in terms of etiology, pathogenesis and presentation of the disease.

The cardinal symptoms mentioned in the <italic>Ayurvedic</italic> texts such as <italic>Prabhuta Mutrata</italic> (polyuria), <italic>Avila Mutrata</italic> (turbid urine or the urine with high specific gravity) are also invariably found in almost all the diagnosed cases of type-2 diabetes mellitus. Secondly, Ayurvedic texts mention <italic>Prameha</italic> as one of the first disease as a manifestation of obesity, which is the most prominent predisposing factor in the incident of type-2 diabetes mellitus. Life style and diet style factors such as sedentary habits, high sugar content food articles such as simple carbohydrates, milk products, and sweets, which make an individual prone for the incidence of type-2 diabetes mellitus, are also mentioned in Ayurvedic texts as predisposing factors for <italic>Apathyanimittaja Prameha</italic>. Thus in this study, the treatment regime both in the form of lifestyle modifications as well as pharmacological intervention using the Ayurvedic herbs mentioned for their <italic>Medohara</italic>, <italic>Pramehahara</italic>, <italic>Rasayana</italic> actions were selected, in addition to a folklore herb (<italic>Salacia chinensis</italic>).</p><p>A total of 75 patients, consisting of 39 patients newly detected and 36 chronic cases of type-2 diabetes mellitus, were registered in this study and were kept in group A and group B, respectively. A total of 67 patients completed the treatment, 36 in group A and 31 in group B.</p><p><italic>Saptarangyadi Ghanavati</italic> provided significant relief in almost all the cardinal symptoms. On comparison, both the groups were equally significant in all the symptoms except <italic>Prabhuta Mutrata</italic>, in which group A showed better effect then group B. This can be because of the less chronicity (average chronicity &#x0003c;9 months) in group A as compared to group B (average chronicity &#x0003e;5 years). In the FBS parameters, group A showed statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) reduction of 12% and group B showed a reduction of 10%, which was also statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Reduction of fasting blood glucose can be attributed &#x003b2;-cell protective and regenerative effect of the drugs like <italic>Karvellaka</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] and <italic>Methika</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] in the combination which might have improved the basal insulin secretion and thus, might have reduced the hepatic gluconeogenesis also. This assumption is further supported by an increase in fasting S. insulin levels, to some extent. In PPBS parameter, group A showed statistically highly significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) reduction of 24% and group B showed a reduction of 18%, which was also statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Reduction of post-prandial blood glucose can be attributed insulin secretagogue effect of the drugs like <italic>Karvellaka</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] <italic>Methika</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] and <italic>Guduchi</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] of the combination, which might have improved the response also. This assumption is further supported by an increase (statistically significant, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in post-prandial S. insulin levels. Both fasting as well as post-prandial levels of S. insulin were carried out in six patients in group B to evaluate &#x003b2;-cell regenerative effect (if any) and &#x003b2;-cell supportive (by improving the incretin response) effect of the combination. Fasting S. insulin levels showed a statistically insignificant increase, whereas post-prandial S. insulin showed a statistically significant increase. In chronic diabetic state, there is &#x003b2;-cell destruction, which reduces the basal insulin secretion, but acute insulin response to the oral glucose intake is not that much impaired. <italic>Saptarangyadi Ghanavati</italic> had shown an increase in the fasting S. insulin level, which was not statistically significant. However, this increase may be because of the slight regenerative effect of <italic>Saptarangyadi Ghanavati</italic>, which is supported by significant reduction in the fasting blood glucose as a result of improvement in basal insulin secretion.</p><p>Significant increase in post-prandial S. insulin levels can be attributed to the combined effect of improvement in the basal insulin secretion (supported by significant reduction in FBS levels) as well as improvement in the response (supported by significant reduction in PPBS levels) because of the insulotropic effect of the ingredients of <italic>Saptarangyadi Ghanavati</italic> like <italic>Karvellaka</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] <italic>Methika</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] <italic>Guduchi</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] There was statistically significant reduction (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in S. HbA1c levels carried out in a selected number (<italic>n</italic> &#x02212; 6) of the patients in group A. This reduction can be attributed to the multifactorial, i.e., <italic>Pramehaghna</italic> (<italic>Guduchi</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] <italic>Methika</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] <italic>Karvellaka</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] etc.), <italic>Medohara</italic> (<italic>Karvellaka</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] <italic>Methika</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] etc.), <italic>Rasayana</italic> (<italic>Triphala</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] <italic>Guduchi</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>], etc.) effect of the ingredients of the combination. Significant reduction in S.HbA1c levels shows good glycemic control for the long term as well as significant improvement in the lipid profile besides reduction in oxidative stress related to hyperglycemia.</p><p>After 2 months of the treatment, in group A serum creatinine (S. creatinine) and serum urea (S. urea) had statistically insignificant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) increase of 4.45% and 3.9%, respectively. In group B, S. urea and S. creatinine showed a statistically insignificant increase of 2.25% and 10.5%, respectively.
