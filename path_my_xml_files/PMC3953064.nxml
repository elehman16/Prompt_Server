Because canine VL chemotherapy is limited by the low efficacy of drugs currently used for human VL treatment, immunotherapy may provide a viable alternative. We used a recombinant cysteine proteinase from <italic>L.

Dogs treated with rLdccys1 showed a significant delayed type hypersensitivity reaction against the recombinant antigen and displayed high serum concentrations of IgG2 and IFN-&#x003b3; and low concentrations of IgG1 and IL-10. Immunotherapy with rLdccys1 resulted in no increase of the clinical signs of canine VL and an extensive reduction of spleen parasite load. Furthermore, all of the dogs treated with rLdccys1 survived for at least 12 months after treatment, whereas those that received either saline or <italic>P. acnes</italic> alone died within 3 to 7 months. These findings support the potential of rLdccys1 immunotherapy as an additional option for the treatment of canine VL.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grant #2007/55465-7, S&#x000e3;o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP).

A high human VL incidence has been reported in Brazil mainly due to disease urbanization as a consequence of human migration from rural areas and ineffective vector and reservoir control <xref rid="pntd.0002729-Arias1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0002729-MaiaElkhoury1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Canine VL control is based on either treatment or euthanasia of infected animals. However, treatment of canine leishmaniasis with drugs successfully used for human VL shows low efficacy and induces the development of parasitic resistance to these drugs <xref rid="pntd.0002729-Andrade1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0002729-Silva1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The WHO thus strongly recommends that the same drugs should not be used for treatment of dogs and humans in a same area <xref rid="pntd.0002729-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. On the other hand, euthanasia of infected dogs is often unacceptable for ethical and social reasons. Furthermore, the elimination of infected dogs has shown controversial results in Brazil <xref rid="pntd.0002729-Ashford1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002729-Costa1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. These issues led to the search of immunotherapy as a treatment alternative for canine VL. The administration of <italic>L. (L.) infantum chagasi</italic> extracts associated with the conventional chemotherapy of naturally infected dogs resulted in a significant reduction in infectivity <xref rid="pntd.0002729-Guarga1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Similar results were observed in dogs infected with <italic>L. (L.)</italic> infantum <italic>chagasi</italic> that displayed a significant parasite burden reduction after treatment with autoclaved <italic>L. (L.) majo</italic>r antigens and heat killed <italic>Mycobacterium vaccae</italic> administered in conjunction with Glucantime <xref rid="pntd.0002729-Jamshidi1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The healing efficacy of some vaccine candidates has also been tested. Treatment of infected dogs with purified <italic>L. (L.) infantum chagasi</italic> LiF2 antigen in combination with Glucantime led to the disappearance of clinical signs and a 100% cure rate <xref rid="pntd.0002729-Neogy1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Dogs naturally infected with <italic>L. (L.) infantum chagasi</italic> and treated with the recombinant vaccine Leish-110f formulated with the adjuvant MPL-SE associated with Glucantime showed clinical improvement, parasitological cure and increased survival <xref rid="pntd.0002729-Miret1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Recent data supported the effectiveness of this recombinant vaccine for the treatment of mild cases of canine VL <xref rid="pntd.0002729-Trigo1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.

This scenario is even more pronounced in the case of canine VL due to the low efficacy of the drugs currently in use for treatment of infected dogs <xref rid="pntd.0002729-Maltezou1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. All of these issues have pointed to the immunological stimulation as an attractive option for the treatment of leishmaniasis <xref rid="pntd.0002729-Musa1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. With this rationale, the potential of a recombinant cysteine proteinase of <italic>L. (L.) infantum chagasi</italic>, rLdccys1, for the treatment of canine VL was investigated in this study. The usefulness of this recombinant antigen was first demonstrated in screening naturally infected dogs selected for this study. Similar values were observed when either rLdccys1 or <italic>L. (L.) infantum chagasi</italic> extracts were used as antigens in ELISA assays for evaluation of humoral responses (data not shown). These findings corroborate previous results that demonstrated the high sensitivity and specificity of rLdccys1 for the diagnosis of canine and human VL <xref rid="pntd.0002729-Dias1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002729-Pinheiro2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In this study, a significant increase of DTH responses was observed after treatment with rLdccys1, supporting our previous results on the use of rLccys1 to distinguish between asymptomatic and symptomatic canine VL <xref rid="pntd.0002729-Pinheiro2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>Data on antibody production showed an increase of total IgG in all animal groups during the treatment; however this increase was higher in the rLdccys-treated dogs. Furthermore, rLdccys1-treated dogs had increased IgG2 production and decreased IgG1, while control animals exhibited lower antibody levels with predominance of IgG1. Although the IgG1 and IgG2 subclasses have been used as more reliable indicators of the CVL status than total IgG <xref rid="pntd.0002729-Deplazes1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, recently, the functional characterization of canine IgG subclasses raised doubts about the correlation of IgG subclasses with Th1 or Th2 responses <xref rid="pntd.0002729-Bergeron1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. However, our findings are compatible with those that showed high levels of IgG1 anti-<italic>Leishmania</italic> antibodies associated with the development of clinical signs in <italic>L. (L.) infantum chagasi</italic>-infected dogs, while IgG2 antibodies appear to be associated with asymptomatic infection <xref rid="pntd.0002729-Nieto1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Furthermore, protective responses in dogs vaccinated with the recombinant A2 protein appear to be associated with increased levels of total IgG and IgG2 but not with those of IgG1 anti-A2 antibodies <xref rid="pntd.0002729-Fernandes1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Our data on DTH and humoral responses in rLdccys1-treated dogs are also compatible with those reported in dogs infected with <italic>L (L.) infantum chagasi</italic> subjected to immunotherapy with the Leishmune vaccine <xref rid="pntd.0002729-BorjaCabrera1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002729-Santos1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>The treatment with rLdccys1 resulted in a significant increase of IFN-&#x003b3;, reduction in IL-10, and significantly less progressive clinical disease than control groups. In contrast, the control dogs presented the opposite profile of these lymphokines and a significant increase of clinical signs until four months after treatment. Indeed, a significant negative correlation was found between the number of clinical signs and IFN-&#x003b3; production in dogs treated with rLdccys1, whereas a positive correlation was observed between the production of IL-10 and an increase of clinical signs in control dogs. These results strengthen the implication of IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-10 in control and progression, respectively of canine VL. The induction of Th1 cells producing IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-2 and TNF-&#x003b1; has been associated with protection against canine VL <xref rid="pntd.0002729-Pinelli1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002729-Pinelli2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>.

<xref rid="pntd.0002729-Vouldoukis1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002729-Panaro1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. In contrast, IL-10 has been correlated with disease progression and an increase in IL-10 levels; this was observed in the spleens of dogs naturally infected with <italic>L. (L.) infantum chagasi</italic>
<xref rid="pntd.0002729-Lage1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. IL-10 mRNA transcripts were detected in Con A-stimulated PBMC derived from dogs with VL clinical signs <xref rid="pntd.0002729-Pinelli2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002729-Manna1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. It is worth noting that among the rLdccys1-treated dogs, the first animal that died exhibited a higher clinical score mean at screening, as well as a lower level of serum IFN-&#x003b3; one month after the end of treatment (data not shown). These findings indicate that the effectiveness of the rLdccys1 treatment is dependent on the disease progression at the time of inclusion in the study. It is possible that sick animals with lower levels of IL-10 respond better to antigen stimulation. Similar results were observed in dogs developing severe VL that did not respond to Leish-111f vaccine treatment <xref rid="pntd.0002729-Trigo1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. These considerations point to the treatment of asymptomatic dogs with rLdccys1 and a potential more pronounced Th1 response in these animals.</p><p>It is also important to emphasize the choice of the adjuvant used in the present study. <italic>P. acnes</italic> treatment elicits a type-1 (Th1) immune response involving IL-12 and IL-18 that induces IFN-&#x003b3; release, enhancement of the IgG2a switch and Th2 expansion inhibition <xref rid="pntd.0002729-Matsui1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002729-Tsutsui1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.

Our previous data on immunization of BALB/c mice with either the native or recombinant Ldccys1 plus <italic>P. acnes</italic> followed by challenge with <italic>L.

<xref rid="pntd.0002729-Miret1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Contrary to our findings, animals subjected to that immunotherapeutic protocol had a reduced number of deaths. Nevertheless, treated animals were followed until 180 days after treatment, while in our study animals were monitored until their natural death, and all of the rLdccys1-treated dogs were alive up until one year after treatment. Use of the Leish-110f vaccine in infected dogs treated for longer period of time also resulted in lower death rates compared to our results <xref rid="pntd.0002729-Trigo1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Again, this study was different from our treatment protocol because the authors emphasized the advantage of a weekly vaccine schedule over antigen administration with 3 or 4 weeks intervals <xref rid="pntd.0002729-Trigo1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.

It is important to highlight that the differences among previous studies on immunochemotherapy and the present study, including treatment schedules, adjuvant, geographical factors, and disease status of the dogs, hinder the comparison with our data. It is still important to mention that only symptomatic dogs with a high parasite burden were selected for our study and presumably treatment with rLdccys1 of animals with lower parasite burden may lead to improved results.</p><p>Despite the high parasitism levels found within the infected dogs enrolled in the present study, there was a significant lesser parasite burden in dogs treated with rLdccys1 compared to controls. Nevertheless, dog cure and a pronounced decrease of vector infectivity are desirable goals in regions of high VL endemicity. In this context, we believe that the use of booster doses of rLdccys1 associated to allopurinol, the drug recommended by WHO to treat CVL <xref rid="pntd.0002729-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, are promising to improve the effectiveness of treating CVL with this recombinant antigen.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings showed the potential of rLdccys1 as an additional tool for immunotherapy of canine VL and support further studies to evaluate its healing efficacy with a larger number of dogs, as well as in different regions of VL incidence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0002729.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
