Among them, 13 to 22&#x000a0;% become symptomatic during their lifetime. Cholecystectomy is the preferred treatment for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis. Remarkably, cholecystectomy provides symptom relief in only 60-70&#x000a0;% of patients. The objective of this trial is to compare the effectiveness of usual (operative) care with a restrictive strategy using a standardized work-up with stepwise selection for cholecystectomy in patients with gallstones and abdominal complaints.</p></sec><sec><title>Design and methods</title><p>The SECURE-trial is designed as a multicenter, randomized, parallel-arm, non-inferiority trial in patients with abdominal symptoms and ultrasound proven gallstones or sludge. If patients meet the inclusion criteria they will be randomized to either usual care or the restrictive strategy.</p><p>Patients in the usual care group will be treated according to the physician&#x02019;s knowledge and preference. Patients in the restrictive care group will be treated with interval evaluation and stepwise selection for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In this stepwise selection, patients strictly meeting the preselected criteria for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis will be offered a cholecystectomy. Patients not meeting these criteria will be assessed for other diagnoses and re-evaluated at 3-monthly intervals. Follow-up consists of web-based questionnaires at 3, 6, 9 and 12&#x000a0;months.</p><p>The main end point of this trial is defined as the proportion of patients being pain-free at 12&#x000a0;months follow-up. Pain will be assessed with the Izbicki Pain Score and Gallstone Symptom Score.</p><p>Secondary endpoints will be the proportion of patients with complications due to gallstones or cholecystectomy, the association between the patients&#x02019; symptoms and treatment and work performance, and ultimately, cost-effectiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The SECURE trial is the first randomized controlled trial examining the effectiveness of usual care versus restrictive care in patients with symptomatic gallstones. The outcome of this trial will inform clinicians whether a more restrictive strategy can minimize persistent pain in post-operative patients at least as good as usual care does, but at a lower cholecystectomy rate.

Most patients with gallstones remain asymptomatic. About 13&#x02013;22&#x000a0;% of the patients with gallstones will eventually become symptomatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Yearly, this corresponds to approximately 28,000 patients in The Netherlands and over 800,000 patients in the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The life time risk of complicated cholecystolithiasis causing choledocholithiasis, acute cholecystitis, acute pancreatitis or cholangitis is 5&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Removal of the gallbladder (i.e. cholecystectomy) is the first choice of treatment in symptomatic cholecystolithiasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with 5.5&#x000a0;% morbidity and 0.2&#x000a0;% mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Bile duct injury with an incidence of 0.5&#x02013;1.0&#x000a0;% is the most severe complication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Despite the high number of cholecystectomies performed worldwide, this approach appears to be ineffective for up to 40&#x000a0;% of patients with persistent post-operative pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>The typical presentation of uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis is a biliary colic, consisting of a steady pain, usually located in epigastrium and/or in the right upper quadrant, lasting 30&#x000a0;min or longer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, the assessment and management of cholelithiasis and cholecystolithiasis varies between surgeons, hospitals and countries mainly due to a lack of evidence-based treatment guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Variation in the cholecystectomy rate and differences in indication for surgery are reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The variety in indications for cholecystectomy is hypothesized to be one of the causes for the substantial practice variation in cholecystectomies in The Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Dutch health care insurance companies have reported that the variation in cholecystectomies performed per 100,000 insured inhabitants varied from 48 to 262 procedures, a fivefold variation. Because LC is a common surgical procedure mostly performed in regional hospitals, a centralization effect cannot explain this variation. Moreover, the total number of cholecystectomies in the Netherlands increased from 12,000 per year in 1990 to 23,000 per year at present, a 100&#x000a0;% increase, whereas the Dutch population increased from 15 to 17 million people, an increase of 13&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The indications for cholecystectomy are currently not based on evidence from randomized research and are not restricted within guidelines. The motivation to perform a cholecystectomy is not only dependent on an appropriate clinical indication, but is also influenced by patient preference and the financial incentive to operate. Patients with persistent pain generate an ongoing and significant health economic burden for society. Investigating the right indication for cholecyctectomy is in line with recent initiatives to improve patient health and reduce risks and healthcare overuse. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]</p><p>This trial aims to optimize the outcomes of patients with gallstones and abdominal complaints by identifying which patients benefit most from surgery for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis. This will clarify which patients have an absolute indication for cholecystectomy and minimize the proportion of patients undergoing unnecessary cholecystectomy. In this randomized trial usual care will be compared with a restrictive strategy consisting of a standardized work-up and stepwise selection for cholecystectomy. This study will evaluate if stepwise selection for cholecystectomy is non-inferior to usual care with respect to the proportion of patients being pain-free after 12&#x000a0;months. We hypothesize that stepwise selection of patients with cholecystolithiasis for cholecystectomy is non-inferior to usual care with respect to the patient reported outcome, but attributes to a more appropriate use of care and provides a basis for a lower number of cholecystectomies performed. This may improve patients&#x02019; health status, prevent complications, reduce health care demand and, consequently, lower health care costs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods and design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>The SECURE-trial (Scrutinizing (in)efficient use of cholecystectomy: a randomized trial concerning variation in practice) is designed as a multi-center, randomized, parallel-arm, non-inferiority study in 1038 subjects with abdominal symptoms and ultrasound proven gallstones or sludge.

Diagnostic and treatment decisions will be based on the physician&#x02019;s knowledge, preference and experience and on the patients&#x02019; preferred choice of treatment. The results of treatment will be evaluated during one year of follow-up using web-based questionnaires.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Restrictive standardized strategy</title><p>The restrictive strategy includes a standardized work-up with stepwise selection for surgery. In this restrictive arm patients are selected for surgery after a specified history using a triage instrument based on the Rome criteria for biliary colic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and systematic review of the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. According to the Rome criteria a biliary colic is defined as a severe steady pain, lasting 15&#x02013;30&#x000a0;min or longer, usually located in the epigastrium and/or right upper quadrant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The biliary colic defined according to the Rome criteria has shown to be insufficiently accurate for the diagnosis of symptomatic cholecystolithiasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Systematic reviews of the literature have shown that three symptoms have a significant relationship with the diagnosis of symptomatic cholecystolithiasis: biliary colic, pain radiating to the back and a positive response to simple analgesics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>Patients who meet these three criteria: biliary colic (Rome definition), pain radiating to the back and pain reduction after analgesics are selected for primary gallbladder removal. Patients who do not meet all these criteria go for further work-up of alternative diagnoses and have an interval evaluation at the outpatient clinic every three months. This work-up, symptoms and the effect of therapy aimed at another likely diagnosis are repeatedly evaluated every three months during one year of follow-up using web-based questionnaires. At each of the evaluation moments the indication for surgery can be made or conservative approach is continued</p><p>The use of diagnostics (e.g., gastroscopy) or therapeutics (e.g., analgesics or antacids) aimed to diagnose or treat other possible diseases causing the abdominal symptoms are left to the discretion of the treating physician.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Randomization</title><p>Patients will be randomized 1:1 between the usual care group and the restrictive care group. Randomization will be computer- and web-based using stratification to ensure a balanced distribution of (un-)known possible confounders in both treatment groups, and in blocks of variable size.</p><p>Randomization will be stratified according to the following characteristics: center, sex and body mass index. To ensure allocation concealment the randomization list will be generated using an online computer software program (ALEA NKI-AVL, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, Release: 2.2.) and implemented into a web-based application.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Sample Size</title><p>For the power analysis we assumed that the percentage of pain-free patients in the restrictive arm will be at least equal to the usual care arm at the end of follow-up. For the calculation we assumed, based on literature, that after usual care a maximum of 80&#x000a0;% of patients will be pain-free [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. If the restrictive strategy results in less than 75&#x000a0;% of patients pain-free, then this strategy will not be considered non-inferior. However, it is hypothesized that the percentage of pain-free patients in the restrictive strategy group will be slightly higher than the percentage in the usual care arm and rise to 82&#x000a0;% or above.</p><p>If the usual care arm becomes, to some extent, contaminated by the restrictive strategy arm, then the 80&#x000a0;% pain-free estimate for the usual care arm will tend towards the 82&#x000a0;% for the restrictive standardized work-up arm. If so, the boundary of non-inferiority should be increased as well in order to maintain the non-inferiority of 5&#x000a0;%. Hence, if contamination would result in 81&#x000a0;% of patients pain-free in the usual care arm, then the lower boundary of non-inferiority equals 76&#x000a0;%. Although we do not expect contamination to happen, it is accounted for in this calculation of the sample size. Thus, with a one-sided Z test, 80&#x000a0;% power and a significance level of 5&#x000a0;% a total of 1038 evaluable patients (519 in each arm) needs to be included, if the boundary of non-inferiority equals 76&#x000a0;%. In the absence of contamination and a lower boundary of non-inferiority of 75&#x000a0;%, this total number of 1038 evaluable patients will result in a power of 89&#x000a0;%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Cost-effectiveness</title><p>The economic evaluation will be undertaken as a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) with the costs per patient pain-free at 12&#x000a0;months as primary outcome measure.

The DSMC will perform safety assessments consisting of the analysis of proportion of complications due to cholecystectomy in the total number of complications. The choice of appropriate statistical technique, if any, will be left to the discretion of the DSMC, but may consist of a regression analysis on the proportion of complications due to cholecystectomy, with treatment and the proportion of patients with cholecystectomy as covariates.

The parallel-arm, non-inferiority study design best fits the focus of research in which optimal patient selection (identifying the right patient for the right treatment) rather than treatment effectiveness (identifying the best treatment given the right patient) is studied; estimates of both, the proportion of patients in whom unnecessary cholecystectomies can be prevented as well as the resulting overall effectiveness at the group level, automatically follow from this design. The current study design of randomizing patients to usual care or the restrictive standardized work-up does not exhibit the weaknesses of alternative designs which were considered. First, a design with randomization of patients to laparoscopic cholecystectomy or no surgery would focus exclusively on the effect of surgery itself and would be in need of a well-defined target population as reflected in selective inclusion and exclusion criteria. Such design would ignore the core issue in this proposal that practice variation and overconsumption of care result from the presence of indeterminate means of patient selection and indication. Second, a cluster randomized design with hospitals (rather than patients) randomized to usual care or to the restrictive standardized work-up would run the risk of selection bias and confounding. Selection bias in a cluster randomized trial might occur, if the local recruitment of patients would be influenced by prior knowledge of the treatment strategy offered by the hospital; confounding following an uneven distribution of hospitals with similar characteristics over both trial arms might easily occur given the number of participating hospitals. In addition, an adequate informed consent procedure for such cluster randomized trial would be difficult to accomplish.</p><p>A potential pitfall of the present design is the risk of contamination of usual care by the restrictive standardized work-up approach as it is conceivable that specialists transfer their experience with this work-up to usual care. It should be noted however that the equipoise principle still holds for usual care and the standardized work-up. It is very unwise and perhaps even unethical to adjust usual care as long as the clinical non-inferiority and health economic superiority of the restrictive standardized work-up approach has not been demonstrated yet. The equipoise principle should make surgeons in the participating hospitals indifferent regarding their preference for either approach during the study period. Moreover many different surgeons are involved making a strong and uniform contamination effect unlikely.</p><p>To further counter the risk of contamination as well as its potential impact on the study results, we will monitor each step during usual care in the clinical report forms. Additionally, a sample size is calculated conditional on the presence of contamination, which will be reevaluated during interim analysis and adjusted if indicated.</p><p>To optimally reflect the current health care practice all patients with abdominal pain and gallstones are included in this study. Pre-selection by excluding patients with non-specific abdominal symptoms and only including patients with specific &#x0201c;biliary colic&#x0201d; would potentially optimize health care practice outcome, but would leave optimization efforts unmeasured and would give no insight in the obvious difficulty of this selection. Selected inclusion would certainly hamper the future implementation of results by leaving the dispute unresolved of which symptoms are typical and which are not. This will risk non-compliance to new guidelines as these would not reflect real life. The &#x02018;typical&#x02019; gallstone colic patients are less typical than definition suggests. Even if a colic resulting from gallstones is almost certain, then still, wide differences of opinion exist between surgeons of how many colics are needed and which time interval between colics should have presented to indicate surgery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Impact of the secure trial</title><p>Both the inefficacy of cholecystectomy in a considerable number of patients as well as a substantial practice variation in gallbladder surgery warrant a more evidence-based approach for this high volume procedure. The first challenge in evaluating patients with upper abdominal symptoms found to have gallstones is to determine whether the stones are the cause of the symptoms or merely an incidental finding.</p><p>There is no national or international prospective randomized study of the efficiency gains of a standardized work-up and interval evaluation with stepwise selection for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The best available patient reported data comes from the long term follow up from a randomized study which showed that a watchful waiting strategy was shown to be a feasible option in 31&#x000a0;% of patients with uncomplicated symptomatic cholelithiasis during 14&#x000a0;years of follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In the absence of existing evidence it is clear that a more adequate discriminative selection tool for cholecystectomy is necessary. The present study aims to improve the outcome of patients with gallstones and abdominal complaints by identifying those patients with an absolute indication for cholecystectomy based on an accurate assessment of symptomology. This will ultimately maximise the number of patients successfully treated for biliary pain and minimise not only patients with persistent post cholecystectomy pain, but also the risks of unnecessary operative intervention. Secondly, this study examines the cost-effectiveness and budgetary impact of a more restrictive strategy for cholecystectomy against usual care for patients with abdominal complaints and gallstones. In the present trial an evaluation will be performed on whether a restrictive strategy with standardized work-up, interval evaluation and stepwise selection for surgery can improve patient outcomes with a reduced number of cholecystectomies. Results of the present study as proposed here will affect health care policy concerning cholecystectomy for the coming decades.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The SECURE-trial is a multicentre trial designed to assess the effectiveness of a more restrictive treatment strategy in patients with gallstones and abdominal complaints, using a restrictive standardized work-up with stepwise selection for cholecystectomy. This trial aims to improve the outcome of patients after cholecystectomies by optimizing the indications for cholecystectomy. Therefore, the SECURE-trial has the potential to impact daily clinical practice and the development of national and potentially international guidelines concerning the indications for cholecystectomy in symptomatic gallstone disease.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ASA, a five-category physical status classification system developed by the American Society of Anesthesiologists; CEA, cost-effectiveness analysis; CUA, cost-utility analysis; DSMC, data monitoring committee; GEE, generalized estimating equations; MEC, medical ethical committee; QALY, quality adjusted life-year; SECURE trial, scrutinizing the (in)efficient use of cholecystectomy: a randomized trial; VAS, visual analogue scale</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The Netherlands organisation for health research and development financially supported the Secure trial with the ZonMW Health Care Efficacy grant.
