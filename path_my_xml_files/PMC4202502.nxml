It is also a defense mechanism to inform the body of the problem.</p><p>In the past few decades progress in knowledge of pathophysiology of pain has led to the new pain control methods based on these mechanisms.</p><p>Pain is the result of either direct or inflammation mediated stimulation of neural terminal ends.</p><p>Labor and delivery is a painful process. Delivery and surgical procedures result in peripheral pain receptors activation through tissue damage receptors (for examples: Such as A-mechano-thermal and c-polymodal fibers), and Chemical mediators released from tissue during surgery, signal pain through neural pathways. (For Examples: Mediators such as histamine, bradykinin, serotonin, hydroxitriptophan, <italic>p</italic> substance and prostaglandins).[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Body in response to pain will show some reflexes such as increased tonicity of skeletal muscles, increased oxygen consumption and lactic acidosis.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>These reflexes themselves result in increased heart rate and cardiac output through autonomic neural pathways.</p><p>Postoperative pain may result in some complications such as lung dysfunction due to restriction of lung expansion secondary to increased pain, cardiovascular complications, increased risk of cardiac ischemic events, increased risk of Deep Vein Thrombosis and pulmonary emboli due to immobilization, psychological complications such as nervousness and finally prolonged hospitalization.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>The effective relief of pain is of paramount important in all patients. Recent data show that ineffective pain control after surgery can delay rehabilitation and patient discharge up to four days.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Uncontrolled pain may result in complications such as thromboemboli, ileus and pneumonia.</p><p>Cesarean is the most common surgery in America, so limiting cesarean surgery complications is of paramount important.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Different methods and drugs have been used to control pain and research to define a pain relieving method with the least adverse effect is important.</p><p>Patient- control pain by intravenous, spinal or epidural pumps, local anesthetic methods, glucocorticoids, NSAIDS and cryoanalgesia are some of methods in use.</p><p>Studies showed opioids analgesic effect by peripheral nociceptors methadone stimulates spinal and CNS opioid receptors and change the pain response.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Methadone is a synthetic opioid agonist with a prolonged half-time. it has been used since 1960 in treatment of opioid dependence,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] but it is used in chronic pain control and is a strong pain reliever in patients with cancer.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Methadone is the second line opioid in the treatment of patients suffering pain and is safe in those with long-time hospitalization.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Also methadone is used in opioid-dependent pregnant women to decrease complications such as LBW and prematurity.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Effectiveness of methadone in controlling acute or chronic pain either in the form of oral or epidural both in adults or children has been shown.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Because of minimal transfer of methadone into human milk, breastfeeding is safe.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Besides, as it has no active metabolite and because of its low price; methadone can be a good replacement for other pain relievers.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Subcutaneous injection of methadone can make the same blood level of drug that IV infusion will. And there is no data that cachectic or hypertensive patients have problem in absorption of subcutaneous methadone.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] For postoperative pain management for acute pain equianalgesic dose of methadone is 10 mg IV/IM route.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Some studies have shown efficacy of subcutaneous methadone in relieving acute pain (Alberto University in Canada).</p><p>In subcutaneous route, the dose is lower and so price will be.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Besides, risk of bacteremia and infection in subcutaneous route is less than IV route.

Patients were taking drug 2-3 times per day as need. Pain control and side effects were th e same in two groups. In patients receiving methadone, more stable analgesia overtime was seen.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>In our study there was no significant difference statistically in mean morphine consumption, but mean pain severity was higher in group treated with morphine alone. In other word, in patients treated with morphine and methadone pain control was better. There was no significant difference in mean episodes of nausea, mean metoclopramide consumption frequency, mean sedation score and mean arterial pressure statistically.</p><p>Subcutaneous rout of methadone taking is valuable but there are some reports of local skin reactions, such as swelling and erythem following its administration. These side effects are preventable by changing the site of injection and co-administration of dexamethason or hyaloronidase.</p><p>In a case series study methadone was used successfully by using dexamethasone infusion and rotating its injection site.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>In our study there was just one injection and there was no need to rotate injection site.</p><p>In all together in our study mean satisfaction was higher in group receiving methadone and morphine vs. those receiving morphine alone.</p><p>In Yoram Shir study on 3954 patients with severe pain, methadone was used in oral form or by epidural route. There was no significant side effect in those received oral form and in those received methadone epidurally three cases of respiratory depression was reported that it was because of pump failure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The result showed that methadone has a significant immune profile and can be used in hospitalized patients as an effective analgesia.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Tolerance is lower in methadone compared to other opioid. On the other hand, some studies suggest that constipation occurs later in patients taking methadone compared to other opioids.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>According to unpredictable complications of morphine such as conjunctivitis, amblyopia, ocular pain, leucopenia and it's so many contraindications[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] it's so valuable that subcutaneous methadone can relief pain successfully and so we can use it instead of morphine. Regardless of its use in our study, we can use methadone in other situations such as in cancers and in especially interminably ill patients in which consciousness is not full and so oral route is difficult or it can be used instead of rectal rout which is aggressive.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Isfahan University of Medical Sciences</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Leung</surname><given-names>AY</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Postoperative pain management in obstetric anesthesia-new challenges and solutions</article-title><source>J Clin Anesth</source><year>2004</year><volume>16</volume><fpage>57</fpage><lpage>65</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14984863</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Porter</surname><given-names>TF</given-names></name><name><surname>Scott</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Scott</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name><name><surname>Gibbs</surname><given-names>RS</given-names></name><name><surname>Karlan</surname><given-names>BY</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Cesarean delivery</article-title><source>Danforth's obstetrics and gynecology</source><year>2003</year><edition>9th ed</edition><publisher-loc>Philadelphia</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Lippin Cott Williams Wilkins</publisher-name><fpage>449</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gangnon</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Bruera</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Differences in the ratios of morphine to methadone in patients with neuropathic pain versus non-neuropathic pain</article-title><source>J Pain Symptom Manage</source><year>1999</year><volume>18</volume><fpage>120</fpage><lpage>5</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10484859</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><article-title>Health Canada.
