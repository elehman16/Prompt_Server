Improving quality of life is therefore a key treatment goal. We report quality of life for patients with <italic>RAS</italic> wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer in the PRIME study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A randomised phase 3 open-label study of first-line panitumumab+FOLFOX4 vs FOLFOX4 enrolled adults with untreated metastatic colorectal cancer and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0&#x02013;2. This analysis includes patients with wild-type <italic>RAS</italic> tumours (n=505). Quality of life (prespecified end point) was assessed using the EuroQoL 5-domain health state index and overall health rating in all patients and by early tumour shrinkage status (&#x02265;30% reduction in size by week 8; exploratory end point). Differences in quality of life were assessed using analysis of covariance and a mixed-effect piecewise linear model, and were also analysed by skin toxicity severity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were no statistically significant differences between treatment arms from baseline to progression or to discontinuation. Grade 3+ skin toxicity was reported by 38% of patients receiving panitumumab+FOLFOX4 and 2% receiving FOLFOX4 alone. There were no significant differences in quality of life between patients with grade 0&#x02013;2 skin toxicity and those with grade 3+ skin toxicity. More patients receiving panitumumab+FOLFOX4 vs FOLFOX4 had early tumour shrinkage (p&#x0003c;.001). In patients with tumour symptoms at baseline, there were statistically significant improvements in quality of life in those with early tumour shrinkage versus those without early tumour shrinkage.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Addition of panitumumab to FOLFOX4 in first-line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer prolongs survival and has no negative effect on overall quality of life compared with FOLFOX4 alone. Specific quality of life assessments for skin toxicity should be included in study designs to better define the direct effect of these adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>NCT00364013.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>chemotherapy</kwd><kwd>tumour shrinkage</kwd><kwd>quality of life</kwd><kwd>EGFR inhibitors</kwd><kwd>metastatic colorectal cancer</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Amgen</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002429</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><p><bold>Find all abstract addressing studies on panitumumab at ESMO 2014 here:</bold>

<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Despite recent advances, the curative treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is limited to a subgroup of patients undergoing complete resection, and improvement of QoL is therefore an important treatment goal in patients with mCRC.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Panitumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> which is indicated in combination with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI for the first-line treatment of patients with <italic>RAS</italic> wild-type (WT) mCRC in Europe.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The efficacy and safety of first-line panitumumab in combination with FOLFOX4 were evaluated in the PRIME study,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>

For example, in the analysis of data from the PRIME study, duration of treatment was a confounding factor, with patients who received panitumumab remaining on treatment longer than those receiving FOLFOX4 alone. We report prespecified tertiary QoL end points from the PRIME study for patients with <italic>RAS</italic> WT mCRC, including exploratory analyses of the impact of early tumour shrinkage (ETS) and skin toxicity on QoL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and patients</title><p>PRIME (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00364013) was a randomised (1:1), open-label phase 3 study of first-line panitumumab+FOLFOX4 vs FOLFOX4 alone in patients with mCRC. The study was conducted in 133 study centres in 18 countries (Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, the Czech Republic, France, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Mexico, Poland, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, the UK). The first patient was enrolled in August 2006 (first participant enrolled), and the final data cut-off date was August 2010.</p><p>Panitumumab was given as an intravenous infusion of 6.0&#x02005;mg/kg on the first day of each 14-day cycle. Participants were randomised using an interactive voice response system, and randomisation was stratified by geographic region (Western Europe, Canada and Australia vs rest of the world) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS 0 or 1 vs 2). Each patient was assigned a unique identification number used to identify that patient throughout the study. Details of the study design and inclusion criteria have been published previously.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS), with secondary end points including OS, objective tumour response and safety. Although the study was originally designed to test treatment effect in all randomised patients, it was amended to compare PFS and OS according to <italic>KRAS</italic> status prior to any efficacy analyses. Sample size was originally set at 900 patients, assuming that all time-to-event end points are exponentially distributed. The sample size was revised to 1150 when the protocol was revised to assess the primary end point in patients with WT <italic>KRAS</italic> tumours only (assumed prevalence, 55%). This is based on a PFS HR of 0.714 and a median PFS of 12&#x02005;months in the control arm.</p><p>Eligible patients were aged &#x02265;18&#x02005;years with previously untreated metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum, and had an ECOG PS of 0&#x02013;2. The protocol was approved by the ethics committees at participating sites and adhered to all ethical guidelines, and all patients signed informed consent before any study-related procedures were performed. The present analysis focuses on patients with <italic>RAS</italic> WT mCRC (ie, tumours WT for <italic>KRAS/NRAS</italic> exon 2 (codons 12 and 13), exon 3 (codons 59 and 61) and exon 4 (codons 117 and 146)).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Mutation analysis was performed using Sanger sequencing and SURVEYOR/WAVE laboratory-developed testing, as described previously.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>QoL end points and analysis</title><p>QoL was assessed as a prespecified tertiary end point during PRIME, using the EuroQoL 5-domain (EQ-5D) health state index (HSI) and overall health rating (OHR) measures. HSI scores range from &#x02212;0.594 to 1.0 (higher scores represent better health, with 1.0 equivalent to perfect health). The OHR comprises a 0&#x02013;100 visual analogue scale, with 0 representing the &#x02018;worst imaginable health state&#x02019; and 100 representing the &#x02018;best imaginable health state&#x02019;. QoL was assessed &#x02264;7&#x02005;days before randomisation and every 4&#x02005;weeks until disease progression, with a final assessment at a safety follow-up visit.</p><p>Between-treatment differences in QoL were assessed from baseline to disease progression, and to discontinuation of first-line treatment, using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Treatment-by-covariate interactions (between treatment and baseline QoL score, between treatment and baseline ECOG score, and between treatment and region) was tested at the 5% level and those that were found to be significant were retained in the final model. Changes in QoL from baseline to discontinuation of first-line treatment, and between-treatment differences, were also assessed using a mixed-effect model adjusted for worst grade skin toxicity (ie, nail changes, erythema, pruritus, acne, rash and ulceration; grade 0&#x02013;2 vs grade 3+), baseline QoL score and time (QoL assessment week). Random effects for intercept and time were also included. In the HSI model, the five subscales (anxiety/depression, mobility, pain/discomfort, self-care and usual activities) were evaluated separately.</p><p>The primary QoL analyses were conducted on the subset of patients in the intent-to-treat analysis set who had a baseline QoL assessment and at least one postbaseline QoL assessment. For this analysis, the minimally important differences (MIDs) were defined as 0.08 for HSI and 7 for OHR.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Changes in QoL were also assessed in subgroups of patients with and without ETS, both in the overall population and in patients with tumour-related symptoms at baseline (defined as EQ-5D pain/discomfort scale score &#x0003e;1). Tumour size and response were measured as described previously,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and ETS was defined as a decrease of &#x02265;30% in tumour size at week 8.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Patients</title><p>Of the 1183 patients enrolled in PRIME, 505 had <italic>RAS</italic> WT mCRC (patient disposition shown in online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary figure</xref> S1).

We therefore conducted an analysis of QoL in patients receiving first-line treatment for mCRC with FOLFOX4 with or without panitumumab in the phase 3 PRIME study.</p><p>While addition of panitumumab to FOLFOX4 in first-line <italic>RAS</italic> WT mCRC is associated with a high incidence of skin toxicity, there was no negative impact on global QoL. While skin toxicity might be expected to have a negative impact on QoL, our results are consistent with previous studies of the EGFR inhibitors panitumumab and cetuximab in mCRC. For example, similar results were seen in an earlier analysis of data from patients with WT <italic>KRAS</italic> mCRC in the PRIME study,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> while studies of first-line FOLFIRI combined with panitumumab or cetuximab have shown no negative effect on QoL or social functioning during treatment.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;18</xref> Similarly, addition of panitumumab to second-line FOLFIRI treatment resulted in a significant improvement in PFS without compromising QoL.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In a study of the psychological effects associated with cetuximab treatment (n=80), psychological distress was present in 41% of patients.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Distress was linked with overall QoL, but not with rash, which did not affect psychological status or social life. Furthermore, a recent quality-adjusted time without symptoms of disease or toxicity (Q-TWiST) analysis from the PRIME study showed that panitumumab+FOLFOX4 significantly improved quality-adjusted survival time compared with FOLFOX4 alone (20.5 vs 18.2&#x02005;months, respectively; p=0.025).<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The ESMO-MCBS is a standardised and validated approach to stratify the magnitude of clinical benefit that can be expected from anticancer therapies. A recent analysis of therapies for first-line mCRC provides additional confirmation of the overall clinical benefit of panitumumab: panitumumab scored 4/5, representing &#x02018;a high level of proven clinical benefit&#x02019; in terms of both prolonged survival and improved QoL.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>The QoL scales used in these studies, including the EQ-5D, are measures of global QoL and are not specific for skin toxicity. In patients treated with panitumumab in the PRIME study, therefore, the impact of rash-related events may have been balanced by favourable antitumour treatment-related effects. For example, patients with advanced cancer may consider skin rash to be part of their overall condition, and they may feel that skin rash is a marker of treatment efficacy.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> It is also possible that the beneficial effects of treatment may outweigh skin-related side effects.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> This is supported by our analysis of ETS, in which patients with tumour-related symptoms at baseline who experienced ETS showed a statistically meaningful improvement in QoL compared with those who did not have ETS. These important data add to the idea that achieving early reductions in tumour load is associated with symptomatic benefit for patients.</p><p>The strengths of this study include its randomised design and international recruitment, as well as the use of planned QoL assessments with internationally validated tools available in local languages. The main weakness of the study is the use of global QoL instruments. The lack of a QoL difference associated with different grades of adverse events suggests that tools specific for skin-related events are required to assess the direct effect of skin toxicity on QoL for patients receiving treatment with EGFR inhibitors. One such instrument is the Dermatology Life Quality Index, which has previously been used to assess the impact of toxicities such as hair loss, hyperpigmentation and dry skin, in patients receiving cancer chemotherapy.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> It should also be noted that other drug-related adverse events may also affect QoL. For example, hypomagnesaemia affects QoL by causing muscle cramps and spasms, both directly and indirectly as a result of secondary hypocalcaemia. An analysis of QoL by muscle-related symptoms (with or without magnesium levels) may therefore also be of interest. Finally, disease progression itself may affect QoL, which was not systematically analysed in the present study.</p><p>In conclusion, the addition of panitumumab to FOLFOX4 in first-line <italic>RAS</italic> WT mCRC improves OS<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> with no negative effect on overall QoL, despite the high incidence of skin toxicity. Skin toxicity of grade 3+ appeared to have a similar impact on QoL outcomes as skin toxicity of grade 0&#x02013;2. In patients with tumour-related symptoms, those with ETS experienced significant improvements in QoL compared with those who did not achieve ETS. In future studies, QoL tools specific for skin-related events may be required to assess the direct effect of skin toxicity on QoL for patients receiving EGFR inhibitors.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to acknowledge all the patients who participated in the PRIME (20050203) study, as well as the study investigators and their study staff, and the study team at Amgen, for their participation in the conduct and reporting of this study.
