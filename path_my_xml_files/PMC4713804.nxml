experience it once or more in modern society<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, and its incidence, and social expenditures related to it are
increasing<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. There are various causes of
back pain, and among them, herniation of intervertebral discs, and muscle weakness caused by
muscle damage are major causes of lower back pain<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Low back pain is caused by loss of segmental stabilization and balance ability, and limits
range of motion<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patients are designated
as having chronic low back pain, when lumbar pain with non-specific causes lasts more than
12 weeks<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In recent years, mechanical
causes of pain account for the greatest number of cases. After analyzing the motion of each
segment of the spine of degenerated disc patients, our study group reported the most common
cause of back pain is spinal instability<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In human movement in a multi-componenet model, the movement of the most flexible segment
generats the largest angle. Therefore, most spinal dysfunction is caused by excessive
flexibility of a particular segment rather than poor flexibility<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>When conducting functional activities, the mobilization of the joints adjacent to an
unstable segment is relatively increased, and decreasing the hypermobility through
stabilization of the hypermobile segment can promote healing<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, thoracic mobilization may help to promote stabilization of
the lumbar region.</p><p>According to a recent study, instability of the lumbar spine is the most important cause of
chronic low back pain<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. If this
instability increases, it can elicit abnormal posture reactions in static balance and result
in inability to perform normal activities due to a loss of sense balance in patients with
chronic low back pain. Loss of balance can also be caused by the loss of the muscular
strength or neurologic imbalances.</p><p>Many studies have reported that lumbar stabilization exercises provide stabilization by
strengthening the lumbar deep muscles of patients with chronic low back pain, but few
studies have investigated lumbar mechanical stabilization through thoracic mobilization.
Therefore, this study investigated whether pain, balance, and stabilization of the lumbar
can be improved through thoracic mobilization in addition to lumbar stabilization
exercises.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study recruited subjects with chronic low back pain lasting more than 12 weeks.
Forty-five subjects satisfied the selection criteria, and 36 them participated in the study.
They were divided into 3 groups; a traditional physiotherapy group (TPG), a lumbar
stabilization exercise group (LSEG), and a thoracic mobilization exercise group (TMEG).</p><p>Traditional physiotherapy, lumbar stabilization exercises, or thoracic mobilization and
exercise were performed three times a week for 12 weeks. The outcome measures were a visual
analog scale assessment of pain, the balance index, and lumbar translation length. Selection
criteria were: experience of low back pain over 12 weeks, and participants who couldn&#x02019;t sit
long in one position, who felt pain every time they changed their position, and also
frequently changed their sitting posture. The subjects chosen for this study participated
voluntarily, and provided their written informed consent form in accordance with the ethical
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All the subjects received traditional
physiotherapy comprised of hot pack treatment for 20 minutes, ultrasound therapy for 5
minutes, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation for 15 minutes, a total of 40
minutes.</p><p>The lumbar stabilization exercise group, additionally performed exercise for stabilizing
the multifidus muscles, and transversus abdominis, after receiving traditional
physiotherapy. The lumbar stabilization exercise program consisted of three exercises. Each
exercise was repeated 12 times for 1 set, and 5 sets, with a break of 3 minutes between
sets, were performed in one therapy session. The 3 exercises were: a semi-situp, holding the
legs in a cross-legged position lying face downwards, and lying on the side keeping one leg
raised.</p><p>The thoracic mobilization and exercise group additionally performed two exercise programs
and received passive thoracic soft tissue mobilization to increase the thoracic mobility
after traditional physiotherapy. The thoracic mobility exercise program consisted of 2
exercises. Each exercise was repeated 12 times for 1 set, and a total of 5 sets, with a
break of three minutes between sets, were performed in one therapy session.</p><p>Thoracic soft tissue mobilization was carried out for 5 minutes after performance of the
thoracic soft tissue exercises. These involved moving the upper body, only putting a pillow
on the thoracic area, moving the thoracic area, and mobilization with the upper body and
lower body crossed. Pain levels were assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS). In this
study, balance was assessed as the best score of 3 trials in a standing posture on a balance
measuring instrument (MICROSWIMG 5.0, HAIDER BIOSWING, Germany) connected to a computer
using Posturomed software.</p><p>The lumbar translation length test is an objective test of lumbar instability. If any
segment of the functional spine is in an unstable state during measurement of the
translation of the functional spine under a physical force, it translates more than stable
segment in the physical forces at that time. In case sagittal plane displacement was
transferred more than at least 3&#x02005;mm in any one segment the curve or expansion when
conducting the X-ray inspection, we called it an instability of the lumbar when more than 9%
of adjacent vertebral body diameter was transferred<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The translation length of the unstable segments was measured in the same way before and
after the intervention to test the translation distance of the segments of the patients with
chronic low back pain. To measure the distance, a line was drawn on the upper surface of the
lower vertebrae of the segment to be measured in the sagittal plane of the X-ray, together
with a vertical line. Then, the lower surface of the upper vertebrae and the end part of end
plate of the upper surface of the lower vertebrae were connected to this line vertically,
and the distance between the two lines was measured.</p><p>All data obtained in this study were processed using SPSS for 20.0 Windows. After the
intervention, the differences in lumbar stability, balance, and pain between the groups were
examined using the paired t test. The statistical significance level, &#x003b1;, used was 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The general characteristics of the subject are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>The general characteristics of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variables</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TPG (N=12)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LSEG (N=12)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TMEG (N=12)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LBP duration (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.3&#x000b1;1.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.8&#x000b1;2.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.9&#x000b1;1.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender: Male (%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11 (91.7)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 (83.3)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (66.7)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">45.4&#x000b1;6.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">43.0&#x000b1;6.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">43.0&#x000b1;5.4</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>.</p><p>The lumbar stability values as measured on X-rays are shown in <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of lumbar stabilization, balance index, pain among the three

lifetimes. It lasts from 2 months to 3 months, and it has a probability recurrence<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Currently, passive treatments for patients with low back pain are losing favor, and
exercise treatments, active treatments which are effective at promoting a normal life,
improving capacity, and preventing recurrence, are being used for the rehabilitation of
patients with chronic low back pain<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>It has often reported that lumbar stabilization exercise, which has been extensively
studied among the treatment programs including the exercise, is an effective treatment
method<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. We conducted the standing on
one leg check targeting the patients with low back pain, and the result is reported that
they were not good at maintaining a balance compared to normal people because the muscles
ability was bad. It has also been reported that patients with chronic low back pain have
poorer one-leg standing ability on an unstable surface than healthy people, and there was a
difference in their weight distributions in two-legged standing between the presence and
absence of sight. Musculoskeletal disorders such as low back pain are said to limit the
ability to maintain balance<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Chronic low back pain patients need to maintain the posture of the trunk, and generate
lumbar stability by contracting muscles such as the transverus abdominis and multifidus
which are responsible for the stability of the lumbar region. Therefore, lumbar
stabilization exercises involving the multifidus and transverus abdominis result in
improvements in postural balance in patients with chronic low back pain<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Only a few studies have investigated other treatment programs for lumbar instability.
Recently, a method of treatment that can relieve pain and improve functional limitations has
been introduced for back pain. This method reduces the stress caused by excessive movement
of segments displaying lumbar instability through mobilization of the segments which have
restricted motion<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The present study shows that lumbar stabilization exercise was most effective for lumbar
stabilization, followed by thoracic mobilization exercise, and traditional physiotherapy, in
decreasing order of effect. In other words, lumbar stabilization exercises and thoracic
mobilization exercises improved lumbar stability.</p><p>Considering this result, it seems to be closely related between abnormal movements of
lumbar segments and lumbar stabilization exercises, and a reduction in the abnormal
movements of segments that have lumbar segmental instability was achieved by performance of
lumbar stabilization exercises or thoracic mobilization exercises, resulting in improvement
of low back pain. After the intervention, the balance index scores showed significant
improvements in all three groups.</p><p>This study demonstrated that lumbar stabilization exercises and thoracic mobilization
exercise improved the balance of patients with chronic low back pain, and chronic low back
pain caused lumbar injury is closely related to the balance of the trunk. Pain assessed by
the visual analogue scale showed significant reductions between before and after the
intervention on all of the group, and there was no statistically significant difference
among the groups after the intervention.</p><p>According to the results traditional physiotherapy didn&#x02019;t reduce the abnormal movements of
the unstable segments or weakened deep muscles of the patients with chronic low back pain
caused by lumbar instability. Therefore, there was a reduction in pain and an improvement in
balance, but there was the possibility of recurrence of low back pain because of the lack of
correction of lumbar instability. Lumbar stabilization exercises improved lumbar stability
by adjusting the abnormal movements of lumbar region by strengthening the multifidus and
transverus abdominis, which are lumbar deep muscles.</p><p>This result is consistent with the significant reduction in pain and functional improvement
after the intervention of lumbar stabilization exercises which were conducted to strengthen
the multifidus and transverus abdominis, which are lumbar deep muscles<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The intervention to improve the thoracic mobilization of
the thoracic mobilization exercise group increased thoracic mobility, improved lumbar
stability by decreasing the abnormal excessive motion of the unstable lumbar segments, and
improved the physical disability by reducing pain and improving balance.</p><p>In conclusion, existing studies have mostly investigated lumbar stabilization exercises
known as treatment for lumbar instability in patient with chronic low back pain. In this
study, an indirect treatment method for the treatment of unstable segments in patients with
chronic low back pain was investigated. Lumbar stability improved and the stress caused by
excessive movements of the relatively unstable lumbar segments was reduced by increasing the
mobilization of thoracic segments which showed restricted movements. Therefore, it is our
opinion that the clinical treatment of lumbar stabilization exercises combined with thoracic
mobilization has a greater effect on the stability of the lumbar region, relieving pain, and
improving the function of patients with chronic low back pain.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Grabiner</surname><given-names>MD</given-names></name><name><surname>Jeziorowski</surname><given-names>JJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Divekar</surname><given-names>AD</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Isokinetic measurements of trunk extension and flexion
