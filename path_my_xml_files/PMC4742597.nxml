As a consequence, which existing TB vaccine continues to cover almost 80% of newborn infants in countries under National childhood immunization programme [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Currently World Health Organization (WHO) recommends single dose of BCG vaccine, after birth in countries with high TB incidence rates [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Revaccination is not recommended, despite low efficacy of BCG for protection against TB in adults. Vaccination with BCG leads to localized cell-mediated immune response, which subsides within few weeks after vaccination, leaving behind pool of memory cells having immunological memory of primary infection [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Circulating antibodies against BCG are thought to be protectitive against TB and provide an initial defense mechanism along with primed T-cell to encounter any primary infection [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The developed immune response may vary with age, and depends on various factors like host immunity, level of environmental mycobacterial exposure, and persistent latent TB infection which leads to cross priming and rapid clearance of BCG IgGs [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Thus, identifcation of immunological markers in blood of BCG vaccinated and unvaccinated children at different age group may help us to monitor efficacy of BCG protection against TB. This may further help in optimizing the BCG vaccination policies for future, along with implementation of other strategies to boost efficacy of BCG in childrens.</p><p>In our earlier studies, we have shown effectiveness of heterologous prime boost regimes to boost level of BCG-induced immunity after primary vaccination [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Molecules such as Ag85B peptides showed improved protection in animal studies as against BCG and Ag85B. However, in an effort to develop improved vaccines, and to bridge the gap between animal and human studies, evaluation of such vaccine molecules is needed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of individuals with diminished BCG induced immunity after primary vaccination. This <italic>ex-vivo</italic> approach may be fundamental in terms of evaluating potency of booster dose of Ag85B peptides, BCG, and Ag85B to boost immune response, and offer protection both in animal and humans. Earlier studies by Kashyap et al. [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], in PBMCs of BCG vaccinated children showed that repeated stimulation with BCG boosted initial immunological memory primed by the vaccine. Howver its evaluation in PBMCS of children with low protective levels of BCG along with its comparison with molecules such as subunit and epitope based vaccines was needed to evaluate efficacy of individual candidate molecule to boost waning BCG induced immunity.</p><p>The objective of the present was study was (1) study immunological response in serum and PBMCs of children of different age groups vaccinated with BCG vaccine and (2) to study the booster effects of BCG, Ag85B, and Ag85B peptides to boost antimycobacterial immunity in children having diminished BCG-induced response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Vaccines and reagents</title><p>BCG vaccine (Moscow strain) was obtained from Serum Institute of India, Pune and stored at 4-8&#x02103; before use.

Based on analysis of immune markers in blood, it was observed that children in age group of 4-6 and 7-10 years showed significantly (p&#x0003c;0.05) increased levels of BCG-specific IgGs which correlated well with T-cell ADA activity and IFN-&#x003b3; levels.

PBMCs of children were isolated and stimulated with BCG, Ag85B, and AG85B peptides. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> shows anti-BCG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>) and cytokine&#x02013;IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>) levels in 72-hour cell supernatants PBMCs of children (n=5) boosted with BCG, Ag85B, and Ag85B peptides. PBMCs of all children showed increased levels of both cytokine and anti-BCG which were comparatively more significant (p&#x0003c;0.001) in cell supernants boosted with BCG and Ag85B peptides compared to native Ag85B (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>A comparative analysis of all molecules to boost BCG induced immunity revealed that peptides of Ag85B were able to boost almost 3-fold increase (3&#x000b1;0.2Log2) in IFN-&#x003b3; expression as compared to earlier levels, followed by booster dose of BCG (2&#x000b1;0.4Log2) and Ag85B (0.8Log2). Cell supernatants of PBMCs boosted with BCG (1.7&#x000b1;0.1) and Ag85B peptides however showed similar fold increase in IgGs to BCG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Timely assessment and screening of markers of BCG induced immunity is needed to monitor the level of BCG protection post vaccination. Currently, WHO recommends single dose of BCG vaccine immediately after birth for children in high TB endemic regions [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Neonatal vaccination is thought to be protective against childhood forms of meningeal and miliary TB [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; however, many reports are suggestive of waning of the current BCG-induced immunity in children [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This decrease in immunity correlates with increased number of TB cases in later years. Identification of these waning BCG induced protection in children constitutes an important part of health survey programmes and will be helpful to monitor children with high risk for development of TB infection in future. In current study, we intended to study protective efficacy of BCG post-vaccination in children of different age groups with objective to specifically demonstrate course of immunological markers of protection in children vaccinated with BCG with age.</p><p>Based on results, it was observed that efficacy of protection post BCG vaccination increases with age, but gradually wanes in later years. Based on the assessment of immunological markers (anti-BCG IgG and IFN-&#x003b3;) in serum and PBMCs of children vaccinated with BCG, it was found that children in age group of 4-6 years are associated with significantly higher BCG-specific IgG and interferon levels compared to that in age group &#x0003c;10 years. In TB endemic countries like India, cross riming due to environmental mycobacterial infection and persistent latent infection are major reasons for rapid clearance of immunity primed by BCG with age [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Our results are therfore in agreement with published reports and suggest that such extrinsic factors may be responsible for reduced efficacy of BCG in later years.</p><p>Immune response post-vaccination is dependent on host immunity along with development of BCG scar [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Many people post-vaccination are associated with scar development while in some cases, scar may not be observed. To further study impact of scar development on BCG-induced protection; we evaluated protective markers in BCG vaccinated children with/without scar development. Based on results it was observed that BCG scar has limited impact on assessment of markers in blood but has considerable effect in PBMCs of children stimulated with BCG vaccine. The results are suggestive that children with scar have comparatively better developed immunological memory which can be further increased by boosting. Similar results were obtained when immunological markers were analyzed in PBMCs of BCG vaccinated and unvaccinated children, wherein vaccinated children were associated with better immunological recall on stimulation.</p><p>The presents results clearly highlights that BCG vaccination, has essential repertoire for short-term protection but lacks development of essential memory cells that may be required to protect against TB disease in later years [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Cross priming by environmental mycobacteria along with high persistence of latent TB infection in TB endemic countries like India are main reasons for low efficacy of BCG [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], therefore booster vaccination with BCG in later years may be required to boost waning BCG-induced immunity in adults for effective protection against TB.</p><p>In India, single dose of BCG is given, based on lack of evidences supporting booster concept of BCG. However, revaccination with BCG in adolescence has been routine practice in many countries throughout the world [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Revaccination policies adopted in Hungary in late 1950s showed improved protection and sharp decrease in TB cases among purified protein derivative purified protein derivative (PPD) negative individuals and were attributed to the revaccination policies used [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Boosting healthy BCG-vaccinated adults in the UK was well tolerated and enhanced PPD-specific CD4+ T-cell responses, but did not induce CD8+ T cells [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These studies support our hypothesis that repeated dose of BCG or boosting immunity primed by BCG is needed for effective protection in population where primary effects of vaccination are generally neutralized leaving vaccinated individuals undistinguished from non-vaccinated population.</p><p>Another approach to boost BCG induced immunity is use of Mtb antigens and peptides in heterologous prime boost combinations. Heterologous prime boost approach employs sequential administration of vaccines within appropriate intervals by using different antigen-delivery systems such that the immune system is primed to the antigen by using one vector and then boosted with the same antigen delivered through a different vector [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Heterologous prime-boost represents a new way of immunization and will stimulate better understanding on the immunological basis of vaccines [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The attraction of the heterologous prime-boost approach is that it preferentially expands TB-specific pre-existing memory T cells against antigenic epitopes shared by both the prime and booster vaccines. This approach also minimizes the potential of generating antibody and T-cell neutralizing effect. This approach may also be beneficial for boosting immunity in BCG vaccinated individuals in high TB endemic regions, where primary effect of BCG generally wanes with age due to existing exposure to non tuberculous mycobacteria and persisting latent infection [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>In our earlier studies in animals, we have shown that heterologous prime boost combination with BCG, Ag85B, and Ag85B peptides increases protective efficacy of BCG vaccine against TB in mice (unpublished data). In an attempt to study protective efficacy of booster doses of BCG, Ag85B, and Ag85B peptides in humans, children with low protective immunological markers post vaccination, were recruited and their PBMCs were boosted all three molecules. PBMCs of children boosted with BCG, Ag85B, and Ag85B peptides showed increased BCG-specific immune reponse compared to stimulated controls. A comparative analysis of booster affects all three candidate molecules revealed that peptides were efficiently able to boost BCG induced immunity in children followed by BCG. No significant impact of Ag85B was observed on per fold rise in BCG-specific response compared to peptides and BCG. Peptide based vaccines offer numerous advantage over subunit vaccines based on Mtb antigens [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The results of present study combined with earlier studies in mice [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] are the thereby suggestive that peptides can be attractive vaccine candidates in near future as they can rapidly stimulate memory cells primed by primary vaccination in neonates and can specifically overcome the limitation of cross priming due to environmental factors in high TB endemic zones. Moreover our studies also highlights a role of booster effect of BCG, which may provide a base for future studies to further explore beneficial effects of booster concept of BCG for protection against TB in childrens and adults in later years. The present approach may be beneficial for evaluation of potential candidate's vaccines prior to trials and may be valuable in predicting the efficacy of vaccines in both preclinical and clinical studies.</p><p>The present study was also associated with some limitation. Major limitation was very limited sample size. However considering the study design, it was very difficult to convince participants and their kin to provide blood especially for children less than 5 years. Moreover, due to lack of follow up, we had to exclude lot of subjects which further contributed to low sample size. Authors are aware that such sample size may be difficult to justify the observed conclusion, but results may be taken as preliminary but important observations. We plan to investigate the present study in large cohorts in future.</p><p>To conclude, efficacy of protection post-BCG vaccination increases with age, but gradually wanes in later years. Assessment of immunological markers of BCG-induced protection in children suggest that children within age 4-6 years are associated with high immunological markers (anti-BCG IgG and IFN-&#x003b3;) which eventually diminishes with age thereby suggesting need for booster dose in later years. Assessment of booster effects of BCG, Ag85B, and Ag85B peptides shows, that peptides are attractive candidates to boost immunity in children with low protective immunological markers suggesting they be attractive vaccine candidates to increase protective efficacy of BCG vaccine in high TB endemic regions for protection against TB.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>No potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Authors also acknowledge Colorado State University, USA, for providing Mtb antigens and antibodies under the TB Research Materials and Vaccine Testing Contract (NO1-AI-75320).
