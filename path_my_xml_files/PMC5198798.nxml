Commercial dietary supplements are often advertised to stimulate metabolism and cause rapid weight and/or fat loss, although few well-controlled studies have demonstrated such effects. We describe a commercially available dietary supplement (purportedly containing caffeine, catechins, and other metabolic stimulators) on resting metabolic rate in humans, and on metabolism, mitochondrial content, and related gene expression <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic>. Human males ingested either a placebo or commercially available supplement (RF) in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over fashion. Metabolic rate, respiratory exchange ratio, and blood pressure were measured hourly for 3&#x000a0;h post-ingestion. To investigate molecular effects, human rhabdomyosarcoma cells (RD) and mouse myocytes (C2C12) were treated with various doses of RF for various durations. RF enhanced energy expenditure and systolic blood pressure in human males without altering substrate utilization. In myocytes, RF enhanced metabolism, metabolic gene expression, and mitochondrial content suggesting RF may target common energetic pathways which control mitochondrial biogenesis. RF appears to increase metabolism immediately following ingestion, although it is unclear if RF provides benefits beyond those provided by caffeine alone. Additional research is needed to examine safety and efficacy for human weight loss.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="abs0015"><title>Graphical abstract</title><fig id="undfig1" position="anchor"><graphic xlink:href="fx1"/></fig></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Obesity</kwd><kwd>Thermogenic agent</kwd><kwd>Fat burner</kwd><kwd>Resting energy expenditure</kwd><kwd>Mitochondrial biogenesis</kwd><kwd>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x003b3; coactivator-1&#x003b1; (PGC-1&#x003b1;)</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group id="kwrds0015"><title>Abbreviations</title><kwd>GLUT4, Glucose transporter 4</kwd><kwd>TFAM, Mitochondrial transcription factor A</kwd><kwd>NRF-1, Nuclear respiratory factor</kwd><kwd>PGC-1&#x003b1;, Proliferator-activated receptor &#x003b3; coactivator-1&#x003b1;</kwd><kwd>REE, Resting energy expenditure</kwd><kwd>RER, Respiratory exchange ratio</kwd><kwd>TBP, TATA Binding Protein</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Obesity is an increasingly prevalent morbidity with nearly two-thirds of adult Americans overweight, with over 32% of men and 35% of adult women clinically obese.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> It is forecasted that roughly 85% of adult Americans will be overweight, over half of which will be clinically obese by 2030.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Over the past decade, chemical and behavioral interventions that favorably modify metabolic rate have been central to obesity research.

Conversely, C2C12 cells treated with RF showed significantly elevated peak glycolytic metabolism (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>e).

Our data are among the first observations to describe both the molecular and physiological effects of RF which include increased cellular metabolism with enhanced mitochondrial uncoupling <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic>. Interestingly, our observations demonstrate that RF-treated muscle cells consistently exhibited greater basal oxidative and total metabolism accompanied by a significant increase in peak oxidative capacity. Our data also demonstrate that RF significantly induced metabolic gene expression including PGC-1&#x003b1;, which was accompanied by a significant increase in mitochondrial content in both cell models. An interesting observation is that RD cells tolerated ten times greater concentration than the non-malignant myocytes, suggesting that RD cells are substantially more resilient. Moreover, the cancerous phenotype that RD cells possess (causing RD cells to preferentially select glycolytic metabolism over oxidative metabolism) may also explain the differential response in glycolytic metabolism between the cell models. These observations highlight potential issues (including cell model discrepancies) with experiments using <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> observations alone.</p><p>The discrepancy between cell model ATP response is a meaningful observation because reduced cellular ATP content is a potent stimulus for cells and is likely in part responsible for the heightened metabolic activity with related gene expression. Not surprisingly, non-malignant C2C12 myocytes exhibited significantly reduced ATP content and a larger relative increase in both oxidative and glycolytic metabolism. One limitation of this work is that the specific upstream signaling targets of PGC-1&#x003b1; were not evaluated. However, the effect of caffeine and reduced cellular ATP content on 5-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation are well documented, making AMPK a strong candidate responsible for increases in energy expenditure and PGC-1&#x003b1; expression.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Additionally, because oxidative metabolism is more efficient at ATP biosynthesis, increased ATP consumption (or reduced efficiency of oxidative ATP production) is a necessary effect of potential anti-obesity agents. Our data suggests that RF reduces ATP production in part by promoting mitochondrial uncoupling. Despite this observation, it remains unclear if RF-induced mitochondrial uncoupling is sufficient to compensate for increased ATP production from oxidative metabolism. Cumulatively, the <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> findings are similar to several other studies performed by our lab which showed that various dietary constituents can increase cell metabolism and mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle cells.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> These observations also parallel those of other previous investigations that measured the effects of dietary stimulants such as caffeine on similar metabolic parameters in L6 myotubes and C2C12 myocytes.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p><p>In agreement with previous <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> observations using similar dietary supplements, RF appears to increase metabolic rate in young and healthy adult male subjects.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Although RF treatment elevated energy expenditure by approximately 160&#x000a0;kcals/day (as estimated from our 3&#x000a0;h measurements), this estimate may be inflated due to the time points measured (measurements closer to initial consumption yield greater increases in metabolism) and provide negligible benefit for weight loss. Several similarities exist between supplements designed to stimulate metabolism including stimulants such as caffeine which have previously been documented to increase metabolism in humans.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> We have recently discussed many of these similarities including ingredient composition and effect on resting energy expenditure.<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> Despite these findings, it is unclear to what extent energy expenditure is increased for the purpose of weight loss. Because our measurements in human subjects were limited to 3&#x000a0;h following consumption, several questions remain unanswered about the effects of RF. First, at what point after a single dose does resting energy expenditure return to normal? Are these effects diminished with ongoing use (sensitization)? Are these effects also seen in older adults and/or women? Will increases in systolic blood pressure resolve with use? Another primary limitation of our work is that it is unclear if RF provides any metabolic benefit beyond that previously documented by caffeine or catechin consumption. Another limitation is that this study only measured the metabolic consequences of RF consumption during resting state, however many of the metabolic benefits of caffeine occur as a result of increased muscular activity, suggesting our findings may not reveal the complete metabolic effect(s) of RF during activities of daily living. Despite these and other limitations, our data adds to the current literature which supports the hypothesis that dietary composition of select food chemicals may play a vital role in human energy homeostasis and energy balance. Proprietary blends consisting of multiple plant extracts potentially offer numerous diverse phytochemicals which may be useful in altering energy expenditure, although promotional advertising makes current information difficult for consumers to trust. There currently exists an immense interest in both private and commercial sectors for exploring extracts (such as green tea (&#x07da0;&#x08336;l&#x001dc; ch&#x000e1;)) and other food chemicals for the benefit of metabolic diseases including obesity and diabetes supporting the need for ongoing research in dietary supplements and functional food chemicals.<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>Dietary supplements are generally regarded as ineffective, under-researched, and potentially risky by the medical community. Despite this consensus, increasing consumer interest in alternative methods to increase metabolism and fat loss warrants further investigation into dietary supplements and thermogenic agents. Our observations suggest RF may be effective at increasing metabolic rate <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> and <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic>; although from the current data it is doubtful RF provides benefits beyond those provided by natural dietary sources of ingredients found in RF.
