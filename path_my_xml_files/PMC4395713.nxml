shift induced by shoe lift beneath the unaffected lower extremity, on balance functions
and electromyography of the affected lower extremity of stroke patients. [Subjects and
Methods] Twelve patients with unilateral stroke were recruited as volunteers for this
study. The subjects were repeatedly measured in a randomized order under three conditions:
no-shoe lift, and shoe lifts of 5&#x02005;mm and 10&#x02005;mm heights beneath the unaffected lower
extremity. [Results] Standing with a 10&#x02005;mm shoe lift for the unaffected lower extremity
decreased the mean velocity of mediolateral sway compared to no-shoe lift. Regarding the
velocity of anteroposterior sway, standing with 5&#x02005;mm and 10&#x02005;mm shoe lifts decreased the
mean velocity of anteroposterior sway. The muscle activation of the affected lower
extremity was not significantly different among the no-shoe lift, 5&#x02005;mm shoe lift and 10&#x02005;mm
shoe lift conditions; however, the muscle activities of the rectus femoris, biceps
femoris, tibialis anterior, and medial gastrocnemius of the affected lower extremity
progressively improved with increasing height of the shoe lift. [Conclusion] A constrained
weight shift to the affected side elicited by a shoe insole of 10&#x02005;mm height on the
unaffected side can improve the static standing balance of stroke patients, and it
resulted in 14&#x02013;24% increases in the muscle activities of the affected leg.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Constrained weight shift</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Post-stroke individuals present an array of changes to the neuromuscular system functions,

diminished and postural sway can be twice that of their age-matched healthy

associated with abnormal weight bearing on the lower extremity<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies have reported that stroke patients frequently bear
most of their body weight on the unaffected lower extremity. Abnormal weight bearing causes
asymmetrical posture, and together with postural asymmetry of stroke patients, poor postural
control causes slow and inflexible motor behavior during functional activities of daily
living<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Because weight bearing is a necessary prerequisite to functional movements, such as sit to

goal of physical therapy for stroke patients<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, rapid and optimal improvement
of symmetrical weight bearing of stroke patients is essential for independence and social
participation<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Various therapeutic
approaches have been used to help stroke patients to overcome asymmetrical weight

approach, constrained weight shift has been used to facilitate weight bearing on the
affected lower extremity by placing a shoe lift under the unaffected lower extremity<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The addition of a 10&#x02005;mm shoe lift results
in a 10% increase in weight bearing on the affected lower extremity in stroke patients and
improves postural control reactions to external disturbance<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Previous studies of constrained weight shift have investigated postural control reactions
to external perturbations and symmetrical standing posture, but there has been little study
of balance indexes and EMG differences in the affected lower extremity muscles in relation
to the height of the shoe lift of applied to the unaffected lower extremity. Therefore, the
purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of constrained weight shift induced by
shoe lift applied to the unaffected lower extremity on the balance function and
electromyography of the affected lower extremity of stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Subjects were selected from patients referred by a physical therapist participating in the
stroke program of a rehabilitation hospital. Twelve subjects (7 men, 5 women) with
hemiparesis associated with unilateral stroke participated in this study. The average age of
subjects was 62.07 &#x000b1; 10.57&#x02005;years, and their average height was 166.27 &#x000b1; 8.81&#x02005;cm. The period
since stroke onset was 8.20 &#x000b1; 3.48 months. Seven subjects had right-sided hemiparesis and 5
had left-sided hemiparesis. The inclusion criteria were the following: hemiparesis due to
cerebrovascular accident, and the ability to stand independently without an assistive device
or an ankle-foot orthothis (AFO) for up to 5 minutes without rest. Exclusion criteria were:
visual or vestibular deficits (such as hemianopia, neglect and pusher syndrome), inability
to understand the informed consent form because of impaired cognitive function (a score less
than 24 on the MMSE), a history of lower extremity orthopedic problem, or a neurological
condition other than stroke. Each subject gave written consent to the experimental procedure
which was approved by the institutional review board of the local ethics committee.</p><p>In this study, we used the Good Balance System (Metitur Ltd., Jyv&#x000e4;skyl&#x000e4;, Finland) which
measures the moving trajectory of COP, a variable that quantifies balance ability. Static
balance was assessed using the movement of the center of pressure during standing. During
measurements of balance, surface EMG was measured to collect information on muscle
performance using a FlexComp Infiniti system from Thought Technology.</p><p>The balance ability of all subjects was measured for each condition on the Good Balance
System. The subjects stood on the Good Balance System, and wore a harness to prevent falls.
The subjects were repeatedly measured in a randomized order under three conditions: shoe
lift of 5&#x02005;mm height placed beneath the unaffected lower extremity, shoe lift of 10&#x02005;mm
height, and no-shoe lift.</p><p>The average velocity of COP in the x- and y-axes was calculated in&#x02005;mm/s from the
mediolateral and anteroposterior sway distances over 30 seconds with the eyes open. While
balance was being measured by the Good Balance System, we collected EMG data of the affected
leg. We placed surface electrodes on the affected lower limbs to record surface
electromyography (Flex com Infinity TM, Thought Technology Ltd., Canada) of four muscles:
the rectus femoris, biceps femoris, tibialis anterior, and medial gastrocnemius. Pairs of
Ag/AgCl electrodes (3M, RedDot) with a surface diameter of 2&#x02005;cm were arranged parallel to
the muscle belly. The electrode sites were prepared by shaving and rubbing the skin with
alcohol to ensure good contact. The EMG data was acquired at a sampling rate of 1,000&#x02005;Hz.
After acquisition, the data was filtered with a dual pass fourth order digital low pass
Butterworth filter with a cut-off frequency of 15&#x02005;Hz. The input impedance of the electrode
units was 1,000,000 M&#x003a9; and the Common Mode Rejection Ratio in the range of 20&#x02013;500&#x02005;Hz was
greater than 130 dB.</p><p>All data were analyzed with SPSS for Windows version 18.0. One-way repeated measures ANOVA
was used to compare the balance values and muscle activities of the affected lower extremity
(rectus femoris, biceps femoris, tibialis anterior, medial gastrocnemius). The post-hoc LSD
method was used. A significance level of 0.05 was chosen for all analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>One-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant differences in the velocities of

be improved by applying a lift to the shoe of the unaffected lower extremity. The balance
parameters of mediolateral sway and anteroposterior sway in static standing proportionately
improved when 5&#x02005;mm and 10&#x02005;mm shoe lifts were placed under the shoe of the unaffected lower
extremity of the stroke patients. Shoe lift induced constrained weight shift to the affected
lower extremity. In addition, the muscle activities of the affected lower-extremity
gradually increased with increasing shoe lift from 0 to 10&#x02005;mm. Our findings demonstrate that
shoe lift beneath the unaffected lower extremity reduces standing sway and induces weight
shift toward the affected-lower extremity of stroke patients.</p><p>The results of our study show there was a reduction in mediolateral sway and
anteroposterior sway during static standing with shoe lift. These results show that the
static balance function of stroke patients can be improved by placing a lift under the shoe
of the unaffected lower extremity. Our results are in agreement with several previous
studies that have reported that the symmetry of stance of stroke patients can be improved by
shifting the weight to the affected side by adding a lift to the shoe beneath the unaffected
lower extremity<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Chaudhuri et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that weight shift induced by
lifts applied to the shoe of the non-affected lower extremity improved weight symmetry,
shortened latencies, and increased the magnitude of the response strength. Moreover, the
muscle activation of the rectus femoris, biceps femoris, tibialis anterior, and medial
gastrocnemius of the affected lower extremity progressively improved with increasing height
of the shoe lift. Our results indicate that muscle activities of the affected lower
extremity with 5&#x02005;mm shoe lift of the unaffected side increased by 8&#x02013;11% over those of
no-shoe lift, and that 10&#x02005;mm shoe lift increased them by 14&#x02013;24%. A previous study also
reported that the proportion of body weight supported by the affected side increase with
shoe lift, reaching almost 50&#x02013;50 weight distribution with an increase of load of 11% body
weight when a 10&#x02005;mm shoe lift was used<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>We consider that weight shift to the weaker side induced by a shoe lift placed beneath the
unaffected lower extremity provides a more equal distribution of forces on both the lower
extremities through shift the center of gravity from the unaffected side to the midline.
Thus, increased weight bearing by the affected side due to shoe lift on the unaffected side
facilitates load receptor feedback to the central nervous system.</p><p>Our results suggest that constrained weight shift to the affected side elicited by a shoe
insole of 10&#x02005;mm height beneath the unaffected leg can improve the static standing balance of
stroke patients, and it increases by 14&#x02013;24% the muscle activation of the affected leg.
Several limitations should be taken into account when interpreting the data. Because our
study was only conducted with stroke patients who were able to independently stand, the
results may not be generalized to those with more severe forms of stroke who use assistive
walking devices or are incapable of independently standing. We did not investigate the
balance function and muscle activation of the affected lower extremity of shoe lift heights
other than 5&#x02005;mm and 10&#x02005;mm. Therefore, future studies may be needed in order to address these
issues.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Geurts</surname><given-names>AC</given-names></name><name><surname>de Haart</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>van Nes</surname><given-names>IJ</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>A review of standing balance recovery from
