All of the pregnant women have a living fetus in the uterine cavity in the first trimester with willingness for participation in this study, were included. The study had a double-blinded randomized design, where both investigators and participants were blinded to the study group assignment. We informed all of the participants about the research protocol and process and then asked them to sign a participation written consent. After that, using computerized randomization system, we assigned them into two groups of taking 5 mg or 1 mg folic acid pills. Participant level randomization was stratified by the research site, to assure balance in representation [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study flowchart</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ABR-5-192-g001"/></fig><p>For randomization, each participant has received an exclusive (random) number which was the same/different from the sequence numbers of pill boxes.

Patients and drug store's stuff were both blind about a dose of the drug. The folic acid pills were manufactured by Jalinous Company Pharmaceutical Industries in Iran. Perioral the production the manufacturer was asked to develop quality control tests for each of pills, include the quantity of folic acid material and its dosage in the pills, and also the content uniformity and dissolution test to ensure that the folic acid material is consistent across pills and it dissolve adequately in a standard time.</p><p>All participants were asked to take a single pill of 1 mg or 5 mg of folic acid daily throughout the first trimester of pregnancy since delivery. The first assessment of women was done about complete medical and obstetrical history, physical examination, demographic data (age, weigh, height, body mass index [BMI], and gravidity), calculating gestational age, vital sign (especially systolic and diastolic blood pressure) and laboratory data including urine analysis, platelet count, liver function tests (including aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase) and serum's creatinine and making prenatal card.</p><p>Participants were followed up every month in first and second trimester to check on their health status, providing new pill boxes for the next 2 months, and collect old pillboxes. The follow-up surveys were continued during the years of the study (October 2013&#x02013;May 2015), and every 2 weeks until 36 weeks and weekly in the last month of pregnancy up to delivery. Participants were also asked to no to use multivitamins during the study. The study protocol, informed consent, manual of operations, and data collection forms were approved by the Ethics Committees of the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences Ethic Committee. The study participants were pregnant women who have received prenatal cares at the study clinics since the first visit to delivery and followed up at least 42 days after childbirth in these clinics. If they have any of the following situations they do not include in our study: Presence or history of a disorder in which administration of folic acid is contraindicated, renal diseases, using anti-epileptic drugs (since the metabolism of anti-epileptic drugs requires a great deal of folic acid), malignancy, alcohol abuse, multiple birth (presence of three living fetus or more) and known hypersensitivity to folic acid (rashes, dermatologic, and gastroenterological discomforts).

In 2014, the Bilano <italic>et al</italic>. performed a secondary analysis of the WHO Global Survey on Maternal and Perinatal Health. The survey was a multicountry, facility-based cross-sectional study. A global sample consisting of 24 countries from three regions and 373 health facilities was obtained via a stratified multi-stage cluster sampling design. Maternal and offspring data were extracted from records using standardized questionnaires. Multi-level logistic regression modeling was conducted with random effects at the individual, facility, and country levels. The prevalence of PE/eclampsia in the Mori Jo&#x000e3;o <italic>et al</italic>. study population was 10,754 (4%), but they found much variation between and within countries. PE/eclampsia prevalence ranged from &#x0003c;1% in Angola to 8% in Brazil.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>Near to our findings, there is a local investigation in our local area (Iran) which showed that the prevalence of hypertensive disorder between a population of 2300 pregnant women was 3.3% of which 96% fulfilled PE criteria.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>According to the WHO Global Survey on Maternal and Perinatal Health, and in attention to this fact that the prevalence of PE is higher in low and middle-income countries than Western, we suggest that this study results support the hypothesis that folic acid supplementation associated with reduced risk of PE.</p><p>Our findings do not support that administration of high dose (5 mg) folic acid can decrease severity rate of PE. Patients in 1 mg and 5 mg groups&#x02019; evaluations did not reveal any difference in blood pressure and regarding laboratory data, all of the following parameters were similar in both groups: Platelet count, serum creatinine, liver function tests, 24-h urine analysis; although high doses of folic acid can reduce the risk of PE, there is no proved finding on efficacy of supplementation on reducing signs and laboratory data of the disease. In any case, we did not find a significant relationship between severity of PE between those supplemented with high dose and those treated with a low dose. We have not significant differences which support that administration of folic acid can retard the onset of PE.
