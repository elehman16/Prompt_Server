The patients were assessed for postoperative pain, swelling, dry socket, and soft tissue healing on the 3<sup>rd</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup>, and 14<sup>th</sup> day of postoperative periods depending on the standard methods. Radiological assessment of the extraction site was done at 1, 2, and 6 months interval to compare the change in bone density in the sockets in control and treated patients.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Pain and swelling were less on PRP and PRF site when compared to HA and control site.

Among the several materials used to repair bone defects, autologous graft is still considered as the gold standard.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] However, the use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and protein-rich fibrin (PRF) as bone graft material has increased in recent years. The beneficial growth factors from platelets were first described by Ross <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Platelets trapped within fibrin matrix release growth factors after activation that stimulates the mitogenic response in the periosteum for bone repair.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] PRP contain important growth promoting factors such as platelet-derived growth factors (PDGF), transforming growth factors-&#x003b2;, vascular endothelial growth factor, and epithelial growth factor that are responsible for increased cell mitosis, collagen production, and recruitment of other cells to the site of injury, thereby initiating vascular in-growth and cell differentiation. PRP also contains cell adhesive such as fibrin, fibronectin, and vitronectin responsible for osteoconduction and used as a matrix for bone, connective tissue, and epithelial migration.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Choukroun's PRF is a fibrin matrix in which platelet cytokines and cells are trapped and can serve as a resorbable membrane when released after a certain time.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] More recently, PRF is shown to be a suitable scaffold for breeding human periosteal cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, thus also being beneficial for bone tissue engineering applications.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>At present, several biocompatible materials have emerged as substitutes of autologous bone. Among synthetic biomaterials artificial or synthetic hydroxyapatite (HA), the bioglass and bioceramics are also widely accepted. The unique chemical similarity of HA with the mineralized phase of bone makes it osteoconductive and biocompatible.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] It is widely used in dental, craniofacial, and orthopedic surgery.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>This clinical study was undertaken to compare the efficacy of PRP, PRF, and HA for reduction of pain and swelling, absence of dry socket, soft tissue healing, and bone regeneration after mandibular third molar extraction, to compare whether any difference exist between postoperative stages of each type of treatment and to determine which one is the best graft material for bone regeneration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>aterials and</sc> M<sc>ethods</sc></title><p>The CONSORT guidelines were followed for reporting this study.

Our study demonstrated that the use of PRP and PRF in extraction socket was more beneficial in reducing pain, swelling, and in accelerating the healing of soft tissue than HA. PDGF and epidermal growth factor are mainly involved in the migration of fibroblast, their proliferation, and collagen synthesis, thereby accelerating soft tissue wound healing.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Thus, the use of platelets in bone defects to improve, fasten healing, and stimulate new bone formation is quite justifiable.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] It has also been shown in our previous study that healing of surgical sites enhanced with PRP is 2&#x02013;3 times greater than that of normal surgical sites without PRP.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] PRP accelerates wound maturity and epithelialization and hence decreases scar formation.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] The activation of PRP to form PRP gel causes degranulation of &#x003b1;-granules present in the platelets, thus releasing the growth factors. In this study, we have mixed CaCl<sub>2</sub> along with PRP to form an autologous platelet gel. This gel was prepared from the patient's own blood, thus preventing any antigen-antibody reaction.</p><p>PRF is mostly preferred over other concentrates because it releases the growth factors at a sustained rate over a longer period, thereby optimizing wound healing.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] PRF is also beneficial for the regeneration of periodontal defects as it stimulates the growth of osteoblasts and periodontal ligament cells.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>The presence of dry socket (alveolar osteitis) is a common complication after tooth extraction, occurring due to disruption of blood clot prematurely in the extraction socket leaving bone unprotected and exposed to the oral environment.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The result from the assessment of dry socket supports previous report indicating that HA can be an effective preventive factor for dry socket (though results are not statistically significant).[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>However, our radiographic results revealed better bone healing at HA site than other sites, suggesting that HA has an excellent bone conductive property. Porous HA permits the growth of osteogenic cells from existing bone surfaces into adjacent bone graft material.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Studies have shown that HA is well tolerated by the surrounding uninflamed tissues and is suitable for application in humans.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p>In our study, all the procedures were done comfortably under local anesthesia on an outpatient basis without any complication. All the materials used in this study were found to be biocompatible with no detectable evidence of foreign body reaction or rejection of the material. All the materials not only fill and obliterate the extraction socket defect but also maintain the existing height of the alveolar bone. One of the disadvantages of PRP and PRF over HA is that former preparation is cumbersome procedure. Both preparations need patient's blood collection and taking to laboratory which requires some time while HA is readily available and can be placed immediately. The use of HA granules (G Bone) is cost-effective for the patients compared to other bone graft materials. The limitation of this study was that 6 months postoperative follow-up period was short to comment on the efficacy of various graft materials in complete bone regeneration process but adequate to evaluate the effects of initiating and enhancing the role in pain, swelling, dry socket prevention also in soft tissue healing. However, long-term follow-up along with histological study of the bone is required for assessment of the efficacy of various graft materials.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>S<sc>ummary and</sc> C<sc>onclusion</sc></title><p>In summary, the results obtained from our study clearly indicate that in cases treated with PRP and PRF there was obvious improvement in the pain, swelling, and healing of soft tissue. Regeneration of bone after third molar surgery in HA is much better as compared to the control, PRP- and PRF-treated patients postoperatively. Moreover, PRP used in this study formed a biological gel which functioned as an adhesive and formed stable clot. In addition, the procedure for the preparation of PRP and PRF in this study is simple, economical, and exhibited fruitful results. However, since this study was done with a follow-up of 6 months only, further clinical trials with follow-up of longer duration with larger sample size needs to be done to get more affirmative and conclusive result.</p><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-11" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>The work has been done in Vyas Dental College, Jodhpur, Rasjasthan, India.
