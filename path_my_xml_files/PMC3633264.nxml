It is caused by excessive intake of fluoride, but only during the period of tooth development. The most important risk factor for dental fluorosis is the amount of fluoride consumed from all sources during the critical period of tooth development.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>The relationship of dental fluorosis with fluoride level of drinking water [normal: 0.6-0.8 ppm (parts per million) at 26.3-32.6&#x000b0;C and 0.9-1.7 ppm at 10-12&#x000b0;C] is well established.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Fluoridated supplements, fluoridated dentifrices, and infant formulas before the age of seven are the three major risk factors other than fluoridated water for dental fluorosis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] The mechanism underlying the development of dental fluorosis has not been conclusively determined. It was believed previously that excessive intake of fluoride interfered with the function of ameloblasts, perhaps inhibiting the secretion of, or altering the composition of enamel matrix proteins. It now appears that the risk of dental fluorosis is the lowest during the secretory stage of enamel development. It is suggested that fluorosis causes subsurface hypomineralization or porosity of enamel. This subsurface porosity is most likely caused by a delay in the hydrolysis and removal of enamel proteins, particularly amelogenins, as the enamel matures. This delay could be due to the direct effect of fluoride on the ameloblasts or to an interaction of fluoride with the proteins or proteinases in the mineralizing matrix. Early maturation stage of enamel formation appears to be particularly sensitive to fluoride exposure. The risk of enamel fluorosis is lowest when exposure takes place only during the secretory stage of enamel formation, but highest when exposure occurs in both secretory and maturation stages of enamel formation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>The clinical appearance of dental fluorosis varies according to its severity. It is characterized by either chalky white discoloration confined only to incisal edges of anterior teeth and cusp tips of posterior teeth or chalky white discoloration involving either less than one-third, one-third to two&#x02013;thirds, or more than two-thirds of the surface, with or without light-to-dark brown discoloration associated with or without discrete pitting and/or with large areas of missing enamel.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Chronic fluoride toxicity may produce skeletal fluorosis characterized by stiffness in the back and various joints, deformity in hips, knees, and other joints, bony exostosis in limb bones, neurologic manifestations, difficulty in walking due to weakness, nausea, loss of appetite, pain in the stomach, constipation, diarrhea, and allergic manifestations.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>Fluorosis occurs mainly by systemic route and can be predicted from fluoride expression in biological fluids like serum, plasma, and urine. Fluoride level of serum and urine are good indicators of fluoride exposure of the patients. Fluoride level in hair and nail have also been used to evaluate the risk of dental fluorosis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>]</p><p>In the past, vitamin C, vitamin D, and salts of calcium, magnesium, or aluminum were prescribed individually in an attempt to inhibit or reverse the adverse effects of fluorosis. But the results were inconclusive.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] However, in a few studies, calcium, ascorbic acid, and vitamin D<sub>3</sub> have been proved to be effective when prescribed in combination in an attempt at reversal of dental fluorosis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>]</p><p>The present study was carried out to evaluate clinical grading of dental fluorosis, reversal of dental fluorosis in patients with calcium, vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, and ascorbic acid, and pretreatment and post-treatment levels of certain biochemical parameters concerned with dental fluorosis. The role of fluoride level of drinking water in dental fluorosis and prevalence of dental fluorosis in both dentitions and teeth were assessed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The present study was conducted in 50 patients, randomly selected from the Oral Diagnosis, Oral Medicine and Dental Radiology Department of the Government Dental College and Hospital, Ahmedabad.

Moreover, dental fluorosis is more common in permanent teeth compared to deciduous teeth.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] Hence, this group remains the most commonly affected for dental fluorosis.</p><p>The present study showed that approximately 46% of the patients were living in various areas of Ahmedabad city with normal fluoride level of water. Dental fluorosis was found in approximately 33% of the patients coming from the area with higher fluoride level of water and only 20% cases were from the area with low level of fluoride in the drinking water. The prime reason for dental fluorosis is high fluoride level in drinking water. Other than this, three major risk factors were identified. They are fluoridated supplements, fluoridated dentifrices, and infant formulas before the age of seven years.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] Fluoridated toothpastes contribute to the risk of enamel fluorosis because the swallowing reflex is not well developed in children below six years, particularly below three years. The significantly lower prevalence and severity of dental fluorosis among the vegetarian group compared to the nonvegetarians would seem to be related to diet.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] The present study showed that 92% of the cases fall in the age group of 11-17 years; so, fluoridated toothpaste cannot be considered as a causative factor of dental fluorosis in our study.</p><p>The maximum number of patients in the present study showed prevalence of dental fluorosis in permanent teeth rather than deciduous teeth. The literature also showed that the prevalence in permanent teeth is more than that in deciduous dentition.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] This is because excess fluoride arrests the late phases of enamel formation. The maturative stage of enamel formation is the lengthiest phase, lasting from one to two years for primary teeth and four to five years for permanent posterior teeth. As the maturative stage is much shorter in primary teeth, less fluoride is found in the primary teeth than in permanent teeth developed under the same exposure to fluoride. Studies also showed that prevalence in deciduous teeth is low due to limited permeability of the human placenta by fluoride.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, maxillary teeth were found to be more commonly affected than homologous mandibular teeth. The literature also showed that dental fluorosis is more severe in maxillary teeth than in homologous mandibular teeth.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] In the present study, in permanent teeth, maxillary central incisors were found most commonly affected by dental fluorosis followed by premolars and second molars. Various studies established that maxillary central incisors are most commonly affected by dental fluorosis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] The prevalence of dental fluorosis is low in mandibular incisors and first molars in contrast to maxillary central incisors. From Haavikko's 1970 tooth development data it is evident that first molars and lower incisors are at or have passed the &#x02018;crown completed&#x02019; stage around the age of three, that is, the time when the fluoride regimen is initiated in most children. However, upper central incisors are at an earlier stage of tooth development at this age.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>] Various other studies showed that premolars and second molars which mineralize later than anterior teeth may be more severely affected due to the cumulative effect of fluoride.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Various studies showed that the intraoral distribution of the severity of dental fluorosis within permanent dentition in decreasing order depends on the duration of enamel formation, age at completion of enamel formation, age of tooth eruption, and the age at the start of enamel formation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>In this study, no change in clinical grades was noted, but changes were noted in biochemical parameters, that is, serum fluoride and urine fluoride levels. As seen in the results, a significant decrease in serum fluoride levels of the patients was noted in patients of group A and group B after three months of treatment and was more significant in group A treated with calcium and vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplements than group B treated with ascorbic acid and vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplements. A significant decrease in urine fluoride level of patients was also noted after three months of treatment in both group A and group B. This is suggestive of a decrease in the level of biochemical parameters in patients of dental fluorosis. No significant changes in either serum fluoride or urine fluoride were noted in patients of the control group C. Thus, the therapy reduced the fluoride levels markedly in body fluids, serum and urine. Fluoride level in urine has been used to estimate the absorbed amount of fluoride.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] Thus, the present study showed reduced fluoride absorption.</p><p>Various studies showed that dietary calcium protects the individual against fluoride toxicity by reducing its absorption.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>] Calcium interacts with the fluoride to form calcium fluoride which is an insoluble salt and being a larger molecule is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and excreted through feces.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>] Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> increases the absorption of calcium and thus directly affects the absorption of fluoride ions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is an important entity to ameliorate the ill effects of fluoride. Vitamin C acts as a cofactor or coenzyme in the process of hydroxylation of proline, one of the most important amino acids of collagen, the base material for bone and tooth matrix.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Increasing fluoride level in water is a major risk factor for dental fluorosis. Permanent dentition is involved more in dental fluorosis than primary dentition. Maxillary teeth are more commonly affected than homologous mandibular teeth and maxillary central incisors are found to be the most commonly affected teeth, whereas first molars are the least commonly affected. No change in clinical grading of dental fluorosis was noted in all three groups of treated patients. A significant reduction in serum fluoride and urine fluoride levels was noted in patients treated with calcium, vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, and ascorbic acid-vitamin D<sub>3</sub>. The study regarding reversal of dental fluorosis comprised only 30 patients with three months of regular follow-up. So, this sample of patients and duration of follow-up period are conclusive to observe changes in biochemical parameters but not sufficient to observe changes in clinical grading. Hence, more number of patients with long term follow-up is required for better clinical evaluation.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold>
