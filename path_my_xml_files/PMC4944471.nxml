Volunteers, as community members, are a critical part of many end-of-life care services. The impact of their services on important outcomes such as quality of life is currently poorly understood. The purpose of this study is to evaluate a series of social action initiatives which use volunteers to deliver befriending services to people anticipated to be in their last year of life. The aim is to determine if receiving care from a social action volunteer befriending service plus usual care significantly improves quality of life in the last year of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The research questions will be addressed through a wait-list randomised controlled trial (WLRCT) and qualitative case study evaluation across 12 sites in England. Participants will be randomly allocated to either receive the social action volunteer befriending service straight away or receive the intervention after a four week wait (wait-list arm). The impact of the intervention on end-of-life experience (quality of life as primary outcome, loneliness, social support) will be measured. Repeated assessments will be carried out at baseline and weeks 4 and 8 for the intervention arm and weeks 4, 8 and 12 for the wait-list arm. For selected sites case study evaluation will include interviews, observation and documentary analysis to understand the mechanisms underpinning any found impact.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will address the need to both provide services which use social action models to support end-of-life care in community settings, and to robustly evaluate these models to determine if they influence the experience of end-of-life care. Such services could work to reduce isolation, help meet emotional needs and maintain a sense of connectedness to the community.

People want to be cared for as close to home as possible, especially in the last year of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However there is poor understanding about which components of home based interventions provide the highest benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Understanding the impact of these components in context is important so that priority is given to developing services in a way known to maximise benefit to people in their last year of life, informal carers and the services themselves.</p><p>With reference to end of life care at home, it is increasingly recognised that compassionate support cannot be the responsibility of health and social care professionals alone and requires a response from the wider community. Volunteers are a critical part of many end-of-life care services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] Family members are satisfied with the services that volunteers provide at the end-of-life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], but there is little evidence of their effect on care outcomes. A recent systematic review assessing the impact of volunteers involved in the direct care of palliative care patients and their families at the end-of-life only found 8 studies, none from the UK. They indicate that volunteer involvement has a positive impact on satisfaction with care and that people may survive longer with home visits from a volunteer. They conclude that further research is needed to ensure the resource of volunteers in palliative care is used appropriately and effectively. Evaluation in well-designed comparative studies is recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>In order to meet this knowledge gap, the UK Cabinet Office funded the provision and evaluation of a range of social action projects at the end of life. The purpose of this evaluation is to use a robust and ethical comparative design to determine the effect of volunteer led social action befriending services on quality of life in the last year of life and how such services can best be implemented and delivered. Research of this sort can ensure that the resource of volunteers in palliative care is used appropriately, and in a way which effectively improves quality of life and the experience in the last year of life. Many volunteer delivered befriending social action services are being run or developed to provide non-clinical support to people in their own homes such as companionship, running errands and providing information. Whilst this feels intuitively helpful, there is no robust evaluation of the outcomes of these services nor understanding of how best to provide such care to maximise effectiveness.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aims</title><p>The <bold>primary aim</bold> of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of receiving care from a social action volunteer befriending service plus standard care at improving quality of life as compared to usual care alone for adults in the last year of life.</p><p>The <bold>secondary aims</bold> are to:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>explore whether the social action volunteer befriending service reduces loneliness and affects the perception of social support for adults</p></list-item><list-item><p>examine whether informal carers for those receiving care from a social action volunteer befriending service experience less carer burden</p></list-item><list-item><p>determine whether receiving care from a social action volunteer befriending service can affect participant&#x02019;s use of other health and social care services</p></list-item><list-item><p>identify and explore the factors that influence the impact of social action volunteer befriending services on end-of-life experience</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The intervention</title><p>The intervention is based on a model of social action, and comprises a number of components. Core to the intervention is that it is provided by a trained volunteer rather than a paid member of staff, and provides non-clinical, non-hands on support. Individual support needs are assessed by the non-clinical volunteer co-ordinator, and support then provided from a suite of possible options including &#x02018;befriending&#x02019; e.g. sitting with someone to provide companionship, &#x02018;practical support&#x02019; e.g. assisting with household tasks such as dog walking, gardening, picking up prescriptions or other errands, and &#x02018;signposting&#x02019; e.g. providing information on other available services. Support will be typically provided from 1&#x02013;3 times per week, face to face or by telephone, as negotiated between volunteer providers and participants. Participants will be in the trial for 8 or 12&#x000a0;weeks (immediate vs wait-list arm), but their receipt of the social action volunteer service can continue outside the trial beyond this point if needed. Participants are free to withdraw at any time. Participants will continue to receive all usual care during this period. In this study the intervention will be provided across a number of sites in England who are independently funded to provide this service by the UK Cabinet Office.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Methods</title><p>The study involves two main approaches to data collection.</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Wait-list randomised controlled trial</title><p>This is a multi-site (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;12) randomised controlled trial (RCT) involving a wait-list design. Participants will be allocated on a 1:1 allocation ratio. A wait-list trial was chosen as an ethical design which has the strength of an RCT, but with greater acceptability as all patients eventually receive the intervention. In a wait-list trial, respondents are either allocated to an intervention group where they receive the intervention immediately (or as soon after randomisation as possible) or to a wait-list group where they receive the same intervention after a defined period on a waiting list. While they are on the waiting list patients receive standard/usual care. Wait-list designs have been successfully used in end-of-life care research, including where there is a pre-existing service [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Advantages include having the strength of a RCT in determining causality, but with greater acceptability as all patients eventually receive the intervention which can feel more ethically defensible in end of life care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. We propose a short wait period to minimise risk and acknowledge that interventions need to be effective in a short time period where life expectancy is short (i.e. a year or less) and attrition due to illness or death highly anticipated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Qualitative case study design</title><p>Results generated from the WLRCT will be combined with a qualitative case study evaluation to understand the impact of social action befriending services on end-of-life experience and the factors that can maximize or minimise that impact.

Those who are eligible will be given an invitation letter and participant information sheet and given time to ask questions and consider trial participation. Once a referred patient has indicated that they are happy to participate in the trial, the informed consent documentation will be explained to them and written consent taken. These staff are also responsible for informing Lancaster University of ay adverse events. Baseline data will then be collected. At this point the site will contact Lancaster University as part of the randomisation procedure, and plan intervention delivery according to the assigned trial arm.</p><p>For trial participants who are receiving their service within a chosen case study site, a proportion of them may be invited to participate in a qualitative interview to discuss their experience of the service.

The fixed effects include site, treatment group, and time since entry, and time interactions, which measure systematic differences in the rate of change. The assumption of a common initial mean for all participants is justified by the randomization of participants into treatment groups. A major advantage of the LME model is that is does not require a balanced design; in particular, participant effects can be estimated using incomplete data.

If observed, these confounders will be included in the LME model to reduce the bias of differential attrition on the estimated treatment effect.</p><p>Statistical significance will be assessed at the 5&#x000a0;% (two-sided) level. All statistical analyses will be conducted using SPSS v.20.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Missing data</title><p>A complete case analysis will be undertaken with a range of approaches for undertaking sensitivity analyses to access the robustness of the findings with respect to missing data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Case-study evaluation analyses</title><p>Data analyses will follow a framework analysis approach using a matrix approach informed by the final theory of change. Framework analysis facilitates within and cross case pattern matching and has been used in case studies in palliative and end-of-life care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This analysis will be integrated with trial data so that an understanding of the factors affecting impact can be compared with quantitative impact. Cross case pattern matching will follow to identify thematic factors associated with challenges and successes in creating impact. This should provide information on facilitators, challenges, barriers and strategies for overcoming them.</p><p>All qualitative analyses will be performed using NVivo software.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Handling and storage of data and documents</title><sec id="Sec36"><title>Access to data</title><p>The designated contact person(s) in each study site will have access to clinical information either contained within the service referral or available within the organisation if the potential participant is known to them already. Patient and carer permission will be required for Lancaster University to access patient contact details in order to post subsequent questionnaires to patient and carer participants. Patient identifiable data will be encrypted and securely transferred. To ensure confidentiality, data dispersed to project team members will have any identifying participant information removed.</p><p>Study data (baseline, week 4, 8, 12 questionnaires) will be returned by post to Lancaster University for entry onto an SPSS database. Weekly data on volunteer input will be securely transferred electronically to Lancaster University for entry onto SPSS. Data will be cleaned and quality checked independently from the person entering the data. Range checks will be made for expected data values. An error rate will be reported.</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Confidentiality</title><p>Questionnaires will be coded with a unique alpha numeric identifier which will be kept separately from participant contact details. No personal identifying information will be included in the questionnaires. Interviews will be recorded only if the patient consents for this to occur. Interviews will be digitally recorded on an encrypted recorder and transferred as soon as possible to a password protected computer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Data storage</title><p>Data storage and handling will include locked storage, password protection, encryption and anonymisation of original data. All audio&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;recordings will be labelled only with participants&#x02019; alphanumeric codes and stored securely. Direct quotations from respondents will only be used in such a way as to ensure anonymity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Data monitoring</title><p>Due to the low risk nature of the intervention, the REC determined that a data monitoring committee (DMC) was not required. Regular meetings of protocol authors and funder representatives will occur where any adverse or unintended effects of trial interventions or conduct will be discussed, and stopping decisions made. Site initiation visits will be made by Lancaster University investigators to explain trial conduct, and an interim audit of site trial procedures will be made by the investigators.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec40"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec41"><title>Risks</title><p>The main risk identified is that participants entered into the trial who are randomised to the wait-list condition will potentially receive suboptimal support over that waiting time, if the intervention is found to be of benefit. However a number of factors mitigate against this risk:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>First, there is insufficient current evidence that such services are of benefit. There are no current trials or comparative studies of such social action services which measure outcomes and recent reviews of the literature about volunteering at the end-of-life argue strongly for well conducted robust evaluations of these services.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Second, a relatively short wait period has been chosen to minimise any risks should the service prove to be of benefit. In the UK people are used to short waits for services and are unlikely to feel seriously disadvantaged by a short wait.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Third, these social action services are not currently available to participants, and they would not be receiving the potential benefit of these services without the funding available to support this trial.</p></list-item></list></p><p>There is a further risk that these services cause burden, distress or harm rather than the intended benefit. This is unlikely to be the case, as other similar services have had reports of satisfaction, and the service provided is not core clinical work or hands on care but additional social support. The qualitative interview data collected from participants should give an indication of experience which can be used to monitor this possibility. Participants will also have written information given to them, and verbally explained, about the complaints and other procedures to follow if they have any concerns or feedback related to either their service provision or the conduct of the research. The research team and service provider sites will work closely together to monitor any issues and act upon them rapidly.</p><p>There is also a risk that patient and carer participants may be concerned or distressed by some of the questions asked within the questionnaire toolkit. This risk will be minimised by using existing well validated standardised tools, which have been tested in a number of similar populations, and in different cultures and contexts. The tools have been carefully chosen to be short and easy to complete to minimise participant burden as much as possible.</p><p>Finally, the risk that participants will be contacted to complete subsequent questionnaires or to be invited to interview when they may be too unwell through deterioration in their condition, or that carers may be distressed by such information after a participants&#x02019; death will be mitigated by a clear protocol between the sites and the University to ensure that this information is securely transferred to avoid such distress.</p></sec><sec id="Sec42"><title>Potential benefits</title><p>Whilst no direct benefit to participants has been promised, they may enjoy and benefit from the social action intervention. This intervention can continue after the research phase of the service: services have been asked to provide this service as per their assessment of need, the only difference to usual service provision is the wait period for those allocated to the wait-list condition. Indirectly, our experience of conducting research in palliative care has shown that patients and informal carers have been willing to take part in such studies as a method of reciprocity for the care they have received from palliative care practitioners and in the knowledge that their participation will inform the overall understanding of the provision of care and benefit others in the future; this finding is increasingly being supported by a growing literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In addition, experience with this kind of research shows that patients and carers often appreciate the interest shown in their experience and opinions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge the contributions of the people who take part in this research, often at a time of great challenge in their lives, thank you.
