The large central compartment volume in children makes the induction dose calculation difficult when it is used as a sole agent.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] To combat these problems, addition of opioid (like fentanyl) prior to propofol induction gained importance.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Fentanyl pretreatment also reduces propofol requirement for LMA insertion.

Clonidine is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from gastrointestinal tract (oral bioavailability up to 95%). After an oral intake, onset of action starts within 30-60 minutes and peak plasma concentration is reached within 90 min.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] It is devoid of respiratory depressant action and lacks the negative effects on cognition, memory, and behavior as seen with midazolam.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Previous studies have shown that an oral clonidine premedication reduces propofol requirement for LMA insertion,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] and oral clonidine is superior to oral midazolam in pediatric patient in view of mask acceptance, parental satisfaction, and quality of sedation (similar to natural sleep).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Thus, clonidine has a promising role in premedication in children.</p><p>The current double-blind, prospective, randomized, controlled study was conducted with the aim to compare the effect of addition of ketamine with fentanyl and saline before propofol induction on hemodynamic profile during and immediately after LMA insertion, and to compare insertion conditions in oral clonidine premedicated children.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>With an approval of ethical committee, a written and informed consent was taken from parents of each 180 patient between age group of 2-10 years of either gender with American Society of Anesthesia physical status grading I from a group of 201 potential candidates.

To reduce pain on propofol administration 1 ml of 1% lidocaine was added to 100 mg of propofol. If required, further increments of propofol 0.5 mg/kg was given until loss of consciousness and loss of eye lash reflex.

If LMA insertion was unsuccessful after 3 attempts, patient's trachea was intubated after using muscle relaxant. After successful LMA insertion, anesthesia was maintained with 70% N<sub>2</sub>O with 30% O<sub>2</sub> and Halothane, using Ayres T piece for patient weight &#x0003c;18 kg and Bain's circuit for patients &#x0003e;18 kg.

Second issue was to investigate whether administration of ketamine or fentanyl improves LMA insertion conditions. In the present study, we demonstrated consistently higher heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure in ketamine group compared to fentanyl and saline group, even in clonidine premedicated patient. The indirect sympathomimetic action of ketamine on sinus node may lead to this effect.</p><p>Propofol decreases blood pressure by decrease in peripheral vascular resistance and myocardial contractility.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Heart rate may be slowed with more significant vagotonic effect at larger doses.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] The combination of propofol ketamine attenuates hemodynamic depression intraoperatively without causing respiratory depression. The cardio-stimulant effect of ketamine in balances the cardio-depressant effect of propofol and this effect is utmost important in pediatric group of patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Goh <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that the addition of subanesthetic dose of ketamine with propofol for LMA insertion preserved hemodynamic stability in adult patient.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Tomatir <italic>et al</italic>. showed that ketamine 0.5 mg/kg administered before propofol 1.5 mg/kg preserved hemodynamic stability compared with propofol alone in children in short term procedure like magnetic resonance imaging.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] In our study, ketamine 0.5 mg/kg administered before induction of anesthesia with propofol 3 mg/kg for LMA placement produced improved hemodynamic stability compared to fentanyl 1 &#x003bc;g/kg with same dose of propofol in children.</p><p>Goh <italic>et al</italic>. showed that the addition of fentanyl increased the depressant effects of propofol on systolic blood pressure and heart rate.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Cheam and Chui also deducted that fentanyl enhances the depressant effects of propofol on blood pressure and heart rate.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Our results are similar with these studies, with heart rate and mean blood pressure decreasing following induction of anesthesia with fentanyl&#x02013;propofol in the present study.</p><p>Goyagi <italic>et al</italic>. described that oral clonidine premedication reduced propofol requirement for the LMA insertion in adults.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] The mean dose (ED50) according to their study in adult is 2&#x000b1;0.2 mg/kg. A satisfaction insertion was present in 59% of our oral clonidine-premeditated control group children with a dose of 3 mg/kg propofol. This could be possible due to the fact that substantially greater volume of distribution of drug in children as compared to adults.</p><p>Still, there is no consensus regarding the criteria to assess LMA insertion condition. In our study also, we compared LMA insertion conditions using the methodology based on 6 variables/3 grade score proposed by Silivagam <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] and Cheam <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Here also, we graded 4 fundamental patient responses to insertion like swallowing, coughing, movement, laryngospasm, and 2 observer-dependent variables like mouth opening with an ease of insertion. Conditions were graded as satisfactory if there was adequate mouth opening, no coughing, swallowing or laryngospasm, and no limb movement. We were able to use the score to assess both the ease of placement and patient's response. From these 6 points, a &#x02018;summed score&#x02019; was prepared. In our study, &#x02018;summed score&#x02019; of ketamine and fentanyl use for LMA insertion following anesthetic induction with propofol was comparable, which was significantly better than control group. Our results concur with the studies by Goh <italic>et al</italic>. in adult population.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>Prolonged apnea occurred more frequently with fentanyl than with ketamine or saline in our study. Our study is comparable to other studies where fentanyl was used to facilitate LMA insertion following propofol induction and prolonged the duration of apnea.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>Our study has the limitation of only one dose-response evaluation. We preferred to use a smaller dose of propofol (3 mg/kg) with oral clonidine premedicated patient that would not cause any hemodynamic side-effects. Secondly, our main concern was LMA insertion conditions and hemodynamic changes during insertion. Other concerns with addition of ketamine like emergence reactions were not followed in this study in children. However, we feel further studies with large sample size should address to solve our limitations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Administration of low dose of ketamine balanced the cardio depressant effect of propofol, even in clonidine-premedicated children. The combination is of significant hemodynamic benefit and better LMA insertion condition when compared with placebo. It is also seen that ketamine-propofol provide comparable conditions for LMA insertion like fentanyl-propofol with significantly less prolonged apnea and hemodynamic stability in clonidine-premedicated children.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold>
