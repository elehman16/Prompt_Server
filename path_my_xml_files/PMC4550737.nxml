In the ideal world, positive trials lead directly to implementation of the intervention into practice. However, trial results are most meaningful (and useful) when the trial has both internal and external validity. Internal validity is well understood<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and can be controlled in the design stage of most RCTs by using strategies such as masking of patients and assessors, randomisation, stratification and block randomisation (to ensure balance between allocated groups), and standardisation of treatment protocols. In contrast, external validity, the extent to which the results of a study can be generalised to other situations and to other people,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> is often under-recognised, under-reported and undervalued.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;4</xref></p><p>Rothwell<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> describes the concept of external validity as &#x02018;slippery&#x02019; and complex, easy to define in broad terms but problematic to quantify. However, when the results of a promising clinical trial are not incorporated into practice, a commonly cited reason is a lack of generalisability of the results.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;8</xref> In reality, the degree to which trial results can be generalised is often a matter of judgement, as well as pragmatics. When it comes time to implement an intervention, costs, site logistics and administrator goals play a critical role in uptake. Nevertheless, understanding how well the participants included in the trial are representative of the population of interest is important,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> but so too is the treatment setting in which the trial took place and the expertise of the intervention staff. It is also important to understand whether the results can be generalised beyond often restrictive eligibility criteria such as age and comorbidities.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>Our aims were to examine potential threats to generalisability of the results from an ongoing multicentre randomised trial, A Very Early Rehabilitation Trial (AVERT). AVERT is a large, pragmatic clinical trial of very early out of bed training (mobilisation) after stroke. It takes place in real-world clinical settings, with existing clinical staff delivering the intervention. The inclusion criteria are kept broad, in an effort to test whether the intervention might be widely applicable to patients with stroke.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Unlike many acute stroke trials, there is no restriction on upper age limit or stroke subtype (infarct or haemorrhage), and apart from excluding patients with significant disability prior to the index stroke admission, there is no restriction on comorbidities or previous stroke. Although these design characteristics should enhance the external validity of this trial, the question of how broadly trial results can be applied more generally has implications for implementation into practice.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>The Proximal Similarity Model is a useful framework for considering different generalisability contexts.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The term proximal similarity was suggested by Donald T Campbell as an appropriate relabelling of the term external validity. Under this model, different generalisability contexts, and the settings and circumstances in which people in a study may be different from, or similar to the population of interest, are considered and a gradient of similarity determined<italic>.</italic> Use of this framework encourages us to explore more deeply the potential critical factors that threaten external validity. For example, in the design phase for any trial, one of the goals is to ensure that the sample of patients involved in the study is representative of the population of interest. This goal is achieved by systematically addressing and, when possible, minimising or eliminating identifiable threats to external validity. Such threats can be specific to either the patient or to the study. Patient-specific threats include the systematic differences in important demographic and clinical characteristics between the patients in the study and in the population of interest. Study-specific threats include processes and systems of care that may or may not be encapsulated in the exclusion criteria, such as when the care processes in the study are not easily generalisable to different care sites or care systems.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Using the proximal similarity framework, study-specific factors to consider would include both those related to &#x02018;place&#x02019; (site and, if relevant, country) and to the &#x02018;settings and practices&#x02019; (eg, Are patients with acute stroke managed in a stroke unit or intensive care setting?) where the trial is undertaken. A schematic of the proximal similarity framework applied to the AVERT context is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015008378F1">figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2015008378F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Proximal similarity framework applied to the AVERT trial: a model for conceptualising the dimensions along which the sample of patients may be similar to the target population.

Patients admitted to a stroke unit are randomised in a ratio of 1:1 to two groups: very early and frequent mobilisation out of bed (VEM) and usual care. The experimental intervention (VEM) is frequent, functional, out of bed sitting, standing and walking activity starting within 24&#x02005;h of stroke onset and continued 6&#x02005;days a week for 14&#x02005;days or until discharge from acute stroke care (whichever is sooner). Patients are followed up at 3 and 12&#x02005;months. The primary outcome is the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 3&#x02005;months poststroke, with secondary outcomes for safety, walking recovery and quality of life. This paper presents results from the first 20&#x02005;000 patients who were screened, of whom 1158 patients were then randomised to the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participating hospitals</title><p>At the time of analysis, investigators from sites in Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore, England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales had recruited patients to the trial. All participating sites had a dedicated stroke unit with a multidisciplinary stroke team. A detailed site questionnaire was collected from participating sites yearly. This provided a record of the number of admissions for stroke each year and the number of stroke beds available. Sites were classified, by investigators at each site, according to the type of stroke unit defined in the Australian National Stroke Audit, Acute Services Organisational Survey Report:<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> (1) intensive stroke unit care model involving short stay, high nurse patient ratio, life support facilities and no rehabilitation; (2) acute care model involving short stays, close physiological monitoring and limited rehabilitation or (3) comprehensive model involving both acute care and a strong rehabilitation focus, longer stays and broader staffing. Sites were also classified according to the geographic location: metropolitan (population &#x0003e;100&#x02005;000), regional (25&#x02005;000&#x02013;100&#x02005;000) or rural (&#x0003c;25&#x02005;000).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Patient eligibility</title><p>Inclusion and exclusion criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015008378F2">figure 2</xref>) were designed to optimise the diversity of the patients exposed to the intervention while considering patient safety and feasibility. There was no upper age limit for inclusion to the study and both ischaemic and haemorrhagic strokes were included. Patients treated with recombinant tissue plasmin activator (rt-PA) were eligible if the attending physician allowed. Patients were excluded if a comorbid condition (eg, lower limb fracture or amputation) would prevent the start of treatment within the first 24&#x02005;h of stroke onset or if the outcome assessments were likely to be confounded by another serious comorbid medical illness. Patients admitted to a dedicated intensive care unit (ICU) are also excluded.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2015008378F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Relationship between trial inclusion/exclusion criteria and screening log categories (AVERT, A Very Early Rehabilitation Trial).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2015008378f02"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Screening and recruitment process</title><p>The intervention was designed to be delivered by trained nursing and/or physiotherapy staff 6&#x02005;days/week, excluding Sunday. To meet the 24&#x02005;h target for screening, recruitment and start of intervention, screening could take place Monday to Friday (8:00 to 17:00) and Saturday (8:00 to 12:00) to allow for the possibility of a recruited patient randomised to VEM on Saturday to start training on that day. No screening was conducted on Sundays. Screening and recruitment could be undertaken by stroke unit nurses, physiotherapists or research trials staff. A screening log was used to record all patients screened for AVERT. Age, sex, stroke severity and stroke type are important patient characteristics that can influence outcome after stroke and are therefore highlighted for attention on the screening logs.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The log also included reasons for exclusion as related to either trial inclusion and exclusion criteria, or to trial processes that might lead to exclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015008378F2">figure 2</xref>). Recruiting staff could also list the reason for exclusion as &#x02018;other&#x02019;. This category was most commonly used for patients who were not admitted to a stroke unit. However, &#x02018;other&#x02019; included patients who had a lower limb fracture (an exclusion criterion) and instances where a research therapist was unavailable to carry out the intervention, so recruitment was not possible. Multiple reasons could be listed for each patient. Recruiters were required to record all stroke admissions, even those that occurred on days or times outside of the set screening periods.</p><p>For recruited patients, stroke severity was measured using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> by accredited staff and then categorised into mild (NIHSS 1&#x02013;7), moderate (NIHSS 8&#x02013;16) and severe (NIHSS &#x0003e;16),<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> which were used to stratify patients in each group. To minimise the burden on recruiting staff, we did not require completion of a full NIHSS on patients who were excluded. Instead, the same trained staff were asked to estimate whether the patient would be likely to have an NIHSS score in the &#x02018;mild&#x02019;, &#x02018;moderate&#x02019; or &#x02018;severe&#x02019; range.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Data management and statistical analysis</title><p>We summarised the characteristics of the participating sites involved in the trial. Data presented include: number of stroke admissions, number of beds and whether the site was in a metropolitan or regional location.</p><p>To meet the goals of objective 1, we summarised the demographic and clinical factors from all patients with stroke, including those who were recruited and those screened but not recruited. We intended to compare our data with both population-based data and data from other acute stroke trials in which demographic data are generally described in more detail. However, as many acute stroke trials have pharmacological interventions, the inclusion criteria were typically more narrow compared with AVERT.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> We therefore compared demographic and clinical factors against world stroke data. We used epidemiological data from Feigin <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> where available, with gender and stroke severity from the Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive (VISTA).<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> We report 95% CIs, where available, in sample data to allow a broad comparison with population data. Differences in demographics between recruited versus non-recruited patients were examined using the Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney U test for continuous data (age) and Fisher's exact test for categorical data.</p><p>To explore differences between recruited and non-recruited patients (objective 2), we systematically examined the association between patient demographic and clinical factors (ie, age, gender, stroke severity, stroke type) and patient recruitment or non-recruitment. We used a random-effect multilevel logistic regression model with patient factors as independent variables, the recruitment status as the dependent variable, and treating site as a level variable. This enabled us to assess the association between demographic and stroke-related factors and the odds of recruitment in all patients. In a second set of analyses, using the same model, we explored each individual reason for non-recruitment in turn. We systematically compared the recruited patients to those not recruited due to a specific reason, and explored demographic and clinical factors associated with recruitment versus non-recruitment due to each given reason (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015008378F3">figure 3</xref>, analysis 1). We report the estimated adjusted ORs of being recruited compared with the reference of non-recruitment for each specific reason (eg, the odds of being recruited vs non-recruitment due to late arrival). ORs&#x0003e;1 indicate the increased likelihood of recruitment and ORs&#x0003c;1 indicate the increased likelihood of non-recruitment due to that reason.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2015008378F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Methods of explorative analysis using the first reason for non-recruitment (arrived after 24&#x02005;h) as an example. Bold boxes indicate data grouping. Analyses were repeated for all 10 reasons for non-recruitment, with four patient demographic and clinical factors. Trial site and month of trial were controlled for in each analysis (ICU, intensive care unit; mRS, modified Rankin Scale).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2015008378f03"/></fig><p>A similar random-effect multilevel logistic regression approach was also used to more closely examine the association between patient demographic factors and specific reasons for non-recruitment (objective 3). In this analysis, for each reason in turn, we systematically compared the patients not recruited due to each reason to the patients not recruited for all other reasons combined (eg, non-recruitment due to late arrival, vs non-recruitment for all other reasons; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015008378F3">figure 3</xref>, analysis 2). ORs&#x0003e;1 indicate the increased likelihood of non-recruitment due to a specific reason and ORs&#x0003c;1 indicate the decreased likelihood of non-recruitment due to that reason.</p><p>All statistical analyses were performed using STATA-IC.</p><p>To achieve objective 4, we examined the heterogeneity in the individual reasons for non-recruitment between recruiting sites and countries, as well as the effect of the time on recruitment patterns. The between-centre and between-country heterogeneity was estimated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) generated by the respective random-effect logistic regression models. In this analysis, England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales were treated as individual countries, resulting in eight countries included in the analysis. The possible values of ICC are between 0% and 100%. The ICC value indicates the proportion of the variance in the propensity of a specific outcome that can be attributed to sites or countries (eg, the proportion of the variance in the propensity of being non-recruited due to late arrival as opposed to other reasons that can be attributed to sites). In other words, higher values of the ICC signify larger between-site heterogeneity and lower values are indicative of the lower influence of site-specific or country-specific factors on recruitment patterns.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Site characteristics</title><p>Of the 44 sites recruiting, most sites included were metropolitan (n=37), with 6 regional and 1 rural. The number of admissions per year ranged from 33 to 793. Ward size (number of beds open at the time of review) ranged from 8 to 77, with between 1 and 54 dedicated stroke beds. All sites had a geographically defined stroke unit, a coordinated multidisciplinary stroke team and access to a CT scanner, with 20 sites having onsite access to neurosurgery. Eleven sites were classified as a stand-alone stroke unit, whereas the majority of sites (n=33) had dedicated stroke beds within a larger neurology or mixed medical ward. One site described itself as following an intensive care model, 22 as acute stroke unit models and 21 as comprehensive stroke unit models. Patients were screened between July 2006 and December 2011.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Sample characteristics of recruited and non-recruited patients</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015008378TB1">Table&#x000a0;1</xref> presents demographic and stroke characteristics for non-recruited and recruited patients.

Older patients were less likely to be excluded because of admission to an ICU than they were to be recruited. In contrast, they were more likely to be excluded (than recruited) because of prior disability, early deterioration or because they were missed. Having an intracerebral haemorrhage meant that the patients were less likely to be excluded (than recruited) because they were already involved in another trial, or had a coronary condition. In contrast, patients with intracerebral haemorrhage were more likely to be excluded than recruited because they deteriorated early, failed physiological criteria or were admitted directly to the ICU. Patients with severe strokes were more likely to be recruited than arrive late (and be excluded). Women were less likely to be recruited than men for all of the exclusion criteria. In other words, they were more likely to be excluded due to premorbid disability, a coronary condition, early deterioration, late arrival, refusing participation or being missed by

The most common reason for non-recruitment was late arrival to hospital (ie, &#x0003e;24&#x02005;h), but being older and female also reduced the odds of recruitment to the trial. Our findings indicate that women had much greater odds of premorbid disability, were more likely to arrive late to hospital, were more likely to have early deterioration and fail the physiological safety criteria. The odds of exclusion due to early deterioration were particularly high for those with severe stroke. When looking at the between-site heterogeneity in the reasons for non-recruitment, the variability was highest for participation in another trial, admission to ICU and refusal to participate. These observations fit with expected variations in trial activity given that sites are likely to have different competing trials, different ICU admission protocols and different trials experience.</p><p>The lower proportion of women recruited to this trial is consistent with the acute stroke trials literature.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;23</xref> Sex disparities in stroke epidemiology, pathophysiology, treatment and outcomes are well documented in the stroke literature.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Stroke affects a greater number of women in old age,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> largely because women have greater longevity and stroke which more commonly occurs in older people. Women are also more likely to be disabled at the time of their stroke.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Previous stroke disability is a major reason for exclusion from this study for the pragmatic need to optimise the number of patients able to contribute to the primary outcome, independence (score 0&#x02013;2) on the mRS. While the intervention (rehabilitation) could potentially be suitable or even beneficial for patients with pre-existing disability, the chance of a participant with premorbid disability moving from being disabled (mRS&#x0003e;2) to having a good outcome is low. Our observation that women tended to have a delayed arrival to hospital has been reported in a number of studies examining prehospital delay, although this is not a uniform finding.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The most common explanation for this delayed arrival time is that more women than men live alone in older age and arrival times are faster when a stroke is witnessed by another person.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> It is also possible that poorer recruitment of women reflects an unconscious bias on the part of the recruiter, in favour of recruiting men. Nevertheless, we have found significant relationships that help to explain the phenomenon.</p><p>In many acute stroke trials, intracerebral haemorrhage is an exclusion criterion.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In the VISTA trials database,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> 6% of patients have haemorrhagic stroke, which is at the lower limit of estimates for the proportion of stroke due to haemorrhage from international epidemiological data.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> We were pleased to note that this group was well represented in our trial. Once again, where these patients were excluded, the reasons for their exclusion were strongly aligned with what we already know about this stroke subgroup: early deterioration, failed physiological criteria and ICU admission. The sudden onset of the haemorrhage is often dramatic, resulting in rapid transport to hospital (ie, they are less likely to arrive within 24&#x02005;h poststroke). Patients with intracerebral haemorrhage often experience early deterioration within hours of stroke and have greater mortality. Therefore, it is not uncommon for these patients to be managed in the ICU rather than on the general stroke unit.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Patients with intracerebral haemorrhage were also less likely to be excluded because of a coronary condition and less likely to be recruited to another trial, again consistent with current evidence.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p><p>One of the unexpected barriers to recruitment to this trial has been the significant proportion of patients who were ineligible because they arrived late to hospital. This, rather than clinical characteristics of potential patients, was the major barrier. This should be considered a modifiable exclusion variable. Delay in hospital admission has implications for delivery of proven stroke therapies such as thrombolysis. There were surprisingly few data from sources, such as local stroke registries or large clinical trials, with a 24&#x02005;h window, to inform our estimates. Studies of thrombolysis, often from single centres, indicated that between 25% and 59% of patients arrive within 3&#x02005;h of stroke, with older age, ethnicity and gender (females) influencing arrival time.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The large proportion of patients delaying arrival to hospital resulted in the need to enrol a larger number of trial sites than originally planned, and this, in turn, extended the duration of the trial. Fortunately, the duration of a site's participation in the trial appeared to have little impact on the reasons for exclusion and variability between sites was generally low. When variation was observed by site (eg, ICU admission greater in some centres than others), it was easily explained by different care models and processes across the participating hospitals. For example, in some hospitals, it is routine for patients experiencing severe stroke to be admitted to the ICU, while in most hospitals these patients will be managed in the stroke unit. Variability in recruitment to other trials is also readily explained by the fact that some teaching hospitals conduct a large number of trials, while in smaller sites, AVERT was the only active trial in the stroke unit.</p><p>The strengths of our study include a large, international data set, collected over several years, that is relevant to the conduct of broad, pragmatic trials. Second, we have used a conceptual framework<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> to explore a broader range of factors than those commonly examined in reports of external validity.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> We believe that this analytic approach shows promise and encourages a more in-depth exploration of the reasons why different patients are excluded. In the case of AVERT, with the exception of delayed arrival to hospital, most exclusions appeared to be a direct consequence of the trial question or related safety concerns.</p><p>The main weakness of our study is that, as a consequence of this being a large pragmatic trial, we have relatively limited information on each patient screened for eligibility for inclusion in the trial. Further, screening log data were only checked against source data at site visits, which occurred on average once per year. The data manager monitored variations in screening log data on a more regular basis directly with site investigators, and all noted variations were followed up. Data were collected by different staff across eight countries, although all used the same standardised data collection form for screening. It is also important to remember that a large data set may demonstrate statistical significance where it is of little practical importance.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p><p>A common complaint of clinicians is uncertainty about the external validity of trial results.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Our understanding of the external validity of RCTs could be improved by routine and standardised exploration of the critical drivers of exclusion from trials in different settings and conditions. In the current CONSORT statement, external validity is discussed, but there are no clear recommendations for reporting.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> If an agreed framework for examining external validity could be found, standard recommendations could form part of future CONSORT statements, thereby increasing the practical value of clinical trial data reported.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study using data obtained in AVERT, we have demonstrated that a model of exploring generalisability that considers people, places and processes of care can provide important information about the external validity of a trial. This approach could be applied to other trial populations, but trialists would need to identify and plan for the collection of appropriate variables.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Twitter:</bold> Follow Julie Bernhardt at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/AVERTtrial">@AVERTtrial</ext-link></p></fn><fn><p><bold>Collaborators:</bold> The AVERT Trialists&#x02019; Collaboration: Available at the Lancet <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60690-0">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60690-0</ext-link>.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> JB designed the trial, interpreted the data, and drafted and revised the paper.
