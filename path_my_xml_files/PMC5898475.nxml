EFs are a group of cognitive skills required for purposeful goal directed activity <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. EFs are largely mediated by the prefrontal cortex <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The maturation of the prefrontal cortex networks underlies the development of EFs, which can be disrupted by the onset of an acquired brain injury (ABI) during childhood or adolescence <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Impairments in executive functions are often the core deficit in children with difficult behaviour problems <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p id="p0015">Behaviour problems are associated with deficits in self-regulation <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.

SR is composed of 3 dimensions: emotional SR, cognitive SR and behavioural SR <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.

Cognitive SR includes stopping an initial automatic response, interrupting an ongoing response when it is ineffective and protecting self-directed responses from distraction <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.

The parenting programme &#x0201c;Signposts for building better behaviour&#x0201d; (Signposts) teaches parents general skills to help them manage their child's behaviour <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Signposts has demonstrated efficacy in preventing and reducing challenging behaviour in Australian children with ABI and improving parental well-being <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

The researcher conducting the data analysis is not blind to participant identity and allocation. The assessments pre, post and follow up are done by blind assessors. Volunteer-student psychologists, previously trained in the assessment instruments, conduct the assessments under supervision. All of them had a minimum of three years study in the Psychology area and received a 25-h training in which they learned to apply and grade the measures. The assessors give the questionnaires to the parents, assessed the child and score the tests and questionnaires. They are not aware of group allocation and they do not participate in the intervention. All the participants receive Signposts or weekly phone calls. Participants are aware to which study arm they have been allocated because the phone calls focus on academic skills and not on behavior problems. In addition, participants in the CG know that they will be offered the Signposts intervention after completion of the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.8"><label>3.8</label><title>Intervention procedures</title><sec id="sec3.8.1"><label>3.8.1</label><title>Signposts for building better behavior</title><p id="p0070">Signposts is a manualized parenting program that aims to develop skills in parents to improve behavior.

The main researcher is delivering the sessions, and in each session another clinician is present to provide individualized support in the event that it is needed. Signposts consists of a Workbook, a DVD, and 9 manual modules.

This protocol paper explains the consequences of early onset of ABI and the importance of an intervention with a Mexican population. This protocol aims to investigate the effectiveness of an evidenced-based parenting program in improving child behavior, child SR, parenting practices, parenting sense of competence and reducing parenting stress compared to telephone support with a Mexican population. The design for this study is a blind Randomized Controlled Trial in order to provide a high level of evidence. Often, interventions are compared to care as usual, however comparison to telephone support will control for interaction with a clinician. In addition, having a comparison group allows us to control for spontaneous recovery that occurs after brain injury. Furthermore, we have measures completed by parents and teachers, as well as and tasks performed by the child, allowing us to examine whether any changes in behavior are transferred to the school environment.</p><p id="p0195">To our knowledge this is the first study to examine the effectiveness of a parenting program for parents of children with ABI in a Hispanic population.
