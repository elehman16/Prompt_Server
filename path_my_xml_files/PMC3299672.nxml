Few interventions aim to improve maternal and infant health through improving such capacity. Multiple micronutrient (MMN) supplementation may improve maternal cognition and mood, since micronutrients are essential for brain function. We assessed mothers who participated in the Supplementation with Multiple Micronutrients Intervention Trial (SUMMIT), a double-blind cluster-randomized trial in Indonesia comparing MMN supplementation to iron and folic acid (IFA) during pregnancy and until three months postpartum. We adapted a set of well-studied tests of cognition, motor dexterity, and mood to the local context and administered them to a random sample of 640 SUMMIT participants after an average of 25 weeks (SD&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;9) of supplementation. Analysis was by intention to treat. Controlling for maternal age, education, and socio-economic status, MMN resulted in a benefit of 0.12 <italic>SD</italic> on overall cognition, compared to IFA (<italic>95&#x00025;CI</italic> 0.03&#x02013;0.22, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.010), and a benefit of 0.18 <italic>SD</italic> on reading efficiency (<italic>95&#x00025;CI</italic> 0.02&#x02013;0.35, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.031). Both effects were found particularly in anemic (hemoglobin&#x0003c;110 g/L; overall cognition: <italic>B</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.20, 0.00&#x02013;0.41, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.055; reading: <italic>B</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.40, 0.02&#x02013;0.77, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.039) and undernourished (mid-upper arm circumference&#x0003c;23.5 cm; overall cognition: <italic>B</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.33, 0.07&#x02013;0.59, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.020; reading: <italic>B</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.65, 0.19&#x02013;1.12, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.007) mothers. The benefit of MMN on overall cognition was equivalent to the benefit of one year of education for all mothers, to two years of education for anemic mothers, and to three years of education for undernourished mothers. No effects were found on maternal motor dexterity or mood. This is the first study demonstrating an improvement in maternal cognition with MMN supplementation. This improvement may increase the quality of care mothers provide for their infants, potentially partly mediating effects of maternal MMN supplementation on infant health and survival.

Factors underlying the effectiveness of maternal caregiving include knowledge, such as signs of illness and actions necessary, perceiving and processing the observed situation, reasoning and decision-making, and monitoring the effectiveness of decisions in order to adapt to future situations. Although some interventions focus on promoting health knowledge, the possibility of improving infant health and survival by targeting these other skills essential for effective caregiving has received little attention. One way to improve these skills may be to improve the cognitive abilities that underlie and influence them, such as attention, memory, and mood.</p><p>Maternal multiple micronutrient (MMN) supplementation is one intervention that is likely to improve maternal cognition and mood, since micronutrients are essential for brain function (see below). Maternal MMN supplementation has been found to reduce the risk of low birthweight <xref rid="pone.0032519-Fall1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> and early infant mortality (&#x0003c;90 days after birth) <xref rid="pone.0032519-SUMMIT1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> in developing countries, including Indonesia. The mechanisms of these effects are not yet fully understood. They may be partly due to factors such as improved placental development and improved transfer of nutrients to the fetus with MMN supplementation. These effects may also be partly due to neurological effects of MMN in pregnant and postpartum mothers, which may improve cognition and mood and therefore maternal caregiving capacity. For example, improved cognition and/or mood may promote maternal reasoning and decision-making, attentive and appropriate caregiving, and understanding of health information. Therefore, part of the effect of MMN supplementation on infant outcomes may be mediated by improvements in maternal cognition and mood, thereby increasing a mother's ability to care for herself and her infant.</p><p>The positive relationship between maternal education and infant and child health and survival <xref rid="pone.0032519-Bicego1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032519-Charmarbagwala1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> highlights the importance of maternal capacity for children's health. Cognition improves with increasing years of education <xref rid="pone.0032519-Ceci1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The increased cognitive capacity of more highly educated mothers may be the crucial factor that allows them to care more effectively for their children, thus promoting their health and survival. In support of this argument, higher maternal intelligence, independent of education, also reduces the risk of infant mortality <xref rid="pone.0032519-Sandiford1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and infant malnutrition <xref rid="pone.0032519-Anoop1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, as well as morbidity and poor physical growth in school age children <xref rid="pone.0032519-Bhargava1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032519-Rubalcava1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Higher maternal intelligence is also associated with positive caregiving behavior, such as more extensive and longer duration of breast feeding <xref rid="pone.0032519-Jacobson1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and higher quality dietary intake in infants and toddlers, even after controlling for family socio-economic status and maternal education <xref rid="pone.0032519-Wachs1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032519-Wachs2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032519-Bhargava2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Maternal caregiving practices are also associated with maternal mood, for example, reduced preference for breastfeeding <xref rid="pone.0032519-Galler1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and less sensitive mother-infant interaction <xref rid="pone.0032519-Murray1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> in mothers with depressive symptoms.</p><p>Although child health outcomes have been linked to measures of global maternal intelligence in the studies mentioned above, here, we focus on underlying cognitive abilities (e.g., declarative memory, attention and working memory, visuospatial ability; see below) for several reasons. First, intelligence depends in part on these specific functions, and assessing specific abilities allows analysis on both overall cognition and performance on specific tests. Second, we selected tests that have been linked to particular brain structures and mechanisms likely to be affected by micronutrient deficiency and other factors (see Method). For example, zinc plays an important role in brain areas (the hippocampus) and mechanisms (NMDA receptors) that subserve declarative memory <xref rid="pone.0032519-Fredericksen1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, which underlies learning facts, events and words <xref rid="pone.0032519-Squire1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032519-Ullman1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline synthesis all depend on iron, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and folic acid <xref rid="pone.0032519-Beard1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032519-Mackey1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032519-Rosenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Dopamine activity in the frontal lobes and basal ganglia plays a role in working memory (the temporary storage and manipulation of items), attention, executive function (the control and management of cognitive processes), and motor control <xref rid="pone.0032519-Nieoullon1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032519-Willingham1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Noradrenaline is also important for attention, and both noradrenaline and serotonin are implicated in mood disorders <xref rid="pone.0032519-Stahl1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Thus, deficiencies in these micronutrients may affect these particular cognitive functions.</p><p>With these potential mechanisms in mind, the present study was designed to examine the effects of the Supplementation with Multiple Micronutrients Intervention Trial (SUMMIT) on both overall maternal cognitive ability and specific cognitive functions. SUMMIT was a double-blind cluster-randomized trial carried out on the Indonesian island of Lombok by the University of Mataram, the Government of Nusa Tenggara Barat Province, the Ministry of Health of Indonesia, and Helen Keller International, comparing maternal MMN supplementation to iron and folic acid (IFA) <xref rid="pone.0032519-SUMMIT1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. We investigated the maternal cognitive outcomes of SUMMIT first for overall cognitive ability, calculated over the combined scores from the tests of the specific cognitive functions, and second for each individual test in the battery, which included tests of declarative memory, attention and working memory, mental rotation, category fluency, speeded picture naming, and reading efficiency, as well as motor dexterity and mood. Additionally, we examined the effects of MMN in two pre-specified subgroups of participants who had shown especially large reductions in early infant mortality from MMN supplementation <xref rid="pone.0032519-SUMMIT1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>: those who were undernourished at enrollment (mid-upper arm circumference &#x0003c;23.5 cm) and those who were anemic at enrollment (hemoglobin concentration &#x0003c;110 g/L).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>SUMMIT Design</title><p>The design and procedures of SUMMIT are reported in detail elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0032519-SUMMIT1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, and are only summarized here. The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT Checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0032519.s002">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0032519.s001">Protocol S1</xref>. Pregnant women throughout the Indonesian island of Lombok were enrolled in SUMMIT from July, 2001 to April, 2004. Enrollment took place at local pre-natal care clinics run by midwives trained and employed by the Indonesian Ministry of Health. SUMMIT staff attended these clinics and reviewed the informed consent form with women upon confirmation of pregnancy. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Consenting women received a daily supplement throughout the duration of pregnancy and until three months post-partum. Midwives were randomly assigned to distribute either MMN or IFA; thus, all women who received pre-natal care from the same midwife received the same supplement. The contents of both supplements are reported in supporting information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0032519.s003">Appendix S1</xref>. All supplements were coded at the manufacturing plant; hence all SUMMIT scientists and personnel, government staff, and participants were unaware of the allocation of MMN and IFA. Ethical approval for the study protocol and informed consent form was obtained from the National Institute of Health Research and Development of the Ministry of Health of Indonesia, the Provincial Planning Department of Nusa Tenggara Barat Province, and the Johns Hopkins Joint Committee on Clinical Investigation, Baltimore, USA. The study is registered as an International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN34151616 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN34151616">http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN34151616</ext-link>).</p><p>Blood samples were drawn both before and after supplementation in a random subsample of 2,369 SUMMIT participants. This subsample was divided into four groups, each of which provided a blood sample at enrollment in SUMMIT and at one of four subsequent time points: one month after enrollment, 36 weeks of gestation, one week post-partum, and 12 weeks post-partum. Participants in the subsample were targeted to participate in cognitive testing.

Test instructions were translated from English to Indonesian, and printed on the testing forms in Indonesian, the medium of academic (and literacy) instruction in Lombok; this allowed the testers to read the instructions comfortably and translate them slightly differently into various dialects of Sasak as they were testing. Test stimuli, consisting of words and pictures, were developed through various surveys. For example, a dialect survey was conducted to confirm that the Sasak word stimuli in the Word List Memory Test and Speeded Picture Naming Test were the same across all dialects of Sasak. In addition, subjective frequency and imageability (how easily a mental picture can be generated) ratings were gathered to arrange and balance items within tests, for example to ensure that the target list of the Word List Memory Test included some high frequency, highly imageable words that would be easy to remember (e.g. <italic>oil</italic>) and some lower frequency and imageability words that would be more difficult to remember (e.g. <italic>opponent</italic>).</p></sec><sec id="s2d2"><title>Reliability testing</title><p>A series of pilot tests was conducted in order to adapt and revise the instructions, items and procedures of the tests for use in Lombok, as well as to determine whether or not each test was suitable for the local context. Some tests, which are not discussed here, were piloted and discarded because of low test-retest reliability or lack of feasibility under the testing conditions in rural villages.</p><p>The final version of each test was evaluated for three types of reliability: test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and inter-tester reliability. To evaluate test-retest reliability, three certified testers (see below), each administering one of the three sets of tests (see below), were assigned to visit a group of participants (ranging from 9 to 18) twice (the average time between visits was 4 days, ranging from 2&#x02013;16 days).

In addition to the tests listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0032519-t001">Table 1</xref>, tests of near vision, distance vision, and audition were also administered, further lengthening the test session. Most participants scored at ceiling on these tests, precluding meaningful analysis, therefore the data from these tests are not reported here. To reduce the length of the test session, we divided the tests into three sets: X (Word List Memory and Digit Span Forward and Backward), Y (Category Fluency, Coin Rotation, and Mood Scale) and Z (Speeded Picture Naming, Reading Efficiency, and Mental Rotation), and administered two sets to each participant. Two testers administered sets X and Y to 136 participants (21&#x00025;), three testers administered sets X and Z to 333 (52&#x00025;), and two testers administered sets Y and Z to 171 (27&#x00025;). Different numbers of testers administering each test led to unequal numbers of participants in each group.</p></sec><sec id="s2e3"><title>Quality control</title><p>All test sessions, which were conducted at participants' homes, were audio-recorded, and the tapes and forms reviewed in three steps. First, the tape was reviewed by the tester who administered the tests, in order to complete and check the form. Second, the tape was reviewed by a different tester who had not been present at testing, who corrected any further discrepancies between the tape and the form. Third, 10&#x00025; of the tapes and corresponding forms were reviewed by a supervisor (the first author) to ensure the quality of the testers' work, which was in fact consistently high. The data was then entered into SPSS. Every form was double-entered and any discrepancies were corrected.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><sec id="s2f1"><title>Group characteristic comparisons</title><p>Participants who received MMN were compared to those receiving IFA on the following baseline characteristics (i.e., at enrollment): age (years), education (completed years of formal education), and three indicators of nutritional status (height in cm, mid-upper arm circumference &#x0003c;23.5 cm, and hemoglobin concentration &#x0003c;110 g/L, based on capillary blood from finger prick). The two groups were also compared on an index of socio-economic status, derived from a survey administered at baseline concerning whether or not the family owned certain household items. Out of a total of twelve items, four items were discarded that did not correlate with the total (owned a horsecart, a boat, a house, and a vendor's pushcart; <italic>r</italic>s&#x0003c;.1). Two items were also eliminated due to low variability (only six participants owned a car and four owned a satellite dish). Removing these six items improved <italic>Cronbach's Alpha</italic> from 0.49 to 0.59, The six remaining items (owned a radio, a TV, a refrigerator, a bike, a motorbike, and a small sales business) were summed for a total score. This score was coded as a multinomial variable with four levels: 0, 1, 2 and &#x0003e;2.</p><p>In addition, the two groups were compared on the amount of time between enrollment and cognitive testing (in weeks); mean compliance in taking the supplement (percentage of supplements consumed); when the participant was tested (first, second, or third trimester, or after birth); hours of sleep in the 24 hours before testing; and the set of tests given to the participant (XY, XZ, or YZ). Comparisons between the two groups were made for all participants for whom this information was available.</p><p>For the continuous variables, the difference between participants who received IFA and MMN was estimated in mixed effects models using SAS PROC MIXED. Mixed effects models are similar to multiple regression models, but allow for the specification of both fixed and random effects. The model was specified with a fixed effect of supplement type and a random effect of midwife code on intercept. This random effect was included in all analyses since the randomization of IFA and MMN was allocated by midwife rather than by individual participant; specification of midwife code as a random effect accounts for any variation between midwife clusters <xref rid="pone.0032519-Wears1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. All statistical analyses using SAS PROC MIXED (here and below) were estimated using an unstructured covariance structure, and degrees of freedom were estimated using the Satterthwaite method <xref rid="pone.0032519-Satterthwaite1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. For the multinomial variables, the difference was estimated in generalized linear models using SAS PROC GENMOD with midwife code as a repeated measure, with a multinomial distribution, and with the cumlogit link function. For the binomial variables, the difference was estimated using SAS PROC GENMOD with midwife code as a repeated measure, and with a binomial distribution and the log link function.</p></sec><sec id="s2f2"><title>Overall cognition</title><p>The analysis of the effects of MMN on overall cognition included all cognitive test scores (i.e., without the tests of motor ability and mood): Word List Memory, Digit Span Forward and Backward, Mental Rotation, Category Fluency, Speeded Picture Naming, and Reading Efficiency. The timed tests (Speeded Picture Naming and Reading Efficiency) resulted in skewed distributions. These scores were reciprocal transformed, reducing skewness (to &#x0003c;1) and changing the direction of the scores to match the other scores (higher is better). For all other tests, skewness &#x0003c;1. For each test score, <italic>z</italic>-scores were computed based on the distribution of all participants in this study. Rather than averaging the <italic>z</italic>-scores for each participant, all test <italic>z</italic>-scores from every participant were entered as the dependent variable in a nested mixed effects model with random effects of both midwife code and participant on intercept.

Among anemic women, the increase in cognition due to MMN (<italic>B</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.20) was roughly equivalent to two years of education (2&#x0002a;0.11&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.22), and among the undernourished women (<italic>B</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.33), to three years of education (3&#x0002a;0.11&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.33). No effects of MMN were found on maternal mood.</p><p>This is the first study showing a benefit of MMN supplementation on cognition during pregnancy and postpartum. Only two previous studies have examined the effect of micronutrient supplementation on cognitive outcomes in pregnant or postpartum women, and only one of these was conducted in a developing country. Both studies focused on the effects of supplementary iron and both were limited to small sample sizes. Groner, Holtzman, Charney, and Mellits <xref rid="pone.0032519-Groner1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> found that 16 American inner-city pregnant teenagers who received one month of supplementation with iron and vitamins significantly improved in tests of attention and declarative memory, while nine who received vitamins without iron did not improve on any test scores. A second study examined postpartum women in a poor peri-urban South African community. After six months, 30 anemic mothers who received folate and vitamin C with iron significantly improved in tests of reasoning and attention, while 21 anemic mothers who received folate and vitamin C without iron did not improve on either test <xref rid="pone.0032519-Beard2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Here, we have shown that in a larger sample of mothers MMN supplementation resulted in further cognitive benefits over and above any benefit of IFA, suggesting that micronutrients other than iron and folic acid are also critical for maternal cognition.</p><p>Although the present study was limited to pregnant and postpartum women in Lombok, the cognitive benefits of MMN might extend to other populations as well, especially elderly adults and children, who have been the focus of most previous research investigating micronutrients and cognition. Studies in these populations have reported positive concurrent associations between micronutrient status and overall cognitive function, <xref rid="pone.0032519-Selhub1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032519-Lozoff1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> as well as many of the specific abilities tested in the present study <xref rid="pone.0032519-RobinsWahlin1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032519-Louwman1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. However, the results of randomized trials have been inconsistent. Two recent systematic reviews of randomized trials of multiple micronutrient supplementation in adults age 65 and over <xref rid="pone.0032519-Jia1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and children age 0&#x02013;18 <xref rid="pone.0032519-Eilander1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> each found little evidence for cognitive benefits of MMN and concluded that additional methodologically sound large scale trials are needed. Given the findings here, in future studies, it may be important to examine subgroups of participants who are undernourished or anemic in order to detect substantial effects on cognition. In the meta-analysis by Eliander, Gera, Sachdev et al. <xref rid="pone.0032519-Eilander1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> the pooled estimate for the effect of MMN on fluid intelligence in children age 5&#x02013;16 was 0.14 <italic>SD</italic> (95&#x00025; CI: &#x02212;0.02, 0.29; <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.083), which is almost identical to the effect of MMN on overall cognition found here (0.12 <italic>SD</italic>), suggesting that an effect of this magnitude may be expected even without focusing on subgroups of undernourished or anemic individuals.</p><p>In contrast to its positive effects on cognition, MMN showed no evidence of improving maternal motor dexterity or mood scores. In fact, mood scores were non-significantly lower in the MMN group than the IFA group, suggesting that enhanced mood cannot account for the positive effects of MMN on cognition. More generally, the finding that MMN did not enhance mood contributes to the literature examining the effects of maternal micronutrient supplementation on mood, in particular because the null effect observed here was found in the context of significant positive effects on cognition. Although the pattern reported here is different from two studies that found fewer depressive symptoms with maternal MMN supplementation <xref rid="pone.0032519-SmithFawzi1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032519-Frith1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, it is consistent with the results of another study that did not find effects of maternal iron supplementation on postpartum depression, anxiety, or stress <xref rid="pone.0032519-Beard2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. It remains to be seen whether future studies also suggest that maternal MMN supplementation fails to benefit mood during pregnancy or to alleviate postpartum depression.</p><p>The pattern of the benefit of MMN on cognition across all participants and in subgroups of anemic and undernourished mothers is consistent with the pattern of effects on early infant mortality reported by the SUMMIT Study Group <xref rid="pone.0032519-SUMMIT1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Early infant mortality was reduced by 18&#x00025; with maternal MMN supplementation over all mothers, by 38&#x00025; for anemic mothers, and by 25&#x00025; for undernourished mothers. Similarly, cognition was improved by the equivalent of one year of education over all mothers, two years of education for anemic mothers, and three years of education for undernourished mothers. These findings are consistent with the idea that improvements in infant survival may be partly mediated by improvements in maternal cognition.</p><p>The potential effect of improved maternal cognition on infant survival can be inferred from the relationship between maternal education and cognition reported here and the relationship between maternal education and infant mortality reported in other studies. Based on data from 175 countries, every one-year increase in education among women of reproductive age from 1970 to 2009 was associated with a reduction in infant mortality of 9.5&#x00025; <xref rid="pone.0032519-Gakidou1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. One mechanism through which maternal education may improve child health is through improving maternal cognition <xref rid="pone.0032519-Wachs3" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Since the improvement in maternal cognition with MMN supplementation observed here was equivalent to one year of education, it is plausible that up to 9.5&#x00025; of the 18&#x00025; reduction in infant mortality with MMN was due to improvement in maternal cognition. Likewise, since the effect of MMN on cognition was equivalent to two and three years of education for anemic and undernourished mothers, respectively, up to 19&#x00025; of the 38&#x00025; reduction in mortality in infants of anemic mothers might be attributed to improvements in maternal cognition, and possibly all of the 25&#x00025; reduction in undernourished mothers. However, these numbers remain highly speculative. Moreover, factors other than cognition may also play a part in the reduction in infant mortality with maternal education, such as increased use of health services and increased maternal autonomy and input into family decisions in higher educated mothers <xref rid="pone.0032519-Wachs3" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032519-Cleland1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p><p>Further studies are needed to clarify the links between maternal interventions, maternal cognition, specific caregiving behaviors, and infant mortality, as well as other aspects of child health. For example, the benefit of maternal MMN supplementation on cognition reported here may partly mediate the effects of maternal MMN supplementation on subsequent physical growth (weight, head circumference, and mid-upper arm circumference) that have been observed at age 2.5 years <xref rid="pone.0032519-Vaidya1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> and the improvements in subsequent motor and mental development that have been observed in infants of mothers given MMN <xref rid="pone.0032519-McGrath1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032519-Tofail1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032519-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Several lines of evidence suggest that this is an important and promising area of study.</p><p>First, improving cognition in pregnant women seems particularly desirable given that this is a crucial period for acquiring knowledge and skills that are needed for child health and survival, such as health-seeking behaviors and child-care practices, and that many women experience cognitive changes during pregnancy. Subjective experiences such as increased absentmindedness and forgetfulness during pregnancy have been consistently reported <xref rid="pone.0032519-Casey1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032519-Brindle1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032519-Poser1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032519-Sharp1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032519-McDowell1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Deficits in pregnant or postpartum women compared to non-pregnant controls on tests of cognition, including tests of declarative memory and verbal fluency, have also been reported <xref rid="pone.0032519-Sharp1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032519-DeGroot1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032519-DeGroot2" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, though not in all studies <xref rid="pone.0032519-McDowell1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032519-Casey2" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032519-Christensen1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032519-Crawley1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032519-Christensen2" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Cognitive changes during pregnancy may be explained by several mechanisms, including changes in hormone levels <xref rid="pone.0032519-Buckwalter1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, mood alterations <xref rid="pone.0032519-Evans1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, and psychological adjustment to a major life change, which may interfere with normal cognitive processing <xref rid="pone.0032519-Crawley1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Independent of the mechanisms of cognitive changes during pregnancy, improving cognition during this period through MMN supplementation or other means may facilitate memory of new health information and acquisition of caregiving skills.</p><p>Second, the benefit of maternal MMN supplementation on cognition reported here may extend to other maternal interventions as well. Two studies (discussed above) have shown improvements in cognition (attention, declarative memory, and reasoning) with iron supplementation during pregnancy or postpartum <xref rid="pone.0032519-Groner1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032519-Beard2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Treating parasitic infection during pregnancy and treating or preventing malaria may also improve maternal cognition, since both parasitic infection and malaria are associated with cognitive deficits in school children <xref rid="pone.0032519-Ezeamama1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032519-Jukes1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032519-Holding1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, although the cognitive effects of these interventions have not been studied during pregnancy and postpartum. Therefore, several maternal interventions that are known to improve child health are also likely to improve maternal cognition.</p><p>Third, supplementation with certain micronutrients may be more effective before rather than after conception. For example, folic acid supplementation before but not after conception prevents neural tube defects <xref rid="pone.0032519-Pitkin1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref> and iron supplementation before pregnancy has been found to improve maternal iron stores more than supplementation after pregnancy <xref rid="pone.0032519-Milman1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Our findings suggest that supplementation with multiple micronutrients during pre-conception care may confer the additional benefit of improving cognition in the mother as well as preparing micronutrient stores for the pregnancy.</p><p>Finally, maternal caregiving behavior is related to maternal intelligence, education, nutritional status, and health all of which are related to each other <xref rid="pone.0032519-Jacobson1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032519-Wachs1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032519-Winkvist1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. The UNICEF extended model of care specifies six categories of caregiver resources: knowledge and beliefs; health, nutritional status, and anemia; mental health and stress; control of resources and autonomy; workload and time constraints; and social support <xref rid="pone.0032519-Engle1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. According to the model, these caregiver resources interact with economic resources and health resources to determine caregiving behavior which in turn influences child survival, growth, and development. Very few studies have attempted to clarify the extent to which various caregiver resources interact with and affect each other in their influence on child health. The finding in the current study that maternal MMN supplementation improved maternal cognition suggests that such models can be further specified and empirically tested to advance our understanding of the effects of caregiver resources on child health and the mechanisms of the effects of maternal interventions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0032519.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>
