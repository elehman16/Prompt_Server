SHRs were randomly assigned to one of the 12 groups: untreated; DM monotherapy with 1, 5 or 25 mg/kg/day; amlodipine (AM, a calcium channel blocker) monotherapy with 1 or 5 mg/kg/day; and combination therapy of DM 1, 5 or 25 mg/kg/day with AM 1 or 5 mg/kg/day individually for 4 weeks. The <italic>in vitro</italic> effects of DM were also examined. In SHRs, AM monotherapy dose-dependently reduced arterial systolic BP. DM in various doses significantly and similarly reduced arterial systolic BP. Combination of DM with AM gave additive effects on BP reduction. DM, either alone or in combination with AM, improved aortic endothelial function indicated by <italic>ex vivo</italic> acetylcholine-induced relaxation. The combination of low-dose DM with AM gave most significant inhibition on aortic wall thickness in SHRs. Plasma total antioxidant status was significantly increased by all the therapies except for the combination of high-dose DM with high-dose AM.

Recent clinical trials suggested that the combination of low-dose CCBs and other medications with particular vascular protective effects might be an attractive alternative strategy especially for elderly hypertension.</p><p>It has been shown in both preclinical and clinical studies that during the development of hypertension, the production of superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) derived from NAD(P)H oxidase could be increased with age, which may counteract the enhanced nitric oxide (NO) production derived from inducible NO synthase and generate vasoconstrictor responses on aorta <xref rid="pone.0046067-Alvarez1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. It is then possible that the inhibition of vascular NAD(P)H oxidase may help to improve BP control as well as vascular protection in the presence of hypertension.</p><p>Dextromethorphan (DM) is a dextrorotatory morphinan, which has been widely used as a nonopioid cough suppressant for decades though the exact mechanisms are not clarified <xref rid="pone.0046067-Tortella1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Interestingly, previous studies using animal models of cerebral ischemia and hypoglycemic neural injuries have demonstrated the neuroprotective activity of DM <xref rid="pone.0046067-George1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0046067-Tortella2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, which might be related to its effects on NADPH oxidase since DM may effectively inhibit the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine <xref rid="pone.0046067-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. However, it was not known whether DM may provide additional cardiovascular protection to hypertension. Accordingly, this study was conducted to test the hypothesis that DM by inhibiting vascular NADPH oxidase may improve BP control and enhance vascular protection in aged hypertensive animals with or without standard antihypertensive treatment such as AM. The <italic>in vitro</italic> endothelial protection effects of DM were also examined. Our findings may provide some novel rationale to the alternative antihypertensive strategy especially for vascular protection in elderly hypertension.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>In vivo study</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>Animals and experimental design</title><p>In this study, the 18-week-old male Wistar&#x02013;Kyoto (WKY) rats were used as control group and the 18-week-old male spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHRs) as the study group.

The descending thoracic aorta was excised, freed of fat and connective tissue, cut into rings approximately 2&#x02013;3 mm in length, and placed in gassed (95% O2 and 5% CO2) Krebs&#x02013;Henseleit solution with the following composition. The tissues were maintained at 37.8&#x000b0;C under 2-g tension and equilibrated for 1 h before initiating the experimental protocols. During this period, the incubation medium was changed every 15 min. The vascular reactivity was measured in aortic rings with functional endothelium pre-contracted with submaximal concentrations of phenylephrine (10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> mol/l). Endothelium-dependent or endothelium-independent relaxation was evaluated with concentration response curves to acetylcholine (10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup> to 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> mol/l) or sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 10<sup>&#x02212;10</sup> to 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> mol/l), respectively. Relaxation was calculated as the percentage of precontractile vascular tone. The responses of the tissues were recorded using isometric transducers (Kishimoto Medical Instruments, Kyoto, Japan) and recorders (SEKONIC, Tokyo, Japan).

Accordingly, AM monotherapy may have dose-dependent BP lowering effects without significant vascular protection effects, which might be related to its adverse effects on vascular NO production. On the other hand, DM monotherapy, even in low dose, significantly reduced BP, improved endothelial function, and prevented aortic hypertrophy, which might be related to its <italic>in vivo</italic> as well as <italic>in vitro</italic> antioxidant effects on NADPH oxidase. Furthermore, the combination of low dose DM and AM may exert significant BP lowering and vascular protection effects in experimental hypertension. Our findings may give a rational to future implication of DM, either alone or in combination with AM, on clinical hypertension particularly in those patients with evidence of increased intravascular oxidative stress.</p><p>It is suggested that the relationship between ROS and hypertension occurs at the vascular level where oxidative stress induces endothelial dysfunction, vascular inflammation, increased vascular remodeling leading to increased peripheral resistance and elevated BP <xref rid="pone.0046067-Harrison1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. It was shown that antioxidant vitamines could reduce BP in some patients with diabetes or hypertension <xref rid="pone.0046067-Mullan1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The increase of antioxidant capacity would also improve endothelial function and hypertension <xref rid="pone.0046067-Widder1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Previous reports indicated that DM, by directly inhibiting NADPH oxidase activity and consequently decreasing superoxide production, could significantly reduce lipopolysaccharid-induced oxidative stress in microglial cells <xref rid="pone.0046067-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and in macrophage <xref rid="pone.0046067-Liu2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. However, such effects of DM are not dose-dependent <xref rid="pone.0046067-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046067-Liu2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In the present study, treatment of DM, either alone or in combination therapy, could increase TAO without altering plasma NOx level, suggesting its <italic>in vivo</italic> antioxidant effects in SHRs. There are also no dose-dependent effects of DM on TAO in current study. Furthermore, while low-dose DM therapy significantly reduced BP, higher doses of DM either alone or in combination therapy did not further reduce BP. Taken together, low dose rather than high dose of DM could reduce BP in experimental hypertension, which might be related to the specific <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of DM on vascular NADPH oxidase. Future investigations are required to define the optimal dose of DM before it could be used for clinical hypertension.</p><p>Although the physiological and pathophysiological inducers may be complicated and remain poorly defined, intravascular ROS could be theoretically produced by many enzymes including xanthine oxidoreductase, uncouple nitric oxide synthase, and NADPH oxidase <xref rid="pone.0046067-Nishino1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0046067-DeLano1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Besides, decreased antioxidant capacity may also promote oxidative stress and enhance cardiovascular and renal oxidative damage associated with hypertension. <xref rid="pone.0046067-Gongora1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046067-Lob1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> It was suggested that in hypertension, increased vascular ROS may reduce NO bioavailability resulting in the loss of its vasoprotective effect <xref rid="pone.0046067-Cai1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, and ROS scavengers could attenuate the norepinephrine-induced contraction of rat aorta <xref rid="pone.0046067-Srivastava1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. In this study, plasma nitrite and nitrate concentrations were measured for systemic NO production <xref rid="pone.0046067-Fujiwara1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. DM, either alone or as combination treatment, improved the attenuated endothelial dependent vasodilation of the aorta in SHR by increasing systemic antioxidant capacity and by upregulating NO bioavailability. Furthermore, DM, either alone or in combination treatment, also improved endothelial-independent vasorelaxation of aortas in response to SNP, suggesting its direct effects on vascular smooth muscle cells. On the other hand, in this study, though significantly reducing BP, AM either in 1 mg or in 5 mg did not alter endothelial-dependent aortic dilatation induced by acetylcholine, suggesting that the effects of AM on BP reduction may be not necessarily associated with the improvement of vascular endothelial function. However, DM, either in 1 mg or in 5 mg, could not only significantly reduce BP but also enhance acetylcholine-induced endothelial-dependent vasodilatation. The endothelial-dependent vasodilatation could be also enhanced while AM was combined with DM. Accordingly, though BP lowering effects may theoretically contribute to vascular protection, it seems more likely that DM could improve endothelial-dependent and -independent vasodilatation and prevent aortic hypertrophy mainly by its direct anti-oxidant effects. Indeed, our <italic>in vitro</italic> findings showed that DM could inhibit the activity/activation of NADPH oxidase and ROS production induced by angiotensin II in HAECs, suggesting the direct effects of DM on vascular endothelium.</p><p>Another novel finding of this study is that DM, even in low dose, could significantly decrease BP and further enhance the BP-lowering effects of AM in SHRs. Combination therapy is one of the main strategies in current management of hypertension. Given the fewer side effects, low-dose combination therapy might be more preferred clinically. Current guideline suggests that combination therapy could be anticipated with thiazide, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, CCB or adrenergic &#x003b2; &#x02013;blocker in various combinations. Our findings show that DM, similar to other first-line antihypertensives, could effectively reduce BP, prevent vascular damage, and improve vascular function in experimental hypertension. Besides, in this study, combination therapy of DM with AM, a CCB, may give the synergetic effects on BP reduction. Interestingly, low dose rather than high dose of DM could give more additional BP reduction top on the AM treatment. The similar effects of low dose vs. high dose of DM on vascular morphology could be also seen in SHRs. Future clinical trials may determine if the combination of low-dose DM and AM could reduce BP and provide efficient vascular protection in clinical hypertension.</p><p>In our study, the serum levels of angiotensin II were increased after AM and/or DM treatment. Our findings are similar to that of Konda T and colleagues. They also found that AM could lower BP but increase plasma angiotensin II level in SHR/lzm <xref rid="pone.0046067-Konda1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. On the other hand, Li F and colleagues have reported that losartan (an angiotensin II receptor blockade) treatment could reverse the thickened wall of aorta in the SHR through inhibiting the oxidative stress <xref rid="pone.0046067-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. It seems that oxidative stress may be more important than angiotensin II itself in the vascular remodeling of the aorta in the SHR. Besides, Bhatia K and colleagues have evaluated the antioxidant capacity in gender difference in SHR after angiotensin II infusion. They found that angiotensin II &#x02013;induced hypertension was more dependent on the increase of oxidative stress in male than in female SHR <xref rid="pone.0046067-Bhatia1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Taking together, one may speculate that although elevating plasma level of angiotensin II, DM could still enhance BP reduction and promote vascular protection via its antioxidant effects.</p><p>It was indicated that DM may lead to life threatening complications (arrhythmias, coma, hypertension) when over-dosed. Thus, the serum-concentrations of DM could be critical to the experiment animals. Fiese G and colleagues have evaluated the absorption of DM in rats and showed about 20% absorption of DM from isotonic chloride buffers of Ph 2.0 <xref rid="pone.0046067-Fiese1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. It was also shown that at equipotent doses for local anesthesia, DM was safer than bupivacaine (a long-acting local anesthesia) in central nervous system and cardiovascular toxicity. In that study, the highest infusion dose of DM was up to 20 &#x000b5;moL/kg <xref rid="pone.0046067-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Accordingly, it seems that the doses of DM used on rats may be safe in the current study.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Treatment with DM either alone or in combination with AM could enhance BP reduction and vascular protection, which may be via its NADPH oxidase-related antioxidant effects.
