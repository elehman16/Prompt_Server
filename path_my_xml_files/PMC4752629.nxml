In 2010 the US-based National Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NLST) was stopped 1&#x02005;year early because a 20% relative reduction in lung cancer mortality had been achieved by low-dose CT compared with chest x-ray after three annual screens and 6&#x02005;years of follow-up.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Subsequent publications have identified a number of areas where improvements can be made.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Six recommendations were made in the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) CT screening workshop report,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> with a focus on future implementation.

A total of 5967/8729 (68.4%) high-risk responders returned the second questionnaire and agreed to participate; 1291 of these were subsequently excluded for the following reasons: they did not meet the inclusion criteria; they had not completed the eligibility questionnaire correctly; they replied after maximum trial recruitment numbers had been reached; or they were unable to give fully informed consent. Five hundred and eighty-two individuals either changed their mind or failed to attend clinic, and a further 33 attended the recruitment clinic but declined to consent. No stratification criteria were used. In total, 4061 individuals (5.3% of all positive responders, and 46.5% of all high-risk positive responders) consented and were recruited into the UKLS.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="THORAXJNL2015207140F3">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref> shows the participant flow from invitation through to randomisation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="THORAXJNL2015207140F4">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref> provides the percentage of UKLS positive responders (n=75&#x02005;958) with an LLP risk of &#x02265;5%, by individual age; there was a steady increase with age in the percentage of people at high risk, with very low numbers at age 50&#x02013;54.</p><fig id="THORAXJNL2015207140F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Participant flow from initial contact to CT screening.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="thoraxjnl-2015-207140f03"/></fig><fig id="THORAXJNL2015207140F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Percentage of UK Lung Cancer Screening (UKLS) positive responders (n=75&#x02005;958) with a Liverpool Lung Project (LLP<sub>v2</sub>) risk of <underline>&#x0003e;</underline>5%, by individual age.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="thoraxjnl-2015-207140f04"/></fig><p>A total of 73&#x02005;934 (97.3%) of the positive responders gave information about their smoking habits: 43.4% were never smokers, 14.7% current smokers and 39.3% ex-smokers.

This is because future screening programmes are likely to include annual or biennial screens. Overall, 951/1994 (47.7%) of subjects underwent at least one further CT after the initial screen.</p><p>For complete clarity, the proportion of false positive tests is now provided in two ways, which allows an appreciation, in a patient-centred approach, of the variable impact on the subject in a trial or the patient in a programme. A &#x02018;false positive&#x02019; that mandates referral to the lung cancer MDT will usually be associated with significant psychological distress and additional more or less invasive investigations with, in some cases, definitive treatment. An individual with a false positive test so defined is thus more likely to suffer harm than one defined in a different way; that is, those subjects who are recalled solely for further CT imaging to clarify the nature of a nodule. The latter is best termed &#x02018;interval imaging rate&#x02019; and may, in screening programmes, merely mean continuing in the programme rather than referral to the MDT. For this reason, all category 3 lesions without cancer are reported separately as false positives warranting interval imaging. Category 2 findings are not classified as false positives warranting recall as the cancer rate was found to be so low in this study that interval imaging would not be recommended.</p><p>Thus on examining the number of UKLS participants referred to the MDT clinic, the false-positive rate is 3.6% (114-42/1994=3.6); whilst the interval imaging rate is 23.2% (472-9/1994).</p><p>In total, 114/1994 (5.7%) participants were referred to the MDT, of whom 42 (2.1% of all screened) had lung cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Pathology</title><p>Of the 42 screen-detected cancers, there were 25 adenocarcinomas, 12 squamous cell carcinomas, 3 small cell carcinomas, 1 typical carcinoid, and 1 bronchogenic carcinoma. Twenty-eight of 42 (66.7%) lung cancers were detected at stage I and 8/42 (19%) at stage II (<xref ref-type="table" rid="THORAXJNL2015207140TB3">table 3</xref>). In total, 36/42 (85.7%) were stage I or II.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Treatment</title><p>Thirty-five of 42 subjects (83%) had surgery as their primary treatment, with eight having adjuvant chemotherapy. Thirty-three of the 36 patients with stage I and II lung cancer had surgery (91.6%) and a further two had radical radiotherapy (total 97%). In the seven patients who did not undergo resection, lung cancer diagnoses were made radiologically in one individual and via tissue biopsy in six patients. Four patients with benign disease had surgery (benign resection rate of 10.3% (4/39)). Details of the UKLS patients with lung cancer with final pathology, TNM, stage and management are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="THORAXJNL2015207140TB3">table 3</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Cost effectiveness</title><p>A detailed description of the results of the health economics modelling is given in the online supplementary section. The baseline estimate for the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of once-only CT screening relative to symptomatic presentation, under the UKLS protocol, was &#x000a3;8466 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) (CI &#x000a3;5542 to &#x000a3;12&#x02005;569).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The UKLS pilot has demonstrated that, by using a population-based approach and a validated risk assessment model, it is possible to detect lung cancer at an early stage using LDCT screening. Over 85% of lung cancers detected were stage I or II, and over 90% of these cases were able to have potentially curative treatment.</p><p>Overall, there was a 1.7% prevalence of lung cancer at baseline which is higher than that reported by the NLST<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> or NELSON<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> trials. This reflects the relatively high minimum risk threshold using the LLP<sub>v2</sub> risk model (&#x02265;5% over 5&#x02005;years).</p><p>The postal questionnaire approach achieved a 30.7% positive response rate to the initial mailing, a good response rate for a clinical trial; however, only 3.5% of the total met the eligibility criteria. Better targeting of individuals with a high risk will be needed for a screening programme.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>UKLS has demonstrated that a volumetry-based nodule management algorithm accurately selected participants for referral to the MDT, resulting in one of the lowest reported rates of surgical procedures for benign disease (10.3%). The trial has also confirmed the very low rate of malignancy in small nodules shown in NELSON.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Only one (0.2%) participant with nodules between 15 and 50&#x02005;mm<sup>3</sup> (or 3&#x02013;5&#x02005;mm diameter, if volumetry not possible) was proved to have lung cancer within a 12-month period. The rate of malignancy was thus well below the baseline risk in screening populations.</p><p>We have defined the terms false positive and interval imaging rates, thus encapsulating the concept of the level of harm to the participants. This distinction informs the clinician of the rates potentially associated with significant harm and the rate associated with the need for follow-up imaging, which may be part of future screening programmes. The UKLS false-positive rate was 3.6% and the interval imaging rate was 23.2%.</p><p>Our interval imaging rate corresponds to the false-positive rate reported in NLST (23.3%), in which a positive finding on CT was any non-calcified nodule at least 4&#x02005;mm in diameter.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In the NELSON trial lung nodules with a volume &#x0003e;500&#x02005;mm<sup>3</sup> or those with a volume-doubling time &#x0003c;400&#x02005;days were regarded as positive tests. Horeweg <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> reported that over three screening rounds, 458 (6%) of the 7582 participants screened had a positive result and 200 (2.6%) were diagnosed with lung cancer; 3.6% of all NELSON participants (273 out of 7582) had a false-positive screening result. This corresponds to our definition of false-positive rate. However, at the first round in NELSON, 19% of cases had indeterminate findings, which required a repeat scan to assess growth.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>The modelled ICER of once-only CT screening under the UKLS protocol was of the order of &#x000a3;9000 per QALY. This is broadly consistent with the ICERs of other recent studies, once allowance is made for differential efficiency of screening protocols. The ICER would be less favourable if there were substantial overdiagnosis but better if smoking cessation were improved. The prevalence of lung cancer was consistent with the risk status of the UKLS recruits, so substantial overdiagnosis is unlikely.</p><p>The comparison of the NLST and UKLS cost-effectiveness approaches is outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="THORAXJNL2015207140TB4">table 4</xref>. The UKLS ICER is about one-fifth of the NLST's costs ($81&#x02005;000), mainly explained by the differences in unit costs and in the intensity of resource use to detect and manage the same proportion of cancers. The UKLS was a single screen compared with the NLST's three annual screens but both gave similar yields of lung cancer.</p><table-wrap id="THORAXJNL2015207140TB4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Comparison of cost-effectiveness approaches used in the National Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NLST) and UK Lung Cancer Screening(UKLS)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">UKLS</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NLST<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Consequence (USA compared with the UK)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yield=2.1% of persons screened</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yield=2.0% of persons screened</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Similar yield</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Single prevalence screen.<break/>Screening and workup costs per person=&#x000a3;212=$327 at current exchange rates (7 July 2015)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 screens to produce similar yield<break/>Screening and workup costs per person screened=$1965 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="THORAXJNL2015207140TB2">table 2</xref>)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">

However, if CT screening is adopted, efforts to maximise cost effectiveness should be made, such as integrated smoking cessation. The results from the NELSON trial and the pooled UKLS and NELSON trial data will likely influence the decision to undertake lung cancer screening in the UK.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
