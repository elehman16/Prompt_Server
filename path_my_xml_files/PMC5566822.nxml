Also, wound takes up substantial health care resources for its management from injury up to the complete wound healing.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Wound healing starts at the moment of injury and continues up to varied periods, which depend on the extent of wounds and its types. There are two types of wounds which are based on the wound healing processes viz., acute and chronic wounds. Further, wounds can also be classified as clean, clean-contaminated and contaminated or infected wounds.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Acute wounds are usually tissue injuries that heal normally in a short duration with minimal scarring if right treatment is given. Chronic wounds go through portions of repair process without establishing functional anatomic results.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Many oral and topical conventional medicines are available in the market which have been used to prevent wound contamination and to promote wound healing. Conventional treatments include local anti-septic agents and antibiotics. Antiseptic agents include hydrogen peroxide, chlorhexidine, triclosan, iodophors (povidon iodine). Antibiotics include aminoglycosides (viz., Framycetin, Neomycin, etc.) and Polymyxin B, Bacitracin, etc., These remedies prevent wound infection, help to keep wound clean, but these remedies do not possess wound healing property. Also, most of the remedies have minor side effects and drawbacks such as skin irritation, rash, and antibiotic resistance.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] These facts about conventional remedies motivate medical practitioners and patients to use alternative medicines.</p><p>Ari Healthcare Pvt.

Subjects attending OPD clinic/causalty department at above trial sites were selected for study.</p><p>On screening/baseline visit (day 0), subject's voluntary written informed consent was taken. Subject's demographic data, detailed medical history along with the current medications (if any) were noted. Subject's general and systemic examinations were done on every visit. Subjects were inquired about details of wound (cause, duration, treatment for wound etc.). If there were multiple wounds or cuts, only one wound/cut appropriate in size was considered as index wound and was followed up till the end of the trial or till complete wound healing (whichever was earlier). Other wounds/cuts were treated with given investigational product but not considered for assessment purpose.</p><p>On screening/baseline visit, wound examination was done by an investigator/co-investigator. The wound area was assessed by using transparent trace paper and marker pen with all aseptic precautions. Subjects with partial or full thickness skin wounds and wound area between &#x02265;1.0 and &#x02264;16.0 cm<sup>2</sup> were selected for study. On every visit, the wound healing measures (depth/thickness, edges, potential exudate, surrounding skin appearance, peripheral tissue induration, peripheral tissue edema, granulation of wound and epithelialization of wound) were assessed. Pain assessment was done on Visual Analogues Scale (VAS). Photographs of the wound were taken.</p><p>On screening/baseline visit, all the subjects were assessed as per inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subject's detailed medical and surgical history was recorded. Subjects were also asked for any episodes of hospitalization in the past to exclude the cases with known immunological, hematological, neurological, psychiatric pathologies or having metastatic malignancy. Urine pregnancy test (UPT) of all female subjects of reproductive age was done. All the subjects were advised to undergo random blood sugar (RBS) level estimation. ELISA test for HIV (I, II) was performed. If subject fulfilled all inclusion/exclusion criteria, he/she was included in the study. As per the computer generated randomization list, subject was randomized to one of the two study groups i.e., Group A (&#x02018;AHPL/AYTOP/0113&#x02019;) or Group B (Framycetin sulphate cream).</p><p>On screening/baseline visit and during whole study period, study subjects were advised to refrain from NSAIDs, oral and topical antibiotics and other topical medications [except tablet paracetamol as a rescue medication up to 2 gm/day for pain management]. Subjects were advised to get the wound cleaned (using saline/distilled water) by the investigator/co-investigator before applying cream on the wound area. Also, subjects were given single dose of injection TT before application of investigational product (if he/she had not taken injection TT in last 6 months).</p><p>On screening/baseline visit, subjects from Group A received Lami tubes containing 15 gm of AHPL/AYTOP/0113 cream whereas subjects from Group B were received Lami tubes containing 20 g of Framycetin sulphate cream. Subjects in Group A were advised to apply sufficient quantity of AHPL/AYTOP/0113 cream on wounds and cuts thrice daily for 21 days or till complete wound healing (whichever was earlier) and subjects from Group B were advised to apply sufficient quantity of Framycetin sulphate cream on wounds and cuts thrice daily for 21 days or till complete wound healing (whichever was earlier). If needed, subjects were given extra tubes of medicine on follow up visits.</p><p>All the subjects were advised to continue their routine diet and exercise regimen (which they had been already following) during the entire study. Subjects were provided a dose chart (in the languages best understood by subjects) to keep daily record of application of cream. On screening/baseline visit, all the subjects were closely monitored for any adverse events after the first application of trial medications. All the activities and findings were documented in the CRF.</p><p>Drug compliance was assessed by the investigator/co-investigator on every follow up visit. Dose chart provided to the subject on the previous visit was collected and dose chart was checked for missed dosage. After checking, the dose chart was returned to study subject. As per the dose chart, if study medication was applied &#x02265;80% time, the subject was considered compliant. If study medication was applied &#x02264;80% of time, the subject was considered as non-compliant. All the subjects were closely monitored for any adverse events, starting from screening visit up to the end of the study. If the wound healing occurred in between the two visits, the subjects were advised to visit the study site without waiting for next follow up visit to record the day of wound healing.</p><p>At the end of the study i.e., on the day of wound healing or day 21 (whichever was earlier), global assessment of overall improvement was done by the investigator and by the subject. Acceptability/tolerability of trial drugs was assessed by the investigator and subject. At the end of the study, all the trial subjects were asked to stop applying trial medications and take advice of investigator. If the wounds and cuts did not heal completely after continuous application of creams for 21 days, the further management was done according to the decision of investigator/co-investigator. All the activities and findings were documented in the CRF.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Ethics</title><p>Before initiation of the study, the study protocol and related documents were reviewed and approved by the Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) of Dhanashree Hospital, Navi Sangvi, Pune-25; Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC) of Lokmanya Medical Research Centre and Hospital, 314/B, Telco Road, Chinchwad, Pune-33 and Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC) of MAM's SS Ayurveda Mahavidyalaya, Malwadi, Hadapsar, Pune-28, India.
