As the brain ages several components of learning as well as motor performance change. In addition, aging is also related to sleep architectural changes. This combination of slowed learning processes and impaired sleep behavior raises the question of whether sleep can enhance learning and specifically performance of procedural tasks in healthy, older adults. Previous research was able to show sleep-dependent consolidation overnight for numerous tasks in young adults. Some of these study findings can also be replicated for older adults. This study aims to clarify whether sleep-dependent consolidation can also be found during shorter periods of diurnal sleep. The impact of midday naps on motor consolidation was analyzed by comparing procedural learning using a sequence and a motor adaptation task, in a crossover fashion in healthy, non-sleep deprived, older adults randomly subjected to wake (45 min), short nap (10&#x02013;20 min sleep) or long nap (50&#x02013;70 min sleep) conditions. Older adults exhibited learning gains, these were not found to be sleep-dependent in either task. The results suggest that daytime naps do not have an impact on performance and motor learning in an aging population.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>procedural memory</kwd><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>consolidation</kwd><kwd>nap</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>sequence</kwd><kwd>adaptation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001659</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">SFB936/ C4</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">SFB877</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">TP A11</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">SFB841</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">TP B8</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Bundesministerium f&#x000fc;r Bildung und Forschung<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100002347</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn002">TRAINSTIM</award-id><award-id rid="cn002">Brain Plasticity for Active Aging (01GQ1424B)</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn003">European Research Council<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100000781</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn003">ERC-StG-2012-311575_F-12</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="47"/><page-count count="12"/><word-count count="7118"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The capacity of older adults to learn and stabilize motor memory traces (consolidation) during sleep is limited (Backhaus et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Pan and Rickard, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). A number of studies suggest that sleep-dependent consolidation in healthy older adults is apparent either immediately after sleep (Al-Sharman and Siengsukon, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Gudberg et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) or after a delay (Tucker et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Korman et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Mantua et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Interestingly these results also hold true for older adults after stroke (Siengsukon and Boyd, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). To analyze whether sleep-dependent consolidation can be shown in healthy older adults after a sleep period shorter than that of night sleep, we implemented two different tasks, a sequence learning task and a motor adaptation task, in a diurnal nap study setup.</p><p>Sequence learning paradigms are amongst the most commonly implemented designs for assessing sleep-dependent consolidation in various populations. Studies including daytime sleep in older adults combined with motor learning are sparse. Fogel et al. (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) found that the lack of offline consolidation during napping is the result of changes in the cortico-striatal network and sleep-architecture. The latter includes problems initiating and maintaining sleep and the reduction of total sleep time and sleep efficiency (Ohayon et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). The impact of sleep duration on a 5-item sequence learning task was revisited by Korman et al. (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The authors showed that the total sleep time of a day-night-cycle was increased by implementing a daytime napping paradigm. They found similar offline learning&#x02014;after 22 h&#x02014;in young non-napping and older napping adults. This strengthens the link between age-related sleep-architecture changes and limited offline learning. In the current study, different nap durations during sequence learning of a more difficult 9-item sequence task are contrasted to show whether sleep-dependent consolidation can be elicited in diurnal settings in more difficult tasks.</p><p>The term &#x0201c;motor adaptation&#x0201d; incorporates the learning of new movements on top of previously known automated movement patterns, leading to a change in learned movement patterns. One example of a motor adaptation tasks are joystick tracking tasks, as previously studied in young adults (Doyon et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Backhaus et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). No sleep-dependent gains could be shown after a daytime nap in younger adults. Similarly no nap-dependent improvements could be shown in young adults for an adaptive whole body movement task (a reverse bicycle steering task; Hoedlmoser et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). On the other hand previous, especially motor adaptation studies implementing whole hand or whole body movements, showed sleep-dependent consolidation in older adults over night (Al-Sharman and Siengsukon, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Mantua et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). To bridge this gap in research, the present project aimed to evaluate whether whole hand movement performance can also be enhanced during a shorter period of sleep that is short diurnal sleep.</p><p>Whether it is possible to reliably elicit beneficial sleep-dependent consolidation in older adults in the above-mentioned tasks by implementing daytime naps remains uncertain. In the present article, we focus on performance of older adults during sequence learning and motor adaptation. We match the findings to data obtained in younger adults (Backhaus et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Based on previous results which showed learning improvements during sequence learning in older adults (Howard and Howard, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>; Spencer et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) and findings which showed the capability of older adults to adapt to new movements and movement components (Voelcker-Rehage, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), we hypothesized behavioral improvements of older adults in both learning paradigms. In addition, based on findings of night-sleep studies (Al-Sharman and Siengsukon, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Gudberg et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Mantua et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), we expected to observe a difference in the effects of fast offline learning between the intervention groups (sleep/wake), with long nappers showing the greatest performance improvements. Lastly, we predicted increasingly diverging performance curves for the three groups (wake, short nap, long nap) over time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Sixty healthy right-handed older adults (range 60&#x02013;82 years) were initially invited to the study. Fifty-seven provided informed consent and were randomly placed into one of the following groups: short nap (45 min nap opportunity, 10&#x02013;20 min sleep), long nap (90 nap opportunity, 50&#x02013;80 min sleep) or a 45 min period of wakefulness between two learning sessions. The randomization employed the sealed-envelop-method. All participants completed both a sequence learning and a motor adaptation task in a crossover fashion. Participants were excluded in the cases of untreated sleep related disorders (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) &#x02265; 12), recent or the regular use of sleep affecting medication, previous history of neurological or psychiatric disorders, drug abuse or night shift work. Participants were instructed to refrain from caffeine or alcohol a day prior to and on the day of the learning sessions. Participants were also instructed to refrain from napping outside the limits of the study protocol. Sleep habits and possible protocol violations were verbally ascertained prior to each learning session. The study was approved by the local ethics committee (&#x0201c;Ethik-Kommission der &#x000c4;rztekammer Hamburg&#x0201d;, Germany, PV4596) in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Procedure</title><p>Sleep and wakefulness was recorded with polysomnography (Alice 3.5, Respironics Inc.) during the midday break and analyzed according to the guidelines of the AASM (Iber et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Electrodes were placed at the beginning of session 1, prior to the task introduction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Polysomnographic data was analyzed during the nap to ensure homogeneous sleep duration across groups. This was especially important for the short nap group. In case participants slept past the prescribed nap-length, they were awakened. A final sleep staging was performed after all participants completed the study protocol.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Timeline of the study design.</bold> PSG, Polysomnography; VLMT, Verbal Learning and Memory Task (declarative).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fnagi-08-00125-g0001"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Motor Tasks</title><p>The explicit sequence task (SE) was performed during three sessions, each consisting of seven learning blocks, with a baseline block preceding session 1. A nine-element sequence was displayed on a 60 Hz screen and reproduced using the four fingers of the left hand on a laptop keyboard with covers restricting view to the four relevant buttons. Participants were instructed to repeat the displayed sequence as fast and accurately as possible for the duration of the block (90 s). A dot-cursor highlighted the current position within the sequence. Every block was followed by a 90 s break. Each session included one block with a random sequence which highlighted previous performance improvements. This random block was implemented as the third (first and last session) or fifth block (second session). To ensure equal levels of difficulty, and therefore comparability between the sequences, all employed sequences (learning, baseline and random) had a Kolmogorov complexity index of 1.49. The number of correctly completed sequences was the outcome variable.</p><p>To test adaptation skills a target tracking task, motor adaptation task (MA), was implemented. Participants were seated in front of a 70 Hz computer screen, upon which targets (30 &#x000d7; 30 pixel-sized dots) could appear at one out of eight possible predefined locations. These predefined target locations were arranged in circular relationship to the middle of the screen&#x02014;similar to numbers on a clock&#x02014;and collected by moving the joystick with the left hand. Joystick movements were in turn projected as a dot-cursor on the screen. A target would disappear when the dot-cursor remained within a 12 pixel radius of the target for at least 100 ms. As soon as the dot-cursor reached its neutral position in the middle of the screen, a new target would appear. Participants were asked to collect as many target dots as possible. Three baseline blocks and a preceding training helped participants adjust to the joystick. After baseline, the joystick movement trajectory was altered by 110&#x000b0; from the 12 o&#x02019;clock position. Moving the joystick forward then induced cursor movements on the screen in the 110&#x000b0; direction. Each session included one random block with changed joystick deviations (session 1&#x02013;3: 300&#x000b0;, 60&#x000b0; and 290&#x000b0;). The number of collected dots within the 150 s time frame was the outcome measure.</p><p>All learning sessions of both motor tasks were preceded by a reaction time task. Participants had to react as fast as possible to a cue appearing on the display.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Declarative Learning</title><p>A declarative task&#x02014;the verbal learning and memory test (Helmst&#x000e4;dter et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>)&#x02014;was implemented prior to motor learning (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Participants learned lists of 15 words by repeated auditory presentation. Retained knowledge of the list of words was tested at the end of the first and second day.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Salivary Cortisol</title><p>Cortisol is one of the neuromodulators of sleep and was previously found to inhibit declarative memory consolidation during sleep when elevated (Plihal and Born, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>).

These findings were apparent for both the explicit motor sequence and the motor adaptation learning tasks.</p><p>The presented findings of the non-restorative effects of naps are in line with previous research, which was mainly based on sleep-dependent consolidation in older adults during night sleep. Numerous studies could not show a sleep-dependent effect on motor memory consolidation in older adults directly after sleep (Spencer et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Siengsukon and Boyd, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Nemeth et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Wilson et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Pace-Schott and Spencer, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Terpening et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Fogel et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Gudberg et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Age-related changes in sleep-architecture were often found to include the reduction of N2 sleep (Ohayon et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Latter leads to the reduction of sleep spindles, a main characteristic feature of N2 sleep (Crowley et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Cajochen et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Peters et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). The occurrence of sleep spindles (Milner et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Nishida and Walker, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Morin et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Tamaki et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), as well as spindle amplitude (Barakat et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), have been previously been linked to procedural learning. The sole change in sleep architecture, also including sleep fragmentation (Ficca et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>), could explain the significantly greater offline performance deterioration found here in older adults, when comparing their performance to younger adults. Nonetheless it should be mentioned that an increase of N2 sleep duration, by affording a daytime nap after learning, was previously hypothesized to enhance sleep-dependent consolidation in older adults after a night of sleep (Korman et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Therefore restorative effects of naps in older adults could have also been expected in the current study, but may lack due to differences in the experimental setup.</p><p>Sleep-dependent consolidation was previously found in older adults when altering the area of cortical recruitment (whole hand movements (Gudberg et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), whole body movements (Al-Sharman and Siengsukon, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>)), when including an additional period of online learning (Tucker et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) or when the total sleep time was prolonged by including daytime naps (Korman et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Based on the latter studies, it was previously hypothesized that a difference between the nap groups may arise after an extended period of consolidation (Tucker et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Korman et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). We were unable to show similar findings in the implemented sequence learning task, opposing results by Tucker et al. (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) who implemented a 5-element sequence task. Further it has been suggested that increasing the total sleep duration after sequence learning by applying daytime naps would result in similar gains in overnight sleep as in young non-nappers (Korman et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). We were not able to demonstrate this effect and could also not show differences in offline gains in adults sleeping vs. not sleeping. Perhaps a stratification of the participants concerning their sleep depth at night could have elicited further differentiations between the groups. Overall, our re-test took place the following morning after a full night of sleep, thus about 20 h after the last session, 22 h after the first learning session. The elapsed time is, therefore, similar or even identical to the previously mentioned studies. Discrepancies in the experimental task setup especially concerning task difficulty and the additional learning session after napping may explain some differences in findings. In addition, the interval between learning and retest differs in comparison to previous studies. However, based on research of neurobehavioral tasks (Takahashi and Arito, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>), these are not expected to have affected any learning outcomes.</p><p>Similar to the task presented here, Fogel et al. (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) implemented a sequence task in a napping paradigm including fMRI measurements. During motor memory consolidation, sequence tasks are thought to rely on cortico-striatal networks and motor adaptation tasks on cortico-cerebellar connections (Doyon et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). It has been shown that in contrast to young adults, no frontal, parietal or hippocampal activation was present during a post-training nap in older adults&#x02014;a decrease in activation of the cortico-striatal network was found (Fogel et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In addition, older adults have been found to show reduced spindle density during the post-training sleep (Peters et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Fogel and Smith, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Fogel et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Spindles are associated with motor skill acquisition in young (Peters et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Albouy et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Morin et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) but could not be connected to performance gains in older adults (Peters et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). They were, however, correlated with cerebral activation in older adults (Fogel et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The percentage of stage N2 sleep per night was correlated with performance improvements in a mirror-tracing task (Mantua et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). As our groups (wake/sleep) did not differ from each other during offline learning after the diurnal break we did not perform spindle analyses.</p><p>Procedural learning remains important in any age group, for example during rehabilitation after an injury or when dealing with new technologies. It would be very comforting to know that learning could be enhanced by simple napping. Negative emotional memories have previously been found to enhance consolidation during naps in contrast to neutral memories (Nishida et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) and to enhance procedural skill learning during over-night sleep (Javadi et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Perhaps including the amygdala in the consolidation network, for example by implementing more arousing tasks, can lead to desired procedural offline learning during naps when a positive emotional surrounding is provided.</p><p>The declarative task was included on the basis that previous studies, especially those employing declarative setups, were able to show sleep-dependent learning. Deterioration, as found here, is a hint that sleep can neither stop decline of trivial knowledge nor enhance non-important declarative content. In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the combination of declarative and motor tasks may hamper the consolidation of each individual task, as was previously seen (Backhaus and Junghanns, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Mednick et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p><p>The recuperative values of naps in the aging population has been previously shown (Tamaki et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Campbell et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Scullin and Bliwise, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). By napping, older adults increase the duration of sleep during 24 h, thus counteracting the effects of sleep fragmentation (Campbell et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Thereby, it was found that older adults can align their level of sleeping time (Campbell et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) and their offline gain (Korman et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) to young adults without naps. As mentioned previously, we could not confirm the latter finding for healthy, older adults. Nevertheless implementing a napping paradigm is&#x02014;apart from lacking procedural improvements found in the current study&#x02014;not a very practical &#x0201c;intervention&#x0201d;. As a result of the problems with the sleep-on-command setup, this study is based on a relatively small sample size per group (<italic>n</italic> &#x02265; 10), which is nevertheless comparable to previous studies in the field (Siengsukon and Boyd, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Nemeth et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Fogel et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Gudberg et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>Future research should focus not only on the effects of daytime naps in healthy older adults and how these effects can possibly be enhanced, but also on adults with neuropsychiatric diseases, such as stroke as well as on older adults with sleep disorders or sleep deprivation from any cause. In addition, a further exploration of activated networks in these populations&#x02014;by combining EEG and fMRI measures&#x02014;is imperative for further research in this field.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although midday naps may have a great recuperative value, no positive effects for procedural learning could be demonstrated in the present setup. Based on similar findings of previous research also showing no sleep-dependent consolidation over night or after a nap, as well as the non-apparent differences between the three groups in the present study, we conclude that not the duration of sleep is vital, but rather the process of consolidation during sleep which seems impaired in older adults. Nonetheless, we are confident that the results of this study will assist in answering remaining questions on how motor tasks are readily consolidated during sleep in older adults and how much sleep is needed to elicit offline changes.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>WB: developing research idea and design, data acquisition and analysis, data interpretation, draft of manuscript.
