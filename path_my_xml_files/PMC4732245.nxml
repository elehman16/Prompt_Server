Head holders or skull clamps such as Mayfield and Sugita holders are employed to hold the head and neck in a steady position during the surgical procedure. Metallic pins are inserted through the scalp and the periosteum into the external lamina of the skull and are tightened. Although the application of skull pins is carried out after induction of general anesthesia, there always occurs a hemodynamic response to this stimulus in the form of tachycardia and hypertension.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The rise in cerebrospinal fluid pressure has also been noted.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>These hemodynamic changes can lead to adverse outcomes in patients with decreased intracranial compliance and impaired cerebral autoregulation. The increase in intracranial pressure in patients with intracranial pathology can increase morbidity.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Rupture of intracranial aneurysms and intracerebral hematomas can occur.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals are analyzed under anesthesia to evaluate anesthetic depth. Among the EEG-derived indices, spectral entropy is most widely used to evaluate the depth of anesthesia. Spectral entropy is determined using raw EEG and frontal electromyography data, resulting in two indices, response entropy (RE) and state entropy (SE).[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] These reflect nociceptive and hypnotic levels respectively, during general anesthesia. Tracheal intubation, which is a highly noxious stimulus, has been shown to increase bispectral index (BIS) and entropy indices during anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The increase in BIS has also been demonstrated following skull pin application.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Different methods have been employed to blunt this hemodynamic response. They include: Local anesthetic infiltration of the pin sites on the scalp,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] scalp block with local anesthetic,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] deepening the plane of anesthesia,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] opioids,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] alpha agonists,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] beta blockers,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and gamma-aminobutyric acid agonists.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>A scalp block is given to block the nerves supplying the scalp, with local anesthetic has been shown to control the hemodynamic response to skull pin placement.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Beta blockers have been widely used to attenuate the hemodynamic responses to tracheal intubation and other intraoperative stimuli. Recently, Landiolol, a short-acting beta blocker has been shown to control the increase in BIS and entropy values following laryngoscopy and intubation.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Intravenous (IV) labetalol has been used to blunt the hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and intubation. The literature search did not reveal the use of labetalol for suppressing the hemodynamic response following skull pin application.</p><p>Hence, we designed this study to compare the efficacy of IV labetalol and bupivacaine scalp block on the hemodynamic changes and to study their effect on spectral entropy changes following Mayfield skull pin application.</p></sec><sec sec-type="patients|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The trial was registered in Clinical Trial Registry &#x02013; India (CTRI/2015/03/005635).

These patients were randomly divided into group L (labetalol) and group B (bupivacaine group) using a computer-generated randomization table (33 in each group).

All the patients were induced with 2 mcg/kg fentanyl, 2 mg/kg of propofol, and vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg was used for muscle relaxation. Anesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide in oxygen mixture (60:40) with 1&#x02013;1.2 minimum alveolar concentration of isoflurane to maintain SE values between 40 and 60.

It leads to a significant hemodynamic response in the form of a rise in HR and blood pressure. An increase in depth of anesthesia parameters such as the BIS index has also been demonstrated.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] These hemodynamic changes may be tolerated in young, healthy patients, but can be detrimental or even fatal in patients with coronary artery disease and patients with reduced intracranial compliance.</p><p>Many methods and drugs have been used for attenuation of these hemodynamic changes. Drugs such as beta blockers,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] opioids,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] local anesthetics,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and alpha agonists[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] have been shown to be effective. Some methods can cause hypotension and possibly lead to cerebral ischemia.</p><p>In our study, 66 ASA classes I and II normotensive adult patients undergoing elective neurosurgery under general anesthesia were enrolled. The patients were randomized into two groups of 33 each. The two groups were similar with respect to age, sex, and weight. The study groups designated as groups B and L received scalp block with 30 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine and IV labetalol 0.25 mg/kg respectively, 5 min before application of the Mayfield skull pins. A vasoconstrictor like adrenaline was not included in the local anesthetic solution as inadvertent intravascular injection or systemic absorption would cause tachycardia and hypertension. Vitals were recorded just before pinning, and 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 300 s following skull pinning and 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 300 s following skull pinning. The depth of anesthesia was also monitored using spectral entropy.</p><p>Local anesthetic infiltration and scalp block are the two regional anesthetic methods used to blunt the response to skull pinning. A scalp block can be easily performed after induction and has the advantage that the pin sites can be changed if required. It also has the advantage of avoiding any significant systemic effects and reducing the need for an additional anesthetic agent or vasoactive drugs. A possible disadvantage is that it may increase the risk of needle stick injury due to the multiple injections needed.</p><p>Previous studies have also explored these potential benefits of local infiltration and scalp blocks and have found that the hemodynamic response is blunted more efficiently than deepening the level of anesthesia. Pinosky <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] studied scalp block with 0.5% bupivacaine. They found increases in SAP of 40 &#x000b1; 6 mm Hg, DAP of 30 &#x000b1; 5 mm Hg, MAP of 32 &#x000b1; 6 mm Hg, and HR of 22 &#x000b1; 5 bpm in the control group while no increases occurred in patients who received scalp block. Levin <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] used Mepivacaine infiltration at pin sites to control the hemodynamic response. Significant increases in MAP by 43% and HR by 15% were seen in the control group while no significant changes occurred in the study group. Arshad <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] used lignocaine with adrenaline infiltration at the sites of skull pinning. The MAP and HR at 60 s after pinning were significantly higher in the control group (104.03 &#x000b1; 12.95 mm Hg and 103.07 &#x000b1; 6.98 bpm) as compared to the study group (86.13 &#x000b1; 9.73 mm Hg and 78.23 &#x000b1; 7.19 bpm). Similarly, in our study we found significant increases in HR, SAP, DAP, and MAP in patients who received IV Labetalol as compared to scalp block with 0.25% bupivacaine.</p><p>Labetalol is an adrenergic receptor blocker with mild alpha-1 and prominent beta-adrenergic receptor blocking actions. The onset of action when administered IV is 5 min. Labetalol has been used previously to blunt hemodynamic changes to laryngoscopy and intubation,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and has been shown to be effective. In our study, there was a significant increase in HR, MAP, and spectral entropy values following skull pin application as compared to scalp block.
