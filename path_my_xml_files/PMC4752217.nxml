It has been shown that joint damage does not strongly correlate with pain severity in patients with knee OA [<xref rid="pone.0149168.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and previous studies, including a meta-analysis of 41 studies, reinforced the idea that central sensitization is a mechanism that may at least partially explain pain and symptoms severity in this population [<xref rid="pone.0149168.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0149168.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Recent guidelines on the management of knee OA highlight the need of research on the combination of non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment modalities [<xref rid="pone.0149168.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Previous research from our group revealed that supervised exercise therapy focused on strength and coordination exercises reduced pressure-pain sensitivity in patients with knee OA [<xref rid="pone.0149168.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It has also been suggested that pain sensitivity improves (for at least 2 weeks) following an intra-articular steroid injection [<xref rid="pone.0149168.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesized that an intra-articular corticosteroid injection preceding an exercise intervention program may provide a window of opportunity for a greater exercise-related adaptations and consequent improvement on pain sensitivity.</p><p>This study is an exploratory sub-study of a randomized double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial [<xref rid="pone.0149168.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] aiming at investigating the clinical effects of intra-articular steroid injection therapy given 2 weeks prior to a 12-week exercise program in individuals with knee OA. The clinical results suggested comparable effects of steroid and placebo given prior to exercise on knee OA symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0149168.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], yet it remains unknown if the combination yields beneficial effects on measures of pain sensitivity.</p><p>The aim of this exploratory sub-study was to assess the potential of intra-articular corticosteroids injected two weeks prior to an exercise intervention program to provide additional benefits (over placebo) on pain sensitivity in patients with knee OA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The detailed procedures and results from the primary outcome of the trial are reported elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0149168.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].

In brief, we undertook a participant, care provider, and outcome assessor blinded, two-arm, parallel-group, randomized, and placebo-controlled trial, running over 26 weeks from October 1, 2012, to April 2, 2014. The study protocol was registered on August 7, 2012, before enrolment of participants started (EudraCT number: 2012-002607-18) and no deviations from the protocol occurred. The Danish Health and Medicines Authority and the Regional Health Research Ethics Committee reviewed and approved the protocol on August 30, 2012. All participants gave their oral and written informed consent to participate in the trial.

A comprehensive description of the recruitment process and inclusion/exclusion criteria is published elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0149168.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Briefly, inclusion criteria comprised being 40 years or older and having a radiographic confirmation of a clinical diagnosis of tibiofemoral OA, clinical signs of localized knee inflammation, knee pain during walking (score of &#x0003e;4 on a scale of 0&#x02013;10 points), and a body mass index &#x02264;35. Potential participants who had corticosteroid injections or participated in exercise therapy within the previous 3 months, were excluded, as were those who used oral corticosteroids within the previous 4 weeks or had inflammatory arthritis, a history of knee arthroplasty, conditions precluding exercise participation, contraindications to corticosteroids, regional pain syndromes (e.g., fibromyalgia), or spinal nerve root compression syndromes.</p></sec><sec id="sec009" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Procedures</title><p>A telephone screening was conducted, and potentially eligible participants were invited to a clinical screening examination performed by a rheumatologist (HB). During the examination, eligibility criteria were assessed including a standardized, semiflexed, weight-bearing posterior-anterior knee radiograph to confirm the diagnosis of knee OA. At inclusion, each participant chose the most symptomatic knee as target knee for all evaluations, and baseline assessments were undertaken. Subsequently, participants were randomized and an independent blinded researcher performed the injections. To allow expected maximal effect of the corticosteroid [<xref rid="pone.0149168.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], the exercise program began 2 weeks after the injection and continued for 12 weeks [<xref rid="pone.0149168.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Both groups (corticosteroid and placebo) participated in the same exercise classes.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Interventions</title><p>The injections were performed with a 25 gauge (38 mm) needle and a 10 ml Luer-lock syringe under real time ultrasonographic guidance (Logic E9, General Electrics Medical System with a 15 MHz linear array transducer, Milwaukee, WI, USA) by an experienced specialist in musculoskeletal sonography to ensure correct bolus deposition in the joint cavity. Participants in the corticosteroid group received an intra-articular injection with 1 ml methylprednisolone (40 mg Depo-Medrol<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Pfizer) dissolved in 4 ml lidocaine (10 mg/ml, SAD) and participants in the placebo group received an injection with 1 ml isotonic saline mixed with 4 ml lidocaine (10 mg/ml, SAD).</p><p>A comprehensive description of the exercise program, including specific exercises, progressions, and additional details are described elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0149168.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The program consisted of group-based supervised exercise sessions (3 times/week during 12 weeks) in which participants joined the group consecutively as they were enrolled. The sessions lasted 1 hour (including a warm-up and a cool-down phase) and consisted of circuit training focused on strength and coordination exercises of the trunk, hips and knees [<xref rid="pone.0149168.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The exercise program was identical to that previously shown to reduce pain sensitivity in knee OA [<xref rid="pone.0149168.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Outcomes were measured at baseline (before randomization and injection), at week 14 (i.e. immediately after the 12-week exercise program; primary trial endpoint), and at week 26 (i.e. after 12 weeks of no attention). The primary outcome measure of the parent trial [<xref rid="pone.0149168.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] was the pain subscale of the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) questionnaire [<xref rid="pone.0149168.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In the present study, we present measures of pressure pain sensitivity (pressure pain threshold [PPT] and temporal summation [TS]), which are exploratory outcomes of the parent trial (i.e. the study was not specifically designed to evaluate pain sensitivity) and main outcomes of this study.</p><p>Pressure-pain sensitivity was estimated by computerized cuff pressure algometry [<xref rid="pone.0149168.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], which consists of a double-chamber tourniquet cuff (VBM Medizin-technik GmbH) and a computer-controlled air compressor (DoloCuff, Unique Electronic Aps). The cuff was wrapped around the calf at the bulky part of the gastrocnemius muscle on the leg of the nominated target knee. Both chambers of the cuff were automatically and simultaneously inflated at a compression rate of 1 kPa/second until the patient reported that the sensation of pressure started to become painful. The pressure at this point defined the PPT (measured in kPa). The PPT was registered 3 times separated by at least 60 seconds, and the average was used for the analyses. The intraclass correlation coefficient for the PPT using cuff algometry is 0.72 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64 to 0.87) with a minimal detectable change of 2.2 kPa, which is similar to other PPT assessment methods in knee OA [<xref rid="pone.0149168.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Temporal summation of pressure&#x02013;pain was assessed on the same site as the PPT using constant pressure stimulation at 125% of the PPT during 6 minutes. Participants continuously rated their pain intensity during the test on an electronic 0&#x02013;100-mm visual analog scale (VAS), with 0 and 100 mm anchored as &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;worst pain imaginable&#x0201d;, respectively. The VAS signal was sampled by a computer at 10-Hz. To quantify TS of pressure&#x02013;pain, the area under the time-VAS curve was calculated and expressed in mm&#x000d7;seconds. To account for changes in PPT at follow-up potentially blurring effects on TS, the same constant pressure used at baseline was applied at follow-up. Reliability coefficients and minimal detectable change in TS are unknown.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size (n = 100) was calculated for the primary outcome of the hosting trial under the assumption that the corticosteroid group would improve at least 10 units more on the primary study outcome (changes from baseline in the KOOS pain subdomain) than the placebo group at the primary end-point (week 14), using a 2-tailed test, with a SD of 15 points, 91% power and alpha error of 5% [<xref rid="pone.0149168.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Randomization, treatment allocation and blinding</title><p>After baseline assessments, participants were randomized in permuted blocks of 2 to 6 to receive either an intra-articular corticosteroid or placebo injection.

Our results revealed that the steroid injection did not provide any further benefit. These findings are in line with the primary results of this trial showing no group differences either in pain, physical function or inflammation markers [<xref rid="pone.0149168.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Although it has been suggested that pain sensitivity improves for at least 2 weeks following an intra-articular steroid injection [<xref rid="pone.0149168.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], it is not clear what the actual extent of the corticosteroids effects is. It is therefore possible that the exercise program might have begun when the maximal window of opportunity for optimal improvement was exhausted. Future randomized trials using different time points for the beginning of the exercise intervention are warranted.</p><p>Previous research from our group showed that PPT and TS significantly improved in patients with knee OA following the same exercise intervention in comparison to a control group (no exercise) [<xref rid="pone.0149168.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In the present study, however, in this study we did not observe significant intra-group improvements in pain sensitivity measures following the exercise program (despite non-significant improvements [25 to 30%] in TS) in either group. Potential baseline characteristics that might partially explain the different results are a higher proportion of males (39% vs. 20%) and baseline KOOS scores slightly higher (between 2.0 and 7.8 units across subscales) in the current trial [<xref rid="pone.0149168.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] compared to the previous one [<xref rid="pone.0149168.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Also, the proportion of mild and severe radiographic grades was slightly different between the groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0149168.t001">table 1</xref>), and it cannot be completely ruled out that radiographic OA severity could affect treatment response on pain sensitivity. However, in experimental studies radiographic knee OA severity is not associated with pain sensitivity [<xref rid="pone.0149168.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>This study had limitations. The dose of corticosteroid (40 mg/mL) used was in the mid-range for knee joints and was chosen because it is the standard procedure at our institution. Further research is warranted to determine whether a higher dose might produce differential results. In addition, different timings for the corticosteroids injection before exercising are warranted. However, the mean group differences in either of the outcomes are so small that both treatments (placebo or steroid) are most likely equivalent. Pain sensitivity was not measured at week 2 (i.e. prior to the beginning of the exercise program) and there might have been undetected between-group differences due to the corticosteroids alone. However, this study aimed at assessing the combined effect of corticosteroid and exercise. Since this study presents exploratory outcomes that may differ according to the above-mentioned parameters, the generalizability of our findings is unknown and future studies are warranted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec017"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results indicate that one intra-articular corticosteroid injection 2 weeks prior to an exercise intervention program does not provide any additional benefit compared to placebo in reducing pain sensitivity in patients with knee OA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0149168.s001"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0149168.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0149168.s002"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0149168.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0149168.s003"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0149168.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0149168.s004"><label>S2 Protocol</label><caption><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0149168.s004.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0149168.s005"><label>S1 SAS Output</label><caption><p>(TXT)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0149168.s005.txt"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0149168.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Cross</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hoy</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Nolte</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Ackerman</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Fransen</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
