Current guidelines from the American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (ADA/EASD) recommend that glycated hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) be maintained at &#x0003c;7.0% in most patients but be compatible with the patient&#x02019;s preferences, needs, and values, in line with the goal of providing patient-centered care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Guidelines from the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology (AACE/ACE) recommend a stringent HbA<sub>1c</sub> target of 6.5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. HbA<sub>1c</sub> is influenced by increases in daily measures of glucose levels including fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and postprandial glucose (PPG), which are discrete values for measures of daily glucose levels. In addition, rapid daily fluctuations in glucose levels have been implicated as particularly important in contributing to diabetes-related complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Because average daily glucose measurements are strongly correlated with HbA<sub>1c</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and are important parameters for physicians to make therapeutic decisions, and because patients understand FPG and PPG better than HbA<sub>1c</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], estimation of mean daily glucose parameters is critical. Twenty-four hour mean weighted glucose (MWG) can be used to provide an indication of the mean glucose exposure of the body over an entire day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>The ADA/EASD position statement recommends combination therapy when HbA<sub>1c</sub> goals are not achieved or maintained during approximately 3&#x000a0;months with monotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, uptitration of monotherapy is often practiced rather than addition of another agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], which is delayed by an average 27&#x02013;35&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The ADA/EASD and AACE/ACE recommend metformin as first-line drug therapy for T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Metformin is a biguanide that helps maintain glycemic control by suppressing glucose production by the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Gastrointestinal disturbances (diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting) are the most common adverse events reported with metformin monotherapy, although the incidence is lower with metformin extended release (XR) versus metformin immediate release (IR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Because T2DM is a progressive disease associated with worsening hyperglycemia, intensification of treatment over time through combination therapy typically becomes necessary for most patients to maintain glycemic goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. After metformin is used, various strategies to achieve glycemic control can be applied. Antidiabetic medications with complementary mechanisms of action and differing safety and tolerability profiles can help improve glycemic outcomes with greater tolerability compared with uptitration of a single antihyperglycemic agent to the maximum dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Saxagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor with a mechanism of action complementary to that of metformin. The DPP-4 enzyme is involved in the degradation of the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), both of which augment release of insulin from the pancreas in a glucose-dependent manner; GLP-1 also decreases pancreatic glucagon secretion. By inhibiting DPP-4 degradation of GLP-1 and GIP, saxagliptin increases insulin secretion and suppresses glucagon release, complementary effects for controlling hyperglycemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. DPP-4 inhibitors may also aid in beta-cell preservation, as suggested by preclinical evidence of inhibition of beta-cell apoptosis and necrosis and stimulation of beta-cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Saxagliptin is generally well tolerated for the treatment of T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The most commonly reported adverse events with saxagliptin are upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, and headache [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Saxagliptin is weight neutral and is not associated with hypoglycemia when used as monotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]; dose-adjustment from the approved 5-mg dose is not required in patients with hepatic impairment, but dose-reduction is required in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment and when coadministered with strong inhibitors and inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 and 3A5 isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Postmarketing reports of pancreatitis have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitors, including saxagliptin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Saxagliptin has been shown to be efficacious and generally well tolerated as add-on therapy in patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] so it was theorized that addition of saxagliptin in patients inadequately controlled with metformin alone may improve efficacy and tolerability compared with uptitration of metformin. A previous study reported significant improvements in HbA<sub>1c</sub> with the addition of saxagliptin to metformin XR versus uptitration of metformin XR over 18&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Here, findings are presented from a 4-week study in which the clinical effects, including impact on measures of daily glucose control, of adding saxagliptin 5&#x000a0;mg to metformin XR 1,500&#x000a0;mg were compared with those of uptitrating metformin XR to the maximum daily dosage of 2,000&#x000a0;mg in patients with T2DM whose glucose levels were not adequately controlled with metformin monotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The study protocol for this international, randomized, double-blind, phase 3b trial was approved by the institutional review board and independent ethics committee at each site, and the study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, as defined by the International Conference on Harmonisation.

Few infections were reported in either treatment group (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2, [4.3%] in each group). There were no reports of confirmed hypoglycemia (defined as a fingerstick glucose value &#x02264;50&#x000a0;mg/dL in the presence of symptoms) in any patient from either group.

Although HbA<sub>1c</sub> is an important parameter for examining glycemic control over time, it provides limited benefit in understanding the daily fluctuations experienced by patients. This study evaluated the impact of 2 commonly used paradigms of diabetes treatment in patients inadequately controlled with metformin: addition of drugs with complementary mechanisms of action and uptitration of existing therapy. The results indicate that short-term treatment with saxagliptin 5&#x000a0;mg added to metformin XR 1,500&#x000a0;mg once daily is generally well tolerated and may provide greater improvements in glycemic control compared with uptitrating metformin XR from 1,500 to 2,000&#x000a0;mg. The decreases in mean plasma glucose levels with the addition of saxagliptin were most noteworthy after meals, consistent with the incretin-mediated mechanism of action of saxagliptin.</p><p>The observation that the difference between saxagliptin&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;metformin XR and uptitrated metformin XR groups in the primary efficacy end point did not reach statistical significance may reflect the higher-than-expected variability in 24-h MWG data within each treatment group. In turn, it is possible that this variability may result from inequalities between the treatment groups at baseline. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, patients who were later assigned to the saxagliptin group appeared to have a stable HbA<sub>1c</sub> during the lead-in period, whereas those later assigned to the metformin XR uptitration group appeared to have a continuing decline in HbA<sub>1c</sub> before randomization, suggesting their glycemic status had not reached equilibrium. Thus, it is possible that the lead-in period may not have been sufficient to create a stable baseline. The number of patients who had their metformin XR dose uptitrated during the lead-in period was balanced between the two groups. In a 4-week, placebo-controlled trial of similar design that enrolled patients with demographic and clinical characteristics similar to those in our study, saxagliptin&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;metformin XR produced significantly greater decreases in 24-h MWG, compared with placebo (adjusted mean&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;SE change from baseline to week&#x000a0;4, &#x02212;13.8&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;3.0 vs 3.0&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;3.0 mg/dL; 95% CI for difference, &#x02212;25.1 to &#x02212;8.5; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Differences in other glycemic measures, including 2-h PPG, mean daily glucose, and 2-day average FPG, were also significantly greater with saxagliptin&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;metformin XR, compared with placebo. In contrast with the current study, the patients in that study did not change their metformin dose during the lead-in period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>The interpretation of the HbA<sub>1c</sub> results is limited by the short duration of the current study. HbA<sub>1c</sub> is a more stable end point than MWG, and with a longer duration of treatment, differences in effect on HbA<sub>1c</sub> between saxagliptin&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;metformin XR and uptitrated metformin XR would be expected to be demonstrated, as reported in a similarly designed 18-week study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In that study, the decrease in HbA<sub>1c</sub> at week&#x000a0;18 was significantly greater with saxagliptin&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;metformin XR, compared with uptitrated metformin XR (adjusted mean change from baseline, &#x02212;0.88% vs &#x02212;0.35%; 95% CI for difference, &#x02212;0.73 to &#x02212;0.31; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001). In this longer trial, 24-h MWG was not an end point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Given that the design of that study was almost identical to the design of the current study, it is likely that add-on therapy with saxagliptin versus uptitration of metformin would have resulted in significant decreases in HbA<sub>1c</sub> if the current study had extended beyond 4&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>Along with considerations of efficacy, tolerability, and safety, it is also important to include cost-effectiveness as a factor in the decision to add saxagliptin to metformin XR therapy. To the authors knowledge, the cost-effectiveness of saxagliptin&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;metformin XR, compared with uptitrated metformin XR has yet to be assessed. However, recent studies performed in Germany and Sweden have reported saxagliptin plus metformin to be cost-effective compared with metformin plus sulfonylurea, based on relatively greater improvements in quality-adjusted life years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>The current study is limited in that it presents the outcomes achieved in a small number of patients, examining a nonstandard, mechanistic end point after only 4&#x000a0;weeks of treatment. Therefore, these results may not be applicable to patients receiving longer-term treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Short-term treatment with saxagliptin 5&#x000a0;mg added to metformin XR 1,500&#x000a0;mg once daily was generally well tolerated in patients with T2DM who had inadequate glycemic control with metformin monotherapy.
