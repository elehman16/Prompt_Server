Tibetan highlanders, successful high-altitude dwellers for millennia, have higher circulating nitrate and exhaled NO (E<sub>NO</sub>) levels than native lowlanders. Since nitrate itself can reduce the oxygen cost of exercise in normoxia it may confer additional benefits at high altitude. <italic>Xtreme Alps</italic> was a double-blinded randomised placebo-controlled trial to investigate how dietary nitrate supplementation affects physiological responses to hypoxia in 28 healthy adult volunteers resident at 4559&#x0202f;m for 1 week; 14 receiving a beetroot-based high-nitrate supplement and 14 receiving a low-nitrate &#x02018;placebo&#x02019; of matching appearance/taste. E<sub>NO</sub>, vital signs and acute mountain sickness (AMS) severity were recorded at sea level (SL) and daily at altitude. Moreover, standard spirometric values were recorded, and saliva and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) collected. There was no significant difference in resting cardiorespiratory variables, peripheral oxygen saturation or AMS score with nitrate supplementation at SL or altitude. Median E<sub>NO</sub> levels increased from 1.5/3.0&#x0202f;&#x0202f;mPa at SL, to 3.5/7.4&#x0202f;mPa after 5 days at altitude (D5) in the low and high-nitrate groups, respectively (p&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.02). EBC nitrite also rose significantly with dietary nitrate (p&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.004), 1.7&#x02013;5.1&#x0202f;&#x0202f;&#x003bc;M&#x0202f;at SL and 1.6&#x02013;6.3&#x0202f;&#x003bc;M&#x0202f;at D5, and this rise appeared to be associated with increased levels of E<sub>NO</sub>. However, no significant changes occurred to levels of EBC nitrate or nitrosation products (RXNO). Median salivary nitrite/nitrate concentrations increased from 56.5/786&#x0202f;&#x003bc;M to 333/5,194&#x0202f;&#x0202f;&#x003bc;M&#x0202f; with nitrate supplementation&#x000a0;at SL, and changed to 85.6/641&#x0202f;&#x003bc;M and 341/4,553&#x0202f;&#x003bc;M on D5. Salivary RXNO rose markedly with treatment at SL from 0.55&#x0202f;&#x003bc;M to 5.70&#x0202f;&#x003bc;M. At D5 placebo salivary RXNO had increased to 1.90&#x0202f;&#x003bc;M whilst treatment RXNO decreased to 3.26&#x0202f;&#x003bc;M. There was no association with changes in any observation variables or AMS score. In conclusion, dietary nitrate supplementation is well tolerated at altitude and significantly increases pulmonary NO availability and both salivary and EBC NO metabolite concentrations. Surprisingly, this is not associated with changes in hemodynamics, oxygen saturation or AMS development.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="abs0015"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Xtreme Alps is a randomised controlled field study of dietary nitrate at altitude.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Nitrate increased levels of exhaled NO and salivary nitrite, nitrate &#x00026; RXNO.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Breath condensate nitrate, oxygen saturation and blood pressure did not change following dietary nitrate supplementation.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Increases in exhaled NO correlated with increases in breath condensate nitrite.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0030"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Dietary nitrate did not alter the incidence of Acute Mountain Sickness at 4559&#x0202f;m.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Nitrate</kwd><kwd>Nitrite</kwd><kwd>Altitude</kwd><kwd>Nitric oxide</kwd><kwd>Hypoxia</kwd><kwd>Hypoxaemia</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>The partial pressure of oxygen decreases on ascent to high altitude as a result of a decline in barometric pressure; at 5300&#x0202f;m (the height of Everest base camp) it is approximately half the value at sea level <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. This hypobaric hypoxia causes hypoxaemia (a lack of oxygen in the blood) resulting in significant physiological challenges. The respiratory system is particularly affected, and consequently respiratory problems make up some of the most common (e.g. high altitude cough) and also the most serious (e.g. high altitude pulmonary oedema or HAPE) illnesses encountered at high altitude <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Respiratory pathologies and hypoxaemia are also commonly encountered in critical care patients but are very difficult to study in this setting. High altitude environments might therefore provide a model for pathological hypoxaemia from which much can be learned <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Interestingly, native lowlanders appear to respond to acute hypobaric hypoxia differently from native highlanders (i.e. populations permanently residing above 3000&#x0202f;m). For example, native lowlanders seem to rely heavily on increased erythropoiesis to maintain oxygen content at altitude <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, whilst this response is much less pronounced in native highlanders such as the Sherpas (supremely adapted after living at high altitude for over 500 generations) <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Another notable difference that is remarkably conserved across different high altitude populations (including the Tibetan populations and the Bolivian Aymara) is that mountain dwellers exhale higher concentrations of nitric oxide (NO) compared to individuals living at sea level <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, exhaled NO levels decrease significantly in lowland populations on acute exposure to altitude <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. During graded exposure to altitude, however, NO production increases also in lowlanders suggesting that NO production and particularly respiratory NO availability might play an important role in offsetting the effect of hypoxia and improve performance <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>NO is a ubiquitous signalling and effector molecule, and an important modulator of oxygen delivery through effects on blood pressure and blood flow as well as mitochondrial respiration. As well as these vasoactive properties, it also plays crucial roles in inflammation (including pulmonary and airway inflammation) and in the immune system, as a cytotoxic entity and by abating oxidative stress <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Moreover, in hypoxia it plays a key role in energy supply-demand matching <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Inhaled NO has been shown to reduce pulmonary artery pressures and increase arterial oxygenation in critical care patients suffering from Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome by improving ventilation-perfusion matching <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Inhaled NO has also been used to treat patients suffering from HAPE, successfully reducing oedema and increasing arterial oxygenation <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>NO is produced through two main pathways in the body, both regulated by oxygen. While the enzymatic formation of NO from <sc>l</sc>-arginine by nitric oxide synthases (NOS) is an oxygen-requiring process, production of NO through serial reduction of inorganic nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>) to nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>) and NO is inhibited by oxygen <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. It is this second mechanism that is thought to underlie the significant increase in markers of NO metabolism observed in acclimatizing lowlanders and also well-adapted Sherpas at high altitude <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Dietary nitrate is initially reduced to nitrite by the oral bacterial flora in the mouth, before nitrite can be further reduced to NO in the acidic environment of the stomach and in vascular tissue by various nitrite reductase enzymes <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Besides its use as an ergogenic aid in sports medicine <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, attempts to increase nitrate intake through dietary supplements have also been trialled as therapeutic interventions in respiratory patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which results in a chronic hypoxaemic state, with mixed results <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Some studies showed beneficial effects such as increased exercise performance and lower resting blood pressure <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, whilst other studies did not show any significant improvements in exercise performance <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Some studies only showed limited improvements (such as reduced oxygen consumption) but suggested that these benefits might be greatest in the most hypoxic patients <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. However, all of these studies demonstrated that dietary nitrate supplementation is both safe and tolerable to patients. If dietary nitrate supplementation could improve physiological performance under other hypoxic conditions then it could potentially be an effective and economic treatment for hypoxaemia in critically ill patients.</p><p>The Xtreme Alps expedition was a double-blinded randomised placebo-controlled trial designed to investigate how dietary nitrate supplementation affects performance at altitude <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.

A total of 28 healthy adult volunteers (aged 21&#x02013;40 years) were recruited after completing a health screening process to identify those at risk of problems at high altitude (as detailed in <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>). Of these, 21 (75%) were male. The mean weight was 73.3&#x0202f;kg (&#x000b1;11.6), mean height 1.76&#x0202f;m (&#x000b1;0.08), and mean BMI 23.6 (&#x000b1;2.7). 3.6% were smokers and 75% had previously been to an altitude of over 3000&#x0202f;m. Anyone deemed unfit to undergo a formal exercise test at high altitude (as previously described <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>) was excluded. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant and ethical approval for the study was obtained from Research Ethics Committees at both University College London, UK and the University of Turin, Italy.</p><p>The study took place in August 2010 at the Capanna Regina Margherita (&#x02018;Margherita Hut&#x02019;) on the summit of Monte Rosa (altitude 4559&#x0202f;m), which contains a research laboratory inside, managed by the University of Turin. Baseline measurements were conducted in London (altitude 75&#x0202f;m) six weeks earlier: mean barometric pressure 100.5&#x0202f;kPa, mean laboratory temperature 24.1&#x0202f;&#x000b0;C and mean oxygen partial pressure 19.7&#x0202f;kPa. Participants were then separated into 2 groups (Trek 1 and 2) based on their availability, with Trek 2 starting their ascent seven days after Trek 1. All investigators and participants initially flew to Milan (102&#x0202f;m) and remained there one night before starting to ascend the following day; by road to Alagna (1205&#x0202f;m), by lift to Punta Indren (3250&#x0202f;m), and then on foot to the Gnifetti Hut (3611&#x0202f;m). Severe weather conditions meant Trek 1 only stayed at 3611&#x0202f;m for two nights before ascending on foot to the Margherita Hut, whilst Trek 2 ascended on foot after three nights at 3611&#x0202f;m. Subjects then remained at 4559&#x0202f;m for the rest of the study duration (eight nights for Trek 1, seven for Trek 2) (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A) before descending on foot again. This schedule included a planned rest day on arrival at 4559&#x0202f;m for each group (during which the first group could build and set up the laboratory), followed by 5 days of testing. In the laboratory at 4559&#x0202f;m, the mean barometric pressure, temperature and partial pressure of oxygen were 78.1&#x0202f;kPa, 22.6&#x0202f;&#x000b0;C and 15.1&#x0202f;kPa respectively.<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Changes in resting physiological variables during the Xtreme Alps expedition.

Administration, both at sea level and high altitude, commenced 72&#x0202f;h prior to the start of and continued throughout each testing period. However, as all subjects in both the placebo and treatment groups were taking beetroot juice for 3 days prior to each experimental period starting, we were unable to measure baseline (or 'treatment-free' control) measurements either at sea level or at altitude in either of these groups. A limited amount of data is available for E<sub>NO</sub> and breath condensate levels from treatment-na&#x000ef;ve members of the laboratory team, who did not receive any supplement as they were not part of the main study; this data is presented where available on the appropriate figures.

Due to a corrupted file all spirometric recordings taken at high altitude were lost; therefore, only sea level data are reported.</p><p>Breath-to-breath analysis of inhaled and exhaled NO was performed using a spirometric analysis device (using individual disposable Spirettes and bacterial filters) connected to a gas phase chemiluminescence analyzer (CLD88sp with Spiroware software, EcoMedics, Duernten, Switzerland); two identical units were used in parallel throughout. In accordance with current American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society recommendations for exhaled NO measurements <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, individual Denox 88 units (EcoMedics, Duernten, Switzerland) provided NO-free air and enabled advanced adaptive expiratory flow control. Expiratory gas flow was measured in real time according to the time-of-flight principle using a high resolution/high frequency ultrasonic device. A fraction of inspired and expired air (&#x0223c;10% of the expired air at a nominal flow of 50&#x0202f;ml/s) was continually transferred from a sidestream opening in the handheld spirometer; here, flow was controlled using a fixed orifice in the sample line with a vacuum pump driven internal resistor arrangement, maintaining a constant flow of 300&#x0202f;ml/min of sampled air into the analyzer, independent of changes in barometric pressure.</p><p>Both chemiluminescence analysers were equipped with additional stainless-steel bulkhead fittings, which supplied their ozone generators with pure oxygen (instead of environmental air) from a cylinder. This hardware adjustment ensured adequate ozone generation to maintain optimal performance even at lower barometric pressures. For consistency, medical grade oxygen was also used to supply the ozone generators at sea level. All measurement devices were calibrated daily, both at sea level and at altitude, with NO (4.00&#x0202f;ppm) using 100% nitrogen as zero gas and a calibrated 100 mL volumetric syringe. The CLD88sp devices measure continuously ambient temperature and pressure by internal sensors. Each morning accurate barometric pressure and temperature were entered into the software for verification purposes as part of the calibration procedure. The CLD88sp takes the ambient pressure into account during the gas calibration and compensates automatically for diurnal pressure changes. Thus, displayed Fe<sub>NO</sub> concentrations are always accurate and do not require correction for altitude.

(p&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.02), with median values from 1.5 mPA (IQR 1.2&#x02013;2.6) to 2.99&#x0202f;mPa (IQR 1.98&#x02013;4.44) at sea level and from 3.4&#x0202f;mPa (IQR 1.8&#x02013;4.6) to 7.4 mPA (IQR 3.9&#x02013;10.4) by day 5&#x0202f;at altitude. In the same model, treatment with high nitrate supplementation also significantly increased sea level nitrite concentrations in EBC (p&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.004), with median values increasing from 1.66&#x0202f;&#x003bc;M (IQR 1.29&#x02013;1.80) to 5.05&#x0202f;&#x003bc;M (IQR 1.22&#x02013;9.95) at sea level, and from 1.64&#x0202f;&#x003bc;M (IQR 1.04&#x02013;2.09) to 6.26&#x0202f;&#x003bc;M (IQR 3.83&#x02013;8.16) after 5 days at 4559&#x0202f;m.

However, this analysis was limited by low n values at sea level, particularly in the treatment group (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Changes in breath RXNO levels in response to the dietary supplement followed similar trends, but these differences did not reach statistical significance (p&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.23). No significant change was seen in EBC nitrate concentrations with levels remaining very similar in both treatment groups across the study period (p&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.59). Median concentrations of nitrate in the low and high nitrate supplements were 1.84&#x0202f;&#x003bc;M (IQR 1.41&#x02013;2.24) and 2.20&#x0202f;&#x003bc;M (IQR 1.29&#x02013;2.9) respectively at sea level, and 1.17&#x0202f;&#x003bc;M (IQR 0.93&#x02013;1.31) and 1.20&#x0202f;&#x003bc;M (IQR 1.08&#x02013;1.39) after 5 days at altitude.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.5"><label>3.5</label><title>Oral nitrate reduction and NO metabolite levels in saliva</title><p>Similar to EBC, salivary NO metabolite levels at sea level and high altitude varied considerably between individuals.

This experimental design allowed us to take serial measurements in order to examine how dietary nitrate supplementation (ingested in three equal doses throughout each day) affects physiological acclimatization to altitude.</p><sec id="sec4.1"><label>4.1</label><title>Main findings &#x02013; exhaled NO (E<sub>NO</sub>)</title><p>These results demonstrate that dietary nitrate supplementation with a beetroot/fruit juice mixture at altitude successfully increases nitrate availability; these increases are associated with markedly enhanced levels of exhaled NO (E<sub>NO</sub>), and nitrate and nitrite levels in saliva as well as nitrite concentrations in EBC throughout the duration of altitude exposure. In addition, nitrate supplementation also increased the steady-state concentrations of nitrosation products (S-nitrosothiols and N-nitrosamines) in saliva and compensated for the drop in total nitroso species content in EBC observed following ascent to high altitude. Unexpectedly, despite these significant biochemical changes there was no measureable difference in SpO<sub>2</sub>, RR, BP, HR or AMS severity associated with dietary nitrate supplementation, either at sea level or at high altitude.</p><p>Reports on altitude-related changes in E<sub>NO</sub> of lowlanders and experimental animals are inconsistent. Data from one study in healthy volunteers suggested that E<sub>NO</sub> levels decrease on acute exposure to altitude, possibly by as much as 33% at a simulated altitude of 5000&#x0202f;m <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. This was thought to be due to the lower gas density at reduced barometric pressures increasing the back diffusion and alveolar uptake of NO <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. By contrast, E<sub>NO</sub> levels increased upon acute nitrate administration in another study <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Similarly, E<sub>NO</sub> increased in rats exposed to 4 days of hypoxia, possibly as an adaptive response to the increased oxidative stress seen with chronic hypoxic exposure <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Our findings suggest equivalent responses might also be seen in humans at altitude and over comparable timescales; ascent to 4559&#x0202f;m over at least 3 days demonstrated similar increases in E<sub>NO</sub> levels in our cohort.</p><p>Growing evidence supports the notion that both NO and nitrate metabolism play important roles in the physiological response to hypoxia, and also the benefits that nitrate supplementation can confer on individuals' physiological performance <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. However, the physiological role of E<sub>NO</sub> specifically in either of these situations is unclear, and clinically the measurement of Fe<sub>NO</sub> has mainly been as a point-of-care test for airway inflammation in patients with asthma <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Its association with the development of AMS is much less certain.</p><p>While it has been suggested that E<sub>NO</sub> may be associated with AMS, this is not without controversy. One of those studies that led to this conclusion was performed in a hypoxic chamber and subjects only experienced 6&#x0202f;h of exposure to a normobaric hypoxic stimulus <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Others suggested that E<sub>NO</sub> might correlate with the incidence of AMS, but this was a much smaller study (n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;8) where only baseline values for Fe<sub>NO</sub> were measured and subjects did not receive any dietary intervention <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Another study demonstrating that E<sub>NO</sub> values dropped significantly on acute exposure to high altitude found no association between E<sub>NO</sub> values and reported symptoms of AMS <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>The two most striking differences between these studies and the results presented here are our dietary intervention to boost nitrate metabolism and the duration of hypoxic exposure. Our study measured changes over five days at altitude whereas the studies of MacInnis et al. and Brown et al. only looked at an acute exposure to hypoxia, measuring changes up to six hours and three hours, respectively. A recent study that explored a more prolonged exposure to hypobaric exposure where teenage subjects received dietary nitrate supplementation on a graded ascent over two weeks to 5300&#x0202f;m in Nepal also reported no change in AMS scores, lending further support to the unexpected findings of the current study <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>.</p><p>Conceivably, our nitrate supplement might not have induced a large enough increase in E<sub>NO</sub> to generate a measurable physiological change in either baseline observations (e.g. SpO<sub>2</sub>) or AMS score. We are not aware of any specific data that would have quantified the increase in E<sub>NO</sub> required to induce a change in either AMS, SpO<sub>2</sub> or any other measure reported here in native lowlanders. However, our nitrate supplement successfully doubled median E<sub>NO</sub> values compared to control so that by day 5 the median E<sub>NO</sub> in the intervention arm was almost three times higher than levels measured earlier in healthy Tibetan highlanders <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Tibetans have less AMS than lowland trekkers even with this accepted upper limit for E<sub>NO</sub> concentrations; therefore, those supra-normal values in our cohort should have been sufficient to trigger a physiologically meaningful response <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><label>4.2</label><title>Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) results</title><p>EBC is being increasingly used to detect levels of airway inflammation, monitor disease progression and also assess disease severity in a number of respiratory conditions including adults and children with atopic asthma <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. However, despite offering a relatively cheap, quick, simple and non-invasive window into lung physiology, its usefulness in altitude-related respiratory illnesses is less explored.</p><p>There is some evidence to suggest EBC could be useful in predicting altitude-related illness. Results from a small study (5 subjects&#x0202f;+&#x0202f;11 controls) suggested that EBC analysis before and after 90&#x0202f;min of normobaric hypoxic (12% oxygen) exposure might be able to distinguish between individuals with and without a history of HAPE <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Meanwhile, another study demonstrated that EBC measurements conducted at 670&#x0202f;m and 3000&#x0202f;m of malondialdehyde (MDA), a marker of oxidative stress, significantly correlated with the AMS scores of 10 soldiers at 5000&#x0202f;m as they ascended a 6125&#x0202f;m peak <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Other oxidative stress markers (e.g. 8-iso prostaglandin F<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub>) have also been shown to significantly increase in EBC measurements in small numbers of both exercising biathletes (n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;10) and sedentary volunteers (n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;5) over a six week period at 2800&#x0202f;m, further supporting our findings presented here <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. In a study similar to ours also making EBC measurements at 4342&#x0202f;m from seven subjects receiving dietary <sc>l</sc>-arginine supplementation &#x02013; an intervention that should increase endogenous NO production via the classical nitric oxide synthase pathway - no improvement in AMS scores were seen with supplementation. In fact, this study found that the treatment group actually developed significantly worse headaches <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>.</p><p>Again, the biggest difference between all of these previous studies and the results we present here is the scale of the study. To the best of our knowledge, the Xtreme Alps expedition is currently the largest study and 4559&#x0202f;m is also the highest altitude at which EBC samples have yet been collected. While no association was found between NO metabolite related changes in EBC and AMS in the present study, future well-powered studies are needed to determine whether or not this technique could help predict or diagnose altitude illness using other biomarkers.</p><p>A curious finding was that nitrite and nitrate concentrations in EBC measured in the present study were almost identical. This is unlike any other compartment where nitrate levels are typically exceeding nitrite levels by at least an order of magnitude. Moreover, we found that dietary nitrate resulted in significant rises to levels of EBC nitrite - with almost identical rises seen both at sea level and at altitude - but almost no difference to EBC nitrate. This strongly suggests that both EBC nitrate and nitrite are under active regulatory control, even when the exact mechanisms of sensing and regulation remain unclear. We also noted moderate associations between levels of EBC nitrite and Fe<sub>NO</sub>, even in the low nitrate/placebo group and particularly at altitude. We believe that, for the first time, this provides evidence to suggest that nitrite in airway secretions might be acting as a possible source of E<sub>NO</sub>. Whether or not these observations are of biological significance warrants further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3"><label>4.3</label><title>Enterosalivary nitrate circulation</title><p>The physiological importance of the enterosalivary nitrate circulation has only been realised recently whilst the conversion of <sc>l</sc>-arginine and oxygen to NO and citrulline by NOS enzymes was established two decades earlier <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. NOS-independent nitric oxide production was not discovered until the mid 1990s <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Unlike NOS enzymes, the bacterial nitrate-reductase enzymes that convert nitrate to nitrite in the oral cavity function also function in the absence of oxygen. This means that this enterosalivary nitrate circulation becomes particularly important under hypoxic conditions when NOS activity becomes limited <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, and nitrite-reducing pathways in mammalian tissues are still inhibited by the remaining oxygen levels <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>Dietary nitrate supplementation initially increased the levels of salivary nitrate, nitrite and nitrosation products as expected &#x02013; extra oral nitrate availability enables more bacterial nitrate to nitrite conversion, leading to enhanced systemic nitrite availability and formation of downstream nitrosation products <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. However, it is surprising that hypoxic exposure did not significantly alter salivary nitrate or nitrite levels from sea level values. Moreover, we did not expect prolonged altitude exposure to narrow the difference in salivary RXNO concentrations between the two groups. The cause for this finding is not clear at present but this could be related to the duration of exposure as the trends suggest levels might still not have reached a plateau by day 5. Equally this could suggest that chronic hypoxic conditions might limit the maximum RXNO production rate, effectively placing a ceiling on the changes any dietary nitrate supplementation might induce.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.4"><label>4.4</label><title>Dietary nitrate and altitude illness</title><p>Our findings suggest that even though dietary nitrate supplementation at altitude results in increased biochemical nitrate availability, this does not improve acclimatization and/or reduce the incidence of AMS. Another hypobaric chamber study recently showed similar increases in E<sub>NO</sub> after just a single dose of sodium nitrate. However, despite E<sub>NO</sub> increasing by 24% at a simulated altitude of 4300&#x0202f;m, there was no demonstrable benefit in isometric exercise performance, forearm blood flow or tissue oxygenation <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Meanwhile another study, which recently exposed 20 healthy volunteers to 6&#x0202f;h of 12% oxygen in a normobaric chamber, actually showed an increase in AMS scores (particularly headache) with dietary nitrate, contrasting our findings <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. Inhaled NO has previously been shown to reduce pulmonary arterial pressures both at sea level and at altitude, offering particular benefit to HAPE-susceptible patients who tend to have high pulmonary artery pressures <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. One explanation of these findings perhaps is that even a mild vasodilatory effect on the pulmonary vasculature confers benefits at altitude, particularly in people with naturally high pulmonary artery pressures. Meanwhile any cerebrovascular dilation in patients results in increased cerebrovascular flow and worsening of headache symptoms, particularly in those most susceptible to AMS.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.5"><label>4.5</label><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The Xtreme Alps study is one of the earliest double-blinded randomised placebo controlled trials of dietary nitrate supplementation at altitude that the authors are aware of, and also one of the larger studies to investigate the effects of nitrate metabolism at altitude. Nevertheless, absolute numbers remain rather moderate in each arm of the trial; we also had a number of missing data points due to subjects not being able to participate on some test days, usually due to altitude related illness. Consequently, confidence intervals remained wide in all reported measures so we cannot completely exclude a type-2 error, although a sensitivity analysis to correct for these missing values did not change these outcomes.</p><p>Since the Xtreme Alps study was conducted, other studies have emerged that also investigated how nitrate supplementation may affect performance at altitude, however most have used a simulated (chamber) altitude environment. In accordance with our findings, AMS incidence was shown to be similar to controls in cyclists taking dietary nitrate supplements exposed to short sessions of 11% oxygen in a normobaric chamber <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Similarly, short-term nitrate supplementation induced no significant changes in cognitive performance in healthy volunteers simulating hiking at altitude by walking on a treadmill in a normobaric chamber <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Curiously and contrary to our findings, all of these simulated altitude studies reported increases in SpO<sub>2</sub> after nitrate supplementation <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>, <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. The reason for this discrepancy is not clear. However, all of these results were in response to a very different physiological stimulus to the intervention presented here. Our subjects were exposed to hypobaric hypoxia gradually over a number of days; in chamber studies subjects tend to experience a much shorter duration and more rapidly induced period of normobaric hypoxia. For example, in one normobaric chamber study reporting an increase in cycling performance after just one dose of nitrate, subjects were decompressed to 15% oxygen in just 5&#x0202f;min <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. Equally, the physiological response to normobaric and hypobaric hypoxia may not be the same, as suggested by a recent systematic review <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. Currently Xtreme Alps remains the largest field study to date to explore the effects of dietary nitrate by taking serial measurements over a prolonged duration of hypobaric hypoxic exposure at high altitude.</p><p>Another study strength was the fact that the supplement we used to deliver nitrate (a natural beetroot/fruit juice blend) was almost identical in taste, appearance and composition to the placebo (the same mixture except that the beetroot/fruit juice was selectively reduced in nitrate). Ours is the only study we are aware of that also monitored nitrite and nitrate intake with the food.</p><p>As alluded to before, ascent occurred in two successive phases but inclement weather conditions meant that these ascent profiles could not be identical. However, statistical modeling has allowed us to control for these differences in ascent profile as much as possible, and trends between both ascent groups were similar. With each subject starting their beetroot juice supplement (containing either high nitrate 'treatment' or very low nitrate 'placebo') three days prior to each testing period, this meant we were unable to record baseline values at either sea level or at altitude. We were also unable to take a complete third 'treatment free' control group to altitude without reducing the power of the study due to the space available at 4559&#x0202f;m. However, the few measurements that were taken on the small number of treatment free laboratory team members all closely matched those of the placebo group suggesting that the low nitrate placebo supplement taken by this group did indeed behave as a placebo agent.</p><p>The majority of our subjects were young, non-smoking males with previous altitude experience, which is unsurprising given we primarily recruited from a mailing list of medical scientists and healthcare workers with an interest in high-altitude travel and hypoxia physiology. This sample remains representative of lowlanders who visit high altitude regions, as &#x0003e;83% of patients seen at the Himalayan Rescue Association's Everest Base Camp clinic over a ten-year period were male with an average age less than 40 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. Larger studies with a broader sample population might further strengthen this area of research in the future.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study suggests that dietary nitrate supplementation is tolerable and safe at high altitude and robustly increases levels of E<sub>NO</sub> as well as nitrate and nitrite concentrations in saliva, and nitrite concentrations in EBC. The association between EBC nitrite and Fe<sub>NO</sub> levels suggests that exhaled NO may originate, at least in part, from nitrite in alveolar lining fluid. However, these increases in NO and related metabolites were not associated with any measureable changes in AMS, peripheral oxygen saturation or vital physiological parameters such as heart rate and blood pressure after five days of hypobaric hypoxic exposure. Future efforts should be directed at investigating whether dietary nitrate supplementation at altitude is associated with other physiological changes.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>Together MF and HP designed, and HP produced and provided both the intervention and placebo supplement juice drinks for this study.
