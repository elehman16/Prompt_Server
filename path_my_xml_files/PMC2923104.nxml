Practices are randomly allocated to an 'intervention' or 'control' group. General practitioners (GPs) and practice nurses (PNs) are offered training in lifestyle counselling and motivational interviewing as well as practice visits and patient educational resources. Patients enrolled in the trial present for a health check in which the GP and PN provide brief lifestyle counselling based on the 5As model (ask, assess, advise, assist, and arrange) and refer high risk patients to a diet education and physical activity program. The program consists of two individual visits with a dietician or exercise physiologist and four group sessions, after which patients are followed up by the GP or PN. In each practice 160 eligible patients aged between 40 and 64 years are invited to participate in the study, with the expectation that 40 will be eligible and willing to participate. Evaluation data collection consists of (1) a practice questionnaire, (2) GP and PN questionnaires to assess preventive care attitudes and practices, (3) patient questionnaire to assess self-reported lifestyle behaviours and readiness to change, (4) physical assessment including weight, height, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference and blood pressure, (5) a fasting blood test for glucose and lipids, (6) a clinical record audit, and (7) qualitative data collection. All measures are collected at baseline and 12 months except the patient questionnaire which is also collected at 6 months. Study outcomes before and after the intervention is compared between intervention and control groups after adjusting for baseline differences and clustering at the level of the practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will provide evidence of the effectiveness of a primary care intervention to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes in general practice patients.

Given the contribution of cardiovascular disease to disease burden, the cost of inadequate prevention is high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Diabetes, itself a major risk factor for ischaemic heart disease and stroke, affects 7.5% of Australians, and a further 16.3% of the population over the age of 25 years have impaired glucose metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>There is considerable evidence for the effectiveness of interventions to prevent cardiovascular disease at the population and individual levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. A simple office-based lifestyle intervention has been shown to significantly reduce total cholesterol in hypercholestrolaemic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Intensive lifestyle interventions involving diet and exercise have also been shown to be effective in the prevention of diabetes in patients with impaired glucose tolerance and also lowering blood pressure in patients with hypertension over 6 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Even moderate reductions in weight has been shown to reduce the incidence of diabetes by more than one half [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Studies such as these suggest that there is a strong case for intervening in groups at high risk of developing lifestylerelated disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The Australian national health survey 2007-2008 found that the most common vascular risk factors were those related to nutrition, with over 90% of adults not meeting the recommended serves of vegetables, over half not consuming adequate amounts of fruit and 62% being overweight or obese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Around one third of adults were classified as physically inactive, one in five smoked, and of the 59% of the population who drank alcohol, 21% did so at a level which would pose a risk to their health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Patients who already have one or more risk factors for vascular disease may be more likely to perceive potential health risk, as well as benefits, than those who are not at risk. This may increase their motivation to participate in lifestyle change activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, advice about risk may also increase psychological distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] which in turn can also impact on behaviour choices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>General practice is well placed to offer early interventions to modify lifestyle risk factors. It provides care across the continuum from prevention of illness to treatment and rehabilitation, and provides consultations to approximately 90% of Australians each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In 2007-08, 59% of general practice encounters were with patients who were overweight or obese, 26% with those who drank alcohol at risky levels and 17% with those who smoked daily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. There is evidence that lifestyle modification can be implemented in general practice and that selective interventions can bring about behaviour change in patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, many studies have focused on single risk factors and have not tried to change systematically. Findings from research into interventions that have targeted multiple factors have been more equivocal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Few primary care encounters in Australia involve risk-factor assessment and intervention, signifying an important gap between evidence and practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The challenge is thus to determine if interventions outside the practice can be integrated with routine clinical care in Australian general practice. Our previous research and that of others suggests that referral of high risk patients to services to support lifestyle change is infrequent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>General practice preventive care in Australia has recently been enhanced by the introduction of health checks. A "Well Person's Health Check" in general practice for people aged 45-49 was introduced in November 2006, as a once-only service for those who have one or more identifiable risk factors for chronic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In 2008 a diabetes risk check was introduced for patients aged 40-49 which aimed to identify patients at high risk for diabetes, to introduce lifestyle interventions. Although these checks have been taken up by GPs, the referral rate of high risk patients for more intensive lifestyle interventions has been disappointingly low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><sec><title>Study Aim and Hypotheses</title><p>The aim of the HIPS is to evaluate the impact of a general practice intervention for patients at high risk of vascular disease on changes in behavioural and physiological risk factors (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Study hypotheses</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Primary Hypotheses</th><th align="left">Secondary Hypotheses</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">1.

This study involves three urban and two rural DGPs in NSW, which invited practices to participate in the study. Practices are identified from databases held at the DGP and are invited to participate in the study via a letter from the Division. Each DGP is asked to recruit eight practices to participate in the study (two of the urban DGPs participate as a pair, each aiming to recruit four practices). General practices are eligible to participate if they use computer-based medical records, are not involved in other research, and are located in the participating DGPs. All GPs and PNs in participating practices are invited to take part in the study (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>HIPS Recruitment Flowchart</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2296-11-57-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Recruitment of Patients</title><p>Participating practices are asked to search their electronic records to identify a list of 160 patients who meet the selection criteria (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Previous research suggests that 25% of these will be eligible and willing to participate. The rationale for the eligibility criteria is to recruit sufficient patients with high to moderate risk of cardiovascular disease or diabetes to participate in the full intervention (both in general practice and the referral program). Patients in the 40-55 age groups are targeted by existing health checks but are less likely to have multiple risk factors or to be at high CVD or diabetes risk. Thus in this age group we are specifically targeting those who already have physiological risk factors. Patients aged 56-64 are more likely to have multiple risk factors and also to be at increased risk because of their age. The majority of general practice patients older than 64 years have already developed a chronic disease.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Patient selection criteria</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2">Inclusion criteria</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">&#x02022; Aged 40-55 with hypertension and/or hyperlipidaemia</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">&#x02022; Aged 56-64</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2">&#x02022; Attended the practice in the last 12 months</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Exclusion criteria by practice</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Exclusion criteria by GP</bold></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Diagnosed or treated for:</td><td align="left">&#x02022; Has current severe illness or personal circumstances which are of overriding concern;</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02022; Diabetes</td><td/></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02022; Cardiovascular disease</td><td align="left">&#x02022; Is deceased (up to date medical records generally prevent this)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02022; Renal disease</td><td align="left">&#x02022; Is no longer a patient of the practice;</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02022; Stroke</td><td align="left">&#x02022; Is unable to speak adequate English;</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">&#x02022; Has diabetes or cardiovascular disease;</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">&#x02022; Is unlikely to be able to read and understand the information sheet and consent form because of significant cognitive impairment (e.g. dementia.)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Up to 160 eligible patients are sent a letter from the practice, signed by their GP, advising that the practice is participating in the research and that the patient has been randomly selected to be invited to participate (if the list exceeds 160 patients, 160 are randomly selected for recruitment).

While trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of intense interventions to prevent diabetes or cardiovascular disease, it has been difficult to replicate this within routine practice. This is one of the first studies in Australia to evaluate an intervention which includes assessment and brief intervention in routine general practice coupled with a more intensive referral-based intervention based in the local DGP. The trial is unique in that the intervention is delivered as part of routine practice (both in general practices and the DGP), and the study aims to examine its impact in both high and low risk patients. The study will also provide valuable qualitative data on the barriers and facilitators to implementing brief intervention and referral of high risk patients to more intensive intervention in the general practice setting.</p><p>The study involved a strong collaborative partnership with DGPs and non-government organizations such as the National Heart Foundation. These relationships are essential not only to recruit participants into the study but also to deliver an effective intervention and subsequently implement the findings.</p><p>The results of this study will help inform improvements to the implementation of primary prevention of vascular disease and inform the implementation of other preventive health initiatives which involve referral to group programs outside general practice, such as the 45-year-old health check and the diabetes risk assessment in Australian general practice. The findings of the study will be disseminated using peer-reviewed journals, conference presentations, and research summaries tailored for practitioners, service managers and policy makers. We anticipate that it will inform broader policies and strategies including:</p><p>&#x02022; defining the optimal roles of general practice staff, allied health providers and group referral programs in providing interventions for low and high risk patients</p><p>&#x02022; redesigning the pathways for referral and follow up of high risk patients</p><p>&#x02022; providing more effective support for primary prevention through DGPs in general practice;</p><p>&#x02022; redesigning the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) preventive care related item numbers;</p><p>&#x02022; integrating the complex preventive interventions required to prevent chronic diseases such as diabetes within routine general practice and its associated services and programs.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>All authors have contributed to study design and have reviewed and approved the final manuscript.
