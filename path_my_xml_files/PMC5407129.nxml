Additional objectives were to describe the serum bactericidal antibody responses elicited by bivalent rLP2086 against 4 MnB test strains expressing either fHBP subfamily A or B proteins different from the vaccine antigens 1 month after the second and third vaccinations with bivalent rLP2086. The safety profile is also described for participants who received DTaP/IPV and bivalent rLP2086 concomitantly and for those who received DTaP/IPV alone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Design</title><p>This was a phase II, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind study conducted at 34 sites in Finland, Germany, and Poland. The final protocol, any amendments, and informed-consent documents were reviewed and approved by independent ethics committees at the investigational centers (Ethics Committee of the Pirkanmaa Hospital District, Tampere, Finland; Arztekammer Schleswig-Holstein Ethics Committee, Bad Segeberg, Baden-Wurttemberg Landesarztekammer Ethics Commission, Stuttgart, Landesarztekammer Hesse Ethics Committee, Frankfurt, and Landesarztekammer Niedersachsen Ethics Committee, Hannover, and Landesaerztekammer Rhineland-Pfalz Ethics Committee, Mainz, and Bioethics Committee of the Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland). The study was conducted in compliance with the ethical principles originating in or derived from the Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with all International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All local regulatory requirements were followed. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant or the parent(s)/legal guardian(s) of each participant before enrollment and before performance of any study-related procedures. The participants were randomly assigned using an interactive voice-response system, interactive Web-based response system, or an equivalent system that was accessible at all times.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study Participants</title><p>Included in the study were healthy adolescents &#x02265;11 to &#x0003c;19 years of age at enrollment who had received the full series of DTaP/IPV vaccines per the country-specific recommendations applicable at the time of vaccination. Key exclusion criteria included previous vaccination with any MnB vaccine, vaccination with any diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, or poliomyelitis virus vaccine within 5 years of the first study vaccination, previous vaccine-related anaphylactic reaction, contraindication to diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, or poliomyelitis virus vaccine, bleeding disorders, known or suspected disease of the immune system or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy, any significant neurologic disorder, any neuroinflammatory or autoimmune condition, history of culture-proven disease caused by <italic>N meningitidis</italic> or <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic>, current chronic systemic antibiotic use, or current pregnancy or breastfeeding.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Interventions</title><p>Participants in the bivalent rLP2086 + DTaP/IPV group received 1 intramuscular dose of bivalent rLP2086 (0.5 mL) in the left arm and 1 intramuscular dose of DTaP/IPV (0.5 mL) in the right arm at month 0 and 1 dose of bivalent rLP2086 at months 2 and 6. Participants in the saline +DTaP/IPV group received 1 intramuscular dose of saline (0.5 mL) in the left arm and 1 intramuscular dose of DTaP/IPV (0.5 mL) in the right arm at month 0, and 1 dose of saline at months 2 and 6. The study protocol required blood samples to be obtained before vaccination 1, 1 month (28&#x02013;41 days) after vaccination 1 to assess immune responses to the DTaP/IPV antigens, and 1 month after vaccinations 2 and 3 (28&#x02013;42 days) to assess bactericidal antibody responses elicited by bivalent rLP2086.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Vaccines</title><p>Each 0.5-mL dose of bivalent rLP2086 contained 60 &#x003bc;g each of a purified subfamily A and a purified subfamily B rLP2086 protein, a 2.8 molar ratio of polysorbate 80 to protein, and 0.25 mg of Al<sup>3+</sup> as aluminum phosphate (AlPO<sub>4</sub>) in 10 mM histidine-buffered saline at pH 6.0.

These levels were the same or higher than those used in the pivotal phase III trials in adolescents, which formed the basis for Repevax licensure [<xref rid="PIV064C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Immune responses to the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis components of DTaP/IPV were assessed by using a multiplexed Luminex assay. Immune responses to poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 were measured by using poliovirus neutralization assays. Additional descriptive end points for the primary objective were antibody levels to DTaP/IPV antigens measured as geometric mean titers (GMTs) or geometric mean concentrations 1 month after vaccination 1. End points for assessing immune responses to bivalent rLP2086 included the GMT and the proportion of participants in whom prespecified serum bactericidal antibody titers were achieved, according to the results of serum bactericidal assays using human complement (hSBAs) 1 month after bivalent rLP2086 vaccination [<xref rid="PIV064C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The hSBA was based on the assay described by the World Health Organization [<xref rid="PIV064C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and Borrow and Carlone [<xref rid="PIV064C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and was reported previously [<xref rid="PIV064C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The hSBA titer is the reciprocal of the highest 2-fold dilution of a test serum that results in at least a 50% reduction in MnB bacteria (50% bacterial survival) compared to the T<sub>30</sub> colony-forming-unit value (ie, the number of bacteria surviving after incubation in assay wells containing all assay components except test serum; 100% bacterial survival). Titers were reported as step titers (ie, 1:4, 1:8, 1:16, etc). The hSBA responses were defined as the proportion of participants with an hSBA titer greater than or equal to the lower limit of quantitation of the assay (ie, an hSBA titer of &#x02265;1:8 for MnB test strains expressing fHBP subfamily A [A56] or B [B24 or B44] variants or an hSBA titer of &#x02265;1:16 for the other fHBP subfamily A test strain [A22]). Serum samples collected before vaccination 1 and after vaccinations 2 and 3 were tested in hSBA; sera from approximately 50% of the randomly selected participants were evaluated in hSBAs performed with MnB test strains PMB80 [A22] and PMB2948 [B24], and the other 50% were tested in hSBAs with PMB2001 [A56] and PMB2701 [B44].</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Safety Assessments</title><p>Information on local reactions (redness, swelling, and pain) at the site of bivalent rLP2086 + saline injections, systemic events, and the use of antipyretic medications was collected for 7 days after each vaccination by using an e-diary. Local reactions at the site of DTaP/IPV injection have been reported previously [<xref rid="PIV064C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and were not monitored by e-diary in this study. Data on unsolicited adverse events (AEs) were collected from enrollment through 1 month after the last vaccination, and data on serious AEs (SAEs) were collected throughout the study.

The noninferiority criterion was &#x02212;0.1 (or &#x02212;10%); the rate of response to each antigen in the bivalent rLP2086 + DTaP/IPV group was assumed to be 2% less than the rate of response in the saline + DTaP/IPV group. Assuming the response for each antigen was independent, the overall power for declaring noninferiority in this study, using an exact method, was approximately 93% with 300 evaluable participants per group (type I error rate of 2.5% [1-sided test of noninferiority]). A total of 750 participants were enrolled in the study by using a 1:1 randomization ratio and assuming a 20% dropout rate.</p><p>The proportion of participants in whom the prespecified antibody-level criteria for DTaP/IPV antigens by 1 month after vaccination 1 were achieved was computed along with the difference in proportions (bivalent rLP2086 + DTaP/IPV group &#x02013; saline + DTaP/IPV group) and a 2-sided 95% exact confidence interval (CI) for the difference [<xref rid="PIV064C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. If the lower bound of the 95% CI on the difference is greater than &#x02212;10% for all 9 antigens in the DTaP/IPV, then the study achieved the noninferiority objective. The proportions of participants with an hSBA titer of &#x02265;1:8 (A56, B24, B44) or &#x02265;1:16 (A22) were summarized with exact 2-sided 95% CIs (or Clopper&#x02013;Pearson confidence limits).

Concurrent administration of approved vaccines to adolescents could increase adherence to the recommended vaccination schedules in this population. Data from this study support the concomitant administration to adolescents of the investigational vaccine, bivalent rLP2086 + DTaP/IPV. The primary objective of this study was met. Immune responses to DTaP/IPV antigens induced after concurrent DTaP/IPV and bivalent rLP2086 vaccination were noninferior to the immune response induced by DTaP/IPV alone.</p><p>In this study, 2 doses of bivalent rLP2086 generated substantial and broadly protective serum bactericidal antibody responses, as measured in hSBAs against 4 diverse MnB test strains. Three doses of the vaccine elicited the most robust hSBA response (ie, responder rates). The MnB test strains used in this study express fHBP variants that are different (heterologous) from the protein variants present in the vaccine and represent the epidemiologically relevant diversity of fHBP variants identified in disease-causing isolates. On the basis of fHBP subgroup, these 4 MnB test strains are representative of &#x0003e;90% of the invasive MnB disease-causing isolates in the United States and Europe combined [<xref rid="PIV064C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Although an hSBA titer of &#x02265;1:4 is the recognized immunologic correlate of protection from meningococcal disease [<xref rid="PIV064C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="PIV064C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], the hSBA titers used in this study to measure a protective level were &#x02265;1:8 for 3 of the 4 MnB test strains and &#x02265;1:16 for the fourth and thus assessed protective bivalent rLP2086 immune responses according to a more stringent measure. More than 80% of the participants had an hSBA titer that exceeded these levels for 3 of the test strains after the second vaccination and exceeded these levels for all 4 of the test strains after the third vaccination (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PIV064F2">2</xref>). In addition, GMTs for all the test strains were substantially greater than 1:4 after bivalent rLP2086 vaccinations 2 and 3. Thus, as shown in this study, both 2 and 3 vaccinations with bivalent rLP2086 elicited broadly protective immune responses against MnB in a high proportion of the participants according to a measure well above the correlate of protection. In contrast, baseline responses in adolescent participants were generally low, which is expected for a population vulnerable to MnB infection and disease. The results of this study are consistent with the results of a phase II dosing study of bivalent rLP2086 in which bivalent rLP2086 elicited a substantial and broad immune response after 2 doses and a more robust response after 3 doses across a range of dosing schedules (our unpublished data). Safety data suggest that the bivalent rLP2086 vaccine was generally safe and well tolerated when given in 3 doses and when given concomitantly with DTaP/IPV. These safety and noninferiority data suggest that the administration of bivalent rLP2086 + DTaP/IPV can be completed during the same office or clinic visit. This result is important because the simultaneous administration of multiple vaccines is not only more convenient but also increases the probability that recommended immunization schedules will be followed [<xref rid="PIV064C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Additional studies of the bivalent rLP2086 vaccine administered concurrently with other vaccines commonly used in adolescent and young adult populations are ongoing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Immune responses to DTaP/IPV administered with bivalent rLP2086 to adolescents were noninferior to DTaP/IPV administered alone. Bivalent rLP2086 was well tolerated and elicited substantial and broad bactericidal responses to diverse MnB strains in a high proportion of recipients after 2 vaccinations, and these responses were further enhanced after 3 vaccinations.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Writing support was provided by Daniel E.
