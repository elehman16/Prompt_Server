After demineralization, half the surface of each specimen was covered with a nail varnish to serve as the reference surface. The dentin specimens were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: F-, CHX&#x02013;thymol, and control (no treatment).

</xref>. Bifluoride is a commercially available high-concentration fluoride varnish used for topical fluoridation. It contains a combination of two fluorides: 5% sodium fluoride (NaF) (22,600 ppm F-) and 5% calcium fluoride (CaF2).</p><p>Non-fluoride agents may serve as adjunctive therapeutics for preventing, arresting, or even reversing dental caries. Studies have shown that CHX can be used for the control of plaque formation and caries prevention<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref>. CHX has been reported to reduce the self-degradation of collagen fibrils by inhibiting host-derived protease activity in demineralized dentin. Theoretically, if the collagen fibril scaffold of demineralized dentin maintains its original cross-linkage pattern on treatment with CHX and appropriate supplementation with necessary mineral sources, dentin remineralization may occur in demineralized lesions<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">

However, currently, to the best of our knowledge, there seems to be no study comparing the efficacy of a 1% CHX&#x02013;1% thymol varnish with that of a high-concentration fluoride varnish on demineralized dentin. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 10% F<sup>-</sup> and a 1% CHX&#x02013;1% thymol varnish on the remineralization of demineralized dentin surfaces <italic>in situ</italic>, in comparison to that in a control group with no treatment. The null hypothesis to be tested was that there is no difference in the effectiveness of 10% F<sup>-</sup> and 1% CHX&#x02013;1% thymol in re-mineralization and in the formation of caries-like dentin lesions in comparison with a control group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>Twelve volunteers (one male and eleven females) with a mean age of 32.5&#x000b1;11.8 years participated in this study. Fifteen participants were originally recruited, but only twelve were able to complete the study. The first 15 subjects, who were interested, agreed to participate in the study and fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria, were required to sign the informed consent form and were enrolled in the study. The study was single-blinded, whereby the participants were blinded to their allocations. The subjects were all randomly divided into three groups. This study was a cross-over study; therefore, all 15 of the subjects have an equal chance of being assigned to the three groups. The specimens were analyzed by an examiner, who was also blinded.</p><p>All participants signed an informed consent form. No participant indicated the presence of systemic disease in his/her medical history. An intraoral examination confirmed that each participant had at least 22 natural teeth with no current caries activity, gingivitis, periodontal disease, or other oral pathology. None of the volunteers was using antibiotics or other medications that could have affected the salivary flow rate. The exclusion criteria were the presence of any systemic illness, pregnancy or breastfeeding, the use of fixed or removable orthodontic appliances, the use of a fluoride mouthrinse or professional fluoride application in the preceding two months, and hyposalivation. The salivary flow rate was quantitatively checked during oral examination, and a salivary flow rate under 0.1 mL/min was considered as hyposalivation. All participants had an unstimulated salivary flow rate of more than 0.1 mL/min. They were instructed to use the same toothpaste containing 1500 ppm Olaflur and Potassium Hydroxide (Elmex sensitiv; GABA, L&#x000f6;rrach, Germany) and toothbrush (Elmex Kariesschutz Inter X, GABA, L&#x000f6;rrach, Germany), starting four weeks prior to and continuing throughout the experimental period.</p><p>The study was approved by the ethical committee of the University of D&#x000fc;sseldorf, Germany (No. 3313), and the full trial protocol can be accessed there.

<italic>In situ</italic> study</title><p>Each participant received an oral prophylaxis at the initial visit to establish a plaque- and calculus-free baseline. Thereafter, participants were randomly assigned to one of the three groups. A removable appliance was fabricated with an orthodontic wire (Dentaurum, Ispringen, Germany) and resin (Dentaurum) for the lower jaw of each participant. Four dentin specimens were inserted into both buccal aspects of the intraoral appliance, two specimens in the premolar and two in the molar region (<xref rid="f02" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The specimens of the appliances (not part of the experimental period) were stored in Ringer&#x02019;s solution (0.9% NaCl Deltaselect GmbH, Pfullingen, Germany). The specimens were placed in the intraoral appliance with varnish coverage. After 24 h, the specimen surfaces were located 1 mm under the appliance surface to promote plaque accumulation. Four specimens were randomly chosen for every period and participant. Patients were instructed to wear the appliances approximately 24 h a day, to rinse their appliances under tap water, and to refrain from brushing the specimens. The appliance was meant to be removed only twice, during toothbrushing and during the three daily meals. At these times, the appliance was stored in a 10% sucrose solution at room temperature. This process was chosen to continue the demineralization process and avoid drying the specimens. The specimens were rinsed after the sucrose immersion. Before and between each four-week testing period, there was a 1-week washout period. Thus, after completion of all three groups, all participants should have worn the appliance for a total of 12 weeks.</p><p>

Thereafter, the specimens were rinsed in deionized water for 2 min and sectioned perpendicular to the varnished area of the dentin. These transverse sections contained the experimental group and reference group in one section. Thin dentin sections (DS), 100 &#x000b5;m in thickness, 1.5&#x02013;2.0 mm in width, and 5 mm in length, were obtained and polished with sandpaper (4000 grit). The DS samples were microradiographed together with an aluminum reference step-wedge on a high-speed holographic film (SO-253: Kodak, Stuttgart, Germany). The x-ray source (PW 1830/40; Philips, Kassel, Germany) had a nickel-filtered copper (CuK&#x003b1;) radiation , and the x-ray settings were 20 kV and 20 mA for 12 s.

Similarly, the lesion depth reduction was calculated between the exposed and reference areas in the center of each area, which was 1.25 mm away from the perimeter of the dentin disc, thus resulting in sites of analysis that were 2.5 mm apart.

The medians (25<sup>th</sup>/75<sup>th</sup> percentile) of lesion depth were 13.6 (5.7-34.5) for chlorhexidine varnish, 16.5 (5.6-38.1) for fluoride varnish, and -14.2 (-4.5- -32.9) for the control group. Use of the 10% F<sup>- </sup> or 1% CHX&#x02013;1% thymol varnishes resulted in significantly decreased mineral loss and lesion depth in dentin compared with the control group.</p><p>The changes in integrated mineral loss and in lesion depth were significantly higher in the 10% F<sup>- </sup> and 1% CHX&#x02013;1% thymol groups compared with those in the control group (<xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04">4</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f05">Figure 5</xref> shows three samples of mineral profiles of lesions remineralized with either 1% CHX&#x02013;1% thymol or with 10% F<sup>- </sup>or in the control group.

Hence, the primary outcome of this study was confirmed. The results of the fluoride group were comparable to the known results of the effectivity of topical application of highly concentrated fluoride formulations in caries prevention<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref>. The caries-preventive effect of fluoride is mainly attributed to its effects on demineralization/remineralization at the tooth&#x02013;oral fluid interface<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>. The primary mode of fluoride action is the inhibition of demineralization and enhancement of remineralization<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>22</sup>
</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> enamel or dentin remineralization experiments have demonstrated that, with increasing concentrations of fluoride, the calcium loss from enamel and dentin was reversed under acidic conditions, thus promoting remineralization and inhibiting demineralization<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. The results of the present study with a higher fluoride concentration, a combination of 5% NaF (equal to 22,600 ppm fluoride) and 5% CaF<sub>2, </sub>were congruent with these studies.</p><p>The CHX mechanism may assert that the interaction between CHX and apatit is not adsorptive, but reactive. CHX may be due to electrostatic links with the phosphate groups in the hydroxyapatite of the dentin and saliva, which could favor the precipitation of phosphate salts on the reactive surface of demineralized dentin<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">

<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. An <italic>in vitro</italic> study reported the direct effects of CHX on the remineralization of demineralized dentin. It showed that the application of 0.2% and 2% CHX, which inhibits the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity, seemed to be effective in promoting the remineralization of demineralized dentin. CHX could keep the collagen cross-linkage sound by inhibiting the MMP activity. Remineralization would then happen around the remaining mineral crystals by obtaining mineral sources from a simulated body fluid (SBF)<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>. 1% CHX&#x02013;1% thymol has inhibitory effects on the demineralization of dentin<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>. Our results also confirm that 1% CHX&#x02013;1% thymol was effective in the remineralization of dentin compared with the control group. Current studies have reported that the artificial protein formed due to the mineralization process on human dentin provides a general strategy to prepare various promising restorative materials for biomineralized hard tissues such as bone and teeth. These agents could be potentially applicable in a clinical situation in the future, to remineralize the demineralized dentin<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>.</p><p>Generally, our results are in agreement with the other studies, but have some limitations regarding the clinical situation. Caries is a complex phenomenon influenced by systemic defense factors and a number of external ones. There is no doubt that these factors differ in every individual and play a significant role in dentin demineralization. Classical risk factors of caries, such as eating habits, salivary flow rate, and oral hygiene, are individual-dependent. Therefore, 12 individuals were chosen for this study. In addition, root caries is a dental disease caused by exposure of the root surfaces, thus allowing the microorganisms to erode the dentin directly. The structure and composition of root-dentin and crown-dentin is not similar. Older individuals show a decrease in the components and quality of saliva. The participants of this study were young and did not present root caries, but they carried demineralized dentin specimens, as in another study<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>27</sup>
</xref>. Furthermore, the dentin used in the study was crown-dentin (below enamel). Both the aforementioned factors were limitations of this study. Another limitation was that the subjects were instructed to remove the appliance only during tooth brushing (twice a day) and meals (four times a day for a maximum of 1 h each). The standardized 10% sucrose solution was renewed every day.</p><p>Before and between each four-week testing period, there was a 1-week washout period to avoid a sequence effect. This is a common method of minimizing carry-over effects, and ensures that the participants start each test period under the same conditions.</p><p>In our study, the mineral loss after demineralization in the control group was more than that of the chlorhexidine and fluoride groups. It was decided to randomly distribute the specimens before the start of each phase, as extracted human teeth usually exhibit an inconsistent age and source; these factors may bring about a variance in the tooth composition, which then leads to larger variations in the demineralization process. Therefore, the remineralization progression was not linear during the whole treatment, which may have led to a different effect in different stages with the same intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Based on the results and within the limitations of this study, we conclude that the single use of 10% F<sup>- </sup>or 1% CHX&#x02013;1% thymol have a considerably better effect on the remineralization of demineralized dentin surfaces <italic>in situ </italic>than a no-treatment control group. These may be beneficial in preventing dentin demineralization. Since this preliminary investigation may provide a valuable insight into the clinical indication of a high-concentration fluoride varnish, future research in the form of clinical trials would be valuable. Subsequent studies dedicated to analyzing the frequency of applications and the investigation of the best method to exert a prolonged anti-caries effect are suggested.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The support of Prof. Dr. E.
