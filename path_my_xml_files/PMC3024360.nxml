In recent years, the research aiming to explore the genetic basis of type 2 diabetes has progressed significantly. Currently, &#x0003e;30 genetic variants have been identified in large multicenter studies with sufficient power to be associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Typically, each variant has only a limited effect on the risk, i.e., the risk may increase by 10 to 15% per copy of each risk allele except for <italic>TCF7L2,</italic> which is so far the most convincing type 2 diabetes risk gene, increasing the risk 1.4-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The known risk variants explain only &#x0223c;10% of the genetic basis of type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). On the basis of findings in a limited number of longitudinal studies, the risk variants have only a small effect on the ability to predict the development of type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In two lifestyle-based diabetes prevention trials in persons with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study (DPS), it has been possible to examine the interaction between genetic and lifestyle factors regarding the future risk of diabetes. In these studies, lifestyle changes modified the risk of diabetes depending on the genetic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Specifically, the increased risk of type 2 diabetes was completely abolished by lifestyles in both DPP and DPS among the persons with the risk allele for <italic>TCF7L2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). It is commonly believed that type 2 diabetes is highly heritable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), and a positive family history (FH+) predicts the development of type 2 diabetes even after adjustment for common risk factors for type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). In the DPP, the known genetic risk variants were not associated with an increased risk of diabetes, and only one potential genotype-intervention interaction for <italic>CDKN2A/B</italic> was reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). However, the responses to lifestyle according to FH of diabetes were not documented.</p><p>The aim of the current study was to investigate whether an FH+ of diabetes or genetic variants of type 2 diabetes could modulate the effect of lifestyle changes achieved in the Finnish DPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) on the incidence of type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, we aimed to assess the ability of FH and genetic risk variants, in addition to lifestyle changes and basic clinical variables, to predict the incidence of type 2 diabetes in individuals at high risk of type 2 diabetes.</p><sec id="s5"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>The DPS is a clinical trial with five participating centers (Helsinki, Kuopio, Turku, Tampere, and Oulu) in Finland (NCT00518167). Details of the DPS study design, methods, and procedures have been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Briefly, study participants were recruited mainly by screening of high-risk groups who voluntarily responded to local advertisements. The inclusion criteria were 1) age 40&#x02013;64 years at screening, 2) BMI &#x0003e;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> at screening, and 3) the mean value of two 75-g oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) in the IGT range based on World Health Organization 1985 criteria. Exclusion criteria included recent (within 6 months) cardiovascular disease event. The randomization of participants started in 1993 and continued until 1998.</p><p>A total of 522 overweight men and women were randomly allocated to one of the two treatment modalities, the intensive diet-exercise counseling group (<italic>n</italic> = 265, 66% were women) or the control group (<italic>n</italic> = 257, 69% were women). The participants randomized to intensive lifestyle intervention were given individualized counseling by the study nutritionists to achieve the lifestyle goals. They were also advised to increase their level of physical activity, and voluntary physical activity sessions were offered. The lifestyle goals were <italic>1</italic>) weight reduction of &#x02265;5%, <italic>2</italic>) &#x0003c;30% of the daily energy intake from fat, <italic>3</italic>) &#x0003c;10% of the daily energy intake from saturated fat, <italic>4</italic>) fiber intake &#x02265;15 g per 1,000 kcal, and <italic>5</italic>) moderately intense physical activity &#x02265;30 min per day. The control participants were given general health behavior information at randomization. The median length of the active intervention period was 4 years (range 1&#x02212;6 years).</p><p>All participants had an annual OGTT, a medical history, and a physical examination with measurements of height (without shoes), weight (in light indoor clothes), waist circumference (midway between the lowest rib and iliac crest), and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Serum total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were determined from fasting samples using an enzymatic assay method.</p><p>The diagnosis of diabetes was based on the repeated OGTT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). FH of diabetes was based on a questionnaire applied in the DPS. If one of the first-degree relatives (father, mother, sister, brother) had diabetes, FH was regarded as positive (FH+). These data are based on the follow-up of 4 years when active intervention was finished and on the 3 years of follow-up after active intervention with a total follow-up of an average of 6.2 years (median 7 years). Altogether, 75 persons (28%) in the intervention group and 110 persons (43%) in the control group developed diabetes during the entire follow-up. During the entire study period, the incidence of diabetes was substantially lower in the intervention group compared with the control group (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.43&#x02212;0.76, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).

Changes during follow-up (&#x00394; values between the value at 1 year of follow-up and the baseline value) in body weight, glucose, and other variables were analyzed with the general linear model, adjusting for age, sex, study center, BMI, and fasting glucose at baseline. Interaction between FH and the randomization group was tested for each model, modeled as fixed factor. Variables with non-normal distribution were log-transformed before analyses. Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method was used to estimate the incidence of diabetes in the two groups. The difference in incidence between the groups was tested with the log-rank test. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratio for the development of diabetes between the groups. Hazard ratios for continuous traits are expressed as unit change per 1 SD. If not stated otherwise, the models were adjusted for age, sex, BMI at baseline, fasting glucose at baseline, and study center. No multicollinearity problems were found for any model. Interaction between FH (or GRS) and randomization group was modeled as a covariate in Cox regression. All comparisons of the end points were based on the intention-to-treat principle.

FH did not affect the result of lifestyle intervention during the entire follow-up. We did not observe any aggregation of known genetic risk variants in persons with FH+, nor did genetic risk variants modify the incidence of diabetes. On the basis of different analyses, in addition to the intervention, fasting and 2-h plasma glucose and fasting insulin at baseline, and the 1-year changes of 2-h plasma glucose and 2-h insulin were the main determinants of the development of diabetes during the follow-up, independently of the effects of genetic risk variants and FH.</p><p>Although the participants with FH+ seemed to have a lower incidence of diabetes than those with FH&#x02212; during the first 4 years of follow-up when the active intervention was carried out, this early difference disappeared during the entire follow-up. The seemingly better early response could be explained by the fact that individuals with FH+ may be more aware of the risk of diabetes than others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) and thus more motivated, as suggested by their greater decrease in total caloric intake during the first year of intervention (<italic>P</italic> = 0.012). In addition, the mean 1-year change in the 2-h plasma glucose values was greater among the participants with FH+ in the lifestyle intervention group. It should be noticed that at baseline no differences were found in any clinical or biochemical measurements, which could explain the present findings of the differences during the intervention phase in the incidence of diabetes between individuals with FH+ and FH&#x02212;.</p><p>The known genetic risk variants were not associated with the FH of diabetes. However, this may not be an unexpected finding because it is known that risk loci confer only 10% of the risk of type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Furthermore, all participants in the DPS had screened IGT based on two OGTTs and &#x0003e;60% had an FH+, which also might indicate an aggregation of genetic risk variants. In the general population, FH+ varies from 25% to 40% depending on selection of populations in different studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). It could be argued that a small sample size could explain why no significant association between genetic risk variants and FH or the type 2 diabetes risk was found. However, this may not be the case, because in regression analyses not even a trend to an association with the diabetes risk was found. It is of note that the total number of diabetes cases was 185 during the entire follow-up. This figure is almost comparable to 255 cases in the Framingham Offspring Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), including 2,377 participants with 28 years of follow-up. In that study, the adjusted C-statistic was 0.595 without the genotype score and 0.615 with the score (<italic>P</italic> = 0.11). In a larger study on Swedish and Finnish cohorts, including 18,831 individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), of whom 2,201 developed diabetes during a median follow-up of 23.5 years, the addition of specific genetic information to clinical factors slightly improved the prediction of future diabetes, from 0.74 to 0.75 (the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve); however, the <italic>P</italic> value was significant (<italic>P</italic> = 1.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>). These results are in line with the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and Nurses&#x02019; Health Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) applying a case-control study design, in which GRS based on 10 polymorphisms in nine loci increased the predictive value from 0.78 to 0.79 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). In the latter study, however, glucose values were not included in the analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In both the DPP and DPS, in which gene&#x02013;lifestyle interactions have been examined, lifestyle changes abolished the increased risk of type 2 diabetes in the carriers of the risk allele at <italic>TCF7L2</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). No other studies have used a similar approach. Thus, lifestyle intervention per se, at least in part, seems to abolish the genetic risk associations observed in observational cross-sectional and longitudinal studies.</p><p>The main predictors of the incidence of type 2 diabetes in our study were the lifestyle intervention, fasting and 2-h glucose, fasting insulin at baseline, and 1-year change in 2-h glucose and 2-h insulin. The finding that the 1-year changes in the 2-h glucose and insulin levels were powerful predictors of diabetes, whereas the 1-year change in fasting glucose level, which primarily reflects insulin secretion, did not contribute to the success rate of prevention, suggests a significant role of an improvement of insulin sensitivity along with weight reduction. Indeed, in a substudy of DPS, there was a marked improvement of insulin sensitivity based on intravenous glucose tolerance test along with weight loss, but only small changes were found in insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Overall, these results show that an elevation of fasting glucose with poor insulin secretion capacity and the degree of insulin resistance and obesity remain the main predictive factors among known risk factors for type 2 diabetes. We cannot exclude the possibility that the known genetic risk variants could have been operative in an earlier phase of development of diabetes, but along with this line, the changes in lifestyle also might be more effective in earlier phases of this disease.</p><p>Because insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity are not independent of each other, both mechanisms could be operative when searching biological explanations for the markedly decreased risk of diabetes in prevention trials such as the DPS. It has been hypothesized that lifestyle intervention may have beneficial effects on insulin secretion avoiding the exhaustion of &#x003b2;-cells and thus delaying the progression of disturbed insulin secretion capacity. Because the decrease in the 2-h glucose and insulin had a marked impact on the risk reduction of diabetes, we believe that an improvement in insulin sensitivity and perhaps concomitant recovery of &#x003b2;-cell sensitivity to glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) could mainly explain the observed beneficial effects of changing lifestyles on the diabetes risk.</p><p>To conclude, conventional risk factors and lifestyle changes known to decrease the risk of diabetes are the most important predictors of type 2 diabetes in persons with IGT, and lifestyle changes overcome the impact of the known genetic and familial risk. This information is important both for health professionals and for persons at increased risk for type 2 diabetes. Our results in conjunction with some former population-based studies and the DPP genetic studies indicate that genetic risk testing at this point may not offer much additional information applicable to prevention strategies of type 2 diabetes to that obtained from patients&#x02019; FH and the well-known clinical risk markers.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
