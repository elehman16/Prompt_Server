With advances in the field of surgery, surgical procedures have become more complex and the operating time has increased manifold with a consequent need to increase the duration of the BPB. To achieve this, many drugs have been used as adjuncts to the local anesthetics (LA). Clonidine is one of them, which is an<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist with hypotensive, sedative, and analgesic properties.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] It is, however, not free of adverse effects, the most commonly observed being dry mouth, sedation, hypotension, and bradycardia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>However, till date, there has been no consensus about the ideal dose of clonidine as an adjunct to LA in the BPB. The present study was planned to evaluate two different doses of clonidine added to 0.5% bupivacaine&#x02212;1 and 2 g/kg, with regards to onset and duration of sensorimotor blockade, hemodynamic variables, postoperative analgesia, and adverse effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The hospital ethical committee approved the prospective, double-blinded randomized study and a written informed consent from all the patients was obtained. Sixty adult patients (18-65 years) of either sex, weight range (40-90 kg), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade I, II, scheduled for upper limb surgeries were randomly allocated by a computer generated randomization list into two groups. Patients were given supraclavicular BPB with 30 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine with clonidine as adjuvant in the dose of either 1 g/kg (Group I; <italic>n</italic> = 30) or 2 g/kg (Group II; <italic>n</italic> = 30) using a peripheral nerve stimulator. Patients having peripheral neuropathy or motor weakness, uncontrolled systemic illness, infection at the site of the block, history of coagulopathy or anticoagulant medication intake, hypersensitivity to any of the study drug and those with inadequate block were excluded from the study.</p><p>All patients were premedicated with oral diazepam 0.2 mg/kg on the night before surgery. In the operation theatre parameters recorded included heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) at baseline and every 15 min thereafter. BPB was performed by supraclavicular approach using peripheral nerve stimulator (Stimuplex DIG RC, B Braun Medical Inc., Malaysia) in all the patients by the same anesthesiologist who was blinded to the composition of the LA mixture.</p><p>The onset of sensory block was evaluated by the loss of temperature sense (by the cold test tube method)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] in the forearm. Assessment of motor blockade was done using 3-point modified Bromage score[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]0 &#x02212; normal motor function with full extension and flexion of elbow, wrist, and fingers, 1 &#x02212; decreased motor strength, with ability to move only fingers, 2 &#x02212; complete motor block with inability to move elbow, wrist, and fingers. Both intraoperative and postoperative sedation was rated by using the 4-point sedation score:[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]0 &#x02212; awake, 1 &#x02212; drowsy, 2 &#x02212; sleeping but arousable on verbal command, 3 &#x02212; sleeping and arousable only on tactile stimulation.</p><p>Duration of sensory and motor blockade was assessed every hour till the recovery of sensations by an anesthesiologist who was blinded to the study groups. Postoperative pain was assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS) (0 &#x02212; no pain to 10 &#x02212; worst pain)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] every hour till the block lasted. The end-point of the study was time from performance of the block to the onset of pain as determined by VAS score of 4 or more. Rescue analgesia was provided with tramadol 2 mg/kg intravenous (IV). Postoperative vitals (HR, SBP, DBP, MAP, SpO<sub>2</sub>) were recorded every 2 h for the first 6 h and thereafter every 4 h till the need for rescue analgesia (tramadol 2 mg/kg IV). The incidence of side effects (bradycardia, hypotension, and sedation) was also recorded. Bradycardia was defined as a decrease in HR by 20% from the baseline value or an absolute HR &#x0003e; 50 beats per min; which was managed by 0.6 mg IV bolus of atropine. Hypotension was defined as fall in blood pressure by 20% from the baseline or an absolute MAP &#x0003e; 60 mm Hg; which was managed by a bolus of IV crystalloids or increments of mephentermine 3 mg IV.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Sample size was based on a pilot study of 10 patients and was selected to detect a projected difference of 20% in duration of postoperative analgesia between the groups, with a type I error of 0.05 and a power of 0.8. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (version 12.0; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) software and graphs were produced using Microsoft Excel for MAC 2011 (version 14.1.2). Parametric data were recorded as arithmetic mean &#x000b1; standard deviation. Chi-square analysis was used to compare the qualitative variables.

Hemodynamics remained stable throughout the study period with both the doses.

Hence, the present study was undertaken to find the appropriate dose of clonidine used as an adjuvant to peripheral nerve blockade without significant adverse outcomes. We chose bupivacaine because controversy still exists about using clonidine as an adjuvant to long-acting LA such as ropivacaine and bupivacaine where in some studies support its addition to peripheral nerve block,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] while others contradict it.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>In our study, the onset of sensory and motor block was earlier with the higher dose of clonidine (2 g/kg). Both Bernard and Macaire[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] and Iohom <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] have reported a faster onset of sensorimotor block with the use of clonidine as an adjuvant to LA than plain LA.

This can be explained by the fact that clonidine increases potassium conductance and blocks the conduction of C and A fibers. Besides, clonidine also enhances lidocaine-induced inhibition of C-fiber compound action potential. Lipophilic nature of clonidine allows rapid absorption into cerebrospinal fluid and binding to 2-adrenoceptor of spinal cord causing blockade at primary afferent terminals (both spinal as well as peripheral nerve endings).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Similar to our study, both Hutschala <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] and El Saied <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] observed longer duration of analgesia and motor block with the use of clonidine as an adjuvant as compared to placebo.
