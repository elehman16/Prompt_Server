If mean arterial pressure (MAP) &#x02265;65&#x000a0;mmHg was not maintained, open-label norepinephrine was added. Co-primary endpoints were maintenance of MAP &#x0003e;60&#x000a0;mmHg without norepinephrine, norepinephrine dose, and proportion of patients maintaining MAP &#x0003e;60&#x000a0;mmHg with or without norepinephrine over 7&#x000a0;days.

However, vasopressin infusion has been used to replace norepinephrine to maintain adequate systemic arterial pressure (e.g., in patients refractory to norepinephrine) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In a large, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, norepinephrine-controlled trial (the Vasopressin and Septic Shock Trial [VASST]), vasopressin decreased mortality compared with norepinephrine in patients with less severe septic shock, although the overall mortality was not different [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The researchers in the VAsopressin versus Noradrenaline as Initial therapy in Septic sHock (VANISH) randomized controlled trial of vasopressin vs. norepinephrine found no differences in rates of acute kidney injury, the primary endpoint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Vasopressin infusion is currently recommended as a second-line vasopressor for septic shock in the Surviving Sepsis Guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and is used clinically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Selepressin, a novel, selective vasopressin V<sub>1A</sub> receptor agonist, is a potent vasopressor, and it has also been shown to reduce fluid requirements and limit edema formation in animal septic shock models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and is now in clinical development for the treatment of septic shock. In a phase I first-in-human trial, selepressin infusion in 30 healthy subjects with infusion rates up to 3.0&#x000a0;ng/kg/minute for 6&#x000a0;h showed V<sub>1A</sub>-agonistic vasopressor properties, was safe and well tolerated, and showed no signs of vasopressin V<sub>2</sub> activity (Ferring Pharmaceuticals A/S, unpublished data). In this first-in-patient pilot phase IIa randomized, placebo-controlled trial, the hypothesis was that selepressin maintains adequate arterial pressure in the absence of norepinephrine and shortens the duration of organ dysfunction in patients with early septic shock.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par8">This was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase IIa trial investigating three ascending doses of selepressin in patients with early septic shock. Patients were recruited into the trial between 2009 and 2011 in Belgium, Denmark, and the United States in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the principles of good clinical practice. The study protocol and informed consent documents were approved by the independent ethics committees or research ethics boards of all participating institutions, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients, their next of kin, or another surrogate decision maker as appropriate prior to enrollment. The study was approved by the competent regulatory authorities of each country participating in the trial. An independent data safety and monitoring committee evaluated the safety of the dose regimens prior to escalating to the next dose level.</p><p id="Par9">At each dose level, patients were randomized to constant intravenous infusion of selepressin or placebo in a ratio of 2:1. Open-label norepinephrine was concomitantly administered to maintain the treatment target MAP of &#x02265;65&#x000a0;mmHg. Study drug infusion continued as long as arterial pressure support was deemed necessary, but no longer than 7&#x000a0;days. Patients needing vasopressor support after 7&#x000a0;days were switched from study drug infusion to norepinephrine or another vasopressor. Assessments were performed during study drug treatment and up to 4&#x000a0;weeks after study drug initiation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study population</title><p id="Par10">Patients with hypotension in early septic shock, defined as hypotension not responding to infusion of fluid and requiring at least 0.1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg/minute norepinephrine for at least 2&#x000a0;h, with a proven or suspected site of infection and at least one sign of tissue hypoperfusion (oliguria, decreased Glasgow Coma Scale score, decreased ratio of partial pressure arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen, or increased arterial blood lactate) could be included. To be eligible, patients had to be shifted to the open-label norepinephrine and randomized to a constant intravenous infusion of selepressin or placebo within 24&#x000a0;h of meeting the inclusion criteria. Briefly, exclusion criteria (<italic>see</italic> Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1 for details) were acute coronary syndrome; hypovolemia suspected on clinical grounds; cardiac failure; pregnancy or breastfeeding; hypotension other than septic shock; use of vasopressin or terlipressin during the current hospital admission; acute mesenteric ischemia; episode of septic shock within 1&#x000a0;month; death anticipated within 24&#x000a0;h; chronic heart disease, including heart failure and second- and third-degree atrioventricular block without pacemaker; hyponatremia; brain injury; burn; peripheral vascular disease; previously randomized in this trial; intake of an investigational drug within the last 3&#x000a0;months; participation in another clinical trial; and considered unsuitable to participate in the trial for any other reason.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Sample size and randomization</title><p id="Par11">The study design comprised four treatment cohorts at three ascending infusion rate levels, the first three cohorts with ten receiving active treatment and five receiving placebo. The last cohort comprised active and placebo to finally reach 20 patients at the maximum tolerated infusion level and 20 patients receiving placebo. The randomization process was a computer-generated random listing of the treatment allocations, stratified by center and in variable permuted blocks of 2, 4, or 6.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Infusion of study drug and norepinephrine</title><p id="Par12">The investigated starting and maximal infusion rates of selepressin were 1.25&#x000a0;ng/kg/minute, 2.5&#x000a0;ng/kg/minute, and 3.75&#x000a0;ng/kg/minute, with the patient&#x02019;s body weight being measured or estimated. Selepressin or placebo was infused via a central venous catheter at the constant initial rate in addition to open-label norepinephrine targeting a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of &#x02265;65&#x000a0;mmHg. When patients were hemodynamically stable, open-label norepinephrine was tapered while maintaining target MAP with study drug. When the MAP was stable for 4&#x000a0;h without norepinephrine, study drug was weaned stepwise according to the protocol (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2). If weaning resulted in hemodynamic instability, the study drug was reinstituted, and, if needed, open-label norepinephrine was restarted. Open-label norepinephrine was adjusted to maintain the MAP &#x02265;65&#x000a0;mmHg if blinded study drug was insufficient. Patients received study drug until shock resolution (i.e., no vasopressor support) or a maximum of 7&#x000a0;days unless discontinued for safety reasons (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3).</p><p id="Par13">Open-label norepinephrine was supplied in the United States and Canada as norepinephrine bitartrate 1&#x000a0;mg/ml (Levophed, norepinephrine base; Hospira, Lake Forest, IL, USA) diluted in 5% dextrose and in Europe as Norepinephrine 1:1000 (norepinephrine tartrate; (Cardinal Health Ltd., Basingstoke, UK) 2&#x000a0;mg/ml (1&#x000a0;mg/ml norepinephrine base) diluted in 5% glucose. A tight protocol and accurate pumps (Braun Perfusor&#x000ae; Space; B.

The limit for maintained MAP was defined as 60&#x000a0;mmHg to prevent small variations around the clinical treatment target of 65&#x000a0;mmHg having disproportional impact on the overall evaluation.</p><p id="Par15">Secondary endpoints included pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, safety (vital signs, central venous pressure, central venous oxygen saturation, electrocardiographic and cardiac function, respiratory function, clinical chemistry, hematology, hemostasis, and urinalysis), organ dysfunction, an indirect measure of vascular leakage (i.e., fluid balance), and morbidity. Treatment-emergent adverse events (occurrence from start of study drug to 48&#x000a0;h after infusion was stopped) were collated and evaluated. Morbidity and organ dysfunction were evaluated by time course of Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores; days alive and free of organ dysfunction (using SOFA); proportion of patients off all vasopressors; days alive and out of intensive care unit (ICU); days alive and free of vasopressors; corticosteroids for sepsis treatment, dialysis, or mechanical ventilation at days 7, 14, and 28; ICU and hospital (up to day 28) lengths of stay; and plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1;, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and IL-1ra levels.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Pharmacokinetics</title><p id="Par16">Because the study drug infusion was administered according to need, the pharmacokinetic parameters steady-state concentration, total systemic clearance, distribution volume at steady state, and half-life were calculated by modeling using a two-compartment population pharmacokinetic model with random subject effects on clearance and distribution volume using WinNonlin&#x000ae;Pro (Pharsight Corp., Cary, NC, USA). Actual blood sampling time points were used for the calculations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par17">All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 for Windows software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The first two co-primary endpoints were compared using a logistic regression model. The rates and cumulative amounts of open-label norepinephrine administered were compared between treatment groups by using a repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment, time, and treatment by time interaction as factors; baseline rate of norepinephrine as a covariate; and subject as the experimental unit. The analyses were done for both the full analysis set and the per-protocol analysis set. For both analysis sets, the analyses were presented for the whole analysis set and those alive (and not discontinued) at the time of the measurement. The selepressin groups were compared individually with the placebo group in an analysis of variance model.</p><p id="Par18">Changes in vascular leakage endpoints (i.e., fluid balance), as well as changes from baseline in cytokines and SOFA scores, were compared between treatment groups using the same ANCOVA model as for norepinephrine. Patients were categorized as free of organ dysfunction if all six individual SOFA scores were 0. Percentage days alive and free of organ dysfunction/ICU/hospital (i.e., number of days/7 observation days&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;100) were analyzed between treatment groups using nonparametric Wilcoxon tests. The treatment differences between the selepressin groups and placebo were estimated using the Hodges-Lehmann estimator for independent samples. The proportions of patients alive were analyzed between treatment groups on days 7, 14, and 28 using a logistic regression model. Confidence intervals (Clopper-Pearson) were calculated for mortality rates and for the ORs of mortality rates.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Study population</title><p id="Par19">Fifty-three patients were randomized, and 52 subjects were dosed; 10 subjects received 1.25&#x000a0;ng/kg/minute, 19 subjects received 2.5&#x000a0;ng/kg/minute, 2 subjects received 3.75&#x000a0;ng/kg/minute, and 21 subjects received placebo.

Moreover, 2.5&#x000a0;ng/kg/minute selepressin could possibly mitigate lung dysfunction because it was associated with a higher proportion of days alive and free of ventilation over 7&#x000a0;days than placebo. It is well known that long duration of mechanical ventilation increases the risk of nosocomial pneumonia, neuromuscular weakness, and death. Also, although not statistically significant, twice as many patients were out of shock within 48&#x000a0;h with selepressin 2.5&#x000a0;ng/kg/minute compared with placebo, suggesting potential clinical benefit.

There was no difference between selepressin dose groups and placebo in terms of treatment-emergent adverse events. However, the highest-dose group was stopped after two patients because of adverse events in one of the patients that were regarded to be possibly related to selepressin. Because selepressin 3.75&#x000a0;ng/kg/minute was discontinued following only two patients with short infusion times, it was not possible to assess the safety and efficacy of this dose. However, 3.75&#x000a0;ng/kg/minute and higher infusion rates did not raise any safety concerns in a separate uncontrolled, multicenter, open-label trial in which all 30 patients received selepressin at infusion rates of 3.75&#x000a0;ng/kg/minute and higher (Ferring Pharmaceuticals A/S, unpublished data). Further assessment of the safety and efficacy of selepressin (at infusion rates of 1.7&#x02013;7.5&#x000a0;ng/kg/minute) vs. placebo is currently ongoing in the phase IIb/III Selepressin Evaluation Programme for Sepsis-Induced Shock - Adaptive Clinical Trial (SEPSIS-ACT; clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02508649?term&#x02009;=&#x02009;selepressin&#x00026;rank&#x02009;=&#x02009;1).</p><p id="Par35">Selepressin clearance was about 30% lower in septic shock patients than in healthy subjects. Because peptides similar in size are eliminated predominantly by peptidase degradation and excretion in the kidney, the decreased clearance in septic shock may be explained by reduced renal function. Accordingly, the terminal half-life of selepressin was longer in septic shock patients (2.5&#x000a0;h) than in healthy subjects (1.5&#x000a0;h) (Ferring Pharmaceuticals, unpublished data). The longer half-life of selepressin than of norepinephrine would potentially limit rapid adjustment of the selepressin-induced vasopressor support, especially after steady state has been established. However, the selepressin initial distribution/elimination phase half-life was short (10&#x000a0;minutes), enabling rapid selepressin dose adjustment during the early phase.

Limitations of this trial include the small sample size due to the early stage in selepressin&#x02019;s clinical development in a limited number of centers (that may limit the overall impact), but they were suitable for initial assessment of selepressin in human septic shock. The fluid input was not controlled, and we do not have information about the different solutions used (crystalloids, colloids, blood products), which might, at least in part, have influenced the amount of infused fluids, a potential limitation in interpreting the fluid balance. Although the addition of selepressin allowed sparing of norepinephrine and some would argue that one is simply substituting one vasopressor (selepressin) for another (norepinephrine), the beneficial effects on ventilation and fluid balance suggest additional nonvasopressor benefits of selepressin vs. norepinephrine. The pharmacodynamic effects of selepressin should be interpreted with caution owing to the small sample size of this phase IIa trial. We did not measure cardiac output, so we cannot comment on selepressin vs. norepinephrine effects on this parameter. Of note, vasopressin and norepinephrine had similar effects&#x02014;no decrease in cardiac output in VASST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Interaction of vasopressin and corticosteroids has been reported elsewhere, but owing to the small sample size, it was not possible to assess the potential interaction of corticosteroids and selepressin in this trial.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par40">The novel selective vasopressin V<sub>1A</sub> receptor agonist selepressin at an infusion rate of 2.5&#x000a0;ng/kg/minute rapidly replaced norepinephrine while maintaining target MAP and may have improved fluid balance and shortened the time of mechanical ventilation. Further studies of selepressin&#x02019;s mechanism of action and additional larger randomized controlled trials to investigate its efficacy are needed and ongoing to assess its ability to improve the treatment outcome of patients in septic shock.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec19"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par47">
