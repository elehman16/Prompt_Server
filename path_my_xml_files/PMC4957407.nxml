Rigorously designed phase I clinical trials are nearly non-existent in the field of probiotic research, which is a contributing factor to this disparity. As a consequence, how to appropriately dose probiotics to study their efficacy is unknown. Herein we propose a novel phase I ascending dose trial of <italic>Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis</italic> (<italic>B. infantis</italic>) to identify the dose required to produce predominant gut colonisation in healthy breastfed infants at 6&#x000a0;weeks of age.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is a parallel-group, placebo-controlled, randomised, double-blind ascending dose phase I clinical trial of dietary supplementation with <italic>B. infantis</italic> in healthy breastfed infants.

Successively enrolled infant groups will be randomised to receive two doses of either <italic>B. infantis</italic> or placebo on days 7 and 14 of life. Stool samples will be used to characterise the gut microbiota at increasing doses of <italic>B. infantis</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Probiotic supplementation has shown promising results for the treatment of a variety of ailments, but evidence-based dosing regimes are currently lacking. The ultimate goal of this trial is to establish a recommended starting dose of <italic>B. infantis</italic> for further efficacy-testing phase II trials designed to evaluate <italic>B. infantis</italic> for the prevention of atopic dermatitis and food allergies in at-risk children.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinicaltrials.gov #<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov">NCT02286999</ext-link>, date of trial registration 23 October 2014.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Bifidobacterium infantis</kwd><kwd>Probiotic</kwd><kwd>Atopy</kwd><kwd>Dose-escalation</kwd><kwd>Phase I clinical trial</kwd><kwd>Atopic dermatitis</kwd><kwd>Food allergy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1006787.01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maverakis</surname><given-names>Emanual</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>The idea of probiotics, &#x0201c;live microorganisms that when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host&#x0201d;, dates back to Elie Metchnikoff who hypothesised over 100&#x000a0;years ago that lactic acid bacilli had health benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. To date, thousands of reports of probiotics have supported the potential health benefits of these bacteria and the World Health Organization (WHO) has formulated guidelines for their use as nutritional supplements as well as investigation into their potential therapeutic properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Probiotics have been studied for the treatment and prevention of a variety of diseases in children including atopic dermatitis, bacterial gastroenteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and necrotizing enterocolitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Overall, the data concerning probiotics as preventive agents for atopic diseases such as atopic dermatitis and food allergies are inconclusive, with some studies suggesting a possible benefit and others showing mixed results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Humans and other mammals are hosts to a diverse set of symbiotic as well as pathogenic intestinal bacteria. Approximately 1000 microbial species reside at a density of 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>12</sup> organisms per gram of colonic content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Several studies have demonstrated a clear link between immune system development and the composition of gut microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, disruption of intestinal barrier function may lead to premature exposure of the infant to atopy-inducing environmental allergens, which would theoretically predispose the infant to the development of food allergies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. By protecting against colonisation by pathogenic bacteria, probiotics may help protect intestinal barrier function and thus decrease the susceptibility for development of atopic diseases and food allergies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, the pharmacokinetics of commensal bacteria and the dosage required to achieve predominant gut colonisation has thus far not been quantified. The probiotic that will be administered in our proposed phase I clinical trial, <italic>Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis (B. infantis),</italic> is unique in that it is able to fully utilise human milk oligosaccharides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Thus, an exclusively breastfed infant&#x02019;s gut provides the ideal environment to facilitate colonisation with this commensal bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]<italic>.</italic></p><p>In order to proceed with designing a rigorous phase II clinical trial program to evaluate <italic>B. infantis</italic> as a preventative measure for a variety of childhood ailments, including atopic disease, it is necessary to first determine the pharmacologically effective dose (ED) of <italic>B. infantis</italic>. To date, pharmacologically guided phase I studies have not been conducted in the field of probiotics. We are thus proposing a phase I dose-escalation trial to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of <italic>B. infantis</italic> supplementation when administered to healthy breastfed infants. The primary endpoint of the proposed trial is identification of the ED of <italic>B. infantis</italic>, defined as the dose required to produce predominant (&#x0003e;50&#x000a0;%) gastrointestinal colonisation in breastfed infants by 6&#x000a0;weeks of age. The 50&#x000a0;% value was chosen based on the proportion of <italic>B. infantis</italic> colonisation observed in breastfed infants in less-developed countries that have a low incidence of atopic disease compared to infants in the United States, specifically that seen in Bangladeshi infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>If successful, this study will be the first of its kind to establish a standardised dosing regime for probiotic supplementation in infants and will serve as a platform from which to design phase II and III trials to investigate the ability of <italic>B. infantis</italic> to protect against the development of a variety of childhood illnesses, including atopic dermatitis and food allergies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The proposed phase I clinical trial is a parallel-group, placebo-controlled, randomised, double-blind ascending dose study of dietary supplementation with <italic>B. infantis</italic> in healthy breastfed infants to evaluate its safety as well as determine the ED of <italic>B. infantis</italic> producing &#x0003e;50&#x000a0;% gut colonisation at 6&#x000a0;weeks of age. Infants will be enrolled sequentially in groups of five (three randomised to receive <italic>B. infantis</italic> and two to receive placebo). The trial participants and investigators will be blinded as to their group randomisation, which will be conducted by the study pharmacist (who will then dispense blinded <italic>B. infantis</italic> or placebo to the investigators). Depending on group assignment, each infant will receive one dose of either <italic>B. infantis</italic> or placebo on day 7 and another on day 14 of life (two doses total). For infants in the <italic>B. infantis</italic> group, a calculated maximally recommended starting dose (MRSD) will be used to initiate the dose escalation and is defined below. Every 2&#x000a0;weeks, an additional group of five infants (randomised 3:2 to <italic>B. infantis</italic> and placebo) will be enrolled to receive progressively higher doses of <italic>B. infantis</italic>. Calculation of the appropriate dose escalation will be performed using a modified Fibonacci series as described below in an effort to identify the ED of <italic>B. infantis</italic>.</p><p>After the ED of <italic>B. infantis</italic> has been identified (defined as the dose capable of producing 50&#x000a0;% gut colonisation by 6&#x000a0;weeks of age) two additional sequential dose escalations will be performed. The purpose of the final two dose escalations is to determine if successively higher doses of <italic>B. infantis</italic> result in increased gut colonisation or barrier protection, or, alternatively, if a maximum effective dose (MaxED) for <italic>B. infantis</italic> exists above which there is no further increase in gut colonisation or barrier protection. Following the final dose escalation, Hanley&#x02019;s Rule of Three will be applied in order to determine if lower-frequency adverse events are caused by <italic>B. infantis</italic>. Hanley&#x02019;s Rule of Three states that in order to identify any adverse events occurring at a frequency of 1:10 or greater with a 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval, at least 30 subjects must be enrolled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

After the ED has been reached, two additional dose escalations will occur to determine the impact that additional <italic>B. infantis</italic> has on the gut microbiota.

Probiotics may have benefits such as decreasing the growth of harmful bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract, improving digestion and helping to strengthen the immune system. Probiotics have shown some benefit in reducing the risk of developing atopic (allergic) dermatitis in children. However, this optimal dose of probiotic needed to achieve such beneficial effects has not yet been studied in randomised controlled clinical trials. We wish to investigate the optimal dose of probiotic bacteria needed to colonise the infant gastrointestinal tracts by 6&#x000a0;weeks of age.

Thus, our proposed phase I ascending dose study will instead utilise a targeted outcome, optimal gut colonisation of <italic>B. infantis</italic> at 6&#x000a0;weeks of age. Such &#x0201c;concentration controlled&#x0201d; phase I clinical trials that use pharmacokinetics in place of drug toxicity to guide dose escalation are supported in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. For example, in molecularly targeted anticancer agents, toxicity concerns are reduced, making &#x0201c;drug-related biological effects&#x0201d; a better suited primary endpoint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Our specific trial will measure gut microbiota composition following <italic>B. infantis</italic> administration to determine the dose of <italic>B. infantis</italic> that is required to successfully colonise the gastrointestinal tract of a 6-week-old breastfed infant. Secondary outcome measures will include measurement of complex glycan consumption by the infant as well as diversity of the intestinal microbiota. As in all phase I studies, the infants will be monitored closely for adverse events. The main goal of this phase I trial is to establish a recommended administering dose of <italic>B. infantis</italic> to support further efficacy testing in phase II and phase III trials.</p><p>Prior probiotic studies have differed from the proposed study with regards to their dosing regime, inclusion criteria, and types of bacteria administered. Many prior trials in infants were designed with limited knowledge of the human milk glycome and resultant effects on the infant&#x02019;s intestinal microbiotia. Probiotic bacteria used in prior trials in children have included <italic>Bifidobacterium breve</italic>, <italic>Bifidobacterium lactis</italic>, <italic>Bifidobacterium longum</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillus fermentum</italic>, and <italic>Propinobacterium freudenreichii</italic>, among others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In many prior studies, it was unclear why a particular probiotic was chosen. Research done by the milk group at UC Davis has shown that the vast majority of probiotic species do not grow on the human milk oligosaccharides in breast milk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Evidently, most probiotics studied in previous clinical trials have been selected based on culturability and taste profiles when administered as fermented food products rather than their biological activity. In contrast, our proposed study is based upon research into the human milk glycome and insight into the specific bacteria that digest breast milk oligosaccharides.</p><p>One unique aspect of this trial is that we will administer <italic>B. infantis</italic> to exclusively breastfed infants. The breast milk will provide the prebiotic oligosaccharides and thus select for the growth of <italic>B. infantis</italic> over other gastrointestinal commensal bacteria. In addition, we will monitor the composition of the intestinal microbiota should the mothers choose to discontinue breastfeeding to determine the effect breast milk consumption has on the maintenance of <italic>B. infantis</italic> intestinal colonisation. Previous studies investigating probiotics have administered the bacteria in combination with galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. However, these sugars differ significantly from milk oligosaccharides in that they are linear rather than branched and lack fucose and sialic acid moieties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. As human breast milk will comprise the majority of an infant&#x02019;s diet, supplementing with a probiotic that thrives on human milk oligosaccharides may be the most sensible strategy for cultivating a protective microbiota in healthy infants.</p><p>The most common adverse effects described with probiotic use include diarrhoea, vomiting, and increased flatulence. Probiotics are known to be extremely safe, as evidenced by prior use in premature infants as well as in both adults and children with HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In Finland, the use of probiotic supplements (namely <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosous GG</italic>) has increased dramatically over the past 20&#x000a0;years without evidence of a corresponding increase in the rate of lactobacillus bactermia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Probiotic supplementation has also been shown to be well tolerated without adverse effects in a recent randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing a combination of lactobacilli (<italic>Lactobacillus salivarius</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus paracasei</italic>) and bifidobacteria (<italic>Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacterium bifidum</italic>) in pregnant women and infants, with the goal of assessing the safety of probiotic supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In this trial, enrolled women were treated with a total of 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup> colony-forming units of this probiotic regime daily for the last month of pregnancy and the regime was then administered to their infants from birth through to 6&#x000a0;months of age. There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse events in either the maternal or infant groups, and no adverse events were attributed directly to the probiotic supplementation. There have been rare reports demonstrating the possibility of probiotic-related infectious complications, such as sepsis, bacteraemia, and endocarditis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. However, it is estimated that the risk of developing bacteraemia from ingested <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> probiotics is less than one in one million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Though extremely rare, sepsis due to bifidobacterium has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The described cases of bifidobacterium bacteraemia include one adult that developed incidental sepsis following acupuncture, and two infants that received <italic>Bifidobacterium breve</italic> or <italic>Bifidobacterium longum</italic> as a probiotic supplement. Of note, one infant was premature with extremely low birthweight and the other was full term with comorbid omphalocele. To date there are no reported instances of bacteraemia resulting from <italic>B. infantis</italic>; however, all study participants will be warned of the extremely low risk of such complications.</p><p>While studies have demonstrated the ability of certain probiotics to prevent childhood illnesses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], there are virtually no data on how to appropriately dose these supplements. The typical probiotic study has adopted a daily dosing regime, making feasibility an issue. Sometimes the probiotic is administered to the mother first and then to the infant for the first 6&#x000a0;months of life. Dose-ranging studies are usually required early on during a drug&#x02019;s clinical development. Excluding a few exceptions, probiotic dose-ranging studies are for the most part non-existent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. As a follow-up clinical trial, we plan to conduct a dose-ranging phase II study that will compare the effectiveness of <italic>B. infantis</italic> daily dosing to a limited dosing regime consisting of <italic>B. infantis</italic> administered on days 7 and 14 only. In theory, the human breast milk oligosaccharides will bestow <italic>B. infantis</italic> with a competitive growth advantage, making daily dosing unnecessary. If the limited dosing regime is successful, it will have an immediate health care impact, as inoculating breast fed infants with two doses of <italic>B. infantis</italic> is an extremely feasible preventative measure to reduce the incidence of atopy and other diseases in at-risk children.</p><p>The pharmacokinetically guided design of this proposed phase I trial has not been attempted in prior probiotic studies. If successful the trial will identify a pharmacologically effective dose (ED) and maximum effective dose (MaxED) for <italic>B. infantis</italic> supplementation in healthy infants. The next generation sequencing strategy that will be employed to analyse the stool of the infants to determine gut colonisation with <italic>B. infantis</italic> has been well standardised, and is a common method for analysis of gut microbiota. Infants will also be monitored closely for potential adverse effects in case a maximally tolerated dose (MTD) is reached during the ascending dose study. The design of the trial is also innovative because the specific probiotic used for the supplementation will have a competitive advantage in an exclusively breastfed infant; it is the only bacterium that can fully utilise the complex oligosaccharides in breast milk as an energy source. Thus, the design of the trial provides an optimal environment for <italic>B. infantis</italic> to outcompete other intestinal microbiota. The rationale for the choice of probiotic used in prior infant trials is not clear; however, in this study it is based upon knowledge of the human milk glycome and specific metabolic needs of <italic>B. infantis</italic>. Our ultimate goal is to develop a clinically appropriate, safe, and effective dosing regime for probiotics that may be utilised in further phase II and phase III clinical trials. In doing so, we hope to lay the foundation for the design of objective, standardised clinical trials to assess the efficacy of probiotics for the prevention of a variety of diseases, including atopic dermatitis and food allergies in at-risk infants.</p><sec id="Sec27"><title>Trial status</title><p>This protocol is for a proposed clinical trial.
