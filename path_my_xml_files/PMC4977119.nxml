They can also diminish quality of life and result in posttraumatic stress reactions, loss of self-esteem, and stigmatization.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Furthermore, discernible scarring is a major complication and a major cause of reoperation after breast surgery.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Attempts to reduce scarring after plastic surgery, particularly breast surgery, have traditionally focused on choosing well-hidden incision sites and using silicon sheets, corticosteroid injections, and massage therapy postoperatively.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>Inflammation is the most important physiologic response to any form of wounding. The outcome of controlled inflammation in adults is a collagenous scar, which lacks the ordered structure of healthy skin.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Fetal healing, on the other hand, resembles a regenerative process and does not result in a collagenous scar.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Pathogenesis of scar deformity is still unclear.</p><p>When the skin is injured, the first glycosaminoglycan to be synthesized is hyaluronan, or hyaluronic acid (HA).<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Fetal healing is scarless and occurs in an environment rich in HA,<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> suggesting that exogenous HA may be useful in wound repair in adults.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Evidence suggests that using suitable HA under appropriate conditions leads to enhanced wound healing and a reduction in or elimination of scarring.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> More than 50% of the body&#x02019;s HA is found in the skin, where it functions to stabilize and maintain the biomatrix between the cells.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> The intrinsic water-retaining capacity of HA suggests that it facilitates the transport of metabolites and preserves tissue hydration, especially in the dermal layer.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> In the early 1970s, Rydell<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> observed that application of high-molecular weight, purified HA to surgical incisions in animals resulted in subcutaneous scars that were smoother with less connective tissue reaction than those of untreated incisions in the same animals. Although HA is not the sole factor in regulating wound repair, it is certainly a key factor. It modulates inflammation by affecting polymorphonuclear cells, macrophages, cells of the lymphomyeloid system, phagocytosis, and chemotaxis and is a scavenger of free radicals.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>Various HA formulations have been produced to help reduce scarring.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> One such formulation is the HA sponge (HylaSponge System, Matrix Biological Institute, Fort Lee, N.J.), which uses polymerization methods to produce a network of large HA molecular chains bound into an assembly of very large coils (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). These coils form spheroidal particles of virtually infinite molecular weight. The spheroidal particles can absorb and release large volumes of water, or water-soluble molecules, much like a sponge. This system provides a &#x0201c;waterway&#x0201d; to the skin for large- and small-molecular weight HAs and biologically active molecules incorporated into them, thus providing longer lasting effects and more penetrating hydration.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Hyaluronic acid sponge with zinc system.

The space in between the HA sponges is occupied by large-molecular weight, soluble HA (2) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). Small-molecular weight, soluble HA (3) is inside and around the HA sponge. Optional additions of biologically active small molecules (4) such as vitamins, amino acids, and peptides are distributed in the water around and filling the HA sponges. The system releases water to the skin, enabling diffusion of the large (2) and small (3) HA molecules and the (4) biologically active molecules into the stratum corneum (5) of the skin, with the latter 2 molecules diffusing toward the deeper layers of the skin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B).</p><p>In this randomized prospective study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of the HA sponge with zinc compared with placebo in the management of bilateral breast surgery scars.

They were instructed to wash their hands between applications of products. The HA sponge with zinc and placebo were supplied by the study sponsor and packaged identically without any identifying marks.

Each visit included evaluation by the investigator, patient satisfaction surveys, and photographs of the surgical sites. Participants applied the assigned product to each site for 12 weeks. Three blinded evaluators reviewed the photographs and assessed the scars with a Modified Manchester scale/visual analog scale (VAS) and a simpler New Scale at 12 weeks. The New Scale is a complementary scale to the validated VAS that we used exclusively in this article and in the sister article &#x0201c;A Randomized, Blinded Clinical Evaluation of Efficacy and Safety of Hyaluronan Sponge with Vitamin C (HylaSponge System) vs Placebo for Scar Reduction.&#x0201d; This is a 10-point New Scale created by adding the measures such as scar color, texture, relation to surrounding skin, and distortion. For all scales, lower scores indicated better outcomes. Photographs obtained at each interval were adjusted to the scar quality to reflect the best visualization by altering the lighting and shadowing to delineate the scars.

Massage therapy is also often advocated for scar management but lacks evidence of benefit.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Without proper trials, benefits are difficult to quantify objectively because even a placebo benefit may be appreciated by patients.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>Hyaluronan likely plays a multifaceted role in mediation of cellular and matrix events during wound healing.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Zinc is one of the trace elements considered to play an important role in wound healing and also has the additional benefits of antimicrobial and antiinflammatory properties.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> With this knowledge, it would be logical to combine zinc and HA in scar management to harness benefits of both to improve scar quality. One such formulation has been zinc HA, which is a proprietary biomolecule.</p><p>The HA sponge with zinc is based on research of the structure, function, and uses of various forms of HA: it hydrates the skin&#x02019;s surface layer (stratum corneum) and maintains movement of water, biologically active ingredients, and small water-soluble molecules toward the skin&#x02019;s deeper layers. Cosmetic applications of this product are used for hydration and to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles while smoothing the skin.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><p>Most studies of zinc and HA have been done in animal models, and none have been randomized, controlled, prospective trials.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> To our knowledge, our study is the first randomized, controlled, prospective trial to show significant patient satisfaction with this HA delivery system. Most of the patients in our study mentioned that they will buy the product. There was a histologic difference between the HA sponge with zinc and placebo in our biopsy samples, with changes in collagen fiber density and orientation noted. However, this difference may need further analysis with more samples and specific delineation of the location of the biopsy and the depth of the scar. Our understanding of the density and orientation of collagen fibers in a maturing scar is far better than our understanding of the changes that may appear in a superior esthetic scar.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Multiple factors control the superior esthetic appearance of the scar, and these are hard to correlate with specific dermatopathologic findings.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> However, these changes further support the differential appearance of the placebo versus HA-sponge-treated skin. The timing of the application of this product is also important; the product should be applied soon after the time of wounding to modulate inflammation, at the time of initial scar matrix formation.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> For this study, we compared groups at 12 weeks, after which time all patients were allowed to apply the HA sponge with zinc on their scars. The longest follow-up was 1 year. We started using the product between 2 and 6 days. Additional research can determine how long this product needs to be applied for the best outcome, but based on our preliminary data it should be started within days of operation and continued at least for 3 months and up to 1 year after operation for maximal effect. Our findings support that the HA sponge with zinc is effective for early scars and that it can also function effectively for darker skin types.</p><p>One of the limitations of our study was the small number of patients. Another limitation of the study is the use of a VAS. Although this scale has been validated and is commonly used for skin care scar products, it is still subjective. Objective proof of benefit of HA sponge with zinc is demonstrated through histologic analysis, and although we observed histopathologic differences in the biopsy samples, there is no clear and large-scale study to demonstrate how a better esthetic scar should appear on histopathologic findings. Although we did see differences in scar depth, widening, and color, statistical significance was not reached, probably because of the small number of patients. Overall, results of the patient satisfaction surveys in our study were statistically significant with minimal side effects of the product to validate the use of this product on postoperative surgical scars.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>This is a preliminary study that shows that the use of HA sponges with zinc was found to have high patient satisfaction in achieving a better scar after bilateral breast surgery, irrespective of skin color. Zinc HA seems to be safe and effective for early scars with minimal adverse effects and can be used in the management of surgical scars, with effective and easy application protocols.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Disclosure:</bold> The authors have no financial interest to declare in relation to the content of this article.
