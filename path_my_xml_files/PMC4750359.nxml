Qualitative research has focused more generally on clinician-parent communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and a systematic review of interventions used in communicating with and supporting parents of preterm infants focused on a range of information-giving methods including ward rounds, notes based discussions, websites and written information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Audio recordings of discussions between parents and clinicians in the neonatal unit have previously been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, the main purpose and effectiveness of such recordings was to facilitate parental recall rather than investigating the nature of the communication process itself.</p><p>Communication about neonatal brain imaging was explored in a small-scale study of parents&#x02019; experiences in the neonatal unit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Concerns about long-term developmental outcome were evident and the effect of having a preterm infant had a negative impact on parents&#x02019; ability to retain information at this time. A recent account of one couple&#x02019;s experience of information-giving after an MRI at term of their preterm baby [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and the clinicians&#x02019; responses to their account [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] raised the issue of MRI not necessarily being beneficial for parents in this context.</p><p>In a small scale study of seven families of children with dysmorphic features communication of information was explored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Content and discourse analysis, following verbatim transcription of recorded consultations, indicated that the discussion elements focusing on challenging issues such as the child&#x02019;s appearance and longer term outcome were more negative. On these occasions lack of fluency, more repetition, clinician difficulty finding suitable terminology and an imbalance in clinician and parent participation in the discussion were noted. The contributions made by parents were generally more open, direct and goal focused, leading to the authors to suggest that parents may prefer a more frank approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Another study used audio-recording of clinician-parent communication to analyse discussions about their child&#x02019;s possible participation in a clinical trial, finding that clinical staff rarely asked open questions and parents said little [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, no published studies were identified which have used audio recording to specifically investigate the strategies used in talking with parents about diagnosis and longer term outcome.</p><p>Tools have been devised, mostly for use in adult health care, to support assessment of patient-clinician communication. These tools include checklists of approaches, behaviours and responses and specifically devised frameworks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The Paediatric Consultation Assessment Tool (PCAT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] is a rating scale focusing on six aspects of the communication process with children and their parents during consultations. No such tools have been identified which relate specifically to communication between parents of young infants and clinicians. An initial aim of this study was thus to develop a framework to describe the communication between clinicians and parents of preterm infants about brain ultrasound and MRI imaging at term age.</p><p>The present study was undertaken as part of a larger research programme on neonatal brain imaging in which a key component was a trial of information-giving to parents following MRI or ultrasound scans at term, of babies born before 33&#x000a0;weeks gestation. The hypothesis of the larger study concerned the effect on parental wellbeing of the more detailed prognostic information provided by MRI. The purpose of this qualitative component was to focus on communication with parents following brain MRI or ultrasound scan. A specifically developed framework was devised to describe the strategies, content and language used in talking to parents.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Context</title><p>UK, the ePrime study, a programme of research evaluating the use of MRI to predict neurodevelopmental impairment in preterm infants. The programme of work was approved by Hammersmith, Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Research Ethics Committee - 09/H0707/98.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Sample</title><p>Parents of preterm infants born before 33&#x000a0;weeks gestation who delivered in 13 NHS trusts in the London area, who had consented to participate in the main study of information-giving following MRI or ultrasound imaging at term age. Most parents or &#x02018;family units&#x02019; consented to participate in the audio-recording sub-study (80&#x000a0;% of those participating in the main study, 350 out of 434).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Procedure and data collection</title><p>Parents who had been recruited to ePrime were invited to the diagnostic scanning day at the main study centre. Written informed consent was obtained at the recruitment site a few weeks before the scanning appointment. Prior to the ultrasound and MRI scanning of the baby, parental written consent to the study was affirmed including the audio-recording part of the study. Randomisation to either ultrasound or MRI results sharing took place after both scans had been undertaken. Audio recordings were initiated by one of three clinicians undertaking the discussions during which parents were shown images of the MRI or ultrasound and the findings were described. The scans were carried out immediately prior to the meeting. The results of the scans were therefore only made available to the clinicians after the imaging and just prior to the discussion with parents. Copies of the MRI or ultrasound images were given to parents on the day of the scan and a letter detailing the points made in the discussion was sent to them. A topic guide / script ensured essential information was given in the generally agreed order (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Appendix 1) and images from the scan were used to facilitate the communication process. A total of 60 discussions were recorded, transcribed and analysed. Audio recordings were made of consecutive individual clinician-parent discussions over three specific time periods: during the early, middle and late phases of recruitment and data collection. These time points were chosen to encompass any differences over the course of the study that might occur in the content and style of the discussions. Parents who did not consent to the audio-recording continued to participate in the main study and received their baby&#x02019;s scan result (MRI or ultrasound) as described above but their discussion with the clinician was not recorded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Data analysis</title><p>An experienced qualitative researcher (MH) transcribed the audio recordings. The first phase of data collection resulted in the recording of 24 discussions. A preliminary analysis of these was undertaken using NVivio10. Sections of the text were coded in accordance to issues identified in the data. The codes were then organised into themes and sub-themes. New codes, themes and sub-themes were created when the data appeared to capture something new. This process continued until all transcripts had been coded. The themes and sub-themes were then reviewed by MH and MR and combined as appropriate. This analysis was then reviewed by both researchers in the context of more general clinician-patient and clinician-parent interaction studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], in order to finalise the framework (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Appendix 2).</p><p>This specifically devised framework facilitated a further more detailed qualitative analysis also using NVivo10, of 36 recordings (12 from each clinician) taken from across the three periods of recording. Thematic analysis was undertaken [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] supported by the framework. Reading the transcripts, coding and re-reading of these by both researchers in an iterative manner facilitated the identification and sharing of themes and subthemes. The arrangement and grouping of themes and sub-themes was discussed and agreed by both researchers. Saturation with no further themes identified, was reached by the time 36 interviews had been analysed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Results</title><p>Most mothers in the study were in their early 30&#x02019;s, less than half had previously given birth, most were partnered and half were from Black and Minority Ethnic groups (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The 36 parental interviews concerned 43 infants: 23 boys and 20 girls, with a mean and median gestation at birth of 30&#x000a0;weeks (range 25&#x000a0;weeks&#x02009;+&#x02009;2&#x000a0;days to 32&#x000a0;weeks&#x02009;+&#x02009;6&#x000a0;days). Of the 36 interviews, 19 were with parents whose babies were allocated to MRI and 17 were assigned ultrasound based information. Most parents had singletons (30 out of 36), with 5 sets of twins and one of triplets. Scans took place at a mean of 12&#x000a0;weeks actual age (median, 12&#x000a0;weeks 2&#x000a0;days) and at a mean of 3&#x000a0;weeks corrected age (median 2&#x000a0;weeks, 5&#x000a0;days), with a total 5 out of 43 infants identified as having abnormal scans. Almost all of the discussions (duration 6&#x02013;48 min, mean 25, median 21&#x000a0;min) took place with mothers present (35), half with fathers (18) and one with a grandmother present. Discussions about MRI results were longer (median: MRI - 16&#x000a0;min, US - 11&#x000a0;min), as were discussions involving multiples (median: multiples - 17&#x000a0;min, singletons - 12&#x000a0;min) and abnormal results (median: abnormal - 26&#x000a0;min, normal - 11&#x000a0;min). Following the discussion, parents were offered a copy of the audio-recording, 28 accepted and these were sent by post.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Characteristics of mothers whose babies were discussed in the audio recordings study</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="3">Maternal characteristics</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Mother&#x02019;s age (years) <italic>n=36</italic>

Whilst the same approach to framing the discussion was taken, the importance of the information to be given was often emphasised when abnormal results were given:<disp-quote><p><italic>CL2:</italic> And the way I give the results is that I will first talk about the background at the hospital type of thing-</p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p>M: Ok.</p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p>CL2: &#x02212;and then talk about babies born before 33&#x000a0;weeks and then give you the results and what they mean, ok?</p><p><bold><italic>2047</italic></bold>&#x02013;<bold><italic>2059: 28</italic></bold><sup><bold><italic>+6</italic></bold></sup><bold><italic>weeks, MRI, normal</italic></bold></p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p><italic>CL3: &#x02026;. We do have some results for you today, which I think are important and which I think will be important for the future.... I&#x02019;m going to tell you some things that you may know already and then I&#x02019;ll give you the results at the end.</italic><bold><italic>2891: 32</italic></bold><sup><bold><italic>+1</italic></bold></sup><bold><italic>weeks, MRI, abnormal</italic></bold></p></disp-quote></p><p>There was active positioning of the information in orienting to the topic. A key element was checking on the information parents had previously received and what they already knew. The clinicians were aware of difficulties that could arise for parents receiving information from different sources and the anxieties this could provoke. The emphasis was on how the babies were now, &#x02018;today&#x02019;. This contextualising allowed the issue of different and possibly contradictory information, to be handled.<disp-quote><p><italic>CL3: &#x02026;first of all I&#x02019;d like to find out from you what you know about already about the scans, what you&#x02019;ve heard from the other hospital and what you think you&#x02019;re going to hear, so to speak.... It&#x02019;s also fair to say that some problems don&#x02019;t show themselves on earlier scans so if there are differences between this scan and what you&#x02019;ve heard before then that&#x02019;ll be the sort of reason why.</italic><bold><italic>2106/2131/2144: 28</italic></bold><sup><bold><italic>+6</italic></bold></sup><bold><italic>weeks, US, normal</italic></bold></p></disp-quote></p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>What we are looking at</title><p>In introducing the process of reviewing the scans and sharing the images with parents the clinicians started by using analogies to help them describe the whole brain. In doing this they focused on the shape and the surface before explaining the complex and varied images arising from the scanning process. Analogies commonly used included &#x02018;walnuts&#x02019;, &#x02018;carpets&#x02019; and &#x02018;railway junctions&#x02019;. There were pauses for parents to respond and the emphasis was on what &#x02018;we&#x02019; and &#x02018;you&#x02019; can see, which parents acknowledged in a fairly minimal way:<disp-quote><p><italic>CL2: Ok. So when we, when we look at the brain through the scans, we look at the surface of the brain-</italic></p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p><italic>F: Yes.</italic></p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p><italic>CL2: &#x02212;which is called the cortex, which is folded like a walnut.</italic><bold><italic>1435: 29</italic></bold><sup><bold><italic>+6</italic></bold></sup><bold><italic>weeks, US, normal</italic></bold></p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p><italic>CL1: As you can see the surface is not smooth, can you see, it&#x02019;s folded?</italic></p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p><italic>M: Yes.</italic></p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p><italic>CL1: It&#x02019;s like a carpet. Somebody has walked on a carpet and it&#x02019;s got folded. So it&#x02019;s folded up and down. That&#x02019;s how a normal brain looks like.</italic><bold><italic>6705: 25</italic></bold><sup><bold><italic>+4</italic></bold></sup><bold><italic>weeks, MRI, normal</italic></bold></p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p><italic>CL1: And those are kind of like junctions, like, imagine Clapham Junction, it&#x02019;s kind of taking signals from the surface of the brain and then deciding where else the signals should go to.</italic><bold><italic>7595: 29</italic></bold><sup><bold><italic>+2</italic></bold></sup><bold><italic>weeks, US, normal</italic></bold></p></disp-quote></p><p>The clinicians also acknowledged the difficulties parents might have in seeing any detail in the images shown, implicitly contrasting parents&#x02019; position with their own based on medical knowledge and experience. They again often used analogies to help reassure parents about what they were seeing:<disp-quote><p><italic>CL3: And I&#x02019;m going to show you an ultrasound scan which I&#x02019;m sure you&#x02019;ve seen before&#x02026;. so that we can know what we&#x02019;re talking about. And I don&#x02019;t know if you&#x02019;ve seen these before?</italic></p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p><italic>M: No.</italic></p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p><italic>CL3: Ok, well in that case, I know it looks like a sort of fuzzy snowstorm.</italic></p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p><italic>M: Yes.</italic></p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p><italic>CL3: But there is quite a lot of information in here.</italic><bold><italic>1636: 30</italic></bold><sup><bold><italic>+0</italic></bold></sup><bold><italic>weeks, US, normal</italic></bold></p></disp-quote></p><p>The clinicians then introduced and explained medical terminology to describe the developing brain as they talked. They referred to structures, sections and slices in describing what parents were being shown. Specific structures are named, with some references to function. Much of this seemed to be aimed at helping parents to get used to looking at the scans and acquiring a vocabulary. This also prepared them for what they would see, in order to understand what may have happened and the prognostic information the clinician was planning to give. The same approach was taken irrespective of whether normal or abnormal results were given:<disp-quote><p><italic>CL2: So we&#x02019;re starting from the base of the neck now, ok? So this part, this part here is called the cerebellum.</italic></p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p><italic>M: The cerebellum?</italic></p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p><italic>CL2: Yes and we think it&#x02019;s important in terms of movement, you know, in walking and things and also in terms of memory. So the way that it looks, it&#x02019;s like we want it to be like, ok? So this is fine, ok?</italic></p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p><italic>M: Ok.</italic></p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p><italic>CL2: Then as we start to look here, if you see this black thing here.</italic></p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p><italic>M: Yes.</italic></p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p><italic>CL2: That&#x02019;s just a vessel. So it&#x02019;s like a vein, where the blood flows. So everywhere in our body, blood flows.</italic></p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p><italic>M: Ok.</italic></p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p><italic>CL2: So because this is an MRI, we&#x02019;re able to see it, just like you can see, there.</italic></p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p><italic>M: Ok.</italic></p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p><italic>CL2: So that&#x02019;s just a vein, a vein where the blood goes.</italic></p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p><italic>F: Yes.</italic></p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p><italic>CL2: So this is not because of something wrong with the cerebellum, we&#x02019;re just seeing it-</italic></p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p><italic>M: Oh.</italic><bold><italic>4986: 32</italic></bold><sup><bold><italic>+6</italic></bold></sup><bold><italic>weeks, MRI, abnormal</italic></bold></p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p><italic>CL1: &#x02026;. we&#x02019;re going to talk about the brain and then I&#x02019;m going to show you the ultrasound pictures. So before I do that I&#x02019;m going to talk a little bit about the brain structures so I can point it out on the ultrasound when I show it you. So I&#x02019;m sure you know that the brain, it has two sides, right and left and there are actually fibres connecting the two sides called the corpus callosum. There&#x02019;s no need to know that. But there are fibres.

But if you&#x02019;re between 29 and 33&#x000a0;weeks then it&#x02019;s about 6&#x000a0;%, the risk. But overall, anybody born preterm below 33&#x000a0;weeks, it&#x02019;s got a 9&#x000a0;% number that everybody quotes. Ok?

Not all parents had an understanding of the potential consequences of preterm birth. The clinicians checked on parent&#x02019;s awareness and knowledge of possible outcomes and then elaborated. This was done by providing further information about the risks and the pattern of development for this group generally and then for their baby using what was found in the scans:<disp-quote><p><italic>M: Like what are you saying then, that she&#x02019;s got cerebral palsy?</italic></p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p><italic>CL2: &#x02026; just by being born before 33&#x000a0;weeks they have a 9&#x000a0;% chance of having cerebral palsy&#x02026; and she was born at 29&#x000a0;weeks, so the risk goes down to about 6&#x000a0;%. That&#x02019;s just by being born. So it has nothing to do with your scans or anything else&#x02026;&#x02026; now that we have scan we can update that information and say, based on the scan result that we&#x02019;ve got, and the scan result has this combination of changes.

The literature identifies some of the challenges and difficulties encountered by clinicians and parents during the provision of information, particularly when this is complex and has far-reaching significance for families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Whilst literature regarding clinician-patient and clinician-parent communication was used to develop the initial framework for this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] no published studies have focused specifically on recorded discussions between clinicians and parents about neonatal brain imaging.</p><p>The aim of the discussions with parents was to give results of the scans, to place these in the context of information they had received previously and to present what is known about the associated risks of preterm birth in relation to the findings for their baby [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In recording the discussions the objective was to develop the analysis framework. This was used to explore the language used, how information and explanations were given and to describe the clinician strategies used in informing parents about diagnosis and the possible longer term outcomes for their children. We were particularly interested in the way the imaging information was handled, the use of technical terminology and the way that risk was presented.</p><p>The themes identified were: &#x02018;Framing the information-giving&#x02019; which sets the scene, and the baseline; &#x02018;What we are looking at&#x02019;, the big issue of terminology which skilled and knowledgeable health professionals have to deal with; &#x02018;Presenting the numbers and explaining risk&#x02019; which embodies real and subjective probability issues and &#x02018;Appreciating the position of parents&#x02019; which reflects ways in which clinicians responded to parents needs and understanding as individuals.</p><p>For clinicians there are difficulties inherent in explaining structures in three dimensions, identifying specific features and integrating this with information describing processes and change over time. Throughout the discussions there was, of necessity, iteration of the information presented in different ways and of key points. Like most parents of babies requiring neonatal care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] these parents were seeking certainty and reassurance. The clinicians found it hard not to be reassuring, while at the same time trying to give messages about possible outcomes, particularly for those infants with an abnormal scan. For clinicians, familiar with numerical data used as an evidence-base in decision-making, the probabilities they presented reflected their home ground. However, the proportions and probability information were difficult to convey effectively. This suggests that consideration of other modes of communication, particularly visual graphical representation as a way of facilitating discussion and understanding could be worthwhile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>There are commonalties with other information-giving situations in neonatal care and paediatrics more broadly in which the aim is also to achieve a shared meaning and understanding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. While the study provides a broad description of the content of clinicians' information-giving process, it is difficult to draw strong conclusions about how information should be shared and to provide clear guidance. We would hope that clinicians reading this paper reflect on how they themselves share information with parents. It may be that those whose role involves giving complex information to parents could better plan what they will communicate in advance of meeting individual parents, particularly where the findings are of likely to be of concern. They could also consider shared interviews with another member of the team in addition to utilising other materials, particularly in relation to giving information about risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The potentially negative implications of this type of intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] also need to be considered in terms of any possible effects on the short term and longer term wellbeing of parents. It is anticipated that the other quantitative components of the ePrime programme will contribute to the evidence base in this regard.</p><p>Further analysis is planned of the way in which longer term outcomes are explained and understood. Interviews undertaken later in the study will explore the impact of early information-giving on parents one and two years on from the prognostic discussions described in this paper. Thus quantitative and qualitative data collected at around one and two years after these discussions will further explore the impact of the early prognostic information-giving experience and reflections on these from the parents&#x02019; perspective.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Recordings are rarely made of clinician-parent interviews. The openness and willingness of both parents and clinicians to participate is a strength of the study, as was the unbiased way in which the specific recordings were made. Data collection took place in the context of a research trial using a topic guide and it is acknowledged that this might not reflect what occurs in clinical practice routinely. However, we would argue that many aspects of giving prognostic information to parents of young infants would be similar. Whilst there were some minor differences in approach between the clinicians, it was not considered meaningful to undertake qualitative analysis of these.</p><p>Video-recording would have allowed us to appreciate the role of non-verbal interaction and non-verbal cues and how the clinicians used gestures in explain the scans shown to parents. However, this could be considered more invasive and likely to affect parent and clinician willingness to participate. In this analysis the focus was on the strategies used in giving information to parents about the findings from ultrasound and MRI scans and expert examination of these. The study data presented, the framework used and the associated strategies described may enable clinicians to be more conscious of the language and constructs they use in discussions with parents. A more detailed analytical focus on the interaction and communication interface between parents and clinicians could facilitate further understanding of the dynamics and processes involved. The framework developed could be used in other health related situations involving parents. Further quantitative research could explore different methods of information provision in this kind of context.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Clinicians used a range of strategies in communicating key information to a diverse group of parents. Clinicians recognised parents as individuals who brought different experiences and levels of knowledge and understanding to the discussion. The themes identified reflect the practical difficulties of giving prognostic information to parents based on brain imaging. The insights gained may encourage health professionals working with families to reflect on and possibly modify their own practice.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec15"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12887_2016_561_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Appendix 1.</label><caption><p>Topic guide used to facilitate the provision of essential information. <bold>Appendix 2:</bold> Framework developed for analysis of audio-recordings based on first 24 recordings and list of sources.
