<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The treatment of hypertension has been shown to reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality associated with elevated blood pressure (BP), including stroke, ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, chronic kidney disease and possibly cognitive decline.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Despite the availability of multiple drug classes with different mechanisms of action, hypertension, especially systolic blood pressure (SBP), remains inadequately controlled.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;6</xref></p><p>The SBP usually increases from childhood throughout life, while diastolic BP (DBP) remains relatively constant or decreases beyond 50&#x02013;60&#x02005;years of age. The changing patterns of BP throughout life reflect different pathologies. In the young, hypertension is predominantly due to an increased DBP and mean arterial pressure (MAP), as a result of a relative increase in cardiac output and/or increased peripheral vascular resistance.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> On the other hand, advancing age, beyond mid-life, is associated with an increased stiffness of large elastic arteries, especially the aorta. Arterial stiffening adversely affects the characteristic impedance of the aorta, requiring more cardiac work and raising SBP as more stroke volume is delivered during systole owing to the increased pulse wave velocity (PWV). DBP also decreases due to less elastic recoil leading to reduced flow, thus increasing pulse pressure (PP) independent of any changes in MAP. PWV been shown to be an independent predictor of CV outcomes, including mortality,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> myocardial infarction (MI),<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> stroke,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> atrial fibrillation,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> cognitive decline<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and renal dysfunction,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and more specifically aortic PWV (aPWV), a robust measure of aortic arterial stiffness, has been shown to predict the adverse CV outcomes.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Another consequence of arterial ageing and stiffening is that the amplification of SBP and PP from the aortic root to the peripheral arteries diminishes. In a healthy arterial system, central aortic systolic pressure (CASP) and PP are amplified as they move towards the periphery, such that the measured brachial systolic pressure is typically around 10&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg higher than the corresponding aortic root pressure.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> With ageing, this amplification is reduced because of the increased PWV and the increase in the early wave reflection resulting in the measured brachial SBP and PP becoming closer to the corresponding aortic root pressures. Some studies have suggested that central pressures may have a closer correlation than peripheral BP with end-organ damage<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;15</xref> and CV risk,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> such as extent of coronary atherosclerosis, carotid intima-media thickness, left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and LV diastolic function.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>These observations raise the intriguing question as to whether treatments used to lower BP could differentially affect aortic pressure relative to brachial pressures and also arterial stiffness per se. It has been demonstrated that BP-lowering drugs can have marked differential effects on central aortic pressure (CAP) and brachial BP.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> These effects mimic a functional antiageing effect in terms of their impact on wave-form morphology, and greater reduction in central pressures relative to brachial pressures. Intriguingly, the &#x003b2;-blockers, a drug class which was least effective at lowering aortic pressure also appeared to be the least effective class at reducing the risk of stroke in elderly patients.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> This supports the concept that the more effective lowering of aortic relative to brachial pressure may be clinically important.</p><p>Despite the findings cited above, controlling SBP remains the most important unmet need in the clinical management of hypertension. The rise in SBP and PP with ageing appears to be strongly related to arterial stiffening and increased impedance to flow through a stiff aorta. This suggests that the treatments targeting aortic stiffening and reducing characteristic impedance would be effective particularly at reducing systolic pressure. Early proof of this concept came from the studies with omapatrilat, a vasopeptidase inhibitor that simultaneously inhibits neprilysin and ACE. Neprilysin inhibition enhances natriuretic peptide (NP) levels by blocking their degradation. NP has vasodilating actions, which could reduce aortic stiffness, improve characteristic impedance and thereby reduce SBP and PP. Studies with omapatrilat show greater improvements in aortic characteristic impedance compared with enalapril, beyond the effects of BP lowering after 12&#x02005;weeks of therapy.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> This benefit on aortic function was also associated with impressive data on SBP and PP lowering in patients with hypertension.</p><p>Although omapatrilat was withdrawn due to safety concerns, a proof of concept was established for concomitant inhibition of neprilysin and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) with the potential to be an attractive treatment strategy to improve aortic haemodynamics. Increased NP levels also promote natriuresis and reduce sympathetic tone, together with antiproliferative and antihypertrophic effects and inhibition of aldosterone secretion.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Alongside, suppression of RAAS would be complementary to neprilysin inhibition, which attenuates vasoconstriction, reduces sodium and water retention and also inhibits the development of CV hypertrophy and adverse remodelling.</p><p>Recently, LCZ696, a first-in-class angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), has been developed. LCZ696 delivers systemic exposure to a neprilysin inhibitor prodrug, AHU377 (which rapidly converts into active LBQ657), and an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), valsartan. LCZ696 at 100, 200 and 400&#x02005;mg once daily, in patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension, resulted in greater BP reductions than corresponding doses of valsartan alone (160 and 320&#x02005;mg) and was well tolerated.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> LCZ696 compared with valsartan was effective especially at reducing brachial SBP and PP. Furthermore, in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, LCZ696 has shown to reduce N-terminal-pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), a biomarker of LV wall stress, to a greater extent than valsartan alone at 12&#x02005;weeks and was well tolerated.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>Thus, the big challenge in hypertension treatment is to reduce the SBP, and the available evidence suggests that this could be achieved by improving the haemodynamic performance of the ageing aorta. The Prospective comparison of Angiotensin Receptor neprilysin inhibitor with Angiotensin receptor blocker MEasuring arterial sTiffness in the eldERly (PARAMETER) study is designed to compare the effect of LCZ696 with olmesartan, an ARB, on CASP, other measures of central aortic haemodynamics and arterial stiffness and ambulatory BPs in elderly patients with an elevated brachial SBP and a widened PP. The widened PP was chosen as an entry criteria as being indicative of aortic stiffening and advanced aortic ageing. The objective was to determine whether the ARNI LCZ696 can reverse some of the effects of arterial ageing in elderly patients with systolic hypertension, and thereby improve aortic pressures and haemodynamics. The study was initiated in December 2012 and the final results are expected in 2015.

The sample size is calculated to ensure a power of 90% to detect statistical significance for the comparison of LCZ696-based treatment regimen with the olmesartan-based treatment regimen in assessing the superiority at the week 12 endpoint, under the alternative hypothesis that the treatment difference is 6.5&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg at a two-sided significance level of 0.05. Assuming a 15% dropout rate, the total targeted sample size to be randomised is 432 patients (216 per group). The primary variable at the week 12 endpoint will be analysed using a two-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with treatment and region as factors and the baseline as a covariate.

The majority of elderly patients present with features of arterial stiffening, notably isolated systolic hypertension (ISH), disrupted circadian BP variation, a non-dipping or early morning riser phenotype of hypertension and orthostatic hypertension. Moreover, compared with younger people, elderly patients are usually characterised with augmented aortic systolic and PP relative to brachial pressure, associated with diminished aortic-brachial pressure amplification resulting in the &#x02018;true&#x02019; elevation of brachial systolic and PPs. In turn, the elevated aortic and brachial PPs that result from increased cardiac work to overcome the increased characteristic impedance of the aorta due to its age-related stiffening cause an increased predisposition to LV hypertrophy, myocardial ischaemia and heart failure.</p><p>Our hypothesis is that the ARNI LCZ696 provides a novel approach to neurohormonal modulation by concomitantly enhancing the NP system and suppressing the RAAS. Owing to the effects of enhanced NPs and RAAS inhibition, LCZ696 is anticipated to improve aortic stiffness, reduce characteristic impedance and improve central haemodynamics. NPs inhibit the production and action of vasoconstrictor peptides, inhibit sympathetic outflow and protect against excess salt and water retention.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> NPs also inhibit cardiac growth or the development of compensatory cardiac hypertrophy and regulate CV function.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Inhibition of sympathetic tone might be beneficial in controlling morning surge in BP in elderly patients with hypertension.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>
<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> In addition, suppressing the RAAS offers the potential for many similar actions on CV structure and function as well as favourable effects on microcirculatory haemodynamics as evidenced by observations of reduced albuminuria and renal protection beyond what might have been anticipated from BP reduction alone.</p><p>It has already been demonstrated that LCZ696 provides superior reductions in msSBP and msDBP versus valsartan in an 8-week study including 1328 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. In addition, LCZ696 significantly reduced maSBP versus valsartan (between-treatment difference: LCZ696 200&#x02005;mg vs valsartan 160&#x02005;mg, &#x02212;3.23&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg, 95% CI &#x02212;5.70 to &#x02212;0.75; LCZ696 400&#x02005;mg vs valsartan 320&#x02005;mg,&#x02212;5.14&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg, 95% CI &#x02212;7.70 to &#x02212;2.59). However, there was no significant treatment difference in maDBP reductions, thereby providing evidence of improvements in PP with LCZ696 versus valsartan. These findings are consistent with improvements in large artery function. Furthermore, BP control rates were significantly higher with LCZ696 200&#x02005;mg than with 160&#x02005;mg valsartan (46% (78/168) vs 33% (54/163), p=0&#x000b7;0147). Importantly, in these studies, unlike the vasopeptidase inhibitor omapatrilat, LCZ696 was generally well tolerated without an incidence of angio-oedema during 8&#x02005;weeks of treatment.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>The reported improvements in PP suggest the potential for LCZ696 to protect more effectively than the existing BP-lowering agents from several consequences of ISH and vascular stiffness, such as stroke and diastolic heart failure. However, in the study by Ruilope <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> CAP, central haemodynamics and arterial stiffness were not assessed, precluding a meticulous assessment of the mechanisms underpinning the superior antihypertensive properties of LCZ696.</p><p>In the PARAMETER study, the measurement of CAP should more accurately assess the loading conditions on the LV, myocardium, coronary arteries&#x000a0;and cerebral vasculature, and therefore, theoretically, CAP should provide a basis for more effective protection against CV target organ damage and events compared with brachial pressures. In this regard, even in normotensive individuals, measurement of aortic BP enhances the ability to predict the target organ changes.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></p><p>The PARAMETER study was initiated in December 2012, with a novel design to evaluate central haemodynamics in elderly patients with ISH and a widened PP at 12 and 52&#x02005;weeks of treatment with LCZ696 or ARB olmesartan. If the changes in CASP at 12&#x02005;weeks (acute haemodynamic effect) are larger than that in SBP, this would support the hypothesis that LCZ696 has the potential to favourably impact aortic haemodynamics and improve ventricular-vascular coupling in elderly patients with aged aortas and ISH. Treatment differences in PWV at 52&#x02005;weeks would further support a direct beneficial effect of LCZ696 on aortic stiffness due to structural changes, independent of MAP, as both treatment groups will be titrated to achieve similar BP control. The overall effect of LCZ696 on maBP (maSBP, maDBP and maPP), 24&#x02005;h BP variability (SD, covariance) and circadian BP rhythms (nocturnal dipping status and morning surge) will also be assessed in comparison with olmesartan. The study targets randomisation of 432 patients and final results are expected in 2015. We acknowledge the limitations of this study which is designed to look at surrogate markers rather than major CV outcomes; nevertheless, this is important to establish whether there are differential effects of drugs therapies on surrogate outcomes of CV disease to justify and impact on the design of subsequent phase III studies assessing the potential of LCZ696 for enhanced CV disease and stroke prevention in elderly patients with ISH.</p><p>In addition to the PARAMETER study, the efficacy and safety of LCZ696 are being evaluated in related studies, for example, in comparison with olmesartan in elderly patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, in patients with systolic hypertension and in patients with systolic hypertension who did not respond to olmesartan. Although it is hypothesised in the PARAMETER study that LCZ696 will be more effective at lowering central aortic and brachial BP compared with olmesartan, it is also recognised that other agents may need to be added to reach recommended BP goals in the elderly patients with systolic hypertension. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs, usually amlodipine) and diuretics are the most commonly used antihypertensive agents in combination with RAAS blockade for patients failing to achieve their BP goal with RAAS blockade monotherapy. Besides being very effective, such combination therapies of specific antihypertensive classes may also improve safety and tolerability. For example, addition of ARBs to CCBs has been shown to reduce the peripheral oedema associated with amlodipine monotherapy.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Similarly, diuretic-induced hypokalaemia has been shown to be attenuated when RAAS blockade is combined with diuretic therapy.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> To further evaluate such combination therapies with LCZ696, the BP-lowering efficacy, safety and tolerability are being evaluated in combination with amlodipine in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, who were non-responsive to amlodipine, and in patients with systolic hypertension. There are also other trials investigating the efficacy and safety of LCZ696 in patients with severe hypertension and in patients with renal impairment.</p><p>In summary, the PARAMETER study will evaluate mechanisms associated with BP lowering in elderly patients with an aged CV system as evidenced by systolic hypertension and a widened PP. The study will define whether LCZ696, a first-in-class ARNI, is more effective in lowering CASP and CAPP than ARB olmesartan and also explore whether this effect is related to a BP-independent reduction in arterial stiffening, suggesting a novel mechanism to target systolic hypertension, a major and increasingly important unmet therapeutic need in the management of hypertension in elderly patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e226" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-004254.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e227" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-004254.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge Dr Sreedevi Boggarapu (Novartis Healthcare Pvt.
