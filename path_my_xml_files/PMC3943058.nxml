Incidence of IS varies from 0.2 to 0.6 per 100 child, and the peak onset age of the epileptic syndrome is 3 to 7 months. The spasms are bilateral, causing symmetric sudden contractions of neck, trunk, and extremities, and they may be of flexor, extensor or mixed types. Hypsarrhythmia pattern is seen in electroencephalography of such patients, which is composed of a chaotic, bilaterally asynchronous highvoltage polyspike and slow wave discharges interspersed with multifocal spikes and slow waves (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Etiologic classification of infantile spasms is as follows:</p><p>1. Symptomatic: with identifiable prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal causes with developmental delay at the time of presentation</p><p>2. Cryptogenic: Unknown underlying cause, normal development at the onset of spasms, normal neurological exam and neuroimaging and no abnormalities in metabolic evaluation.</p><p>3. Idiopathic: Pure functional cerebral dysfunction with complete recovery, no residual dysfunction, normal neurodevelopment, normal neuroimaging, and normal etiologic evaluation. This class is based on final outcome and cannot be certainly confirmed according to the history and presenting symptoms. The terms idiopathic and cryptogenic have been synonymously used in many studies (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>Since early control of spasms may improve prognosis and is accompanied by a higher chance for normal developmental outcome, treatment should be begun immediately (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>There is no agreement on the first choice of the drug for treatment of IS and no single treatment regimen could be considered superior to others. ACTH or oral corticosteroids, pyridoxine, vigabatrin, and other drugs such as valproic acid, nitrazepam (NZP), topiramate (TPM), zonisamide, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, felbamate, ganaxolone, liposteroid, thyrotropinreleasing hormone, intravenous immunoglobulin, and also ketogenic diet might be used in treatment of spasms as first or second line drugs (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). </p><p>ACTH is expensive and hard to obtain in Iran and it has many side-effects, including hypertension, infection, electrolyte abnormalities, hyperglycemia, weight changes, brain shrinkage, sleep and behavioral abnormalities, subdural hematoma/effusion, development of new seizure types, and even death (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Irreversible visual field defect was seen in 30 to 50% of children who were treated with vigabatrin (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). </p><p>It is difficult to recommend for treatment of IS in the absence of comparative trials. So, new antiepileptic drugs with greater efficacy and fewer side-effects are fiercely needed. TPM is one such an agent, and it may also be used as a second-line agent in treatment of IS of tuberous sclerosis, and as a first-line agent for other symptomatic IS treatments. Its anticonvulsant effect is based on the following mechanisms: </p><p>a) Blocking of voltage-dependent Na channels; </p><p>b) Enhancing the inhibitory activity of GABA;</p><p>c) Inhibition of excitatory neurotransmission by blocking Kainate /AMP glutamate receptors;</p><p>d) Inhibition of erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>There is no consensus on mean daily dose of TPM (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), and up to 35 mg/kg/day has been used in IS (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) but maximum dose of 12 mg/kg/day is more effective and safer (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>The purpose of this study was to compare clinical efficacy and safety of TPM and NZP as first-line drugs in the control of infantile spasms in Yazd, Iran.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials &#x00026; Methods</title><p>A randomized single&#x02013;blind clinical, open-label, parallel group study was conducted on patients with ISs who were referred to Pediatric Neurology Clinic of Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran, from September 2008 to March 2010.</p><p>Eligible participants included two months to two years old children who had ISs, and did not use any antiepileptic drugs, ACTH and/ or oral corticosteroids. </p><p>Exclusion criteria consisted of presence of metabolic acidosis, kidney dysfunction, renal stone, and those who had not completed 6 months of treatment period.</p><p>The diagnostic criteria for the IS in this study were based on International League against Epilepsy (ILAE), which were classified and done with two groups: symptomatic and cryptogenic (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). </p><p>The developmental status of the patients was assessed by a pediatric neurologist according to Denver II Developmental Screening test. </p><p>Equal randomization was used in this trial, and the allocation ratio was 1:1 for the two groups.</p><p>Simple randomization was done using a computer generated random number list, which was prepared by an investigator with no clinical involvement in the trial, and no restriction was exerted. First of all, a research resident obtained parents&#x02019; consent and called a person who was independent of the recruitment process for allocation consignment.</p><p>The trial adhered to established procedures to maintain separation between the persons who took outcome assessment and the staff who delivered the intervention. The drug which was packaged and labeled according to a medication code schedule generated before the trial, was delivered by the nurses of the clinic. Inside of all packages, amount of the drug in one tablet and the dosage were written. After opening the packages, drug dosage was determined by pediatric neurologist based on each child&#x02019;s weight.</p><p>Primary and secondary outcomes were assessed by a research resident who was not informed of the drug group assignment. Investigators, staff, and participants were all kept masked to outcome measurements and trial results.</p><p>Informed consent was taken from the patients&#x02019; parents, and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran.</p><p>Sample size based on Z formula and confidence interval of 95% with 80% power, type one error of 5%, good response (more than 50% decrease in weekly seizure frequency during the follow-up period) of 85% for TPM treatment in another study (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), and an effect size (difference in frequency of good response between the two groups) of 40% for the primary efficacy end point, was assessed in 22 patients per group. For more accuracy, total sample size was determined to be 50 children.</p><p>After evaluation for inclusion and exclusion criteria, eligible patients were distributed into two groups. In group one, 25 infants were treated with TPM and in group two, 25 patients were treated with NZP.</p><p>In both groups, the drugs were administered orally in two divided doses and were started with lowest dosage to minimize side effects and then, dosage was increased to maximum in a weekly period or to a dosage which controlled seizures in a four-week period as follows: 3, 6, 9, 12 mg/kg/day in patients who took TPM and 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1 mg/kg/day in those for whom NZP was used.</p><p>During the treatment period, patients were followed up by a pediatric resident of research and in monthly consecutive visits of the patients in the Pediatric Neurology Clinic of Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran, clinical information about seizure frequency and the drugs&#x02019; side-effects were obtained by interview with the patients&#x02019; parents, and information of physical examination data which were recorded on questionnaires.</p><p>At the end of the 6-month follow up period, drug efficacy and safety were evaluated. Weekly seizure frequency was compared with its related number, before and 6 months after the drug use, and the following classification was done:</p><p>1. Seizure-free: all the spasms stopped </p><p>2. Improved: more than 50% reduction in spasms frequency</p><p>3. Unchanged: no notable changes was seen in spasms frequency</p><p>4. Worsened: spasms frequency increased more than 25%</p><p>Cessation of all spasms or more than 50% of reduction in weekly seizure frequency was considered as effective and good response.</p><p>Video&#x02013;EEG monitoring facilities were not available in our city and cessation of clinical seizures was indicative of successful management of IS.</p><p>Primary endpoint was efficacy in cessation of all seizures or reduction of more than 50% in weekly seizure frequency which was evaluated before and 6 months after drug use. </p><p>Secondary outcome was clinical side-effects of the drugs in the duration of treatment. The data were analyzed using SPSS statistical software (version 15). Chi-square test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test were used for data analysis of qualitative variables, and mean values were compared using independent t-test. </p><p>Differences were considered significant at p-values of less than 0.05.

Based on pediatric neurology textbook, hypsarrhythmia may be seen in 66% of patients and it is most obvious in non-rapid eye movement (non- REM) sleep (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). This EEG pattern appears after 3-4 months of age and may only be present periodically and may change or even be resolved by the passage of time. Moreover, during REM sleep and immediately after arousal from REM or non-REM sleep, EEG can be normal for up to several minutes (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). </p><p>In this study, good response to drugs was not different in symptomatic and cryptogenic IS, which is not in accordance with other studies (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, control of all spasms by TPM treatment was seen in 48% of patients.

They were evaluated 6 months after the discontinuation of the drug, and no cases had recurrence of spasms (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>In an open label study, 20 children with medically refractory infantile spasms or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome were treated with NZP in dose of 0.5-3.5 mg/kg/day. Control of all seizures and more than 50% reduction in seizure frequency were respectively seen in 25% and 35% of them, and side-effects were oral hypersecretion in 60% and sedation in 30% (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>In a study on evaluation of the effectiveness of NZP in Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, the most common sideeffects were drooling in 60% and sedation in 40% of their patients (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p><p>Sudden death and higher mortality were reported in epileptic children who received NZP (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), and tolerance to drug and significant adverse effects of NZP has deterred its more use (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, training of parents and children health care providers for early reference, diagnosis, and treatment of ISs is necessary. TPM is an effective and safe drug in treatment of ISs, which should be considered as first line of treatment.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table1</label><caption><p>Comparison of Clinical and Paraclinical Characteristics of Patients In Both Groups</p></caption><table frame="box" rules="all"><thead><tr><th style="background-color:#C2DECB;" align="center" valign="middle" colspan="3" rowspan="1">Data</th><th style="background-color:#C2DECB;" align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Topiramate</th><th style="background-color:#C2DECB;" align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Nitrazepam</th><th style="background-color:#C2DECB;" align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">P.Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Sex</td><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Female </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17</td><td align="center" rowspan="2" colspan="1">0.248</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Male</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" colspan="1">Type of infantile spasms </td><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Flexor </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td><td align="center" rowspan="3" colspan="1">0.46</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Extensor </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Mixed </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Family history of epilepsy </td><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Yes </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td align="center" rowspan="2" colspan="1">0.14</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">No</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Hypsarrhythmia in EEG </td><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Yes </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20</td><td align="center" rowspan="2" colspan="1">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">No </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Neuroimaging results </td><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Abnormal </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17</td><td align="center" rowspan="2" colspan="1">0.55</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Normal </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="8" colspan="1">Etiologic class </td><td align="left" rowspan="7" colspan="1">Symptomatic</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tuberous sclerosis</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="center" rowspan="8" colspan="1">0.22</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Inborn error of metabolism</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Chromosomal &#x00026;
