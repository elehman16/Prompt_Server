Furthermore, celecoxib has been reported to reduce restenosis after coronary stenting by inhibiting expression of the proto-oncogene Akt. A concern is that celecoxib increases thrombogenicity by inhibiting the synthesis of prostacyclin in endothelial cells. However, it is not known whether the administration of celecoxib will attenuate the antiplatelet effects of aspirin and clopidogrel, which are used after stenting. We addressed this gap in our knowledge.</p></sec><sec><title>Subjects and Methods</title><p>We recruited healthy volunteers (n=40) and randomized them into five subgroups (n=8 for each group: aspirin, celecoxib, aspirin+celecoxib, aspirin+clopidogrel, and aspirin+clopidogrel+celecoxib). Each subject received their medications for 6 days and blood samples were taken on day 0 and day 7. Celecoxib (200 mg twice a day), and/or aspirin (100 mg daily), and/or clopidogrel (75 mg daily) were administered. We compared platelet function among subgroups using light transmittance aggregometry and arachidonic acid metabolite assays.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Celecoxib treatment alone did not significantly affect platelet aggregation. The reduction in adenosine diphosphase (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation by aspirin+clopidogrel was not affected by addition of celecoxib (31.3&#x000b1;6.9% vs. 32.4&#x000b1;12.2%, p=0.83). Inhibition of collagen-induced platelet aggregation by aspirin+clopidogrel was not affected by addition of celecoxib (47.6&#x000b1;13.4% vs. 51.6&#x000b1;3.7%, p=0.69). Drug-induced changes in prostacyclin and thromboxane levels did not differ among treatment groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Celecoxib treatment does not interfere with the antiplatelet effects of aspirin or clopidogrel, suggesting that celecoxib can be safely administered in combination with dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with coronary stenting without increased thrombogenicity.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Celecoxib</kwd><kwd>Platelet aggregation inhibitors</kwd><kwd>Thrombosis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Celecoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, has been widely used to manage patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.

Subjects were proved to have no abnormalities on physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram, and routine laboratory tests. Subjects with a history of cardiovascular disease, or hemostatic disorder, and hypersensitivity to NSAIDs and clopidogrel, were excluded. Women with childbearing potential were tested for pregnancy, and women with a positive test result were excluded. Others were excluded if they were smokers, chronic drinkers or overweight (exceeding 20% of standard body weight). Subjects had to abstain from alcohol, beverages containing caffeine, and other drugs beginning one week before the study.</p><p>The study was approved by the review board of Seoul National University Hospital. Written and informed consent was obtained from all volunteers before enrollment in the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>We designed a single-center, open label, parallel-group and randomized study. Young healthy volunteers (n=40) were randomized into 5 groups: celecoxib only (CCX), aspirin only (ASA), celecoxib+aspirin (CCX+ASA), aspirin+clopidogrel (CCX+CPD), and celecoxib+aspirin+clopidogrel group (CCX+ASA+CPD). Screening tests were performed 3 days before the initiation of the study. A celecoxib (Celebrex&#x000ae;, Pfizer Korea, Seoul, Korea) dose of 200 mg twice a day was chosen since this is the usual dose in clinical practice for treating arthritis and pain. Aspirin (Rhonal&#x000ae;, Kun-Wha Pharmaceuticals, Seoul, Korea) 100 mg daily, and/or clopidogrel (Plavix&#x000ae;, Sanofi-Aventis, Seoul, Korea) 75 mg daily were used because they are the standard doses for treating patients with ischemic heart disease. Each subject received their assigned medications for six consecutive days. Blood samples were collected at day 0 (pre) and day 7 (post) for assessment of platelet aggregation. Urine samples were collected at the same time to evaluate prostacyclin and thromboxane levels.</p><p>Whole blood samples were drawn into four standard sodium citrate containing tubes. Samples were centrifuged at 1,200 rpm for 2 minutes and 30 seconds. Platelet aggregation was induced by adenosine 5'-diphosphate (adenosine diphosphase, ADP) or collagen. It was measured using a Chronolog Lumi-Aggregometer (model 560-Ca, Chrono-log Corp., Havertown, PA, USA). The extent of platelet aggregation in samples was expressed by the maximum increase in light transmittance compared to baseline values.</p><p>Urine 6-keto PGF<sub>1&#x003b1;</sub>, a stable metabolite of prostaglandin I<sub>2</sub> (PGI<sub>2</sub>), was measured as described in previous studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12)</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13)</xref> Urine samples were centrifuged to remove any precipitates. Correlate-EIA&#x02122; Immunoassay kits (Assay Designs, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI, USA) were used to measure urine levels of 6-keto PGF<sub>1&#x003b1;</sub>. Values obtained using the kit were adjusted by VAGUE. the urine creatinine level of each subject. Urine samples were also used to measure urinary 11-dehydro-TXB<sub>2</sub>, which is a major metabolite of TXB<sub>2</sub>.

The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to analyze for between group differences. Results for urinary 6-keto PGF<sub>1&#x003b1;</sub> were calculated to show changes from baseline values. The Mann-Whitney test was performed to show whether any differences in prostacyclin between groups was statistically significant. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software (Version 12.0 for Windows, SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analysis.

Our study shows that the effect of celecoxib on prostacyclin production is not significant when added to a regimen of aspirin and clopidogrel. Moreover, celecoxib tended to decrease the level of thromboxane production further when given in combination with aspirin and clopidogrel. No adverse events during the study was observed.</p><sec><title>Effect of celecoxib on prostacyclin and thromboxane metabolism</title><p>There has been a concern that COX-2 inhibitors might increase thrombogenicity and are associated with adverse cardiovascular events. The rationale was that COX-2 inhibitors suppress the synthesis of prostacyclin in endothelial cells while they cannot inhibit thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> formation due to unopposed expression of COX-1 in platelets.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14)</xref> It was demonstrated that urinary excretion of 2, 3 dinor-6 keto PGF<sub>1&#x003b1;</sub> and 6-keto PGF<sub>1&#x003b1;</sub>, which represents prostacyclin biosynthesis, was reduced by celecoxib at 4-6 hours after dosing, and partially recovered after 12-24 hours.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13)</xref> The effect of aspirin and clopidogrel on prostacyclin production was assessed <italic>in vitro</italic> in a previous study,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15)</xref> where aspirin reduced endothelial production of 6-keto PGF<sub>1&#x003b1;</sub> significantly in a concentration-dependent way, whereas clopidogrel did not. However, celecoxib did not interfere with normal mechanisms of platelet aggregation and hemostasis and did not alter serum thromboxane B<sub>2</sub> level in healthy adults.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16)</xref></p><p>In our study, prostacyclin production tended to decrease in all five groups after treatment. Although it was not statistically significant, prostacyclin production seemed to decrease more in the ASA+CCX group than in the ASA group, and more in the ASA+CPD+CCX than in the ASA+CPD group. But these changes in prostacyclin production were paralleled by changes in thromboxane. Our results shows that urinary 11-dehydro-TXB<sub>2</sub> levels were also decreased significantly more in the ASA+CCX group than in the ASA only group, and tended to decrease more in the ASA+CPD+CCX group compared to the ASA+CPD group. Together, these results suggest that celecoxib as a COX-2 inhibitor has a neutral effect on platelet aggregation since it has mild inhibitory effects not only on prostacyclin production but also on thromboxane production, thus not changing the balance of prostacyclin and thromboxane.</p></sec><sec><title>No effect of celecoxib on aspirin's anti-platelet action</title><p>In this study, aspirin inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation and collagen-induced platelet aggregation by 13% and 55% respectively.

Clopidogrel has a potent anti-thrombotic action by blocking P2Y12, a platelet ADP receptor, and also inhibits platelet aggregation induced by collagen.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15)</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23)</xref></p><p>In our study, we demonstrated a significant additional inhibitory effect of clopidogrel on both ADP- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation when added to aspirin. More importantly, we observed that the enhanced antiplatelet effect of dual antiplatelet therapy compared to aspirin alone is not altered by concomitant celecoxib use. This result is consistent with our previous prospective randomized clinical trial,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3)</xref> where additional of celecoxib treatment for 6 months after coronary stenting significantly reduced late loss of the stented segment and the target lesion revascularization rate without any increase in adverse thrombotic events. It is noteworthy that all patients in this trial were taking both aspirin and clopidogrel for more than six months after stenting.</p></sec><sec><title>NSAIDs class adverse effects</title><p>Despite these results indicating that celecoxib does not attenuate the antiplatelet action of aspirin and clopidogrel, and that celecoxib might even have a favorable effect on the cardiovascular system, several clinical studies have questioned the safety of celecoxib treatment for the cardiovascular system.

But such risk may not be celecoxib-specific. Rather, it may that the increased risk is associated with the entire class of NSAIDs. The mechanism of class risk of NSAIDs may be multi-factorial, i.e., induction of blood pressure elevation and platelet aggregability, etc. Actually, celecoxib's cardiovascular risk has been reported to be relatively low compared with other NSAIDs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27)</xref> Addition of celecoxib to patients who take dual anti-platelet agents due to coronary stenting, do not appear to be associated with thrombotic risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>The current study recruited young healthy volunteers instead of old patients at risk for developing cardiovascular disease. In the setting of atherosclerosis, suppression of PGI<sub>2</sub> production in endothelial cells by celecoxib is pronounced, since COX-2 plays a greater role as a source of PGI<sub>2</sub>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28)</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29)</xref> As a result, celecoxib might have a more profound effect on prostanoid balance under atherosclerotic conditions, promoting platelet-dependent thrombosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30)</xref></p><p>The number of volunteers allocated to each treatment group was rather small. However, previous reports evaluating effects of celecoxib on antiplatelet activity and prostanoids had similar numbers of subjects. And results of platelet function tests in this study were consistent with those from previous studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Celecoxib does not interfere with the antiplatelet action of dual antiplatelet therapy, and it does not affect the balance of prostacyclin and thromboxane production. Recent evidence suggests that celecoxib may increase cardiovascular events in high risk patients and that aspirin may not be protective. Since patients with coronary artery stenting take aspirin and clopidogrel together, and some of them take it indefinitely, our study results are worth consideration. Celecoxib can be administered safely in these patients during coverage of dual antiplatelet therapy. Current warnings for celecoxib now mandate larger clinical trials that evaluate the safety of celecoxib during dual antiplatelet therapy following stenting.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was partly supported by a grant [Circulation Multicenter 2005-1] from the Korean Circulation Society.
