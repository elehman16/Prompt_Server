Designs that will integrate with and translate readily into routine care, that are effective, cost-effective, acceptable to all stakeholders and that are feasible are particularly important in the context of currently overstretched postnatal and maternity care services.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref></p><p>The FEeding Support Team (FEST) intervention provided a dedicated feeding support team based on a postnatal ward that delivered proactive (feeding team-initiated) and reactive (woman-initiated) telephone support for breastfeeding women living in disadvantaged areas for up to 14&#x02005;days after hospital discharge. The FEST intervention consisted of four components. Three components are reported separately<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>: a before-and-after study; an embedded pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) of proactive and reactive telephone support for women living in disadvantaged areas who were breast feeding at the time of hospital discharge; and a cost-effectiveness analysis. The fourth component of FEST: a mixed quantitative and qualitative method process evaluation is the focus of this paper. In summary, there was no difference in feeding outcomes at 6&#x02013;8&#x02005;weeks for women initiating breast feeding 12&#x02005;week before the FEST intervention (n=413) compared with 12&#x02005;weeks after (n=388), suggesting that the dedicated feeding team on the postnatal ward had little impact. In the RCT of telephone support, 69 women living in more disadvantaged areas were randomised to proactive and reactive calls (intervention) (n=35) or reactive calls only (control) (n=34) for 14&#x02005;days after hospital discharge. Twenty-two intervention women compared with 12 control women were giving their baby some breast milk (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.40), and 17 intervention women compared with eight control women were exclusively breast feeding (RR 1.73, 95% CI 0.88 to 3.37) at 6&#x02013;8&#x02005;weeks after birth. Proactive telephone support provided by a dedicated feeding team based on a postnatal ward shows promise as an intervention within routine postnatal care. We have demonstrated that recruiting, following up and collecting data for a future trial of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness is feasible.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref></p><p>The FEST study process evaluation followed guidance on designing complex interventions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> and was informed by preliminary qualitative interviews and a review of the relevant literature.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> Randomised proactive telephone interventions to support breast feeding are mostly underpinned by an individual cognitive approach to behaviour change with the emphasis placed on the woman to sustain or change her feeding behaviour.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9 b10 b11 b12 b13 b14 b15">9&#x02013;15</xref> The interactions between the telephone intervention, health service structure and organisation and the cultural context in which it takes place have received little attention, and few studies have explicitly applied an ecological or systems approach to behaviour change as we did in FEST.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>

Mixed qualitative and quantitative methods were used. Data collection activity involving participants was carefully balanced to minimise interaction with the intervention delivery and outcomes (1) before and after the FEST team intervention on the ward and (2) between intervention and control women.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> The qualitative interviews and observations are therefore considered a fixed component of the intervention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref></p><sec><title>Setting</title><p>The study was conducted in a randomly selected postnatal ward from a maternity unit serving a mixed urban and rural population in Scotland.

Successful calls were defined as a telephone conversation between the team and the woman or her partner in contrast to attempted calls, which include no reply, engaged, answer phone message or text message. In some cases, women or their partner would phone the feeding team back at a more convenient time, and these calls were included in the FEST team-initiated phone call total used to calculate the median duration of successful calls. The time taken for attempted but unsuccessful phone calls was estimated as 1&#x02005;min if it was not documented and was included in the total used to calculate median telephone call duration. Detailed case notes describing the care provided for every trial participant were kept to facilitate team working and handover. Case notes were included in the qualitative data analysis described below. Workload activity diaries were collected over 7&#x02005;days by all three members of the FEST team, recording time spent (1) delivering the intervention to trial women, (2) involvement with non-trial women and (3) engaging in trial research activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics were used to summarise quantitative process evaluation data: number and percentage for categorical variables, and mean (or median) and SD (or IQR) for continuously distributed variables.

purposively invited to participate in interviews to explore their experiences of FEST. A sampling frame for staff was used to ensure diversity of age, qualifications, experience and role; characteristics are not reported to protect confidentiality. Every attempt was made to recruit staff who might have diverse views about breast feeding and/or the study. Semistructured interviews with women (n=40) and staff (n=17), each lasting 15&#x02013;75&#x02005;min and 16 FEST team-initiated telephone calls (3&#x02013;15&#x02005;min) were audio-recorded and transcribed. The sampling strategy and interview topic guides were modified through discussion as the data collection and analysis progressed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Analysis</title><p>Quantitative and qualitative data were analysed using the principles of the Framework approach.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> The research team familiarised themselves with data by listening to recordings and reading interview transcripts. Each of the four qualitative researchers independently developed a thematic framework, which was agreed and applied to transcripts and documents. Data were then summarised for each theme identifying verbatim data, researcher interpretations and referencing the page and line number of the transcript. Excel spreadsheet charts were created with participants (rows) grouped according to preintervention, intervention or control group. Chart columns consisted of quantitative demographic data, birth and feeding outcomes, the number, length and content of telephone calls and emergent qualitative themes from all sources of data (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">box 1</xref>). Charts allow differing perspectives and outcomes to be compared, pattern recognition, further interpretation, construction of higher level themes and concepts, assessment of theme saturation (no new data forthcoming) and identification of disconfirming data, as recommended by the constant comparative method in a grounded theory approach.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref></p></sec></sec><sec><title>Participatory approach to designing and implementing FEST</title><p>Between December 2009 and April 2010, the research team met with key members of the Health Board Infant Feeding Work Stream to develop the study protocol. Between May 2010 and November 2010, a study steering group (midwife and ward manager, consultant midwife, public health infant feeding advisor, community midwife, paediatrician, the feeding team and the research team) met monthly. All meetings took place in the maternity hospital to maximise NHS staff attendance. A recent mother from the preliminary qualitative study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> agreed to join the steering group; however, due to personal circumstances, she was unable to attend the meetings and there was insufficient time to recruit a replacement. PH chaired the meetings that were audio-recorded and researchers kept reflective diaries. Data from these meetings contributed to the qualitative data analysis. Through discussion, the steering group agreed team composition, working hours, recruitment, selection and protocols. At meetings, the steering group reflected on what aspects of the study were going well, less well, what could be done differently within the research protocol or in a future trial and reflected on changes made following previous meetings.</p><sec><title>Recruitment to the before-and-after cohort study</title><p>It was decided that all ward staff would be involved with completing the feeding at hospital discharge questionnaire and gaining informed consent for the 6&#x02013;8-week follow-up telephone call, as 24&#x02005;h availability would be required. Research processes and training were provided by the research team, although it was dependent on the ward manager to inform non-attending staff. A research priority was to maximise breastfeeding outcome data completion. This was always on the steering group meeting agenda, and a research assistant visited the ward most days to collect forms, encourage data completion and provide weekly feedback on recruitment and questionnaire return rates. The ward manager engaged the help of the ward clerk very early in the study and she played a crucial role in co-ordinating the paperwork. Weekly questionnaire return rates dropped substantially when she was on leave.</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment to the pilot RCT of telephone support</title><p>Ward staff approached women, provided verbal and written information and identified interested women.

Observing a breast feed is seen as &#x02018;very much part of the midwife's role&#x02019; and important, but with competing demands on their time, it was sometimes &#x02018;impossible&#x02019; and some were &#x02018;horrified&#x02019; that it was not reliably happening. The FEST team found it challenging to co-ordinate being available at the start of a breast feed with three-way patient&#x02013;staff&#x02013;team communications dependent on using buzzers and locating a team member, however, this improved over time.</p><disp-quote><p>I would say to the mum &#x0201c;I'll be back at that feed&#x0201d;, I'd write it down to go back and then I would go back to find the mum had fed, so they (ward staff) didn't really flag us up, whereas towards the end of the study they are flagging up now (Staff 2)</p></disp-quote><p>Students could be perceived as &#x02018;taking their (FEST team) mums&#x02019; and it took time for ward staff to &#x02018;know exactly what our role was&#x02019;.</p><p>Sitting through a breast feed was seen as important by both mothers and the feeding team to establish a trusting relationship for the ongoing telephone support at home.</p><disp-quote><p>The women that probably have been particularly appreciative of the phone calls are often the women that we've had a chance to sort of sit for, for quite a while, so they kind of know you, so that element is very important.

Three women chose to stop proactive calls in the first week: one had stopped breast feeding and two were having no difficulties. Other women who reported few difficulties opted for alternate day calls after day 7. Women who were still breast feeding at 6&#x02013;8&#x02005;weeks received a higher median number of successful calls and fewer attempted calls than women who were formula feeding.

Women would have liked more flexibility to call outside the 13.00&#x02013;19.00 team hours, to fit with other household roles like meals, partner's work or school times. Some preferred not to have a call time saying &#x02018;when it suits you&#x02019;, as an appointment time added &#x02018;pressure&#x02019;:</p><disp-quote><p>I need to sleep when I need to sleep, not staying awake for somebody to phone me, so it was better that it was just more relaxed and kind of they'll phone when they'll phone and they'll phone again if they don't get me the first time. 10023 (Proactive calls.

Telephone recordings with team continuity demonstrated more warmth, humour, engagement and were longer than &#x02018;cold-calls&#x02019; where no face-to-face meeting had occurred. Recordings of cold-calls were more stilted, with less historical, contextual or in-depth information shared and voice tones suggested a more tentative trust. With continuity, feeding was set within the &#x02018;whole story about how this woman's feeling&#x02019;, for example, enquiring about other children or reminders of previous conversations.</p><disp-quote><p>They know the person and they know who's going to be phoning them, I think that's really good&#x02026;they'd met this person face to face and they know that that person knows their story and they can probably relate to that person. (Staff 9)</p></disp-quote><p>Case notes improved the consistency of information and advice provided, with women reporting no conflicting advice. However, team members described the awkwardness of relying on case notes only when cold-calling. At call closure, the name of who would phone the next day would be responded to with pleasure or occasionally disappointment if it was not the team member who they knew best.</p></sec><sec><title>Call style</title><p>The nature of calls can be best summarised as &#x02018;caring&#x02019;. Team members sometimes referred to &#x02018;not gelling&#x02019; or &#x02018;not bonding&#x02019;, which infers a lack of a deep connection between the team member and the woman. Care components included: non-judgemental listening, asking questions about the baby, the mother's own well-being, normalising experiences, providing reassurance, suggestions and flexibility in all aspects of the communication. Recordings and interviews revealed an &#x02018;unrushed&#x02019; calm ambience of calls, which were woman-centred rather than breast feeding-centred. No women reported feeling pressured or uncomfortable. In call transcripts, initial words were usually feeding neutral: &#x02018;How's the feeding going?&#x02019; &#x02018;How are you doing?&#x02019; &#x02018;How's the baby getting on with feeding?&#x02019; &#x02018;How was your first night at home?&#x02019; &#x02018;How are things today?&#x02019; Observations suggest that women who are coming to terms with feelings of embarrassment tend to refer to &#x02018;feeding the baby myself&#x02019; rather than &#x02018;breast feeding&#x02019; and the team were sensitive to this. There were several affirmative words relating to the mother's well-being for example: &#x02018;you're doing great, fantastic&#x02019;, &#x02018;you sound really relaxed and happy so that's good&#x02019; and to the baby's well-being &#x02018;she's doing just grand&#x02019;. What was striking was that superlatives were not overtly linked to breast feeding, although to help with breast feeding was evidently the unvoiced purpose of the call. There was no mention in recorded phone calls of breast being &#x02018;best&#x02019; or the health benefits of breast feeding. However, the team satisfaction if breastfeeding problems were solved was evident in recordings: &#x0201c;I'm happy about that&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;that's really good&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec><title>Content of calls</title><p>Most recorded calls contained some direct questioning about feed frequency, sleep, wet and dirty nappies, nappy colour and baby contentment particularly in the first week. Where there was concern about the establishment of breast feeding, the team asked about breast fullness or heaviness, length of feeds, whether women were feeding from one or both breasts, whether the baby settles after feeds and rarely, where there were concerns, they asked about the baby's weight. Some of the team expressed surprise that there was so little discussion of positioning and attachment during calls, with phrases like &#x02018;latch&#x02019; and &#x02018;position&#x02019; used infrequently. This can be interpreted as appropriate as positioning and attachment cannot be assessed by telephone. From ward observations and interviews, some women prefer more directive suggestions than a non-directive counselling approach.</p><disp-quote><p>W: Is it possible for me to mix the breastfeeding because at the moment I haven't got a breast pump&#x02026;?</p><p>T: Sort of mixing the two, I would say that at the moment it's not a good idea because it sounds like you're not completely established in your breastfeeding and it might interfere with your milk coming in and the baby; so at the moment I would advise that you didn't do that. 10026 (Proactive calls. Breast and formula milk at 6&#x02013;8&#x02005;weeks)</p></disp-quote><p>Flexibility about mixed feeding was important to most women, who appreciated a non-judgemental approach and a discussion of all feeding options. Women were asked about their own rest and diet, emphasising the importance of self-care. Team suggestions included asking her partner to take the baby out in the buggy to give the woman some time to herself.</p></sec><sec><title>Lay language and levelling</title><p>Both on the phone and on the ward, lay rather than technical language was used, and our interpretation is that this acts as a leveller minimising the professional-woman knowledge gap and reinforcing women's experiences rather than scientific or technical knowledge, for example, &#x02018;Is she on your breast proper?&#x02019; There was reference to &#x02018;boobs&#x02019;, &#x02018;snot&#x02019;, &#x02018;pooh&#x02019; or &#x02018;rich milk at the end of a feed&#x02019; rather than the more technical &#x02018;fore&#x02019; and &#x02018;hind&#x02019; milk. This may reflect the team personalities and composition.

They would &#x02018;forget&#x02019; or feel &#x02018;completely overwhelmed&#x02019; or so &#x02018;miserable&#x02019; that they felt unable to pick up a phone to a stranger:</p><disp-quote><p>I maybe should've, but no I didn't.

Self-blame was evident with women perceiving not phoning for help as their &#x02018;own fault&#x02019;, and women appear to undervalue their own care in the context of their observations and experiences of how busy midwives are looking after the needs of others.</p><disp-quote><p>I don't particularly like phoning because I always think &#x02018;oh everyone will be so busy and they'll have other people to see&#x02019;, where if somebody's phoning you, you don't feel like you're using their time, it's like they're phoning you to make sure you're okay&#x02026;they could be busy and they don't need me. 10017 (Reactive calls.

There was some evidence that phone calls did not meet women's needs in the early days: &#x0201c;when my midwife came in she taught me how to do it, so I'm OK now&#x0201d;. The team saw the calls as &#x02018;working well&#x02019; to build women's confidence with the backup of face-to-face visits by the community midwife as &#x02018;the most important thing&#x02019;. Some team members and women felt frustration at not being able to meet face to face. Asking the mother to come back to the ward was proposed but seen as operationally difficult, due to space and &#x0201c;a big thing for all the other staff&#x02014;why is she here? What's going on?&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec><title>Team skills</title><p>The team felt that they had sufficient experience of speaking to women by phone and were ambivalent about whether pretrial training in telephone skills would help. One team member who had previously attended breastfeeding telephone counselling training found her old notes useful and another mentioned that a list of questions to ask might have helped at the start and developed her own. Protected time for regular team discussion was considered important but operationally challenging to achieve within the allocated resources. A team of four, with longer working hours would facilitate more team overlap and the costs of this are considered elsewhere (online tables).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> Conflicting advice, confusion or misunderstandings were not evident, which was seen as strength of having a small team.</p><disp-quote><p>If you do have a small team and you're all kind of saying the same thing, it does help a bit for mums that I can go away and I know that whoever's coming on after me will say the same thing. (Staff 3)</p></disp-quote><p>The team described learning on the job and acknowledged that training might help to manage difficult scenarios. For example: a cold-call where a rapport was difficult to establish; women who are very upset and crying &#x02018;what do you say&#x02019; or &#x02018;unpicking&#x02019; the reasons for a baby being sleepy.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>The advantages and disadvantages of the FEST intervention</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> summarises the process evaluation described in this paper combined with the feeding outcome and health economic data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> as a balance sheet of the advantages and disadvantages of the FEST intervention.

Particularly important themes were:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>the value of daily proactive telephone care</p></list-item><list-item><p>women's reluctance to initiate requests for help with breast feeding</p></list-item><list-item><p>continuity of care from hospital to home</p></list-item><list-item><p>a woman-centred approach</p></list-item><list-item><p>difficulty observing an entire breast feed prior to hospital discharge</p></list-item><list-item><p>the importance of a dedicated team with protected time to establish constructive relationships and prioritise breast feeding.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The intervention integrated well with existing postnatal care, and women were very satisfied with the frequency, length and content of proactive calls. However, in the context of an overstretched health service, women seemed to undervalue breast feeding as a reason to initiate calls to the team.</p><p>The participatory approach embedding a rigorous RCT within a before-and-after cohort study and using mixed methods to evaluate implementation processes and costs are strengths that will enable us to design a feasible and acceptable definitive trial. A mixed-methods approach is an emerging discipline, which adds value when designing RCTs of complex interventions within complex systems. Limitations include the lack of a free mobile and landline service, potentially limiting access to care, which would need to be addressed in a definitive trial. There are challenges for four researchers to prospectively collect and analyse qualitative data for a 3-month intervention period, including the skills needed to use qualitative data management software, which we decided against using. There are trade-offs when collecting process evaluation data between minimising interference with the intervention or the trial outcomes, sources of potential bias and the resources necessary for a rigorous qualitative evaluation. Interviewing more women who did not wish to be randomised and community staff caring for trial women at home might have added different perspectives. However, we did reach theoretical saturation for the perspectives of women randomised to the telephone intervention.</p><p>Telephone calls were shorter than staff expected lasting about 5&#x02005;min, which is similar to other studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> Importantly proactive care may counteract the inverse care law whereby more disadvantaged women are less likely to seek help,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> which may explain the low number of women-initiated calls in our study. This warrants further investigation, as it has implications for reactive breastfeeding telephone helplines. Telephone interventions are private, potentially less stigmatising than face-to-face care and may reduce differences due to socioeconomic factors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> Continuity of care was important and is known to increase breastfeeding initiation,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> but its effect on breastfeeding duration or exclusivity is less clear. An informal, reassuring, caring, woman-centred communication style was valued and increases women's self-confidence, supporting the findings of qualitative research synthesis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> &#x02018;Care&#x02019; captures the FEST intervention compared with &#x02018;support&#x02019; referred to in other studies,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> and it may be the perception that &#x02018;support&#x02019; is being provided that matters most.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> It is unknown how possible it is to train professionals to &#x02018;gel&#x02019; and &#x02018;care&#x02019;, and the jury is out on the benefits of specialised breastfeeding training, as interventions with health professionals have been inconclusive.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref></p><p>Observing a breast feed on the ward adds value to telephone breastfeeding support by helping to establish a rapport. Observing a breast feed is a requirement to achieve the Unicef Baby-friendly accreditation,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> which is endorsed as a minimum standard in UK postnatal care guidelines.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> The small observed increase from 15% (n=60) to 19% (n=73) of women who had an entire breast feed observed after the intervention may have contributed to the lack of team impact on breastfeeding outcomes in the before-and-after study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> Even with the dedicated team, finding uninterrupted time to watch an entire breast feed on the postnatal ward was difficult when faced with other institutional routines and priorities, as reported by others.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> Increased hours of availability of the feeding team on the ward are indicated for the definitive trial in order to facilitate breastfeed observation, as operationally it would probably be more difficult and costly to achieve in the community, particularly in rural areas.</p><p>Our data generate several further research questions:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Would establishing a relationship, regardless of who it is with (skills, personal characteristics, salary band, professional or lay status), immediately after birth with continuity of care once home be effective?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Could effective telephone support be delivered without a dedicated feeding team?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Would FEST be as effective and cost-effective if delivered entirely within primary care?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Would extended team hours translate into more women having a breast feed observed and improved breastfeeding outcomes?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Would training in woman-centred communication and telephone skills add value?</p></list-item></list></p><p>There are many components and interactions in this complex intervention operating at the individual level that could either mediate or moderate the breastfeeding outcomes. However, we would argue that further attempts to isolate individual components might not add value, prior to assessing wider generalisability to other teams and settings. Ecological<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> and systems theory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> would suggest focusing on organisational processes at the macro, meso and micro levels rather than on how individual women behave.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have found that proactive daily telephone calls, delivered by a dedicated feeding team on a postnatal ward who provide woman-centred continuity of care from hospital to home, are both feasible and acceptable to women and staff as a research study and as part of routine postnatal care. The FEST study shows promise and now requires testing in a definitive multicentre trial, prior to implementation in practice. Further process evaluation will be crucial as dedicated feeding teams would have widespread implications for the working lives of midwives, students, other staff and resources as well as women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d34e166" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001039.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d34e167" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001039.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all the women, NHS Grampian staff, committee members and colleagues who have made this study possible.
