The registrants were equally divided into groups and received the different treatments including hot herbal compress, hot compress, and topical diclofenac group, which served as the control group. After treatment courses, Visual Analog Scale and 36-Item Short Form Health survey were, respectively, used to establish the level of pain intensity and quality of life. In addition, cervical range of motion and pressure pain threshold were also examined to identify the motional effects. All treatments showed significantly decreased level of pain intensity and increased cervical range of motion, while the intervention groups exhibited extraordinary capability compared with the topical diclofenac group in pressure pain threshold and quality of life. In summary, hot herbal compress holds promise to be an efficacious treatment parallel to hot compress and topical diclofenac.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>hot herbal compress</kwd><kwd>hot compress</kwd><kwd>topical diclofenac</kwd><kwd>myofascial pain syndrome</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1-2156587217753451"><funding-source id="funding1-2156587217753451"><institution-wrap><institution>Thammasat University Fund under TU Scholar</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="funding1-2156587217753451">2/40/2560</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January-December 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Myofascial pain syndrome is one of the most common illnesses in the working-age population attributable to tasks that require remaining in a sitting posture for an extended period of time, such as using a computer. Myofascial pain syndrome leads to muscle and joint pain, particularly in the upper trapezius, which, in turn, adversely affects occupational efficiency and quality of life.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2156587217753451" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="bibr2-2156587217753451" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr3-2156587217753451" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr4-2156587217753451" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr5-2156587217753451" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> A widely used treatment is the administration of conventional medicine, especially nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, despite their efficacy in relieving pain and inflammation, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been found to cause undesirable side effects. One best alternative treatment for myofascial pain syndrome that can empirically relax muscles and alleviate pain and, at the same time, reduce the undesirable side effects of pain relief medication is the application of a hot compress.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2156587217753451" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>
</p><p>A review of the literature indicates that very little research on the use of a hot compress has employed a scientific instrument in following up its posttreatment efficacy. The present study, therefore, aimed to examine the efficacy of a hot compress in the treatment of myofascial pain syndrome in the upper trapezius in comparison with that of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Ultimately, it is hoped that the research will play a part in preserving Thai folk wisdom and advancing guidelines for developing Thai traditional medicine into scientific treatment recognized for its efficacy in alleviating chronic diseases and improving quality of life.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="section1-2156587217753451"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="section2-2156587217753451"><title>Study Designs</title><p>The present study was a single-blind randomized controlled trial using a simple random sampling method and a pregenerated random assignment scheme enclosed in an envelope.</p></sec><sec id="section3-2156587217753451"><title>Study Settings</title><p>The research was conducted at the Faculty of Medicine of Thammasat University at the time of the study.</p></sec><sec id="section4-2156587217753451" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>Ninety patients volunteered to participate in the study.

To recapitulate, it was found that the pain levels experienced by the 3 groups of participants reduced statistically significantly during the follow-up (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05). In addition, the PPT levels tolerated by the 3 groups of participants increased statistically significantly during the follow-up (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05). Additionally, improvements in the physical components and the mental components of quality of life across the 3 groups were statistically significant after the treatment (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05).</p><p>Such findings bear a resemblance to those in the literature.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2156587217753451" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr16-2156587217753451" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> One randomized controlled trial assigned 60 participants to a Thai massage group, a Thai herbal compress group, and an oral ibuprofen group in order to examine the efficacy of the 3 options in treating osteoarthritis and alleviating pain and stiffness, discovering statistically significant improvements on all assessment indices that were comparable across the 3 experimental groups.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2156587217753451" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Similarly, in a meta-analysis of the clinical effects of Thai herbal compress, it was found that all the 13 studies analyzed indicated that Thai herbal compress treatment resulted in statistically significant improvements in the alleviation of osteoarthritis and muscle pain and that such a treatment alternative was as efficacious as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, knee exercise, and hot compress therapy.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2156587217753451" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Similar results have also been reported elsewhere in studies examining the efficacy of similar therapeutic approaches focusing on relieving pain and increasing flexibility, such as massage, yoga, and stretching.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-2156587217753451" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="bibr18-2156587217753451" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr19-2156587217753451" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr20-2156587217753451" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>
</p><p>When explored further, the 3 treatment options applied in this study led to different outcome levels. That is, hot herbal compress treatment seemed to be generally superior to treatment with a hot compress and a topical diclofenac gel, albeit not statistically significantly, at least in terms of reducing pain intensity, enhancing CROM, and increasing PPT. This finding came as a surprise at first, but a review of the literature points to a similar likelihood.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2156587217753451" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr16-2156587217753451" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> For instance, hot herbal compress therapy was reported to be more efficacious than not only its alternative, nonmedical counterparts, such as a hot compress, massage, and muscle exercise, but also medical options administered to relieve pain, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2156587217753451" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr16-2156587217753451" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>
</p><p>Although definite reasons for the superiority of a hot herbal compress are not yet known, it may be hypothesized that the combination of heat and herbal ingredients including <italic>Z cassumunar</italic>, <italic>C longa</italic>, <italic>C citratus</italic>, <italic>C hystrix</italic>, <italic>T indica</italic>, <italic>A concinna</italic>, camphor, and sea salt gives this treatment option an advantage over others relying on only one therapeutic component, such as a hot compress and massage. <italic>Z cassumunar</italic> is used as an essential oil and is believed to ease pain and inflammation in traditional medicine. The rhizome oils of <italic>Z cassumunar</italic> have been previously investigated for its chemical composition. Terpinen-4-ol, &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-pinene, sabinene, myrcene, &#x003b1;- and &#x003b3;-terpinene, limonene, terpinolene, sabmene, and monoterpenes have been reported as its major constituents.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2156587217753451" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-2156587217753451" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> In addition, compound D, (E)-4-(3&#x02032;,4&#x02032;-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-2-ol, is another compound that can be found in the hexane extract of <italic>Z cassumunar</italic>. In many studies, compound D showed successive effectiveness on anti-inflammatory activity and anti-analgesic activity. Compound D also has been documented as a mediated prominently on the acute phase of inflammation as well as inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis in animal models.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-2156587217753451" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Apart from <italic>Z cassumunar</italic>, <italic>C longa</italic> also was added to the herbal ball. The methanolic extract from rhizomes was investigated to identify the chemical constituents. Previous research reported that the major compounds consisted of curcumin, ar-turmerone, &#x003b2;-sesquiphellandrene, and curcumenol.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-2156587217753451" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> In animal models, <italic>C longa</italic> rhizome extracts were also examined for analgesic and antipyretic activities, and the rhizome extracts showed effective potency on analgesic effect.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-2156587217753451" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>
<italic>C citratus</italic> is another widely used herb in folklore and traditional medicine. The chemical constituents of essential oil have been examined and it was found that geranial, neral, and myrcene were 3 main active constituents.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-2156587217753451" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Furthermore, <italic>C citratus</italic> was investigated for its analgesic and antipyretic properties, and previous research has suggested that the essential oil from <italic>C citratus</italic> displayed strong analgesic and antipyretic properties both in central and peripheral analgesic activities.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-2156587217753451" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="bibr27-2156587217753451" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>
<italic>C hystrix</italic> is another ingredient whose chemical composition in essential oil was reported, which dominantly contained citronella (citronellal, citronellol, and geraniol).<sup><xref rid="bibr28-2156587217753451" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Citronella, which is commonly used as an effective insect repellent, also exhibited analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-2156587217753451" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>
<italic>T indica</italic>, a leguminous tree in the family Fabaceae indigenous to tropical regions, was added into the herbal ball as another ingredient. Some scientific evidences reported its active constituents from leaves. Their results confirmed that its leaves contained essential oils, free and conjugated fatty acids, flavonoids, and other compounds such as linonene and benzyl benzoate.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-2156587217753451" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>
<italic>T indica</italic> was evaluated and its anti-inflammatory activity by the methanol extract showed significant reduction in paw thickness in carrageenan-induced acute inflammation and cotton pellet&#x02013;induced chronic inflammation models and also produced significant central analgesic activity.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-2156587217753451" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bibr32-2156587217753451" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>
<italic>A concinna</italic>, which has been commonly used in both the Ayurvedic and Thai traditional medicine, was also added. The chemical constituents of volatile compounds have already reported: <italic>A concinna</italic> contained common fatty acids such as palmitic and linoleic acid.<sup><xref rid="bibr33-2156587217753451" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Even though analgesic activity has not been documented, <italic>A concinna</italic> played an important role in immunological adjuvant activities by the saponin extracts, which lead to enhance IgG, IgG1 IgG2a, and IgG2b antibody levels in serum.<sup><xref rid="bibr34-2156587217753451" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Despite its advantage over a hot compress or a topical diclofenac gel, however, a hot herbal compress was found in the present study to be less satisfactory than a hot compress in terms of the physical components of quality of life and both a hot compress and a topical diclofenac gel in terms of the mental components of quality of life. This result does not seem to have any logical premises considering the fact that a hot herbal compress fared better than a hot compress and a topical diclofenac gel in terms of pain intensity, CROM, and PPT. One interpretation of the participants&#x02019; more favorable reaction to a topical diclofenac gel on the SF-36 is perhaps that their response might not be an accurate manifestation of their actual physical improvements. Alternatively, possible explanations may lie in different interactions between the 3 types of treatment and the self-rated physical and mental components scores of quality of life in contrast to such objectively measurable outcome variables such as pain intensity, CROM, and PPT.</p><p>Although this study has made it clear that a hot herbal compress is an alternative for patients with myofascial pain syndrome in the upper trapezius that is as efficacious as, if not more so than, comparable nonmedical choices, such as a hot compress, or even pain-relief medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, it remains to be seen to what physical mechanisms the efficacy of a hot herbal compress can be attributable, why actual physical improvements do not coincide with self-rated improvements in the physical and mental components of quality of life, and whether a hot herbal compress may have any undesirable side effects on this group of patients and under what conditions, to name but a few. Research answering these questions will not only preserve but also advance the application of Thai folk wisdom and alternative treatment, especially in alleviating muscle and joint pain caused by myofascial pain syndrome in the upper trapezius.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section19-2156587217753451"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study aimed to examine the efficacy of a hot herbal compress compared to that of a hot compress and a topical diclofenac gel in the treatment of patients with myofascial pain syndrome in the upper trapezius. The findings indicated that all the 3 treatment options were efficacious in reducing pain levels, increasing CROM, increasing PPT, and improving quality of life. However, hot herbal compress treatment contributed to lower pain levels and higher CROM and PPT. It can be concluded, therefore, that treatment with a hot herbal compress is likely to be a better option than that with a hot compress or a topical diclofenac gel.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge the Thammasat University Fund under TU Scholar Contract No. 2/40/2560 and the Faculty of Medicine of Thammasat University for sponsoring this study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-2156587217753451"><p><bold>Author Contributions:</bold> Study conception and design: Boonruab and Nimpitakpong</p><p>Acquisition of data: Boonruab, Damjuti, and Nimpitakpong</p><p>Analysis and interpretation of data: Boonruab and Damjuti</p><p>Drafting of manuscript: Boonruab and Damjuti</p><p>Critical revision: Damjuti</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="fn2-2156587217753451"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn3-2156587217753451"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded Thammasat University Fund under TU Scholar Contract No. 2/40/2560.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn4-2156587217753451"><p><bold>Ethical Approval:</bold> The study was approved by the Ethics Committee for Research Involving Human Subjects of the Faculty of Medicine, Thammasat University (No. 224/2559).</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-2156587217753451"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
