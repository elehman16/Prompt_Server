Participants are the primary caregivers of children aged 0 to 18&#x000a0;years admitted for a life threatening illness or injury to the Oncology, Cardiology, Neurology or Intensive Care Departments of a tertiary pediatric hospital. Parents will be randomized to intervention or waitlist control 4&#x02013;10&#x000a0;months after their child&#x02019;s diagnosis. Measures will be collected prior to and immediately post intervention for intervention and waitlist parents to assess program efficacy. Intervention parents will be followed up at 6&#x000a0;months to assess the maintenance of program effects. We predict that intervention parents will show fewer symptoms post intervention than waitlist parents (primary outcomes: traumatic stress, depression, anxiety, stress symptoms), reflecting improvements in the psychological skills addressed in the intervention (mediating factors). It is anticipated that reductions in mental health difficulties for intervention parents will be maintained up to 6&#x000a0;months post-intervention and will be associated with broader improvements in parents&#x02019; adjustment, child adjustment and child wellbeing (secondary outcomes).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study is unique in evaluating a group intervention delivered to parents of children affected by of a diverse range life-threatening illness or injury.

Facing the possibility of their child&#x02019;s death or lasting impairment, while negotiating complex medical processes and making difficult treatment decisions, is an experience that can overwhelm even the most resilient parent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Many parents report enduring symptoms of trauma including intense feelings of fear, anxiety, helplessness, intrusive thoughts and hypervigilance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Post-traumatic stress disorder has been reported for up to 29&#x000a0;% of mothers and up to 18&#x000a0;% of fathers 6&#x02013;12&#x000a0;months after child diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], with a further 46&#x000a0;% of mothers and 28&#x000a0;% of fathers experiencing significant sub-threshold levels of post-traumatic stress symptoms 6&#x000a0;months after their child&#x02019;s cancer diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These symptoms limit parents&#x02019; ability to manage daily activities and provide the recovering child with an optimal post-hospital environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This paper presents the study protocol of a randomized control trial (RCT) that seeks to evaluate a group psychological intervention delivered to parents in their homes, via videoconferencing. The intervention aims to improve parent mental health, thereby optimizing the child&#x02019;s recovery environment.</p><p>Parental distress following child diagnosis is normative and potentially adaptive &#x02013; parents of seriously ill children are generally well functioning individuals placed in extraordinary circumstances. Most adapt with time and the support of family and friends, and distress symptoms subside. However, higher levels of distress reactions in this early phase have been shown to predict later, persistent parent mental health difficulties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] placing parents and the ill child at high risk of mental health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Persistent distress can impair a parent&#x02019;s ability to respond to the demands of their child&#x02019;s illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and result in the utilization of more hospital resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It is not surprising that the combination of parental trauma and poorer family functioning predicts the longer-term psychological, behavioral and general wellbeing of the ill child [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and has been associated with elevated rates of child psychological, social and health difficulties, including weight and eating difficulties, behavioral, social and emotional problems and negative body image [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>The &#x02018;Take A Breath&#x02019; (TAB) group program was developed as an early intervention for parents with persistent symptoms of distress. It was designed to provide parents with the skills to manage the psychological challenges presented by their child&#x02019;s illness, with the aim of preventing more serious long-term mental health difficulties. Preliminary (non-controlled) outcomes from pilot studies of TAB delivered face-to-face and online have been described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Briefly, the program utilizes an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], including ACT&#x02019;s key elements of acceptance, mindfulness, values clarification and goal setting. These are logical treatment approaches to manage the intrusive thoughts, avoidance and high levels of emotional arousal which are among the most common distressing symptoms in parents of children with a serious illness or injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A group-based approach was selected for its advantages in helping to normalize the challenges faced by parents, the opportunities for providing peer-support and modelling of coping strategies, and the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of group compared to individual treatment. While the targeted participants for the program are parents who are the primary carers of the ill child (predominantly mothers), partners are also encouraged to attend, as they are a key source of support for enacting any changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and may also benefit from the program themselves. The intervention is delivered 4&#x02013;10&#x000a0;months after child diagnosis, a time when the acute management of the child&#x02019;s condition has eased and parents are more able to consider their own needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Research with parents of ill children has found problematic levels of uptake and attendance for group interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Barriers to attending face-to-face programs include recurrent illness and/or ongoing disability in the child, time, childcare and financial pressures that have arisen from the child&#x02019;s illness, and a preference to spend time at home following family separations associated with the child&#x02019;s hospitalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A recent systematic review of family adjustment to childhood cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] highlighted the complex and profound effects of child illness on family life, including the child&#x02019;s needs taking priority over those of parents and siblings, lack of time for &#x02018;non-essential&#x02019; activities, extended periods of family separation during the child&#x02019;s treatment, and a resulting desire to protect family time. Traditional face-to-face interventions may be difficult for many parents given these multiple demands. The current trial utilizes videoconferencing technology as the method of delivery. This allows parents to take part in the program in the comfort of their own homes and removes burden of additional travel costs, child care needs and limited time.</p><p>The use of technology to deliver interventions in the home is a promising alternative to traditional face-to-face delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Internet based interventions that also include clinician involvement appear to be more effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and maintain treatment effects for longer periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] than self-directed treatments. Videoconferencing is a method of electronic delivery that allows client and clinician to see and hear each other, providing the advantages of real time verbal and nonverbal interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. One-on-one videoconferencing (a single client and clinician) is comparable with face-to-face interventions in terms of effectiveness, client ratings of the therapeutic relationship, client satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and treatment retention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] for a variety of psychological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. A recent systematic review found videoconferencing psychotherapy has been used in a variety of therapeutic formats, with diverse populations, and was generally associated with good user satisfaction, having similar clinical outcomes to traditional face-to-face psychotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>Early data on videoconferencing for group therapy are promising [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Studies have reported equivalent outcomes to those found in face-to-face groups for 125 clients with posttraumatic stress disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and seven clients with traumatic brain injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. King and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] found high client acceptability and clinical effectiveness for clients with substance addictions (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;37). In comparison with face-to-face therapy, videoconferencing groups for veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;38) showed equal levels of adherence, empathy and rapport, and more favourable ratings of therapist competence in the videoconferencing conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Our uncontrolled feasibility study shows that TAB delivered online (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;13) was associated with significant reductions on three measures of parental psychological symptoms from pre to 6&#x000a0;month follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims and hypotheses</title><p>Building on promising pilot results, this paper presents the study protocol for an RCT of a group intervention for parents of children with a life threatening illness or injury, delivered using videoconferencing technology. Recruitment and intervention delivery for this trial are underway.</p><p>The aim of the trial is to determine the immediate and longer term efficacy of the TAB program in reducing parental distress, including posttraumatic stress symptoms (primary outcomes), in parents of children with life threatening illness or injury. As indicated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, we predict this reduction will arise from improvements in the psychological skills addressed in the intervention (mediating factors), and will be associated with broader improvements in parents&#x02019; adjustment (e.g., quality of life; and child adjustment and quality of life; secondary outcomes).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Take a Breath Program Logic Model</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12888_2016_861_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>Specifically, we hypothesized that compared to waitlist control group, parents who receive the intervention will report the following short term (post intervention) outcomes:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>Fewer distress symptoms (primary outcome, assessed in terms of traumatic stress, general stress, anxiety and depression symptoms);</p></list-item><list-item><p>Greater improvements in the psychological skills directly targeted by the intervention (mediating factors: e.g. improved psychological flexibility; mindfulness; reduced impact of their child&#x02019;s illness);</p></list-item><list-item><p>Improved parent adjustment (e.g., greater quality of life, improved condition management and parent mutuality), and</p></list-item><list-item><p>Greater improvements in child adjustment and wellbeing.</p></list-item></list></p><p>We predict these short term benefits will be maintained in the longer term (6&#x000a0;month follow-up).

Employing the support of consultants and clinical staff in the recruitment process will assist the research team to recruit as many eligible families as possible that pass through the relevant hospital departments, in order to achieve the adequate enrolment required to reach the target sample size. Written consent is obtained from eligible parents willing to participate, and subsequently are asked to complete the demographics and screening measure (ASDS) within four weeks of their child&#x02019;s admission (T1). Eligible parents based on the screening measure are then phoned from four months post admission and invited to participate in the trial, with interested parents asked to sign a second written consent form. At this point they are asked to complete pre-intervention assessment measures (T2) and are randomly allocated to intervention or waitlist control group. The randomization list is generated independent of the research team by the hospital&#x02019;s Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics Unit, using a computerized randomization plan generator and the method of randomly permuted blocks. The end result will be two randomly allocated treatment arms divided between four randomization lists, one for each department: Cardiology, Oncology, Neurology and PICU. The allocation sequence will be implemented using sequentially numbered, sealed envelopes, which will be controlled by an independent researcher who is not involved in recruiting families or intervention delivery. This will ensure that project staff are blind to client allocation. This independent researcher will also assign participants to the relevant treatment arm. At the time of completing their pre-intervention assessment, participants are blinded to allocation condition: they all have agreed to the assessments and program participation but are unaware of whether they are allocated to immediate or waitlist intervention.</p><p>Strategies will be employed to improve engagement and reduce attrition. These include giving parents keep cups, pens, and note pads with the study logo, to serve as reminders of study participation at home. Regular contact via phone or email with families throughout the trial will also be used to maximise engagement of families in the trial and reduce attrition during follow-up stages.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Intervention delivery</title><p>TAB is a six-session ACT-based group program.

This committee, and any analyses they conduct will remain independent and confidential to the remainder of the team.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This study has notable design strengths: inclusion of parents of children across a diverse range of life threatening conditions, who have elevated symptoms of acute stress at the time of recruitment; timing the intervention to avoid the acute period when parents face intense demands around their child&#x02019;s medical care; a group delivery format that is more cost-efficient than individual therapy and enables normalization of experience and peer support; use of videoconferencing, paired with clinician input to reduce participation barriers and maximize effectiveness; and the first use of an ACT-based approach in this population. CONSORT guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] have been followed to maximise study validity.</p><p>The major design weakness is the use of the waitlist control condition with waitlisted parents offered the program after completing the &#x02018;post&#x02019; (T3) assessment. This precludes comparison between intervention and control participants over the longer term (i.e., at 6&#x000a0;month follow-up). While not ideal, this design reflects the realities of ethical research practice with this highly vulnerable group. Our research team has been conducting research with this population for over 5&#x000a0;years, and it is both practically and ethically challenging to undertake repeated assessments of distressed participants over a long time periods without providing any support. High rates of drop-out by non-intervention participants makes the representativeness of the data questionable for those who are retained, and options for imputing missing data are limited by high rates and non-randomness of the losses to follow-up. Our team has collected longitudinal data from a large cohort of parents of children with life-threatening illnesses recruited in the same setting and using similar eligibility criteria, measurement tools, and assessment time points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The large sample size for this observational study (145 parents assessed at the equivalent of the current study&#x02019;s proposed 6&#x000a0;month follow-up) provides us the opportunity to compare the long term adjustment of intervention families from the current study with a non-intervention normative population.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Discussion</title><p>One in five parents whose child is diagnosed with a life threatening condition experiences enduring and debilitating distress that adversely affects daily functioning and the wellbeing of other family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Importantly, addressing distress associated with medical illness has become a central tenet of modern health service delivery. For example, in oncology, distress as the 6th vital sign has been endorsed by numerous policy and organisational bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. As a result, screening for distress has been mandated as a quality standard in the USA, required for hospital accreditation. There are, however, no effective, evidence-based interventions to address distress in patients and families, once identified. If effective, this program will be an important step to addressing this need and will address a serious gap in the provision of evidence-based care within the child healthcare system. Specifically, it has the potential to reduce burden within families, improve the quality of life of parents, the ill child and other children in the family, thereby reducing demand on hospital and community services.</p><p>In addition, advances in communication technology, combined with near-universal connectivity of the population to online and mobile devices, is radically changing healthcare delivery. This study will build our understanding of how such technology can be used to provide widespread and cost effective access to expert clinicians delivering specialist psychological interventions. Importantly, the online format reduces established mental health service inequalities for those in rural/remote locations, and addresses the reluctance of struggling parents to leave their ill child in the care of others, in order to obtain needed support. The use of a videoconferencing group platform provides the additional advantage of enabling both parents to participate in the intervention together from home, sharing the experience and learning together. This is a rare opportunity for families engaged in interventions.</p><p>A key feature of TAB is the use of a trans-diagnostic therapeutic model (ACT) and its applicability across multiple diagnostic groups. ACT focuses on acceptance of painful emotions and difficult thoughts while continuing to behave in values-consistent ways. This approach may assist parents in managing challenging internal experiences in the midst of an overwhelming and, at times, quite frightening event while still focusing on what matters most in the family and care-giving environment. If its effectiveness is supported in the current trial, this approach has the potential to be implemented as a hospital-wide program.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ACT</term><def><p>acceptance and commitment therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ASDS</term><def><p>acute stress disorder scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DASS</term><def><p>depression anxiety stress scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCL-S</term><def><p>posttraumatic stress disorder checklist &#x02013; specific trauma version</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PICU</term><def><p>pediatric intensive care unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCH</term><def><p>Royal Children&#x02019;s Hospital</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T1-T4</term><def><p>data collection time points 1 to 4</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TAB</term><def><p>take a breath</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank the social workers and medical staff across the cardiology, oncology, PICU, neurology, general medicine, and neo-natal intensive care wards of the Royal Children&#x02019;s Hospital and the PICU reception staff for their support of this research.</p><p>We would also like to thank all staff involved in the running of this research project: Amy Coe, Claire-Marie Heaney, Melissa Dunning, Michelle Tennant and Kate Noone.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>This project has not been externally funded by a charity, government or commercial organisation.
