Such trials are therefore an essential element of comparative effectiveness research and especially important in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a disease in which the range of efficacious treatment options, many of high cost, has widened in recent years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> American College for Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines for the treatment of RA recommend traditional disease-modifying drugs (DMARDs), especially methotrexate, in early and established RA of good prognosis provide for the addition of a tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor in poor prognosis patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> Delayed use of TNF inhibitors may have detrimental effects on radiographic outcomes but not on disease activity scores and functional outcomes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> In the UK TNF inhibitors may only be used if patients with RA have active disease (defined by disease activity scores, DAS28, &#x02265;5.1) despite at least two conventional DMARDs, including methotrexate.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6 R7 R8 R9">6&#x02013;9</xref></p><p>The number of available TNF inhibitors for RA has increased but there is considerably more experience with adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab than more recently introduced agents. There are no published randomised trials comparing one TNF inhibitor directly with another. Observational studies have shown inconsistent differences between agents<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10 R11 R12">10&#x02013;12</xref> but a recent mixed treatment comparison suggests that etanercept and certolizumab are more effective than other TNF inhibitors, especially when modelled on disability scores.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></p><p>The choice of first TNF inhibitor is an important milestone in the treatment pathway of a patient with RA. In the absence of trials comparing these agents directly, we conducted an unblinded pragmatic randomised non-inferiority trial of adalimumab versus etanercept, focusing on persistence with therapy as our primary outcome. Treatment persistence is an important determinant of the cost-effectiveness of these agents.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7 R8 R9">7&#x02013;9</xref> Our trial was planned at a time when only adalimumab and etanercept were approved for subcutaneous use in the UK and at a time when there were indications that persistence with etanercept was better than with adalimumab.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design overview</title><p>This was a 52-week unblinded, randomised, non-inferiority, multicentre, parallel group comparison of adalimumab versus etanercept in patients with active RA despite prior or current use of two DMARDs including methotrexate (unless contraindicated). Data on a key outcome, persistence with therapy, were also collected at 104&#x02005;weeks. There were no constraints on changes in the dose of methotrexate, use of other DMARDs including previously untried agents, or on use of oral, parenteral or intra-articular corticosteroids once patients were included in the study. This approach is consistent with a pragmatic approach reflecting routine care. Study approval was given by the Nottingham Research Ethics Committee 2 (Reference 06/Q2404/171).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Setting and participants</title><p>Patients over the age of 18&#x02005;years, who met the ACR 1987 criteria for RA, were recruited from four hospitals in England. To be eligible, patients had to meet national criteria for treatment with a TNF inhibitor with regard to the lack of response to at least two DMARDs including methotrexate. Patients were excluded if the clinician caring for the patient believed that TNF inhibitors were unsuitable or it was believed that patients would be unlikely to understand study procedures or unwilling to comply. Patients treated previously with any licensed or experimental biological TNF inhibitor were excluded. Adherence to national guidance in relation to pretreatment screening, including for tuberculosis, was required.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Randomisation and interventions</title><p>Patients were randomised to subcutaneous adalimumab 40&#x02005;mg every other week or etanercept 50&#x02005;mg weekly (1:1). Once enrolled, clinicians could modify drug doses within the constraints of the drug license for these agents. Randomisation was stratified according to the use of methotrexate at inception. A random sequence of numbers was generated, by computer, for patients on methotrexate and separately for patients not on methotrexate. Use of other DMARDs at the time of TNF inhibitors introduction was permitted but did not influence randomisation. Randomisation was done in random block sizes. Opaque, sealed envelopes of the allocation sequences were prepared and managed at the sponsoring centre by a member of staff not involved in the patient management. A log was kept and a copy of sequences was lodged with the Department of Research and Development at the sponsoring institution, in order that audits could be conducted, if necessary. This study was the subject of an audit by the UK Medicines and Health Care Regulatory Agency during its conduct.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Outcomes and follow-up</title><p>The primary outcome was the proportion of patients still taking the drug to which they were randomised 52&#x02005;weeks after starting. Patients were deemed to be continuing treatment if an injection of adalimumab or etanercept had been used at the 12-&#x02005;month anniversary with a 2-week window before the anniversary and up to 6&#x02005;weeks after the anniversary. Criteria for withdrawal were not stipulated, consistent with the concept of a trial replicating everyday practice&#x02014;clinicians were free to make their own judgements about treatment modification, including drug cessation, during the trial. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of patients on treatment at 6&#x02005;months and 104&#x02005;weeks, the four variable disease activity score using 28 joints based on C reactive protein (CRP) (DAS28-CRP4), the proportion of patients discontinuing therapy for different reasons (classified by the treating clinician according to lack of efficacy, toxicity, both or other reasons), satisfaction with medication measured by the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM VII),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> health utility determined by the Euroqol-5D questionnaire<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> (permission to use both was registered) and adverse effects defined by severity and body system.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that adalimumab was not inferior to etanercept in terms of drug continuation (or withdrawal from treatment). A systematic review, done when this study was planned, indicated that there were important differences in continuation rates between etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab in established RA. For example, the relative risk of treatment cessation for any reason was 0.71 with adalimumab compared with 0.61 for etanercept when these drugs were combined with methotrexate and compared with methotrexate alone (Table&#x000a0;17 ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). These data were supported by observations after our study began which showed that the HR for drug withdrawal for adalimumab was 1.47 compared with etanercept.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> We assumed that around 75% of patients would still be on the treatment a year after starting. We also assumed, by consensus, that a difference in continuation rates of 15% between etanercept and adalimumab was clinically important and would be sufficient for clinicians to choose one agent over another. We calculated that 124 patients (62 in each treatment group) would be required to have an 80% chance of ruling out a 15% difference with 95% confidence (one-sided analysis). These data correspond to an assumed scenario where the true proportion of patients taking adalimumab at 1&#x02005;year would be 75% compared with 70% for etanercept.</p><p>Patients receiving at least one dose of treatment were included in the analyses. Fisher's exact tests were used for all comparisons of proportions. Mann-Whitney tests or unpaired t tests were used for all other comparisons, as appropriate.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>Study enrolment began in May 2007 and the last patient was recruited in April 2010. Patients were approached about the study during routine clinic visits. A formal screening log was not maintained and our study was not resourced to monitor new prescriptions of TNF inhibitors for RA at the four hospitals that contributed patients. We know that at least 362 patients not included in this study started a TNF inhibitor during this period at the four participating centres, though we do not know what proportion of these patients were starting a first TNF inhibitor. A flow diagram of study participants is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2012001395F1">figure 1</xref>.

It is worth noting that the median disease duration for the study population was 6&#x02005;years, that 88% were rheumatoid factor or cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody positive, that 40% were on oral steroids at baseline and that a third of patients did not receive concomitant methotrexate but took a wide variety of other concomitant DMARDs.

Other measures of efficacy were similar for these two agents including DAS28 responder status. An important strength of our study was a pragmatic design which, within the constraints of volunteer bias, provides data that are directly relevant to everyday practice. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were kept to a minimum. Our study design permitted modification or addition of DMARDs and corticosteroids whereby clinicians maximise opportunities to improve the disease control.</p><p>Drug cessation, or continued use, are key indicators of successful therapy in chronic disease, especially where the prospect of drug free remission is low<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> and drug costs are high. However in some circumstances drug persistence may simply reflect limited treatment options where clinicians and patients continue with a drug in the belief that continuing with something is better than nothing.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> This latter scenario is less likely in our study as we studied first TNF inhibitor use and recruited patients between 2007 and 2010, a period when several new options for treating RA became available.</p><p>One important limitation of our study was that only a proportion of patients treated with TNF inhibitors at the trial centres took part. We are unable to say precisely what proportion of eligible patients took part. We have no reason to suspect that patients were systematically excluded for reasons of disease severity or comorbidity or other factors that limit the generalisability of our findings. Patients, recruited to the British Society for Rheumatology Biologics register in 2008, a national registry to which our hospitals contribute patients, had disease of longer duration and higher DAS28 scores at baseline but a smaller proportion of patients on oral steroids.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> We believe, most likely, that patients were not considered for inclusion because of practical considerations such as time constraints and concerns about loss of professional autonomy and patient choice.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> Reasons clinicians&#x02019; gave, in discussions as the trial proceeded, included a desire for less frequent injections, a preference for a drug with a shorter half-life in the case of etanercept, and concerns about self-administration of injections and thus a preference for infliximab.</p><p>Another potential limitation was our decision to test the hypothesis that adalimumab was not inferior to etanercept (a one-sided hypothesis) rather than demonstrate equivalence (a two-sided hypothesis). A smaller sample size was needed to answer the former question. This meant that the trial could be completed with fewer resources and in a timely manner, an important consideration for pragmatic trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> One justification for hypothesising non-inferiority was data available at the time our study were planned<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> and indeed more recently<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10 R11 R12">10&#x02013;12</xref> that continuation rates are better for etanercept than adalimumab. Such indirect comparisons of continuation rates however are insufficient for accepting the superiority of one agent over another&#x02014;only direct comparisons, such as in our trial, can answer this question with confidence. A further limitation was a non-inferiority margin of 15%. This may be considered a wide margin. However, margins of such magnitude are used by drug manufacturers for securing regulatory approval for new agents.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> A figure of 15% also contributed to a reduction in sample size and was justified on the basis of data from a systematic review<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> and consensus when this study was conceived. We also judged that clinicians would not necessarily be persuaded to change from a preferred drug option and the convenience of less frequent injections with adalimumab, unless the margin between drugs was of sufficient magnitude.</p><p>Our study may also be criticised for lack of blinding. Blinding would have been possible but would have increased study costs greatly and would have compromised our desire to create a real-world setting for our study. Observer blinding of the primary outcome, treatment continuation, was not feasible. It is possible that clinicians may have made extra efforts to persist with a particular TNF inhibitor if they had added faith in that agent. While such efforts may have biased outcomes in a trial of shorter duration we believe that efforts to maintain a particular therapy are much less likely to have been successful over 2&#x02005;years. This is also true because use of a second TNF inhibitor, after lack of success with a first, has only been sanctioned in the UK lately.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> We did not formally survey clinicians at participating centres regarding their beliefs about the relative effectiveness or toxicity of particular TNF inhibitors. For example, it is possible that some clinicians may have chosen etanercept in South Asian patients believing that a risk of unmasking tuberculosis was lesser with etanercept.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></p><p>Continuation rates in our trial were less than rates in some published observational cohorts of RA patients treated with TNF inhibitors but not all.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10 R11 R12">10&#x02013;12</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> It seems unlikely that this is due to systematic differences in practice at study centres compared with the rest of the UK. It is more likely that contemporary cohorts of patients have treatment altered earlier than older cohorts given a wider availability of efficacious agents in the UK<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> and a desire for even better disease control. This view, surprisingly, is not supported by the most recent data (2008) from the BSRBR.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> It is also worth noting that although only two-thirds of patients recruited were given methotrexate with etanercept or adalimumab, a wide range of other DMARDs were used as concomitant therapy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2012001395TB1">table 1</xref>); similar to data from the BSRBR.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> We do not know whether differences in concomitant oral steroids or DMARDs, such as hydroxychloroquine, at baseline, might have influenced continuation rates for either TNF inhibitors. Differences reported between TNF inhibitors in observational studies become more marked with increasing follow-up. In our study the difference between adalimumab and etanercept widened after 2&#x02005;years of follow-up.</p><p>In conclusion, clinicians needing to choose between adalimumab and etanercept, in a patient with active RA despite treatment with methotrexate and another DMARD, may choose either agent in the knowledge that continuation or persistence with therapy after 2&#x02005;years is likely to be similar for these two agents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d34e297" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001395.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d34e298" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001395.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We acknowledge the sponsorship of University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, the support of clinicians, at all four sites, who contributed patients and most of all to patients who consented to take part.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> PJ was the chief investigator.
