Obesity is associated with an increased risk for a range of chronic diseases and presents a major burden of disease and health care spending [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. One of the life stages that may play a critical role in the development and persistence of obesity and related co-morbidities into adulthood is adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The adolescent period is characterized by low physical activity, high levels of sedentary behavior and changes in body composition (amount and location of body fat), making adolescents an important target group for preventive strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Overweight and obesity generally result from a long-term imbalance between energy intake (determined by dietary intake) and energy expenditure (mainly determined by physical activity and sedentary behaviors) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Regarding the latter, sedentary activities such as watching TV and playing video games, have been found to be associated with negative health outcomes such as overweight and obesity, partly independent of diet and moderate to vigorous physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. It has been suggested that reductions in sedentary behavior may be as effective as or even more effective than increasing physical activity directly in decreasing BMI, and percentage overweight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. A major and increasing contributor to sedentary behavior is playing video games, a wide spread and popular activity among adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In the USA, an average of almost two hours per day playing video games was reported for 8&#x02013;18&#x000a0;year olds, with an increase of almost one hour per day from 1999 to 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Recent evidence indicates that in the Netherlands, about 80% of the adolescents (12&#x02013;16&#x000a0;years old) play video games regularly and play on average five days a week with an average duration of 65&#x000a0;minutes on a school day and 80&#x000a0;minutes on a weekend day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In the Netherlands time spent on playing video games seems to peak during adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Reducing time spent in sedentary video games (hereafter called non-active games) may thus contribute to reducing sedentary time and prevention of overweight and obesity in adolescents. A new generation of video games, the ones that require physical activity to play the games &#x02013;i.e. active games&#x02013; seems a promising alternative to traditional non-active games to promote PA and reduce sedentary behaviors in youth. These active games, such as provided by and on Nintendo Wii, Microsoft Kinect, and Sony PlayStation Move, require whole-body movement to play the video game instead of the small movements of fingers and wrists used in non- active gaming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Results from various studies have suggested that energy expenditure may be substantially increased when playing active games compared to energy expenditure during non-active gaming and other sedentary screen activities such as watching television [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Active games can generally elicit light to moderate intensity physical activity (2&#x02013;6 metabolic equivalents; METS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Consequently, when adolescents substitute the time they spent playing non-active games by playing active games, sedentary time will be reduced and physical activity increased, which may help to prevent excessive weight gain.</p><p>The potential strength of these active games is based on the intrinsic motivation of children to play video games. Intrinsic motivation is a construct based on the Self Determination Theory (SDT) and means that one enacts in an activity because one enjoys the activity and not because of external factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. SDT posits that if one is intrinsically motivated, behavior change is more likely to be maintained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Previous studies revealed that playing active games are perceived as fun and enjoyable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Further, adolescents attending a low level of education are more likely to play active games frequently than those attending a higher level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. These results suggest that active games seem promising for reaching adolescents at risk, because they spend more time on non-active gaming and other sedentary behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and are more likely to be overweight or obese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Irrespective of energy expenditure, it can be hypothesized that active games may influence energy balance through reduced energy intake. Energy intake, especially the intake of snacks and sugar-sweetened beverages, is positively associated with time spent in sedentary screen activities such as watching TV en playing non-active games [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. If active games can result in a decrease in sedentary time, it might simultaneously result in a lower energy intake. It is hypothesised that higher energy intake during sedentary activities is because they distract children from satiety cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. It is possible that playing active games is less distractive than watching TV en playing non-active games [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. On the other hand, it might also be that the physical activity required for playing active games influences appetite control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] or may be thirst, resulting in a higher energy intake. However, up until now, little is known about energy intake during active gaming. So far only two studies have evaluated energy intake during playing active games [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Both studies showed no difference in energy intake while playing active games compared to energy intake while playing non-active games. However both studies were controlled laboratory studies and the effects of playing active at home on energy intake need to be further investigated. One randomized controlled trial with a 24-week follow-up showed a non-significant trend towards a decrease in self-reported energy intake from snacks in a home-based active gaming intervention group compared to a non-active game control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>Substituting the time spent playing non-active games with playing active video games may thus reduce sedentary time, increase physical activity, reduce snacking and thereby prevent excessive weight gain in adolescents. So far only few and small scale studies have been conducted indicating that active games can decrease sedentary behavior and increase physical activity in youngsters on the short term (8 to 12&#x000a0;weeks) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Other studies show that ongoing participation in active games is a problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. To date only one well powered randomized controlled trial (RCT) on the effects of an active gaming intervention on body composition with a longer follow-up period has been conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. This trial showed a small effect of a six-months active game intervention on Body Mass Index (BMI) and body composition in 10&#x02013;14&#x000a0;year old overweight/obese children. More evidence is needed from adequately powered studies, also including normal weight children, monitoring long term participation in the active games, and investigating long term effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, the current study aims to evaluate an active game intervention that incorporates motivational elements for adherence, includes a long intervention period and a comprehensive process evaluation. The intervention of the current study has four unique features that make this study worthwhile. First, so far no active game interventions were family-oriented. Parental involvement in interventions for children and adolescents has been recommended, therefore the current trial includes the family instead of only the individual adolescent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Furthermore, games are often played at home and it has been recommended to change the obesogenic home environment to better facilitate and enable weight gain preventive behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Secondly, the current study includes several elements to promote active game play based on previous studies, such as encouraging social play and providing a variety of active games [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. This is important because previous studies showed that maintaining participation in active game participation is difficult to achieve when providing active games without any additional efforts to encourage use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Thirdly, previous studies mainly focused on the first generation of active games such as Dance Dance Revolution and PlayStation2&#x000ae;EyeToy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], and as the gaming industry is evolving fast, there is a need for studies evaluating the newest generation of active games such as PlayStation&#x000ae; Move or Kinect games. Fourthly, to our knowledge the current study includes the longest follow up period (ten months) for an active game intervention.</p><p>The current manuscript describes the design of a trial evaluating the effects of a family-oriented active game intervention, incorporating several motivational elements. The overall study focuses on both the adolescents as well as his or her family members. The current manuscript focuses on the measurements and effectiveness among adolescents. The intervention consists of a) providing an upgrade package for the newest generation of active games (PlayStation&#x000ae;Move), b) an encouragement to replace at least 1&#x000a0;hour of non-active gaming by active gaming on the PlayStation Move, c) stimulating social play by providing an extra Move controller, and d) stimulating long term use by providing multiple active games.</p><p>We will test the following hypotheses:</p><p>1) The intervention will result in lower BMI-SDS (SDS =&#x02009;adjusted for mean standard deviation score using the 1997 Dutch growth study as reference), waist circumference-SDS, hip circumference and skinfold thickness compared to the control condition after four and ten months.</p><p>2) The intervention will lead to less self-reported time on sedentary screen activities compared to the control condition after four and ten months.</p><p>3) The intervention will lead to less self-reported sugar-sweetened beverages and snacks consumption compared to the control condition after four and ten months.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>The efficacy of the active game intervention is evaluated in a randomized controlled trial among adolescents aged 12 to 16&#x000a0;years old and their families. Families are randomly assigned to the intervention or control group after baseline assessment by the researcher or research assistant using a pre-determined randomization list. The randomization list consists of a row with the numbers one and two in a random order and is based on a block randomization scheme, with blocks of 100, obtained from an online computer program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomization.com">http://www.randomization.com</ext-link>). Participants are assigned to one of the research groups based on this randomization list in order of checking out after they finish the baseline measures. The intervention group is exposed to the active game intervention and the control group is asked to continue their normal game play behavior and they receive the material belonging to the intervention at the end of the study. Measures are taken at baseline (T<sub>0</sub>) (adolescent anthropometrics and questionnaire), after one month (T<sub>1m</sub>) adolescent questionnaire (including process evaluation for intervention group adolescents), four months (T<sub>4m</sub>) adolescent anthropometrics and questionnaire (including process evaluation for intervention group adolescents); and ten months (T<sub>10m</sub>) adolescent anthropometrics and questionnaire (including process evaluation for intervention group adolescents) (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Primary outcomes are adolescents&#x02019; measured BMI-SDS (SDS =&#x02009;adjusted for mean standard deviation score), waist circumference-SDS, hip circumference and skinfolds thickness. Secondary outcomes are adolescents&#x02019; self-reported sedentary behavior, and consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and snacks. Additionally, physical activity behavior excluding active game play is assessed to check whether the active game intervention was at the expense of physical activity.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Design scheme</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></th><th colspan="4" align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Measure moment</bold><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="left"><bold>Measures</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>T</bold><sub>

At T<sub>0</sub> the measures are conducted blind for participants and research assistants regarding group assignment. At the end of the T<sub>0</sub> measure the randomization takes place and therefore the measures at T<sub>4m</sub> and T<sub>10m</sub> cannot be conducted blind for participants or assessors. The intervention group receives new games at T<sub>4m</sub> and the control group receives their Move package at T<sub>10m</sub>. Data analyses are not conducted blind.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>The current study focuses on adolescents aged 12&#x02013;16, who are the main participants of the study. Additionally the family members of the adolescent (parents and siblings aged 8&#x02013;18&#x000a0;years old) are included in the study but they are not used for current analyses. Inclusion criteria are:</p><p>&#x02022;Adolescent plays&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;2&#x000a0;hours of non-active video games per week</p><p>&#x02022;Adolescent does not play active games yet, or less than once a week.</p><p>&#x02022;Adolescent is physically and mentally able to play active games</p><p>&#x02022;Adolescent has access to a PlayStation3 in his or her home.</p><p>&#x02022;Family does not have a Move upgrade for PlayStation3</p><p>&#x02022;Adolescent lives in the participating household (assuring sufficient access to the Move games provided as part of the intervention) at least 4&#x000a0;days a week.</p><p>&#x02022;At least one family member (parent or sibling aged 8&#x02013;18&#x000a0;years old) is willing to participate in the study (filling in questionnaires).</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>Sample size calculation is performed to estimate how many adolescents should be included to detect a significant difference of 0.5&#x000a0;kg excess body weight between the intervention and control condition during the follow-up measurements (primary analysis). The 0.5&#x000a0;kg excessive weight gain is based on calculations in adults, because calculations for adolescents were lacking at that time. Adult individuals may gain on average 0.5&#x000a0;kg excess body weight per year, which results from an energy imbalance of only 70 Kcal per week per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. We computed, based on energy expenditure studies, that an excess weight gain of 0.5&#x000a0;kg, may be prevented by substituting one hour per week of non-active gaming by playing active games [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. To have sufficient power to detect a clinically relevant difference in excess weight gain of 0.5&#x000a0;kg (SD =&#x02009;1.5&#x000a0;kg) between the intervention and control condition during follow up, with a power of 0.80, alpha .05 and an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for within-subject clustering of observations of 0.7, 99 participants in each condition are needed. Taking into account an anticipated drop-out of 20%, a total of 119 adolescents per condition needs to be recruited.</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment</title><p>Recruitment of adolescents takes place in four cities in the Netherlands: Amsterdam, Amersfoort, Leiden and Breda. Advertisements are posted on game websites, game magazines, Facebook, newsletter for PlayStation owners and local papers, and announcements are made on local radio. In addition, local health organizations (GGD) and municipalities in the four cities collaborate by providing addresses of families with a child aged 12&#x02013;16&#x000a0;years old. In Leiden all families with a 12&#x02013;16&#x000a0;years old child receive an invitation letter, and in Amsterdam, Breda and Amersfoort we make a selection based on postal code areas covering neighborhoods with a relatively low social economic status. Also, flyers are distributed in schools and popular places for gaming adolescents (e.g. game shops, music stores). Interested adolescents and families can provide their contact details on our project website or send it by mail. The interested families are contacted by email and asked to complete an online questionnaire to assess further inclusion criteria. Next, eligible families receive information about participation and an informed consent form that they have to fill in prior to the baseline measure. Then, families receive information about the baseline online questionnaires and an invitation for the adolescent&#x02019;s baseline assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>Adolescents assigned to the intervention group receive a PlayStation&#x000ae;Move upgrade package to play active games on a PlayStation3 console. PlayStation&#x000ae;Move uses a handheld motion controller wand and a motion-capture PlayStation&#x000ae;Eye camera that tracks the position, and inertial sensors in the wand to detect its motion. In this way every movement of the player is mimicked on-screen in the game. Although, there are multiple active game systems (such as Nintendo Wii, Dance Dance Revolution, Microsoft Xbox Kinect, PlayStation2&#x000ae;EyeToy) available on the market, the PlayStation&#x000ae;Move was chosen for the current study for several reasons. First, a survey study showed that the PlayStation was the most frequently owned game console among 12&#x02013;16&#x000a0;year old adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. So by choosing an application that is compatible with the PlayStation, we optimize the chances for recruiting sufficient participants. Second, the active game system for the PlayStation is one of the newest on the market at time of the study, making use of the most sophisticated technology, and may be more affordable (around &#x020ac;50) than other consoles or active game upgrades (e.g. Microsoft Kinect (around &#x020ac;135)).</p><p>As mentioned in the introduction previous studies showed that attention should be paid to (ongoing) participation in active game play, therefore we include several motivation enhancing intervention elements. Since variation in games is important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], families receive four active Move games (Sport Champions, Move Fitness, Start the Party and Medieval Moves) at the start of the study and two more (Dance Star Party and Sorcery) after four months. Social and family play is important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], and we provide two controllers to promote playing together with family and friends. Further, research has shown that providing instruction to use the active games seems an important addition to providing the games for physical activity promotion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], therefore we explicitly encourage participants at each contact moment to substitute non-active gaming with active gaming as much as possible but at least one hour per week. One hour per week corresponds with approximately 70&#x000a0;kcal (representing the energy imbalance that can result in excessive weight gain) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], and was regarded as a feasible change.</p><p>Adolescents in the control group are asked to continue their normal gaming behavior. They receive a PlayStation Move starters pack at the end of the study as an incentive for their participation. Further, they receive a small gift (e.g. magazine, lanyard, pen) as an incentive after participation at each measure moment.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurements</title><sec><title>Adolescents&#x02019; anthropometrics (T<sub>0</sub>, T<sub>4m</sub>, T<sub>10m</sub>) (primary outcomes)</title><p>Adolescent&#x02019;s anthropometric measures: height, weight, waist and hip circumferences and skinfolds thickness are performed at T<sub>0</sub>, T<sub>4m</sub> and T<sub>10m</sub> on pre-scheduled days at central places in the same four cities where we recruited the participants. These measurements take place at a site close to where the participants live (a museum, school or soccer stadium). Adolescents who are incapable to visit during the pre-scheduled days are measured at home. Trained research assistants conduct the measurements in an accurate manner according to a standardized protocol.</p><p>Height is measured to the nearest 0.1&#x000a0;cm using a Seca type 214 stadiometer with adolescents standing on bare feet and their head in the Frankfort plane. Weight is measured on bare feet with a calibrated electronic scale (SECA) with an accuracy of 0.1&#x000a0;kg. Adolescents are allowed to wear light indoor clothing, such as a t-shirt and shorts/short pants, and are asked to remove belt or any other heavy objects of use such as phone, keys or wallet. BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) is calculated by dividing weight (kg) by height squared (m<sup>2</sup>). Next, BMI-SDS is determined using the data from the fourth Dutch growth study among children of 1997 as reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] employing the Growth Analyser software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.growthanalyser.org/">https://www.growthanalyser.org/</ext-link>). Waist and hip circumference are measured with a tape measure (brand Jobst) to the nearest 0.1&#x000a0;cm. For waist circumference we also determine the SDS values using the same reference group and software as for BMI. Skinfolds are measured with an accuracy of 0.2&#x000a0;mm using four-site skinfold measures (triceps, biceps, subscapular and suprailiac) with a Harpenden skinfold calliper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. For hip circumference and skinfold thickness valid Dutch reference data to calculate SDS scores are not available.</p><p>At least two readings of each measurement (weight, height, waist/hip circumference and skinfolds) are obtained to deal with intra-observer variability, and the mean of the two measurements is used for analyses. If the two readings differ more than 1&#x000a0;cm for height, more than 0.2&#x000a0;kg for weight, more than 1&#x000a0;cm for waist and hip circumference, more than 1&#x000a0;mm for skinfolds, a third measurement is taken. In case of three measurements, the outlier of the three will be excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Self-reported measures</title><p>Online questionnaires (made with the online tool NETQ <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.netq-enquete.nl/nl">http://www.netq-enquete.nl/nl</ext-link>) are emailed to the adolescents at T<sub>0</sub>, T<sub>1m</sub>, T<sub>4m</sub> and T<sub>10m</sub>. The questionnaires assess demographics birth date, sex, educational level (pre-vocational; higher continued education; pre-university) and country of birth. Also active and non-active gaming behavior, other energy balance related behaviors, game consoles/application owned and game companions are assessed in the questionnaires (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Among the adolescents in the intervention group a process evaluation is conducted. Several process evaluation questions are added in the questionnaire of the intervention group at T<sub>1m</sub>, T<sub>4m</sub>, T<sub>10m</sub> (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Furthermore, adolescents in the intervention group are asked to report their use of the Move games over the entire ten-month period using a calendar format.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Gaming aspects and behavior, physical activity, sedentary and dietary behavior assessed in questionnaires</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left">&#x000a0;</th><th align="left"><bold>Items and answering categories</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Instrument/source</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Gaming aspects and behavior</bold><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4" align="left" valign="bottom">Time spent non-active gaming<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>1.

The FPACQ assesses physical activity and sedentary behavior in multiple domains: school activity (physical activity and sports participation at school excluding physical education lessons), active transport (transportation for example by bike, and walking (for both school and leisure time), non-active transport (transportation for example by car or bus (for both school and leisure time) leisure time sports participation, and sedentary activities (watching television and computer activities). For the current study we focus on the domains active transport and leisure time sports participation for physical activity. Physical activity outcomes are leisure time sport behavior (MET*hours per week), active transport to school (minutes per week) and walking and cycling in leisure time (minutes per week). Sports participation in MET*hours per week is calculated by multiplying the reported hours per week by their corresponding MET values according to the compendium of MET values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. For sedentary screen time we focus on computer time (hours per week) and TV time (hours per week).

Subsequently, control group and intervention group are described on baseline for demographics and outcome measures. Next, the effects of the intervention on all outcomes are evaluated by multilevel analyses. In the primary analyses, we analyze those participants which have at least one follow-up measurement in the groups they were randomized to. As a sensitivity analyses we will also impute follow-up measurements for persons with only a baseline measurement using multiple imputation with chained equations (intention to treat).

As mentioned in the introduction, the current trial on active games contributes to existing literature because it is one of the few adequately powered trials, includes normal weight adolescents, has a relatively long follow up period (ten months) and includes a comprehensive process evaluation. Further, the intervention uses the newest generation of active games and incorporates several motivational elements to encourage (maintenance of) active game play. Several studies have focused on overweight/obese children and showed that an active gaming intervention can result in small effects on BMI or body weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. However, as far as we know the current trial is the first well powered RCT including normal weight adolescents. Furthermore, the comprehensive process evaluation will provide important insight into whether adolescents adhere to the active game intervention over a ten month period, whether they enjoy playing active games and the factors that hinder or encourage them to play the active games. This information can help to make future active game interventions more effective.</p><p>For the current study we chose to encourage the adolescents in the intervention group to substitute non-active gaming with active gaming as much as possible but at least one hour per week. The potential contribution of active games on prevention of excessive weight gain in adolescents, lies partly in the fact that adolescents are intrinsically motivated to play video games and active game interventions capitalize on this intrinsic motivation. As stated before behavior change is more likely to be maintained if one is intrinsically motivated, which means that one enacts in an activity because of the activity itself, because one enjoys the activity and not because of external factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Giving adolescents an encouragement to play the active games a minimum amount of time might conflict with this potential intrinsic motivation for active game play. However, it is suggested that only providing active games is not enough to impact physical activity or body weight and it is important to also give an instruction regarding the use of the active games [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p><p>The encouragement for the intervention group to replace at least one hour per week of non-active gaming with active gaming, is based on calculations in adults demonstrating that excessive weight gain can be prevented if the energy balance is affected by 70&#x000a0;kcal per week. This was the best estimation that could be made when designing the study, because no child specific equation was available at that time. Recently, Hall et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>] developed and validated a model that quantifies the energy imbalance underlying excess bodyweight in children and calculates the necessary intervention magnitude to achieve bodyweight change in children. This model shows that around 116 extra kcal per week should be expended to prevent an excessive weight gain of 0.5&#x000a0;kg in children with an average age of 14&#x000a0;years old. As studies have shown that active gaming can elicit an energy expenditure of 381&#x000a0;kcal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], one hour of active gaming (assuming it does not replace more vigorous activities such as sports) should in theory be sufficient to prevent excess weight gain in children.</p><p>A concern regarding promoting active game play is that active game play might replace traditional forms of physical activity (e.g. cycling, playing outside) because these activities elicit greater energy expenditure and may therefore contribute more to prevention of excessive weight gain than active gaming. In a descriptive Dutch study among active gaming adolescents and their parents, adolescents reported that they thought active gaming had replaced sedentary activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. However, this was asked in retrospect after adolescents were already playing active games, and recall bias might have occurred. To get more insight in whether stimulating active gaming will lead to replacement of sedentary activities or whether it takes adolescents away from physical activities in which they already participate, the current study also evaluates the effect of providing active games on sedentary behavior and physical activity.</p><p>The present study is subject to some limitations that need to be acknowledged. Although we obtain the primary outcome measures objectively (e.g. adolescents&#x02019; height, weight, waist/hip circumference and skinfolds), the secondary outcome measures (e.g. adolescents&#x02019; physical activity, sedentary behavior, consumption of snacks and sugar-sweetened beverages) are self-reported and thus liable to social desirability and recall bias. However, this will occur in both groups resulting in potential bias towards the null.</p><p>In conclusion, this trial will provide important new information on the potential contribution of active games to the prevention of excessive weight gain in adolescents and the process evaluation will provide relevant information for future active games studies on factors hindering or promoting active game play.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no financial relationships relevant to this article.
