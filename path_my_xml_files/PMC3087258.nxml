All the patients were premedicated with atropine 0.02mg kg<sup>-1</sup>and midazolam 0.1mg kg<sup>-1</sup>body weight intravenously and received inhalation induction using nitrous oxide in oxygen supplemented with either halothane (maximum inspired concentration of 5%) or sevoflurane (maximum inspired concentration of 8%).

Nowadays these fluorinated hydrocarbons are practiced very frequently in pediatric patients as inhalational agents because of difficult venous access.</p><p>Halothane was prepared and examined by Raventos J. It was introduced into clinical practice by Johnstone &#x00026; Bryce-Smith &#x00026; O Brien<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>. Halothane is a halogenated alkane derivative that exists as a clear, noninflammable liquid, has a sweet, non pungent odour, an intermediate solubility in blood combined with a high potency, permits rapid onset and recovery from anaesthesia when used alone or in combination with nitrous oxide. Its halogenated structure provides no inflammability, intermediate blood solubility, anaesthetic potency and molecular stability.Specifically carbon &#x02013; fluoride bond decreases flammability and the trifluorocarbon contribute to molecular stability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>. Halothane is still the first choice inhalational agent for paediatric anaesthesia due to above stated reasons.</p><p>Sevoflurane is fluorinated methyl isopropyl ether. It has minimal non pungent odour, produces bronchodilation and least degree of airway irritation among the currently available volatile agents. For these reasons, sevoflurane like halothane is acceptable for inhalation induction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></p><p>In childhood, uptake of inhaled agents is particularly rapid although clearly the recovery profile, cardiovascular stability, minimal metabolism in soda lime, lack of central nervous system excitation and antiemetic effect during recovery are as important as they are in adults. This study was conducted to compare quality of anaesthesia, incidence of clinically important side effects with both the agents and recovery after sevoflurane and halothane anaesthesia.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-1"><title>PATIENTS &#x00026; METHODS</title><p>After approval from the College Academic Committee, this comparative study was conducted on 30 paediatric patients, of either sex belonging to ASA grade I and II in the age group of 6 months to 6 years undergoing elective short surgical procedures (less than an hour). The patients were assigned randomly to one of the two groups:</p><p>Group I: included children who received halothane + nitrous oxide + oxygen anaesthesia (n=15)</p><p>Group I: included children who received sevoflurane + nitrous oxide + oxygen anaesthesia (n = 15)</p><p>Patients with prior history of any bleeding disorder, known cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological or gastrointestinal ailments were excluded from the study.</p><p>Electrocardiographic limb leads were attached to the patient before induction and lead II was continuously monitored.The ECG readings were analysed by a physician. Oxygen saturation was continuously monitored throughout the procedure and at the time of recovery using a peadiatric pulse oximetry probe.</p><p>Patients were premedicated with atropine sulphate (0.02mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) and midazolam (0.1mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) intrave-nously. Pulse oximeter saturations, heart rate and non invasive blood pressure measurements were recorded at 1 minute intervals. Face mask of correct size was held close to the patient's face and mixture of either 1% sevoflurane or 0.5% halothane with nitrous oxide 6L/min and oxygen 3L/min was started. Increase in concentration of volatile agents was done after every three breaths of patient (an increase of 0.5%halothane in the halothane vaporizing setting or 1% for sevoflurane).Concentration of halothane and sevoflurane was increased until the child was breathing 8%sevoflurane or 5% halothane. Air sealed face mask was not applied to the face until the child was asleep which was confirmed by the disappearance of the eyelash reflex. The duration of this period was called induction time-1.Now patient was allowed to take breaths through the facemask which was held tightly close to the child's face.</p><p>At the time of induction, pupil size and position was assessed continuously. When pupil became small and central and the patient was fully relaxed, the trachea was Intubated without using any muscle relaxant. Duration of induction until tracheal intubation performed, was noted as induction time-2.</p><p>After induction, halothane administration was continued at the concentration of 2% to 3% or in case of sevoflurane, concentration for maintenance was 3% to 4%.</p><p>After completion of the surgical procedure, inhalation agent and nitrous oxide were stopped, extubation done.</p><p>Time was recorded, at which inhalational agent was ceased and in the recovery room, when the child first attempted to remove his/her chin from the supporting hand. Reflex action, heart rate, cardiac rhythm, any intra operative or emergence complications were noted.</p><p>Data are presented as mean (SD). Statistical analysis were performed using the students t test. p&#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-2"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Demographic data were comparable in both the groups. No statistical significant difference among groups with regard to age, male female ratio, average duration of surgery, type of surgery and ASA physical status were observed.</p><p>We compared the induction times, intubating conditions, incidence of arrhythmias during anaesthesia, intraoperative complications and time taken for adequate recovery from anaesthesia in both the groups.</p><p>The time to loss of eyelash reflex (induction time-1) was significantly shorter in the sevoflurane group, p&#x0003c;0.05 (77.06&#x000b1;13.06) as compared to halothane group (96.06&#x000b1;15.59). The mean time taken to complete induction (tracheal intubation with endotracheal tube, induction time-2) was shorter in the sevoflurane group suggesting more rapid induction times with sevoflurane as the inhalational agent (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Comparison of scoring system for intubating conditions which included ease of laryngoscopy, position of vocal cords, coughing, jaw relaxation and limb movements between the two groups showed no statistical significant difference, p=0.25 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Intubation time</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOACP-26-484-g001"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Comparison of intubating conditions</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOACP-26-484-g002"/></table-wrap><p>The lowest and highest values of heart rate and arterial pressure were similar in both the groups.</p><p>The incidence of cardiac arrhythmias was higher during halothane anaesthesia (60%) as compared during sevoflurane anaesthesia (33.3%).

Sevoflurane is a suitable agent for paediatric patients as it produces highly satisfactory anaesthesia with very few intraoperative and postoperative complications</p><p>The overall quality of anaesthesia delivered with both halothane and sevoflurane was similar.</p><p>In this comparative study, the loss of eyelash reflex (induction time -1) and the time taken till tracheal intubation (induction time - 2) was significantly rapid with sevoflurane than with halothane.Black and coworkers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> also compared the induction times between sevoflurane and halothane and had same results that sevoflurane had a shorter induction time than halothane.</p><p>Similar results were observed by Jehan M et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> but they found that though loss of eyelash reflex was significantly rapid with sevoflurane, the difference in total induction time i.e.till tracheal intubation was significantly not different in both the groups. Sarner and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> compared times to intubation with both the inhalational agents and found that they were the same. They found that though induction was rapid with sevoflurane, the time needed to achieve deeper planes of anaesthesia was similar to that of halothane. Paris ST and coworkers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> suggested that limitation of induction time for sevoflurane may be a function of the vaporizer. The maximum concentration of the agents that they could deliver were 5% halothane and 8% sevoflurane which corresponded to 5 MAC and 4 MAC respectively. In addition, sevoflurane being a more respiratory depressant than halothane at concentration greater than 1.4 MAC which made induction slower as at deeper planes of anaesthesia, the uptake of the vapour was slower than halothane.</p><p>The incidence of cardiac arrhythmias was higher during halothane anaesthesia which is in agreement with the study of Paris S T, et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>.Calderone E and coworkers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> also observed in their study that supraventricular beats appeared in 22.5% of patients in the halothane group and in 5% of the sevoflurane group. Meretoja O.A.,et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> also observed cardiac arrhythmias to be the most common side effect.</p><p>The incidences of intraoperative complications like breath holding, laryngospasm, cough and movements of the patients were observed to be more with halothane anaesthesia; though these results did not interfere with the technique of inhalation induction. Two patients in the halothane group developed bradycardia intraoperatively that necessitated us to decrease the delivered concentration of halothane for some time.</p><p>No significant differences among the two groups with regard to emergence from anaesthesia and recovery were noted. Though agitation and abnormal excitatory movements were the most common emergence phenomenon with sevoflurane anaesthesia, somnolence was found more commonly with halothane and this was noted by other investigators as well.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></p><p>We found that incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting was less in the sevoflurane group than in the halothane group, indicating that sevoflurane anaesthesia produced little nausea and vomiting</p><p>Recovery was rapid with sevoflurane which can be attributed to its low blood-gas solubility.Similar results were observed by Smith, et al and Sury, et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></p><p>We conclude that sevoflurane is the most suitable agent for paediatric age groups because of its rapid onset of action, few intraoperative and postoperative complications, quick recovery and no risk of repeated sevoflurane exposure to patients.</p><p><bold>Author Disclosure:</bold> Authors have no conflict of interest or financial considerations.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brice smith</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>O' Brien</surname><given-names>H.D</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>fluothane: a non explosive volatile anaesthetic agents</article-title><source>BMJ</source><year>1956</year><volume>2</volume><fpage>969</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">13364364</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Robert</surname><given-names>k</given-names></name><name><surname>Stoelting</surname><given-names>M.D</given-names></name><name><surname>Simon</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Hillier</surname><given-names>M.B</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Ch.B FRCA Pharmacology &#x00026; Physiology in Anesthetic Practice</article-title><edition>4th ed</edition><fpage>44</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Robert</surname><given-names>k</given-names></name><name><surname>Stoelting</surname><given-names>M.D</given-names></name><name><surname>Simon</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Hillier</surname><given-names>M.B</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Ch.B FRCA Pharmacology &#x00026; Physiology in Anesthetic Practice</article-title><edition>4th</edition><fpage>44</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Black</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Sury</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Hamington</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Howard</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Mackersie</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Hatch</surname><given-names>D.A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>comparison of the induction characteristics of sevoflurane and halothane in children</article-title><source>Anaesthesia</source><year>1996</year><volume>51</volume><fpage>539</fpage><lpage>542</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8694204</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jehan</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Abdel-Halim</surname><given-names>Kamal</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>comparison of induction and recovery characteristics of sevoflurane, halothane and propofol in pediatric outpatients</article-title><source>Cancer Inst</source><year>2002</year><volume>14</volume><fpage>319</fpage><lpage>323</lpage><comment>Journal of the Egyptian Nat</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sarner</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Levine</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Davis</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Lerman</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Cook</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Motoyama</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Clinical characteristics of sevuflurane in children.
