However, the cellular mechanisms leading to muscle damage are not known and sensitive biomarkers are needed to identify patients at risk of developing statin-induced serious side effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology</title><p>We performed bioinformatics analysis of whole genome expression profiling of muscle specimens and UPLC/MS based lipidomics analyses of plasma samples obtained in an earlier randomized trial from patients either on high dose simvastatin (80 mg), atorvastatin (40 mg), or placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>High dose simvastatin treatment resulted in 111 differentially expressed genes (1.5-fold change and <italic>p</italic>-value&#x0003c;0.05), while expression of only one and five genes was altered in the placebo and atorvastatin groups, respectively. The Gene Set Enrichment Analysis identified several affected pathways (23 gene lists with False Discovery Rate <italic>q</italic>-value&#x0003c;0.1) in muscle following high dose simvastatin, including eicosanoid synthesis and Phospholipase C pathways. Using lipidomic analysis we identified previously uncharacterized drug-specific changes in the plasma lipid profile despite similar statin-induced changes in plasma LDL-cholesterol. We also found that the plasma lipidomic changes following simvastatin treatment correlate with the muscle expression of the arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>High dose simvastatin affects multiple metabolic and signaling pathways in skeletal muscle, including the pro-inflammatory pathways. Thus, our results demonstrate that clinically used high statin dosages may lead to unexpected metabolic effects in non-hepatic tissues. The lipidomic profiles may serve as highly sensitive biomarkers of statin-induced metabolic alterations in muscle and may thus allow us to identify patients who should be treated with a lower dose to prevent a possible toxicity.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Large-scale clinical trials have shown that statins are effective and safe cholesterol lowering drugs <xref rid="pone.0000097-Shepherd1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0000097-1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Recently more patients have been titrated to higher doses of statins in order to reach the new goals of LDL-cholesterol lowering and achieve even greater reductions of atherosclerotic complications. However, aggressive treatment with high dosages increases the risk of statin-induced myopathy <xref rid="pone.0000097-Bruckert1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Elucidation of myopathy mechanisms and identification of patients likely not to tolerate the treatment is therefore of great clinical interest. In addition, comparison of different statin drugs used for aggressive treatment is essential. The currently used statins do have clear differences for instance in their pharmacokinetic properties <xref rid="pone.0000097-Schachter1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, therefore it is likely that some of the statins at high dosages are more prone to have unexpected and unwanted effects in non-hepatic tissues.</p><p>We do know that some diseases such as hypothyroidism, liver dysfunction and diabetes increase the risk of muscle complications due to statin treatment <xref rid="pone.0000097-Antons1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Furthermore, exercise, alcohol, infections or underlying metabolic diseases seems to exacerbate this risk <xref rid="pone.0000097-Vladutiu1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Under these circumstances development of myopathy may be exacerbated by interactions with statins <xref rid="pone.0000097-Mukhtar1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Mukhtar and Reckless listed four potential myopathy mechanisms in their recent review: Depletion of intracellular cholesterol leading to calcium influx; inhibited protein synthesis, signal transduction and metabolism due to decreased mevalonate acid and its metabolite concentrations; reduced ubiquinone (coenzyme Q10) concentrations; and enhanced apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0000097-Mukhtar1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Muscle biopsies obtained from patients with statin-induced myopathy without creatine kinase (CK) elevations have shown evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction, including abnormally increased lipid stores in muscles <xref rid="pone.0000097-Phillips1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. We observed decreased mitochondrial function in patients on high dose simvastatin treatment, with no signs of myopathy <xref rid="pone.0000097-Paiva1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Later, we confirmed that high dose (80 mg) simvastatin affects muscle mitochondria by assessing a significant decrease in the muscle mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content during treatment (Schink et al, submitted). Thus, statins are causing unwanted mitochondrial effects and defective mitochondrial metabolism may already be involved during the early development of statin-induced myopathy when the currently used plasma CK measurements are not sensitive enough to identify these patients at risk of developing muscle damage.</p><p>Given the existing gap in knowledge and understanding of statin-induced muscle damage, we embarked in a systems biology approach aiming to gain insight into the mechanism and potential biomarkers of myopathy in the clinical setting. Of particular relevance is to gain new knowledge of signaling and metabolic pathways in muscle involved in myopathy and early molecular markers applicable in clinical setting. To address both objectives, gene expression profiling of muscle tissue is an obvious strategy of choice. As changes in plasma lipid composition are of particular interest in the study of statins, plasma lipidomics is one possible option to address the latter. Recent advances in liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry have empowered us with ability to reliably measure hundreds of lipid molecular species from biological samples in parallel <xref rid="pone.0000097-Wenk1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0000097-Oresic1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>In this paper we report the study of muscle gene expression profiles in combination with plasma lipidome analysis before and during high dose statin treatment. The specimens were from patients who participated in our earlier controlled and randomized study comparing placebo and high dosages of atorvastatin and simvastatin <xref rid="pone.0000097-Paiva1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The simvastatin treated patients were particularly unique and suitable for sensitive early marker discovery due to changes in their mitochondrial function, mtDNA and ubiquinone concentration in muscle. The systems biology approach allowed us to compare two widely used statins in terms of their effects on muscle gene expression and plasma lipidome. In addition, we were able to illuminate relevant biological pathways and to identify biomarker candidates related to unwanted and potentially toxic statin-induced changes in muscle metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients</title><p>Plasma samples from 37 subjects of an earlier study <xref rid="pone.0000097-Paiva1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, focusing on the effect of high dose statin treatment on skeletal muscle metabolism, were used for plasma lipidome analysis; placebo (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;11), simvastatin (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;13), and atorvastatin (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;14).

Placebo was simvastatin-matched, and to ensure also blinding of atorvastatin, all study drugs were supplied in sealed, identical, numbered containers. The duration of the follow-up was eight weeks. Muscle biopsies were obtained at baseline and at the end of the treatment period. Biopsies were taken from the lateral portion of the quadriceps femoris muscle in local anesthesia at about the mid-point between the greater trochanter and the knee joint with a biopsy needle (Tru-Cut, Baxter, McGaw Park, Ill., USA). The muscle specimens were frozen within 1&#x02013;2 seconds in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until analyzed. The blood sampling was performed in the Department of Clinical Chemistry, Tampere University Hospital by an experienced laboratory technician. Venous blood was drawn from the antecubital vein in sitting position after a twelve-hour fast and after 15 minute rest just before blood sampling. The blood was drawn into tubes containing EDTA, and plasma was separated after cooling by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes. The samples were stored at &#x02212;70&#x000b0; until analyzed.

This observation markedly contrast with the minimum gene expression changes observed in skeletal muscle with atorvastin 40mg. Our studies also revealed novel plasma biomarker candidates for safety assessment of statin treatment before recorded changes in muscle metabolism become clinically evident.</p><p>Similar to an earlier report <xref rid="pone.0000097-Urso1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, expression of genes related to cholesterol metabolism or mevalonate pathway were only modestly affected by statins in the present study. Thus, our data do not directly support the view that statins would cause mitochondrial dysfunction by reducing ubiquinone, a mitochondrial coenzyme with a cholesterol synthetic pathway derived side-chain, due to inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase in the muscle. Similarly we were not able to provide evidence that statins would lead to inhibition of protein synthesis, signal transduction and metabolism due to decreased muscle mevalonate acid. Since our patients did not have any signs of clinical myopathy and muscle damage, we were not able to judge the significance of early proapoptotic markers during the course of the myopathy. However, in the GSEA analysis several pro-apoptosis pathways already appeared with significant FDR <italic>q</italic>-values at these early stages and, therefore, the present results support the role of pro-apoptosis pathways in statin myotoxicity. Furthermore, the hypothesis of an increased Ca2&#x0002b; influx as a mediator of statin induced toxicity is supported by the significant up-regulation of phospholipase C pathway and by the dysregulation of genes encoding for calcium binding proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000097.s040">Supporting Information Dataset S2</xref>) in the present study. Another hallmark of high dose simvastatin effect in muscle is the activation of pro-inflammatory pathways such as eicosanoid synthesis. However, the present results cannot reveal the actual trigger leading to impaired mitochondrial function and induction of these proinflamatory pathways.</p><p>Atorvastatin and simvastatin treatments also resulted in specific plasma lipidome profiles. Thus, lipidomics analysis may have the potential of providing individualized specific lipid lowering agents suitable to individual patients after the significance of these novel lipid biomarkers is elucidated. The role of sphingolipids as independent predictors of coronary artery disease has been previously suggested <xref rid="pone.0000097-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. However, our results demonstrate that plasma sphingomyelin changes in response to statin therapy varies for different sphingomyelin molecular species. This raises important questions about the biological significance of these molecular species.</p><p>We also identified ether phospholipids as another type of lipids differentially regulated by simvastatin. Interestingly plasmalogens, a most abundant sub-class of ether phospholipids, have been associated with protection against oxidative damage <xref rid="pone.0000097-Engelmann1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0000097-Zoeller1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Their observed decrease (and negative correlation with the ALOX5AP expression) following simvastatin treatment may thus be functionally linked to increased oxidative stress and inflammation in muscle. Phosphatidylethanolamines were specifically dysregulated by simvastatin. The significance of this observation remains to be elucidated but it is interesting that a link between the Leukotriene B4 (a lipid synthesised via ALOX5AP) and the release of arachidonate from phosphatidylethanolamine in human neutrophils has been established <xref rid="pone.0000097-Burke1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. All together these data indicate that in parallel with specific gene expression changes in skeletal muscle, treatment with simvastatin was also associated with parallel changes in plasma of lipidic proinflamatory markers.</p><p>One limitation of the present study is the relatively small sample size due to obvious limitations in the number of muscle specimens obtained from patients. However, the conclusions of the results are strengthened by the combined genomic and lipidomic analyses. Although it may considered a potential weakness of the study, we decided not include at this stage any patients with acute proven myopathy. The rational for this is that analysis of gene expression profiles in specimens obtained from patients during acute muscle events (unpublished results) revealed hundreds of different genes affected in the context of muscle damage, making it rather difficult to analyze the results as directly related to the statin treatment or establish their potential use as early markers of myopathy. Therefore our strategy of investigating individuals with well-defined statin-induced mitochondrial defects during a randomized trial allowed us to identify markers with potential diagnostic and prognostic value. In conclusion, the combined analyses of gene expression and lipidomics profiles in asymptomatic statin treated individuals revealed that: a) simvastatin 80 mg induces specific gene expression and lipid changes compared to equally efficient atorvastatin treatments and b) that our combined transcriptomic lipidomic analysis provides <italic>bona fide</italic> sensitive biomarkers of statin induced metabolic changes in muscle potentially useful to identify patients at risk early enough to prevent actual muscle damage. These biomarkers are now available for further validation in patients with proven statin-induced myopathy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000097.s001"><label>Text S1</label><caption><p>Lipidomics platform characteristics and quality control.</p><p>(0.05 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0000097.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000097.s002"><label>Text S2</label><caption><p>Parameters for the GSEA analysis.</p><p>(0.04 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0000097.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000097.s003"><label>Text S3</label><caption><p>Plasma lipidomics PLS/DA model details, corresponding to the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000097-g001">Figure 1</xref> of the paper.</p><p>(0.03 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0000097.s003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000097.s004"><label>Text S4</label><caption><p>Combined plasma lipidomics and muscle gene expression PLS/DA model details, corresponding to the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000097-g002">Figure 2</xref> of the paper.</p><p>(0.03 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0000097.s004.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000097.s005"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Characteristics of the patients selected for tissue gene expression analysis at baseline and at the end of the study.</p><p>(0.03 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0000097.s005.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000097.s006"><label>Table S2</label><caption><p>The top loads from the lipidomics analysis, ranked by increasing first latent variable (differentiating between the placebo and statin-treated groups as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000097-g001">Figure 1</xref>).
