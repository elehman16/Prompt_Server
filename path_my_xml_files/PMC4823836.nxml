Subjects with Pain Visual Analogue Scale of more than 40&#x000a0;mm were included. Uphill walking was provided as the stressor using Naughton&#x02019;s protocol on a treadmill. The subjects walked for 10&#x000a0;minutes continuously followed by a rest period and baseline pain score for index knee joint was recorded. Subjects were administered a single dose of Lanconone&#x000ae; (1000&#x000a0;mg)/Ibuprofen (400&#x000a0;mg). Thereafter the same stressor was provided at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6&#x000a0;hours, subsequently, pain scores were recorded on a visual analogue scale.

The prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders is 23.9&#x000a0;% for women and 18.6&#x000a0;% for men. Furthermore, recent World Health Organization statistics for the year 2010 reported a 45&#x000a0;% increase in disability due to musculoskeletal disorders during the past decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The CDC has also projected that 25&#x000a0;% of the world population would be affected by musculoskeletal disorders by the year 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. These statistics present only a partial picture because they do not take into account the contribution of risk factors associated with obesity, sedentary lifestyle, sports-related injury, and nutritional deficiencies leading to these disorders.</p><p>Pain and debilitation are the central hallmarks of musculoskeletal disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Complete recovery from joint disease poses a significant challenge to patients and healthcare providers. Pain plays a major role, as illustrated by a study conducted amongst basketball players where almost 19&#x000a0;% of athletes never resumed their game owing to pain caused by injury, thus experiencing suboptimal postoperative recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Similar results were observed in running, football [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and other sports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Current regimens for joint pain management include pharmacological, surgical, and alternative therapies. Surgical intervention is generally considered a last resort, in the face of the failure of nonsurgical therapies. Pharmacological therapies include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids, corticosteroids, and other analgesics, all of which carry varying degrees of safety risks.</p><p>NSAIDs even though are most popular, their long-term use is frequently reported to be associated with several safety concerns, such as gastrointestinal erosions with or without bleeding, cardiovascular risks and hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Additionally, increased risk of hypertension as well as blood glucose destabilization was observed in older patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These safety issues fuel patients&#x02019; desires as well as the scientific community&#x02019;s quest for safer and effective alternative treatments.</p><p>Lanconone&#x000ae; (Enovate Biolife, Wilmington DE, USA) is a proprietary botanical active compound, which has demonstrated significant reduction in joint pain in moderate to severe symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA). In an earlier pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], use of Lanconone&#x000ae; for chronic pain over the period of 12&#x000a0;weeks was investigated. However, reports of rapid pain relief from subjects taking Lanconone&#x000ae; prompted us to confirm these initial findings with a new study. Presently, there are no marketed herbal products with demonstrated analgesic activity in the temporal range of NSAIDs. The present double-blind, comparator-controlled randomized clinical study was designed specifically to evaluate the efficacy of Lanconone&#x000ae; in acute pain, intensity, and onset of pain relief, against ibuprofen as a NSAID comparator.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>The trial was conducted at the outpatient clinics of two orthopedic surgeons having a regular inflow of subjects with knee pain. Knee joint pain is an appropriate model to study pain relief, as the structural changes here are representative of a stable condition to study acute pain. A total of 72 males and females between 40 and 60&#x000a0;years of age with mild to moderate degenerative changes of the knee joint were randomized in the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Subject inclusion criteria</title><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>History of moderate to severe knee pain on minimal exertion but no pain at rest.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A score &#x02265;40&#x000a0;mm on the pain visual analog scale (VAS) after walking briskly at a pace of 4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.5 mph on a treadmill without elevation for 10&#x000a0;minutes continuously.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Grade II and III joint functionality assessed clinically as per American Rheumatology Association (ARA) classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and radiologically as per Kellgren Lawrence (KL) classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>Physician and subject global assessment of joint pain as &#x0201c;poor&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;very poor&#x0201d; after walking briskly at a pace of 4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.5 mph on a treadmill without elevation for 10&#x000a0;minutes.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Subject exclusion criteria</title><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Any other form of arthritis except OA.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Neurological origin of pain, limb deformity, or any other systemic illness that might interfere with the outcome of the study.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Subjects taking intra-articular or oral steroids/hyaluronic acid/parenteral NSAIDS for a considerable period.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Subject with signs of local lower limb(s) injury.</p></list-item></list></p><p>All subjects provided their well-informed written consent for participation in the study which was recorded audio-visually.

They were then asked to walk briskly at a pace of 4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.5 mph on a treadmill without elevation for 10&#x000a0;minutes, following which they marked the level of pain on the VAS (0 being no pain and 100 being unbearable pain).</p><p>Subsequently, a clinical examination was done by the investigator to determine functionality based on ARA classification, defined as pain in the knee joint on most days, crepitus on motion, morning stiffness &#x02265;30&#x000a0;minutes, age &#x0003e;50&#x000a0;years, and bony enlargement on palpation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Subjects fulfilling four out of five criteria were included in the study.</p><p>A radiographic image of the index knee joint (refers to the joint of each subject having the higher VAS score) was also obtained. The X-ray image was graded for KL scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] by a radiologist and confirmed by the orthopedic surgeons. Subjects graded by the investigators in grade II (defined as small osteophytes, possible narrowing of the joint) and grade III (defined as multiple, moderately sized osteophytes, definite joint space narrowing, some sclerotic areas, possible deformation of bone ends) were enrolled in the study.</p><p>A global assessment of knee joint pain by the investigator and subject was taken, expressed as &#x0201c;very good&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;good&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;fair&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;poor&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;very poor&#x0201d;.

Once the subjects qualified at the screening visit, a washout period of 7&#x000a0;days was ensured prior to the study start for those on analgesics for knee pain.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Study procedure</title><p>On the day of randomization, subjects were again asked to walk briskly at a pace of 4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.5 mph on a treadmill without elevation for 10&#x000a0;minutes to assess the worsening of pain during the washout period. Knee pain was assessed by the investigator and the subject. An uphill walking protocol is considered most appropriate to induce knee pain which would be close to real-life situations and can be applied to pain in day-to-day wear and tear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A modified Naughton&#x02019;s protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] of uphill walking on a treadmill was provided as the stressor. Subjects were initially familiarized with the treadmill usage protocol. All instructions were provided clearly to the subjects. After an initial resting time of 10&#x000a0;minutes, subjects were asked to stride the treadmill belt. The treadmill speed was set up to 1 mph with 0&#x000b0; incline for the first 2&#x000a0;minutes followed by an increase of speed to 2 mph which remained constant thereafter. The inclination increased by 3.5&#x000a0;% every 2&#x000a0;minutes. Subjects walked on the treadmill for 10&#x000a0;minutes and marked their baseline pain intensity using the VAS within 5&#x02013;10 minutes of ending the walking protocol. The time gap was provided to avoid muscle fatigue-related high scores. They then rested until the next VAS time point.</p><p>Immediately after the baseline pain was recorded, subjects were administered a single oral dose of two capsules of Lanconone&#x000ae; or ibuprofen.</p><p>Pain VAS scores were assessed at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6&#x000a0;hours post dosing. The subject walked for 10&#x000a0;minutes prior to all assessment time points, followed by rest for 50&#x000a0;minutes. The subjects rated their pain on VAS scale 5&#x02013;10 minutes following completion of the treadmill exercise as per specified protocol.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Treatment</title><p>Both Lanconone&#x000ae; and ibuprofen were prepared in orange-colored capsule size 0 and matched in weight and color. Each 500&#x000a0;mg capsule of Lanconone&#x000ae; (Enovate Biolife) contained <italic>Oroxylum indicum</italic>, <italic>Withania somnifera</italic>, <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic>, <italic>Commiphora mukul</italic>, <italic>Smilax china</italic>, <italic>Pluchea lanceolata</italic> and <italic>Boswellia serrata</italic>. The matched capsule of ibuprofen (HuBei Granules-biocause Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, Yangwan Road, Jingmen, Hubei, China) contained 200&#x000a0;mg of the active ingredient plus excipients. Both Lanconone&#x000ae; and ibuprofen were prepared under Good Manufacturing Practices. Ibuprofen was selected as the comparator for the study because of its high efficacy to reduce musculoskeletal pain, its common use as an anti-inflammatory drug, and its better safety profile amongst NSAIDs. The study subjects were administered two capsules of either Lanconone&#x000ae; or ibuprofen. Being a single dose study, 100&#x000a0;% compliance with both interventions was assured.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Pain VAS</title><p>The pain VAS has been effectively used to measure acute as well as chronic pain in degenerative joint conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and has demonstrated sensitivity to changes in pain assessed hourly following analgesic therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. On a scale of 100&#x000a0;mm subdivisions, 0 indicated no pain and 100 the highest pain. Subjects were asked to rate the severity of their pain at the screening visit as well as at baseline and at various time points such as 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6&#x000a0;hours. The pain intensity difference was calculated by comparing pain VAS scores at baseline with each post-treatment time point.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Onset and time to meaningful pain relief</title><p>A &#x0201c;double stop-watch method&#x0201d; was used to determine first perceived pain relief (reduction in VAS pain by 10&#x000a0;mm, as perceived by the subjects compared with the recently scored baseline) and time to meaningful pain relief (reduction in VAS pain by 40&#x000a0;mm, as perceived by the subjects compared with the recently scored baseline), thus defining the precise onset of the drug action. Immediately after dosing, the subjects were given two stop watches and instructed that once they started perceiving the pain relief for the first time, they were to switch off one of the two stop watches and hand it to the study coordinator. Similarly, when they experienced meaningful pain relief they were to switch off the second stop-watch. The study coordinator recorded both time points for pain relief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Safety assessment</title><p>The subjects reported to the investigator any adverse events during the study duration, and the adverse event was recorded by the investigators.

Musculoskeletal pain, being the leading and the most debilitating condition, is a major cause of concern for physically active people. The present study was undertaken to compare the kinetics of pain relief from Lanconone&#x000ae; 1000&#x000a0;mg versus ibuprofen 400&#x000a0;mg in a painful knee joint. Several studies have proven ibuprofen to be efficacious in the management of pain in subjects with joint pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], albeit with serious side-effect liabilities.</p><p>We found no significant difference in the onset and time to meaningful pain relief for the two products studied. Larger studies may be needed to confirm these findings; however, the present study indicates that Lanconone&#x000ae; 1000&#x000a0;mg is as effective as ibuprofen 400&#x000a0;mg in acute musculoskeletal pain. This to our knowledge is the first such demonstration by a botanical dietary supplement.</p><p>Ibuprofen has been extensively studied in relation to pain in knee OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. It has been established that pain in the knee joint correlates well with the pathological condition of the knee joint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]; hence the pain VAS for both groups in our study is comparable because all subjects were in the same stage of OA. Meaningful pain relief is a critical endpoint in pain studies. The American Pain Society has stated that a pain-relieving effect, although statistically significant, is irrelevant if the pain relief is not meaningful to the patients. A score of 40&#x000a0;mm on a 100&#x000a0;mm scale of pain VAS is considered to be clinically significant pain relief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. An exploratory study from 2003 stated that clinically meaningful reduction of acute pain was achieved with a 40&#x02013;45 % decrease on a pain numerical rating scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] similar to the pain VAS, where 0 correlated to no pain and 10 to worst possible pain. This outcome allied well with our study, wherein meaningful pain relief was reached at the pain VAS score of 40 mm. The time to reach meaningful pain relief was similar in both groups.</p><p>The ingredients of Lanconone&#x000ae; have a vast body of scientific data. <italic>B. serrata</italic> has been studied in various animal and human trials with different inflammatory conditions such as OA and rheumatoid arthritis, and so forth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The in-vitro studies show that it has cyclooxygenase (COX) and 5-lipooxygenase (LOX) inhibitor activity. Also, in a human trial with the use of 30&#x000a0;% acetyl-11-keto-b-boswellic acid (AKBA), a constituent of boswellia resulted in the reduction of matrix metalloproteinase-3 which is a marker for central pain sensitization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. <italic>C. mukul</italic> has been studied in an animal model in comparison with ibuprofen and phenyl butazone for its anti-inflammatory effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] in OA. <italic>Z. officinale</italic> is hypothesized to block the activity of COX enzymes and leukotrine and prostaglandin synthesis, thus influencing the pain processing mechanism; it has also been studied for its positive effect on exercise-induced muscle pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. <italic>P. lanceolata</italic> has been found not only to be anti-inflammatory but also to have good analgesic properties. A preclinical study has compared the anti-inflammatory effect of <italic>P. lanceolata</italic> with drugs such as ibuprofen and has proven it to be better [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Thus, the rapid pain relief by Lanconone&#x000ae; may be due to the combined analgesic effect of these ingredients.</p><p>This trial was designed to study the effect of the supplement for pain relief in postexertion acute joint pain. However, Lanconone<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> may be of benefit in joint pain that exacerbates on exertion irrespective of pathological or non-pathological origin of pain. While this was a study in a nonathletic population, the data warrant further clinical work into the use of Lanconone&#x000ae; as a safer alternative for pain relief in athletes and other populations. Larger, preferably postmarketing, studies may be required to completely rule out potential side effects of Lanconone&#x000ae;. Therefore, based on traditional and modern data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] on the component ingredients available, it is not unreasonable to propose Lanconone&#x000ae; for long-term use as a potent and rapid action analgesic for acute joint pain.</p><p>The pain-relieving effect of Lanconone&#x000ae; could not be studied beyond 6&#x000a0;hours because of methodological and ethical challenges. However, the pain levels in both groups at the end of 6&#x000a0;hours were in the 10&#x02013;20 range on the VAS scale, indicating that the analgesic effect for 1000&#x000a0;mg of Lanconone&#x000ae; would probably persist for a considerable time beyond 6&#x000a0;hours.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Lanconone&#x000ae;, a proprietary botanical active compound, was proven to be efficacious for joint health on chronic administration in an earlier randomized placebo-controlled trial. The present study demonstrated rapid pain relieving potential of Lanconone&#x000ae; which is comparable with that of Ibuprofen, one of the most widely used NSAIDs.</p><p>Lanconone&#x000ae; can thus be used as a safe standalone short-term and long-term analgesic, as well as a good complement to potent chondroprotective agents and anti-inflammatory supplements, which are presently facing controversies not only regarding their role in pain and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] but also their role in cartilage rebuilding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>CONSORT Statement</title><p>The current manuscript adheres to &#x0201c;Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials&#x0201d; guidelines.
