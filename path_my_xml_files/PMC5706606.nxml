<sup>1</sup>
</xref>, defined as the cessation of cardiac mechanical activity and confirmed by the
absence of circulation signals<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref>, is considered a public health problem, especially when it occurs in an
out-of-hospital environment. The most important determinant for survival is the presence
of an individual to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) maneuvers: a health
professional, who can apply resuscitation skills adapted to different circumstances, or
lay people trained in basic life support (BLS), in the case of CPR occurring outside the
health service environment<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The BLS is considered the basis for care in cases of CPR, and defines the primary
sequence of resuscitation that save lives, including immediate recognition of the
condition, activation of the emergency response system, early CPR and rapid
defibrillation<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>. In the advanced life support (ALS), interventions are based on basic support
previously initiated in order to increase the probability of return to spontaneous
circulation, with medication therapy, advanced management of airways, and physiological
monitoring with equipment and devices. After spontaneous circulation returns,
neurological survival and evolution can be improved with post-CPR care<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>However, although some advanced support techniques improve survival, the basic support
interventions are determinant in increasing survival rates; the success of resuscitation
depends primarily on the effectiveness of the initial actions. These questions refer to
the reflection on the undervaluation of BLS learning, from the perception of health
professionals, who consider learning about ALS more important than that of basic
support.</p><p>In a more comprehensive manner, one of the greatest challenges is to increase the access
to teaching of CPR maneuvers, including in Brazil, thus minimizing the time between life
support and defibrillation, and to establish processes for the continuous improvement of
resuscitation quality<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>In this context, in an active, affective and collaborative way, the simulation has
occupied a prominent place, from professional formation to education during the
professional life, with association of technological resources, based on active
methodologies. As a representation of the real-life event applied in a controlled
environment, the use of simulation aims to provide safe care, enabling students and
health professionals to practice and reflect on the skills<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>Teaching with simulation, and <italic>debriefing,</italic> is not limited to specific
clinical laboratory encounters. It is possible to use case studies in the classroom,
with discussion supported in virtual simulations; to propose <italic>in situ</italic>
simulations<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref> with actors, standardized patients or simulators, with or without recording of
the activity for <italic>debriefing</italic> during discussion of the didactic content;
assess the learning needs and fill performance gaps in different scenarios; to provide
the monitoring and (re)planning of activities, enabling the educator and/or employer to
evaluate the competencies of the student and/or recently hired professional in the
organization<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>For the coherent orientation of the strategy, organizations such as the
<italic>International Nursing Association for Clinical Simulation and
Learning</italic> (INACSL) provide guidelines on terminology, integrity of
participants, outline of objectives, role of facilitator, <italic>debriefing</italic>,
evaluation of participants and activity<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>According to the guidelines of the American Heart Association (AHA/2015), in addition to
the simulation, the use of technology in the management of CPR is emphasized, aiming at
rapid action, valuation of adequate training, and coordinated efforts to increase the
chances of post-arrest survival<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>In professional education and training, short-term online courses are recommended for
teaching and maintaining proper resuscitation maneuvers. Technological resources, such
as immediate feedback electronic devices, can be used to monitor CPR<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>, online or during real-time training.</p><p>The feedback devices are resources that allow the monitoring of performance in
performing CPR, in relation to several parameters, such as compression ratio and depth,
flow fraction, frequency and volume of ventilation, among others. According to the
equipment used, different parameters are provided to be used as indicators of quality in
the analysis of CPR administration. The devices range from the most common, such as
metronomes, to the more complex ones, such as defibrillators and simulators, equipped
with software and pressure detection sensors for evaluation of compressions and
ventilations<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Considering that BLS skills seem to be learned with the same ease by self-learning
(video or computer) and by practice, compared to traditional classes provided by
instructors<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>, and seeking to combine educational technological resources on resuscitation
maneuvers, the objective of this study was to evaluate the learning of the students
participating in an online BLS course with the use of immediate feedback devices. The
hypothesis of the study was that the online course contributes to incremental BLS
learning.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>This was a quasi-experimental study, of a before--and-after design, about the
application of an online course as an educational intervention, to evaluate the BLS
learning of undergraduate nursing students at a public university in the city of S&#x000e3;o
Paulo, between 2014 and 2015. The research was approved by the Ethics Committee in
Research of the university in question, according to protocol n&#x000ba; 526.932, identifier
CAAE 27029214.4.0000.5392.</p><p>For selection of participants, an invitation and the Terms of Free and Informed Consent
were sent, by electronic mail, to all 283 of the first- to fourth-year nursing students.
Interested respondents received the link and password to access the online course.</p><p>The inclusion criterion was: being regularly enrolled in the baccalaureate course in
Nursing, in 2014. As an exclusion criterion, non-compliance with any of the phases of
the online course, such as: pre-testing, virtual classroom attendance, post-test,
participation in the practical activity simulation, and evaluation of the online course.
In a convenience sample, 94 students agreed to participate, 88 accessed the virtual
environment, 67 finished the theoretical part, and 62 completed the online course.</p><p>The following instruments were used for data collection: a) pre-/post-test, composed of
20 objective questions, with scores of 0.5 or 0, structured according to the tests
applied in the BLS, and which were previously analyzed by eight experts; B) 20-item
checklist, with a score equivalent to 0.5 or 0, based on the BLS evaluation tool and the
professional experience of the researcher, previously analyzed by five specialists; C)
immediate-feedback mobile electronic devices (<italic>Resusci Anne QCPR</italic>

frequency, chest release at each compression) and ventilations (frequency, volume). In
the result of the resuscitation performance, the percentage of performance score is
indicated: from 0 to 49% (basic performance of CPR); from 50 to 74% (intermediate
performance of CPR); from 75 to 100% (advanced performance of CPR)<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>In the development of the online course on BLS, with a workload of 20 hours, we used the
analysis, design, development, implementation, evaluation (ADDIE) model of instructional
design, based on Andragogy<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref> and the Significant Learning Theory<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref>. The educational objectives were structured based on the Bloom taxonomy,
regarding the actions required to identify CPR in the adult and perform the BLS
maneuvers, orienting the design of the instructional matrix and storyboards to organize
the sequence of content and development of the learning objects, such as virtual
classes, interactive exercises, videos, and an infographic.</p><p>The online course was implemented in the <italic>Moodle Stoa</italic> extension area of
the University of S&#x000e3;o Paulo (USP), available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cursosextensao.usp.br/course/view.php?id=133">http://cursosextensao.usp.br/course/view.php?id=133</ext-link>, and was evaluated by
a group of specialists. After some suggested readjustments, the students accessed the
course. In the virtual learning environment, the participants had access to eight
tutors, experienced nurses in higher education in Nursing, Emergency and Distance
Education (DE). During the online course, theoretical learning was virtually assessed by
means of pre- and post-test scores. At the end of the theoretical study, the practical
evaluation was scheduled on one of five days, from 8am to 6pm, in December of 2014 and
also in February of 2015, a period related to data collection. The skills were evaluated
in classes using simulated practice, in the Nursing Skills Laboratory (NSL) of the
university.</p><p>After previous familiarization with the scenario and equipment, the students, in pairs,
administered BLS with an <italic>automated external defibrillator</italic> (AED), in
simulation of care for the adult with cardiopulmonary arrest, during four minutes in the
extra-hospital environment. They were evaluated by the researcher and another tutor on
the use of printed checklists and electronic feedback devices. At the end of the
simulation, a <italic>debriefing</italic> was performed, and the students were taken to
another space, organized in a similar way to the previous one, for the purpose of
reviewing techniques and eventual clarification of doubts, with guidance from the third
tutor. The tutorials were oriented toward the management of equipment, as well as the
role during evaluation of the simulation and the reinforcement activity. Previous
experience as instructors in BLS courses and training of emergency professionals
facilitated the understanding of the activity dynamics and the evaluator role.</p><p>For statistical analysis, means and standard deviations (SD) were calculated for pre-
and post-test scores, course evaluations, and performances in the practical evaluation.
Absolute and relative frequency was used for sex, age and motivation to participate. A
significance level of 5% was adopted. Variables with non-normal distribution were
analyzed using Kendal&#x02019;s correlation coefficient. The difference between the post-test
and pre-test scores was considered as a parameter for theoretical learning. A paired
t-test was applied to test the hypothesis of difference between the pre- and post-test
means; and analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate theoretical learning.
Linear regression was calculated to verify the association between theoretical learning
(dependent variable), year in nursing school for each student, and whether they attended
emergency classes before the online course (independent variables). The Statistical
Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), version 22, was used.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Among the 62 students who completed the online course, the majority (87%) was female,
with a mean age of 21.47 years (SD 2.39). Of these, 90.3% were in the first and second
years of undergraduate nursing courses, while 9.7% were in the third and fourth years.
Regarding previous knowledge, 50% had not participated in an emergency class prior to
the online course; 53.3% did not know BLS; 61.2% were familiar with the
Moodle<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> platform; 69.1% had not previously participated in the distance
education classes.</p><p>As for digital fluency, 100% had access to the Internet, and for 98.9%, access was via
cellphone. Regarding the motivation for taking the course, 96.8% targeted the practical
applicability of learning. Since the participation in the course did not have evaluation
of the students, the difference between the post-test and pre-test was considered as a
parameter for theoretical learning, with a variation from zero to ten. From the pre- and
post-test scores, the means of the scores were calculated in each phase of the
evaluation. The mean in the pre-test was 6.4 (SD1.6) and, in the post-test, 9.3 (SD
0.82, p &#x0003c;0.001, N = 62). In the paired t-test, significant differences in the means
of the pre- and post-test scores were identified, with an increase in the mean and a
decrease in the SD in the post-test. Differences in the means of the scores in the pre-
and post-test were analyzed in relation to the year of study in the undergraduate
program, which were grouped two by two, the first and second year in one group, and the
third and fourth year in another, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table

</p><p>The ANOVA analysis showed significant differences in the means of pre-test scores among
the 56 students in the first two years of the nursing course, and the group of six
students in the last two years. The analysis showed that, after the online course, the
increase in mean scores was significant (p &#x0003c;0.001), regardless of the year in which
the students were enrolled in the nursing program. At the end of the online course, no
significant difference (p = 0.475) was identified in learning among first and second
year students, compared to third and fourth year students.</p><p>To identify the variables associated with learning, a multiple linear regression model
with progressive inclusion (forward stepwise) was adjusted. The association was shown to
be significant, and inversely proportional to learning, in relation to the enrolled year
in the nursing school course (coefficient 0.542, PE 0.215, p=0.015), and participation
of the student in an emergency class before the online course (coefficient 0.903; PE
0.437; p=0.044, R<sup>2</sup>=0.253).</p><p>During the practical evaluation of the simulated activity, the electronic records from
the immediate feedback devices were used. The mean percentage of performance was 43.7%,
which corresponded to basic CPR (from 0 to 49%); mean length of compression cycles per
second of 20.5; correct positioning of the hands to perform compression of 93.2%; mean
number of compressions of 167.2; mean depth of compressions of 48.1 millimeters; mean
chest release of 100%; mean ventilation of 8.2 ventilations every two minutes; mean
ventilation volume of 742.7 milliliters; percentage of flow fraction of 40.3%. In
addition to the electronic devices for immediate feedback during the practical
evaluation, the checklist records used to follow the student&#x02019;s actions were also used to

</p><p>In the practical activity, according to the success of the 20 actions provided on the
checklist, considering the score equivalent to 0.5 per item, the mean score was 9.1 (SD
0.95). The plausibility of the hypothesis was confirmed in this study, and a
contribution to learning about BLS with the online course was verified.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of investigations and resuscitation guidelines converge upon the use of
videos and online courses as resources in life support education<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref>. Thus, the development of the online BLS course aimed at stimulating the
participant&#x02019;s autonomy, favoring the self-managed learning process in a
self-instructional way, combining the assumptions of Andragogy and Significant Learning
Theory with educational technologies, due to the profile of students who seek
distance-learning courses. Most are adults whose previous experiences can be widely
used, since learning is understood as a process of gaining knowledge and/or
experience<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>Among the results found in the evaluation of learning, the significant difference
between the post-test and pre-test scores evidenced the learning gain in the theoretical
study on BLS at the end of the online course, regardless of the students&#x02019; year in the
undergraduation course, or previous participation in emergency classes. This course
contributed to learning, which was evidenced by the significant increase in the mean of
the scores, analyzed between the beginning and the end of the course.</p><p>The correlation among the variables aimed to analyze the outcomes related to learning,
and to understand if the improvement in the learning achievement could be explained by
different events, other than the online course, as an educational intervention. The
correlations with learning were associated with the undergraduate course year of the
student, and the fact that the student had previously attended emergency classes.
Although these two variables influenced the best results in the pre-test, performed by
the students in third and fourth year of nursing school, at the end of the online
course, the students enrolled in the first and second year of nursing school achieved
similar results, even without previous knowledge obtained in emergency classes.</p><p>The finding of another investigation indicated that nursing students acquired
significant theoretical achievement at the end of the online course, when assessing the
learning on BLS obtained in the virtual environment<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Enhancement in theoretical and practical learning was identified, with improvement in
performance, regardless of the type of strategy used. Learning outcomes obtained in
traditional courses, those guided by instructors, and self-learning videos were similar.
Because of this, computer-based courses associated with the practice of resuscitation
maneuvers can be a reasonable alternative to benefit greater standardization, in
addition to a probable reduction in time and resources<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Another relevant aspect is the frequent approximation to the subject, which contributes
to retention of learning of life support maneuvers, as knowledge tends to degrade over
time. At the university where this study was conducted, the BLS subject is introduced to
the students in the Critical Care Nursing of Adults and Elderly course, given in the
third year of the nursing program. Respecting curricular programming, it is necessary to
consider the opportunities for the subject to be presented to the students earlier,
providing new possibilities to increase attendance and (re)training, either in the field
of practice, in clinical training, or in educational activities on BLS, assigning new
meaning to learning and lived experiences of the students.</p><p>The importance of frequent training is consensus. Short and frequent training courses
are highly recommended; the greater the exposure to the content, the greater the
retention and safety in applying life support principles<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref>. Although theoretical learning reaches satisfactory levels at the end of the
course or training, learning retention is of particular concern in relation to life
support performance skills over the time elapsed after the educational intervention. In
general, adult learning retention after training in resuscitation maneuvers varies from
50 to 60%<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>19</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Considering that the knowledge retention about life support maneuvers occurs more
effectively when verified in professionals, especially those working in emergency
situations, or in those who apply the knowledge more frequently, it is necessary to
consider strategies that favor the students&#x02019; learning, because they are less frequently
exposed to emergency situations.</p><p>Recommendations regarding the use of simulation with high fidelity simulators and
feedback devices corroborate the need for higher quality learning processes and results
in education, for the practical application of resuscitation maneuvers<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>. Improvement in resuscitation maneuvers were also identified when using feedback
devices in training of laypersons, conferring higher quality when performing BLS, either
in the initial phase of training or in periodic review<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>20</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Evidence from a systematic review, in 2009, indicated positive aspects in the use of
devices of immediate feedback in the CPR maneuvers, which was also applicable for
situations in real-time care, supporting learning and retention of learned knowledge and
skills, with recommendations to investigate the impact on patient survival<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>. Subsequently, authors indicated that the combination of the use of feedback
devices in training and real-time care in cases of extra-hospital CPR contributed
positively to patient survival<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Considering that short courses and regularity in attendance have a positive influence on
learning, as no significant correlation with longer training time was found<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>22</sup>
</xref>, the online course is a viable resource in professional training and continuing
education.</p><p>The convenience sample used was a limitation of this study, which was influenced by a
period of work strikes (from May to September of 2015) and university stoppage,
generating accumulation in student demand, and complicating the ability to participate
in the research, performed without a practice pre-course phase. </p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results showed an increase in the mean score of the post-test, which indicated a
more significant learning gain for students in the first years, or for those who did not
attend emergency classes previously.</p><p>The use of technological resources and mobile devices of immediate feedback to verify
the students&#x02019; performance in the practical evaluation was a valuable support, with the
measurement of aspects such as hand positioning and thorax release, which are generally
evaluated subjectively by observation. These parameters, evaluated with the device,
indicate the quality of the compressions during resuscitation, giving greater
objectivity and precision in the evaluation process, in addition to encouraging the
student to raise awareness about his/her performance of the care. The BLS online course
enabled access to knowledge, acting as a knowledge space and an environment for
reflection on emergency actions, stimulating clinical reasoning and decision-making. </p><p>In conducting similar studies, practical activity is suggest, both at the beginning and
at the end of the online course.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1"><label>1</label><p>Paper extracted from Doctoral Thesis &#x0201c;Development and evaluation of the online course
