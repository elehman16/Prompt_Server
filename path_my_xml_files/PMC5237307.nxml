Over the past decade, important policy and programmatic steps have been taken to address violence against women in Nepal. There remains a dearth of evidence on the effectiveness of primary violence prevention strategies. The Change Starts at Home study begins to fill this gap by utilizing a multi-component social behaviour change communication (SBCC) strategy involving a radio drama and community mobilization to shift attitudes, norms and behaviours that underpin IPV perpetration in Nepal.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The study uses a concurrent mixed-methods design.

The qualitative aspects of the design include several longitudinal approaches to understand the impact of the intervention and to examine mechanisms of change including in-depth interviews with participants (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;18 couples), and focus group discussions with community leaders (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3 groups), and family members of participants (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;12 groups).

Over the past decade, important policy and programmatic steps have been taken to address violence against women in Nepal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The 2006 Gender Equality Act amended 56 discriminatory provisions in the law and clarified and expanded definitions of violent crimes committed against women, including rape and homicide. In 2009, the government of Nepal passed the Domestic Violence (Crime and Punishment) Act, which renders illegal violence committed by one family member against another. Resources aimed at supporting women who experience violence and preventing violence against women and girls (VAWG) have also increased, and both government and civil society organizations have opened centres throughout the country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. There remains, however, a dearth of evidence on the effectiveness of primary violence prevention strategies (i.e. strategies that prevent violence before it occurs) and existing evidence is skewed toward secondary and tertiary prevention strategies (i.e. strategies that aim to respond to violence after it has taken place and/or mitigate its consequences) developed in high-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Equal Access&#x02019; (EA) Change Starts at Home Project (<italic>Change</italic>) begins to fill this gap by utilizing a multi-component social behaviour change communication (SBCC) strategy involving a radio drama and community mobilization to shift attitudes, norms and behaviours that underpin IPV perpetration in Nepal.</p><p>Existing literature suggests that interventions designed to change social norms can positively influence individual attitudes and practices around IPV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Multicomponent interventions incorporating radio programs have shown increased knowledge and awareness about IPV, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] decreased endorsement of gender-inequitable attitudes, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and increased joint household decision making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and communication about partner violence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and sex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. While no prior studies have investigated the role of radio on the prevention or reduction of IPV in Nepal, radio dramas have been shown to have effects on ideation and behaviour change associated with other gendered health behaviours, such as family planning utilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Despite the small but growing body of literature on the utility of media-based social norms interventions in preventing VAWG, there have been few rigorous studies of violence prevention interventions conducted in Nepal. From August 2007 to May 2010, EA implemented the <italic>Voices</italic> project, which addressed the twin pandemics of HIV (human immmunodeficiency virus) and VAWG using radio and community outreach. The evaluation of <italic>Voices</italic>, funded by the United Nations Trust Fund to End Violence Against Women, demonstrated that the project successfully increased dialogue between husbands and wives around sexual relations and HIV, understanding of legal issues related to VAWG, understanding that marital rape is illegal, intervention in cases of IPV, support for actual help-seeking behaviours, and decreased women&#x02019;s tolerance of VAWG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, the prior evaluation did not utilize a control group, did not involve members of intact couples, and did not directly measure changes in norms but instead measured individual attitudes.</p><p>The current iteration of this approach to violence prevention programming and evaluation address these gaps by building on existing social norms change literature and experimentally testing a promising, multi-component communication-based, social behaviour change intervention (<italic>Change</italic>). <italic>Change</italic> seeks to address social norms, especially the acceptability of IPV, which plays a powerful role in shaping individuals&#x02019; attitudes and behaviours, including the perpetration of IPV and responses to victims of violence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This intervention posits that changes in social norms can successfully promote sustainable change that protects women from IPV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Specifically, the trial seeks to: a) assess whether the multicomponent <italic>Change</italic> program (i.e., media&#x02009;+&#x02009;community engagement strategy) yields a greater reduction in cluster-level IPV rates compared to the <italic>Change</italic> radio program alone; b) determine whether any potential reductions in cluster-level IPV rates are sustained 6&#x000a0;months after cessation of intervention activities, c) explore what mechanisms and factors may explain any differences that may or may not be detected; and d) identify potential socio-demographic or contextual factors that may moderate the impact of the <italic>Change</italic> program. Secondarily, the trial also expects to observe improved conflict resolution techniques, couple communication, attitudes toward gender equity and acceptability of IPV, and perceptions of community acceptance of IPV among <italic>Change</italic> intervention communities versus communities receiving the <italic>Change</italic> radio programming alone. As the target of the intervention are social norms underpinning individual behaviour, a cluster design is utilized.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><p>The study utilizes a concurrent mixed methods design which capitalizes on the strengths of both qualitative and quantitative data collection techniques to ascertain project effectiveness. This study design will also document participant and stakeholder experiences, as well as investigate the mechanisms of action and contextual factors that could affect the outcomes and/or explain results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The quantitative aspect of the evaluation is a pair-matched, repeated cross-sectional 2-armed, single-blinded trial (RCT: <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;36 clusters [Village Development Committees)], 1440 individuals), comparing a social behaviour change communication (SBCC) strategy to radio programming alone for its impact on physical and / or sexual IPV at the end of programming (12&#x000a0;months post-baseline; February-March 2017) and 6-months post the cessation of project activities (18-months post baseline; September-October 2017). The qualitative aspects of the design include several longitudinal approaches to understand the impact of the intervention and examine mechanisms of change, including in-depth interviews with participants (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;18 couples), and focus group discussions with community leaders (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3), and family members of participants (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;12). Measurement activities are timed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) to enable iterative and parallel data analysis.

<italic>Change</italic> is a multi-component SBCC strategy designed to shift attitudes, norms and behaviours that underpin the power imbalances that disfavour women and increase women&#x02019;s vulnerability to husbands&#x02019; IPV within couples in Nepal. Recognizing the social ecology of change, the intervention engages actors across multiple domains of influence, such as family members and community leaders, in addition to the primary target audience of married reproductive age women and their husbands. As a SBCC strategy, the intervention approaches IPV prevention through three key approaches: advocacy, social mobilization and behaviour change communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The behaviour change communication component is a 9-month, weekly radio drama with listener engagement through interactive voice response (IVR) and short message service (SMS), to which both the intervention and control conditions are exposed. The intervention communities are further engaged in radio Listening and Discussion Groups (LDGs), through which the male and female participants meet to critically reflect on the content of the radio episode through a curriculum-based process of guided discussion, in-group and home-based activities. LDGs serve as venues for life skills building and act as a platform through which community outreach activities are planned and executed, alongside local leaders who receive training and support to act as advocates in the community for more equitable social norms. The use of multiple modalities is in keeping with current best practices in social norms change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] which recognizes that modifying complex phenomena (such as social norms) requires a multi-faceted approach.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Theoretical orientation and phases</title><p>The <italic>Change</italic> communication and mobilization intervention relies on a number of theoretical models including: the Socio-Ecological Model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] to conceptualize the multiple contexts and factors that influence behaviour change, the Steps to Behaviour Change Framework, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and the Integrative Model of Behaviour Prediction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] to anchor project activities and curriculum to particular stages and entry points toward behaviour change, and the Diffusion of Innovations theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] to guide efforts to extend the impact of the intervention beyond those most directly exposed (see Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] for visual representations of the hypothesized change process). Collectively, the theoretical underpinning of the project recognizes that change is a process, although not necessarily linear, that occurs within embedded contexts of interpersonal, social and political contexts. The intervention is divided into 3 phases, each lasting 3&#x000a0;months and each delivered via the radio program and the curriculum-based weekly LDG sessions.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Change Starts at Home Theory of Change</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2016_3909_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig>

</p><sec id="Sec7"><title>Phase 1: knowledge and approval</title><p>Current behavioural, normative and control beliefs related to gender norms and VAWG are identified and questioned through a mix of information, role modelling and discussions that highlight the diversity within &#x02018;normative&#x02019; behaviour. During this phase, couples (both as listeners to the radio program and participants in the LDG sessions) are asked to not only acknowledge the existence of a range of behavioural, normative and control beliefs, but to also approve of and internalize those alternatives for themselves. By asking people to accept (and consider applying) new norms and roles, phase 1 will begin to shift negative attitudes related to acceptability of VAWG towards positive attitudes of acceptability of non-violence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Phase 2: intention</title><p>The knowledge and skills gained in phase 1 enable couples to form a strong intention towards adopting more positive behaviours. They now have a more positive attitude towards a gender equitable and non-violent relationship and no longer subscribe to perceived negative social norms related to what is expected of them as a couple. The focus on life skills-based information and education (through both the radio program and LDGs) in this phase enables couples to not only accept that alternative norms and roles exist, but to develop beliefs and skills (example: good communication, empathy, critical thinking, self-awareness) necessary to begin achieving more equitable power in their own relationships. The life skills focus of the curriculum and radio programming therefore plays an important role to build self-efficacy, recognized as a key component in promoting sustained behaviour change. By this phase, those couples who are part of the LDGs should also begin to experience the positive benefits of having a new reference group / positive social identity supporting them to make good decisions as individuals and as a couple, which draws on Jackson&#x02019;s assertion that social learning supports behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Phase 3: practice and advocacy</title><p>Couples move through intention to actually changing behaviours. As per the integrative model, alongside intention and skills, behaviour change is most likely to occur if people have the necessary environment required to support the change. Therefore, whilst the primary beneficiaries of <italic>Change</italic> are couples, family and community members are also targeted (through community activities and the radio program) to ensure they provide an enabling environment and serve as catalysts for change. Community leaders will be trained to incorporate IPV prevention and response into their work as respected members of their communities and family members of LDG participants will be invited to special family-oriented LDG sessions alongside community-based events, such as community theatre, town hall meetings etc. Together, these activities at the various levels of society are hypothesized to affect beliefs, behaviours, and perceptions of social norms to reduce IPV (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Treatment and control conditions for change starts at home</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Treatment</th><th>Control</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Behaviour Change Communication</td><td>Behaviour Change Communication</td></tr><tr><td>o&#x02003;9-month weekly episode behaviour change radio drama with IVR/SMS listener engagement</td><td>o&#x02003;9-month weekly episode behaviour change radio drama with IVR/SMS listener engagement</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Community Mobilization</td></tr><tr><td>o&#x02003;Listening and Discussion Groups, 2 male and 2 female groups per study site meet weekly for 39&#x000a0;weeks (Village Development Council; VDC)</td><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;o&#x02003;Training on gender equity, IPV, life skills, community mobilization, non-violent conflict resolution for LDG facilitators to support knowledge and skill set acquisition of LDG members</td><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;o&#x02003;Joint couple&#x02019;s session every month to foster mutual learning and understanding</td><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;o&#x02003;Community mobilization incentives led by LDGs</td><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;o&#x02003;Encouragement of family members of LGD members to listen to the radio and attend LDG sessions once every 3&#x000a0;months.</td><td/></tr><tr><td>o&#x02003;Awareness raising and street theatre to engage families and community members</td><td/></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Advocacy</td></tr><tr><td>o&#x02003;Training and 6-month follow up of religious/community leaders</td><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;o&#x02003;Religious leaders support community mobilization activity of local LGD</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>

<italic>Samajhdari</italic> is a 30-min drama focused around a highway hotel along the East West Highway in Nepal. The hotel is run by a couple who, comparatively, have a positive and gender-equitable relationship. The wife handles financial issues in the hotel; whereas the husband takes care of the customers and works in the kitchen. Their hotel is popular among travellers passing by and the couple welcome different characters who meet to discuss and exchange stories about problems related to marriage, power and gender identities.

While rigorous evaluations of the effectiveness of utilizing media in combination with dialogue groups and community mobilization to reduce IPV and change underlying gender norms are scarce, quasi-experimental research on other &#x0201c;gendered&#x0201d; health issues (e.g. family planning, HIV discussion) have been encouraging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>LDGs</title><p>LDGs play a vital role in ensuring that the radio content remains relevant and applicable to the listening audience and provides a peer-to-peer group within which it is safe to explore with greater depth some of the issues raised in the radio program. EA trains facilitators that convene discussion groups following a weekly curriculum. Through facilitator feedback forms and monitoring visits, EA collects information and records listener reactions to the radio episodes, capturing perspectives on issues, as well as valuable feedback on which elements were of most interest to listeners, areas for improvement, questions, and requests for additional information. This feedback is then shared with EA&#x02019;s production team to guide the content of future episodes.</p><p>Each session is guided by a step-by-step curriculum. Approximately 10 married couples meeting eligibility criteria will be recruited per ward (1 male and 1 female group per ward, for a total of 4 LDGs per VDC). Each group is managed by a trained facilitator of the same sex who convenes the group once weekly for approximately 2&#x000a0;h in a location deemed socially acceptable and physically accessible. At the start of Phase III each team will be provided with a tool kit to support community interactions, including a gender-focused film and discussion guide for community screenings, a video recording of the gender-focused street theatres (below) plus discussion guide, audio from select radio sessions plus discussion guides, and printed materials including a poster explaining the project.

The play will be performed in one intervention site in each of the 12 districts and will also be professionally recorded so that other communities without access to live performances can view the screenings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Community/religious leader workshop</title><p>Community leaders will be trained in a 2&#x000a0;day workshop designed to: 1) introduce the project 'Change Starts at Home&#x02019; to key stakeholders who are knowledgeable and supportive of the project 2) facilitate smooth implementation of project activities by getting community leader buy-in; 3) strengthen ties between EA/VDRC and the religious/community leaders to encourage better coordinated responses to violence against women, especially IPV in the targeted communities; and 4) provide a forum for the religious and community leaders to reflect on their own position and capacity to comprehend and respond to VAWG, especially IPV. During this workshop the leaders will generate an action plan designed to contribute to violence prevention and enhanced response to partner violence in their local communities; this action plan will be followed up by VDRC after 6&#x000a0;months.

Within each ward, a VDRC representative visited ward subdivisions, comprised of approximately 15-20 households to compile a list of households and identify those containing eligible couples based on information from key informants such as female village health workers and where available, existing lists. These household lists were aggregated at the ward level to create the project&#x02019;s sampling frame.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Community survey recruitment</title><p>For the survey, 40 women per VDC were randomly chosen from the list of households with eligible couples, 20 from each ward were then selected using simple randomization. For this process, within each ward, random numbers were generated in Excel. Households were subsequently organized from highest to lowest based on the randomly generated number. The 20 households with the highest randomly generated numbers were selected for the study.

Findings may contribute to the evidence-base for strategies to reduce IPV and to shift gender norms. Despite the numerous strengths of the study design and approach, the limitations of the study must be discussed. As with all RCTs, this study aims to have strong internal validity, as opposed to strong external validity. One specific limitation is that only women who have received support and permission from their husbands to participate in the study will be recruited. While this criterion likely restricts the study from including the most vulnerable women, it is meant to protect women in high-risk situations from exacerbated abuse and protect the research team and other participants from potentially dangerous situations. Another important limitation regarding external validity is that the trial excludes participants with easily detectable physical or cognitive impairments, and growing research has underscored how women with disabilities may be particular to VAWG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Thus, the research team is fully aware that those who are restricted from participating may have different profiles than those who are able to join. Another important concern is fidelity of intervention delivery given the number of LDGs and their geographic spread which is bolstered by an extensive monitoring and support plan for LDG facilitators.</p><p>The impact of the study may also be difficult to discern due to overlap with programs that have similar content being conducted in the study areas. In order to account for the potential impact of other programming, the study will regularly measure participants&#x02019; exposure by polling participants during LDGs and interviews and communicating with key stakeholders in the regions of operation. Intermittent and ongoing disruptions in programmatic activities may possibly occur due to fuel shortages and safety issues pertaining to political tensions. The research team will closely monitor these potential disruptions.</p><p>In summary, the <italic>Change Starts at Home (Change)</italic> is a multi-component behaviour change communication and community engagement strategy designed to prevent IPV in Nepal. The results of the trial will be immediately useful for governmental, nongovernmental, and donor funded programs targeting partner violence or social norms that underpin it. Findings of the study will also contribute to global knowledge on the effectiveness of media and community engagement as a primary prevention strategy for IPV.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>EA</term><def><p>Equal access</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FGD</term><def><p>Focus group discussion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GEM</term><def><p>Gender equitable men</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HIV</term><def><p>Human immunodeficiency virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICC</term><def><p>Intra-class correlation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IPV</term><def><p>Intimate partner violence</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IVR</term><def><p>Interactive voice response</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LDG</term><def><p>Listening and discussion group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SBCC</term><def><p>Social behaviour change communication</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SMS</term><def><p>Short message service</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAWG</term><def><p>Violence against women and girls</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VDC</term><def><p>Village Development Committees</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VDRC</term><def><p>Vijaya Development Resource Center</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO MCS</term><def><p>World Health Organization Multi-country Study on Women&#x02019;s Health and Domestic Violence</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p>Vox Pop is short for <italic>Vox Populi</italic> (meaning voice of the people) and is a broadcasting term used to describe a range of opinions expressed by the public in the form of informal comments on the same topic or short answers to the same question.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>This manuscript has been funded by UK aid from the UK government, via the What Works to Prevent Violence Against Women and Girls?
