Severe sepsis may induce septic shock, defined as hypotension persisting despite adequate fluid resuscitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. There is evidence indicating an increasing incidence of severe sepsis treated in critical care in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, rising from 50 to 70 cases per 100,000 population per year between 1995 and 2005 - these cases being associated with approximately 31,000 episodes of severe sepsis and 15,000 in-hospital deaths per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Being a serious, life-threatening condition, severe sepsis is expected to be associated with substantial healthcare costs and a significant impact on quality of life.</p><p>Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is a scarce blood product derived from human donor blood; it is currently subject to a Demand Management Programme by the United Kingdom (UK) Department of Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This product has been proposed as an adjuvant therapy for severe sepsis/septic shock since the 1980s. However, the mechanisms of action of IVIG are complex and are not yet fully understood. Despite this, a number of (predominantly small) randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted, and numerous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have been undertaken to synthesise their findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. As a result of the heterogeneity across studies and the inconsistencies in their results, the majority conclude that there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend IVIG as an adjuvant therapy and that more evidence, in the form of a large, well-conducted RCT, is required.</p><p>Prior to investing in a large, multicentre RCT, the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme of the National Institute for Health Research in the UK called for an evaluation of the feasibility and value for money of undertaking such a trial (that is, whether or not the costs of undertaking the trial are outweighed by the potential benefit of the resulting information). The aim of this manuscript is to report our findings in response to this call by assessing the clinical and cost-effectiveness of IVIG in severe sepsis/septic shock in adults, and evaluating the value of conducting a large, multicentre RCT using an expected value of information (EVI) analysis. EVI offers a methodological framework that explicitly considers the uncertainty surrounding the decision by a healthcare system to adopt a health technology and values the additional information, which may be generated by further research, in a way that is consistent with the objectives and resource constraints of heathcare provision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>A full technical report of this research is published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Here, we provide a summary of the evaluation of clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and value of information of IVIG in critically ill adults with severe sepsis/septic shock, undertaken to inform the UK policy context. We discuss the implications arising from this policy-driven evidence review.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a series of formal systematic reviews and undertook additional primary data analysis to develop and populate a decision analytic model. Details of each review and data sources are presented in the full technical report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The decision model evaluated the cost-effectiveness of IVIG as an adjunctive treatment to standard care for the management of adults with severe sepsis (we have used the term severe sepsis in this manuscript to include septic shock). The base-case population in the model reflected the baseline characteristics of the severe sepsis population in the Intensive Care National Audit &#x00026; Research Centre (ICNARC) Case Mix Programme Database (CMPD), a high-quality clinical database of admissions to adult general (mixed medical/surgical) critical care units in the UK, considered to be more representative of current UK National Health Service (NHS) practice than the populations recruited into RCTs. We used data for the years 2007 to 2009, corresponding to a sample of 26,249 patients.</p><p>The decision model evaluated costs from the perspective of the NHS and Personal Social Services (PSS), and expressed these in British pounds sterling at a 2009 price base. Outcomes were expressed in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Both costs and outcomes were discounted using a 3.5% annual discount rate, in line with current guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The model was probabilistic, that is, uncertainty over the input parameters was propagated through the model in such a way that the results of the analysis could be presented with their associated uncertainty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The expected costs and QALYs for IVIG and standard care (SC) were estimated and compared using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) that represent the incremental cost per additional QALY. The ICER was compared against thresholds used to establish value for money in the NHS (currently in the region of &#x000a3;20,000 to &#x000a3;30,000 per QALY) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The probabilistic analysis also provided a formal approach to quantifying the consequences associated with the uncertainty surrounding the model results, which were then used to inform the EVI analyses. The maximum amount the NHS should be willing to invest to reduce uncertainty in the decision can be informed by the expected value of perfect information (EVPI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The EVPI evaluates the expected cost of current uncertainty by accounting both for the probability that a decision based on existing evidence is wrong and for the magnitude of the consequences of making the wrong decisions. EVPI can be expressed at a population level based on the size of the population (yearly incidence&#x02009;=&#x02009;33,160) and the number of years research is assumed useful (10&#x000a0;years). EVPI can also be estimated for individual parameters (or for groups of parameters) contained in the model, termed partial EVPI or EVPPI. Five groups of uncertain parameters were considered: i) baseline mortality during the initial acute hospitalisation with SC; ii) clinical effectiveness of IVIG; iii) long-term mortality estimates for survivors of severe sepsis; iv) long-term costs for survivors of severe sepsis; v) quality of life for survivors of severe sepsis. The groups of parameters also reflect potentially different research designs. For example, while an RCT would ideally be required to further inform the clinical effectiveness of IVIG, evidence on the other parameters could be generated using record linkage of existing databases.</p><p>The EVPI estimates set an upper limit on the returns to further research. However, to fully inform the research decision, the most efficient research design also needs to be established, for example, the type of study, the optimal sample size, the appropriate duration of follow-up and appropriate end points. The same framework of analyses can be extended to establish the expected value of sample information (EVSI) for a particular research design. To obtain the societal payoff to the proposed research, the population EVSI needs to be compared with the costs of sampling: the difference between the EVSI and the costs of sampling gives the expected net benefit of sampling (ENBS). The ENBS provides a necessary and sufficient condition for deciding to conduct more research that is, if the ENBS is greater than zero for any sample size then the benefits of gathering the sample information exceed the costs, and further research is potentially justified. The ENBS also provides a framework for the efficient design of the clinical trial, where the optimal sample size, <italic>n</italic><sup><italic>*</italic></sup>, for the proposed trial is where the ENBS reaches its maximum. This optimal sample size thus indicates how many patients should be enrolled for the trial to provide the highest payoff.</p><p>All stages of the work were informed through discussions with an expert clinical advisory group who provided feedback on specific aspects of the analyses including the model structure, inputs and assumptions.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Decision model structure</title><p>A simplified schematic of the structure of the decision model is presented in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The model evaluated the lifetime prognosis of severe sepsis in order to capture the longer-term costs and consequences associated with the natural history in the absence of IVIG. The model structure considered two related elements reflecting short- and long-term consequences:<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

Baseline data from the CMPD were used to estimate the risk of acute hospital mortality associated with SC and the results of a systematic review of the clinical effectiveness of IVIG were applied to estimate the risk of acute hospital mortality associated with IVIG.</p></list-item><list-item><label>ii.</label><p>longer-term: conditional on having survived the initial acute hospitalisation, a Markov structure was used to characterise the long-term prognosis over the remainder of a patient&#x02019;s lifetime. Such a model represents disease progression by defining important mutually exclusive events/health states and characterising how patients may move between states over regular time intervals. Here, we used a simple structure to represent the possibility of patients being alive or dead (a survival model). Annual cycles were employed to reflect the annual probability of death for each year after the initial severe sepsis episode. Duration of stay alive or transition to death can be associated with a quality of life score and with costs incurred, allowing for long-term QALYs and costs to be evaluated. If IVIG reduces the risk of mortality during the initial acute hospitalisation period, then the use of this longer-term model will allow differences in long-term costs and QALYs to be translated.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The model was developed in the statistical programming package R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Clinical effectiveness of IVIG</title><p>Evidence on the effectiveness of IVIG was sought and used to inform the decision model and further analyses. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to inform the effect of IVIG in severe sepsis on all-cause mortality during the initial acute hospitalisation. Full details of the methods of the systematic review are reported in the full technical report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In summary, RCTs within a critical care setting that compared any standard polyclonal IVIG or immunoglobulin M-enriched polyclonal IVIG (IVIGAM) with either no intervention, placebo (usually albumin) or another standard polyclonal IVIG or IVIGAM preparation were considered eligible for inclusion. Studies were included if the majority of patients were aged &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years and clinical judgement deemed the population studied to have severe sepsis.</p><p>The primary outcome measure extracted was all-cause mortality, summarised on the odds ratio (OR) scale. Fixed- and random-effects meta-analyses were fitted using inverse variance weights. Heterogeneity was assessed using I<sup>2</sup>, and Cochrans Q test. Stata, version 11.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA), was used.</p><p>Heterogeneity was further explored comparing model fit from meta-regressions, estimated through Bayesian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] using WinBUGS version 1.4.3 (MRC Biostatistics Unit, Cambridge, UK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. More detail on the use of Bayesian methods in meta-analysis and evidence synthesis can be found in Sutton and Abrams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and in Spiegelhalter <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Results are presented using means and 95% credible intervals, 95%CrI (the Bayesian equivalent to confidence intervals) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The posterior mean residual deviance (Dres) was used to measure model fit and the deviance information criterion (DIC), a composite measure of model fit and model complexity, was used to choose between competing models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. For the random-effects models, the posterior mean of the between-study standard deviation (SD) parameter (&#x003c4;) was used to investigate the impact of the inclusion of the covariates on explaining (reducing) heterogeneity. Meta-regressions aimed to: i) identify key covariates responsible for heterogeneity; ii) consider more complex treatment models that compared different types and preparations of IVIG; and iii) adjust for potential confounding by considering combinations of covariates. The covariates evaluated related to: characteristics of treatments such as type and dose of IVIG; features of study design related to, or a proxy for, study quality (for example Jadad score - a composite measure ranging from 0 to 5 where 5 indicates best quality and sample size); setting; acute severity of disease; and follow-up period. Key covariates that explained some of the heterogeneity using model fit statistics (Dres, DIC and &#x003c4;) were identified. In addition, combinations of key potential covariates were explored to identify which of the covariates best explained the heterogeneity, after having adjusted for other covariates. Other treatment models were also explored, in which the type of IVIG preparation and type of control were not grouped together. All treatment and covariate models were compared using the model fit statistics (Dres, DIC and &#x003c4;). Results were reported for the best-fitting, competing models.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Other inputs of the decision model</title><sec id="Sec6"><title><italic>Baseline event rates for standard care</italic> (<italic>initial acute hospitalisation</italic>)</title><p>Data from the CMPD (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;26,249) were used to inform the baseline risk of acute hospital mortality applied to SC during the initial hospitalisation.

Three separate models were fitted including additional covariates for: age; APACHE II score at admission; and organ system dysfunction.

<sup>*</sup>With model M4 two cases were considered: for M4a, the sample size N was set equal to the maximum arm size in the studies in our review - avoiding extrapolation beyond the dataset; for M4b, sample size was set to infinity; this demonstrates the effect on model estimates of the absence of bias associated with study quality, here proxied by finite (and small) sample sizes.

For this reason, random-effects models with solely study quality covariates were also considered. The heterogeneity that can be explained with the dosing regimen covariates was left unexplained in these models, reflecting a belief that these covariates were a proxy for other, unmeasured, differences between the included studies. The results of a range of alternative models are presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> (Models M2 to M4b).</p><p>When the heterogeneity explained by duration of IVIG therapy in M1 was treated as unexplained (that is using a random-effects model, models M2 to M4b), the majority of results were fairly comparable and still showed a reduction in the odds of all-cause mortality in patients with severe sepsis treated with IVIG but the 95% CrI widened suggesting a larger degree of uncertainty. The only exception was model M4b, which reported an increase in the odds of all-cause mortality, albeit with very wide credible intervals. However, some caution should be applied to this result since it involves extrapolation beyond the available data. In the absence of a single best-fitting model that made clinical sense, sensitivity analyses were subsequently used in the cost-effectiveness modelling.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Other input parameters to the decision model</title><p>Model input parameters and uncertainty around their estimates are described in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> (and, in greater detail, in the full technical report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]). Briefly, the probability of dying during the initial hospitalisation was estimated from the CMPD to be 40.6% (95% CI 40.0%, 41.2%). With respect to the evidence on longer-term mortality, we initially investigated the plausibility of the different parametric predictions beyond the five years of observed data by comparing these to age-adjusted estimates from the general population (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). It was considered implausible that the longer-term mortality estimates for severe sepsis patients would become lower than that for the general population. Consequently, in the model, we further assumed that the probability of mortality would be the maximum of the predicted parametric distributions and the observed yearly probability of mortality for the general population (age- and sex-adjusted). The &#x02018;modified&#x02019; parametric survival functions are reported in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b.

Using an expected value of information framework, we established the value of collecting further information. Results show that a study collecting data on the relative effectiveness of IVIG (in comparison with standard care) appeared the most efficient research design to invest in. However, results on the value of conducting such research were also sensitive to the clinical effectiveness model used. Given that it was unclear what the clinical rationale for the effects explored was within each of the clinical effectiveness models and that the need for a further RCT exists, designing this study will be complex when uncertainties exist at this level.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Policy implications</title><p>Our study did not find evidence that current guidance on the use of IVIG should change (that is IVIG should not be recommended for use in severe sepsis, unless further evidence becomes available to support its use). Although the EVI analyses suggested substantial potential value from a large, multicentre RCT evaluating the clinical effectiveness of IVIG in this population, there remain significant uncertainties around the design of a study (with respect to, for example, the dose or duration of therapy with IVIG). Without greater understanding of the existing variation (for example through a smaller-scale dosing RCT), there is a danger of investing in a large trial that is suboptimal (for example including a number of different dosing regimens), which may be a less efficient use of resources than deferring a definitive trial until we better understand the existing variation. Thus, our current recommendations are for research that focuses on filling the knowledge gaps that exist with a view to informing the design of a future multicentre RCT. These recommendations include: (i) research on the mechanism(s) of action of IVIG in severe sepsis (and on understanding the heterogeneity of the severe sepsis syndrome) - commencing with a rigorous review of existing research prior to embarking on any new studies and; (ii) dose-ranging/finding studies to identify dose, timing of dose and safety data to inform the intervention(s).</p><p>In addition to clarifying the results on clinical effectiveness, it may be that research informing other parameters is also worthwhile, especially with respect to data on the longer-term survival and costs of severe sepsis. This research could be conducted using relatively cheaper, non-RCT designs, for example using record linkage between existing databases or conducting a prospective cohort study providing that the period for which patients are observed is sufficiently long enough to capture the impact on costs for several years after the initial episode.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study examined the evidence for the clinical effectiveness of IVIG in severe sepsis (including septic shock) and found significant heterogeneity (variation) between studies. An in-depth look at the potential sources for the heterogeneity identified publication bias and dosing regimen as possible explanatory factors. The rationale for the latter being a relevant factor was unclear, and for this reason we examined the implications of the existing heterogeneity and concluded it affected both the potential clinical and cost-effectiveness of this treatment and, hence, current recommendations for its use.</p><p>We assessed the value of a new, large, multicentre RCT to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of IVIG in this population and, while our analyses suggest that such research may be of value, there remains significant uncertainties around the design for such a study (with respect to, for example, the dose or duration of IVIG). We concluded that, prior to investing in a new RCT, further research is needed both into the mechanism(s) of action of IVIG and from a dose-ranging/finding study.</p><p>Our work illustrates the use of an explicit framework to quantify the value of investing in new research. This work also highlights that explicit consideration of the sources of heterogeneity in the current evidence base is key to informing the design of new research.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Key messages</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The effect of IVIG on mortality is associated with a large degree of heterogeneity between individual studies.
