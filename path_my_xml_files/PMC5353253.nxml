Between April 2001 and October 2005, 1.2 million women born between 1925 and 1955 were randomly invited from the age-sex registers of 27 participating primary care trusts. Women had to be postmenopausal (defined as either &#x0003e;12&#x02005;months amenorrhoea following a natural menopause or hysterectomy, or &#x0003e;12&#x02005;months of hormone replacement therapy started for menopausal symptoms) in addition to being aged 50&#x02013;74&#x02005;years at recruitment. Exclusion criteria included bilateral oophorectomy, previous ovarian malignancy, increased risk of familial ovarian cancer, active non-ovarian malignancy and participation in other ovarian cancer screening trials. A total of 288&#x02005;955 agreed to participate in the trial and 202&#x02005;638 eligible postmenopausal women were finally recruited through 13 regional trial centres located in National Health Service Trusts in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The trial design, including details of recruitment and randomisation, has been described in detail elsewhere, which also included the detailed CONSORT diagram.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> All women provided written consent.</p><p>At recruitment, all women completed an 18-item questionnaire. The recruitment questionnaire (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary data, appendix 1</xref>) captured data on demographics (ethnicity), reproductive factors (age at menarche, previous oral contraceptives use and duration, age at menopause), gynaecological procedures (tubal ligation, hysterectomy with ovarian conservation) and parity (number of pregnancies &#x0003c;6&#x02005;months which included miscarriages, abortions and ectopic pregnancies; number of pregnancies lasting over 6&#x02005;months) and infertility treatment. Age at menopause was derived from age at last period excluding those who had self-reported hysterectomy at recruitment with a subgroup analysis excluding those who reported HRT use at recruitment. Personal history of cancer and family history of breast or ovarian cancer were also captured. For the purposes of this analysis, the women were grouped according to year of birth into the following six cohorts: 1925&#x02013;1929, 1930&#x02013;1934, 1935&#x02013;1939, 1940&#x02013;1944, 1945&#x02013;1949 and 1950&#x02013;1955. In a subset of 144&#x02005;454 women who answered a postal follow-up questionnaire 3&#x02013;5&#x02005;years postrandomisation, information on education was also available.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2016-011822.supp1</object-id><label>supplementary appendix</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss1" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-011822supp_appendix1.pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Extreme biometric data values, which were almost certainly errors, were discarded to protect the analyses from their undue influence on statistical methods for continuous data. The data were logged and values that were more than 5 SDs from the mean were discarded. The mean and SD were then recalculated. This threshold rule was applied one more time using the recalculated summary statistics, before anti-logging the data back to the original metric. While this removed distorting values, it may also have excluded some genuine values that were simply extreme outliers as it was based on a statistical rule of deviation from the mean rather than a judgement on what constitutes an erroneous value.</p><p>Trends and differences in baseline characteristics such as age at menarche, age at menopause, oral contraceptives use, hysterectomy, tubal ligation, infertility treatment and parity were explored using tabular and graphical summaries with 95% CIs added to the latter. Formal tests for trends were not considered, as the trend was not linear for most variables. In addition, the large sample size resulted in almost all pairwise cohort-comparisons for each variable being highly significant even when adjusted for multiple comparisons.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>The data captured at recruitment were available for 202&#x02005;637 women as one woman asked for all her personal identifiers and associated data to be removed from the UKCTOCS database. All women were postmenopausal. The median age at completion of the baseline questionnaire (age at randomisation) was 60.6 (IQR 55.9&#x02013;66.2).</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Demographics</title><p>Except for the oldest birth cohort (1925&#x02013;1929), each of the remaining five cohorts included a minimum of 25&#x02005;000 women (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016011822TB1">table 1</xref>). The majority (96.4%; 195&#x02005;275) were white. When the women were separated into birth cohorts, there was an increase in the percentage of non-Caucasians in the younger compared to the oldest cohorts. However, it must be noted that the numbers in these groups were small (data not shown). About 40.0% of women in the oldest (1925&#x02013;1929) cohort reported no formal educational qualification compared with 19.1% in the youngest birth cohort. This was paralleled by a rise in those with a college/university degree from 14.6% (1925&#x02013;1929) to 29.5% (1950&#x02013;1955) (data not shown). About 6.0% had a personal history of cancer with breast cancer being the most common (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016011822TB1">table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2016011822TB1"

We found that in the UK, family size decreased in younger birth cohorts accompanied by an increase in oral contraceptives use. The initial increase in uptake of tubal ligation was not sustained. For women born between 1925 and 1955, increasing use of infertility treatments was not accompanied by a change in the proportion of nulligravid women. The hysterectomy rates were similar across the cohorts. Finally, we observed a decrease in the mean age at menarche. These changing trends directly contribute to a woman's exposure to endogenous and exogenous oestrogen and are likely to influence the incidence of hormonally dependent cancers.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>A major strength is the overall size with over 25&#x02005;000 women in each birth cohort except the earliest. Instead of self-referral, one in six women aged 50&#x02013;74&#x02005;years in the general population was randomly chosen from age-sex registers and sent a personal invitation to participate.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> While a healthy volunteer effect was noted in the cohort early on,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> this was not pronounced at the end of the trial with the mortality rate ratio between the control and screening arms being 0.99 for overall deaths and 1.00 for cancers other than ovarian/peritoneal.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> While the analysis is dependent on self-reporting which is affected by recall bias, especially in older women, the validity of self-reporting of these variables has been previously described in the literature<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;21</xref> including validation of self-reported hysterectomy in this cohort.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Scanning and checking of data entry reduced transcription error while the limited extent of missing data ensured that such records could be discarded without concern of bias. Furthermore, a strength of our data is that the narrowness of the CIs resulting from such a large sample means that any notable change in trend could be interpreted as a real difference and not random perturbation of the data.</p><p>A limitation is that this cohort consists of women who wished to participate in a randomised controlled trial of ovarian cancer screening. As a result, they are likely to be more health-conscious.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> About 96.4% were white compared with 92.1% in the 2001 census.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Additionally, we only captured limited data at recruitment and the need to keep the questionnaire brief meant that no details regarding oral contraceptives formulation, details of infertility treatment, age at childbirth or duration of breastfeeding were captured.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Interpretation</title><p>The mean age at menarche decreased from 13.4&#x02005;years for women born between 1925 and 1929 to 12.8&#x02005;years for those born in the later cohorts (1950&#x02013;1955), which is comparable to a recent British study, showing a decline in the mean age at menarche from 13.5&#x02005;years for women born between 1908 and 1919 to 12.6&#x02005;years for those born between 1945 and 1949.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Other studies have similarly reported a decline.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>

<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26&#x02013;28</xref> The two together are major determinants of endogenous hormone exposure, which is associated with osteoporosis, heart disease and cancer risk, as well as all-cause mortality.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>

<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> A recent meta-analysis of over 100&#x02005;000 women showed that the risk of breast cancer increased by lengthening of a woman's reproductive years and early menarche played a greater role than later menopause.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> While the women in the younger birth cohorts in our study had a lower age at menopause, this could be the result of the trial eligibility criteria that required women to be postmenopausal rather than a real effect of decrease in age at menopause in this group of women. It is possible that the length of the reproductive period may be a more important factor in predisposing a woman to risk of hormone-related cancers. Similar trends of earlier menarche and decrease in family size have also been reported for a large cohort of Chinese women.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>Oral contraceptives use was highest among women in the 1950&#x02013;1955 cohort with 85% reporting ever use. Since the &#x02018;pill&#x02019; was only discovered in the 1950s and approved for contraceptive use in the UK in 1961, women in the later birth cohorts may have had easier access to it. More importantly, changing social norms made its use more acceptable. By 1970, negative publicity surrounding the potential risks (mainly thrombosis) published in various British medical journals and newspapers may have influenced womens' decision against the use of oral contraceptives.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> However, we did not observe an impact within our cohort, as oral contraceptives use increased steadily. Overall, 60% had reported ever use, which is identical to the percentage of oral contraceptive users reported from the Million Women Study. A recent large US study on oral contraceptives and mortality found the prevalence of oral contraceptives use to be 48%, but the limitation of the US study is that it only included married women between the ages of 30&#x02013;55&#x02005;years.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>The increase in tubal ligation rates for women born until 1945 likely reflects the availability of the procedure and is most likely influenced by the change in ambulatory settings (inpatient to outpatient). However, the subsequent plateau may reflect increasing availability of other effective options for contraception. Overall, 19% underwent hysterectomy with conservation of at least one ovary. This is in keeping with a 20% hysterectomy rate at median age 60&#x02005;years reported by a UK study which reported that most of these women had undergone the procedure for benign conditions in their mid-40s.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> The UKCTOCS rates do not include hysterectomies where both ovaries were removed as such women were ineligible to participate. This may explain the lower rates compared with 25.1% noted in the Million Women Study. About 7.4% of women in the latter cohort had undergone bilateral oophorectomy.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> There were small fluctuations in hysterectomy rates across the birth cohorts, which most likely relate to changing attitudes to ovarian conservation during hysterectomy and increasing trends in conservative management of dysfunctional uterine bleeding and fibroids.</p><p>There was a trend towards larger families in those born prior to 1940 in keeping with the postwar era in the UK (1945&#x02013;1950) which saw sharp peaks in the total fertility rate during the 1960s Baby Boom.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> This was when women in the 1930&#x02013;1940 cohorts were of childbearing age. Later cohorts tended to have two children, reflecting increased availability of family planning methods, especially oral contraceptives and changing social attitudes towards female education and employment. Women seeking infertility treatment increased steadily in later birth cohorts as previously reported.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> This possibly reflects the increasing availability of infertility treatments. Despite this, the proportion of women who never conceived remained static across the birth cohorts, as success rates were low prior to introduction of in vitro fertilisation and embryo transfer.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></p><p>The changes described in reproductive and lifestyle factors are likely to contribute to changing incidence in hormone-related cancers such as breast, endometrial and ovarian cancer. For ovarian cancer, for example, incidence rates in Great Britain have increased by 28% between 1979&#x02013;1981 and 1997&#x02013;1999 and then decreased by 8%.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> To forecast impact, statistical modelling needs to take into account both factors that decrease incidence such as increasing oral contraceptives use in younger birth cohorts as well as those that increase incidence such as smaller families, earlier menarche, late menopause and increasing life expectancy.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>There were clear differences in the reproductive factors across birth cohorts in the UK, with later birth cohorts reporting a lower age of menarche, smaller family size and increased use of oral contraceptives and infertility treatments and a decrease in the age at menopause in those born after 1945. While the absolute rates cannot be extrapolated to the general population, the trends in this large cohort of women, although influenced by a &#x02018;healthy volunteer effect&#x02019;, most likely represent trends in the UK population. The changes in lifetime sex hormone exposure resulting from these changes could in part explain the trends in breast, endometrial and ovarian cancer incidence as well as other diseases such as osteoporosis, heart disease and neurodegenerative disorders. Further exploration of these trends could explain their more precise contribution to both disease incidence and mortality.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are particularly grateful to the women throughout the UK who have participated in the trial.
