A small proportion of South African women are screened for cervical cancer and an even smaller portion return for treatment of lesions <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. These low trends in cervical screening coupled with the high HIV prevalence likely explain why cervical cancer incidence is high in South Africa.</p><p id="p0010">HPV is a common infection among women worldwide and is the necessary cause of cervical cancer.

id="s0030"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0070">HPV seroprevalence for any of the 4vHPV types was 88%, indicating a very young age at HPV infection and a high prevalence of HPV in the underlying community. The majority of the participants (64%) had two or more 4vHPV antibodies present at enrollment and 12% of participants had antibodies to all four HPV genotypes (6/11/16/18). The latter women had not previously received the HPV vaccine, as confirmed by their relatively low antibody levels (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), which indicates that they acquired this immunity naturally. Within a relatively short period of time, 25% of women who did not receive vaccine seroconverted to at least one of the 4vHPV types during follow-up. Altogether these data suggest the need to vaccinate against HPV at an early age in this population of women at high risk for HPV and HIV in South Africa.</p><p id="p0075">Overall HPV seroprevalence to any of the 4vHPV types observed in the current study was four-fold higher than observed among women in the licensure trials for Gardasil (19.6%) <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. A bivalent Cervarix vaccine trial among South Africa HIV-negative women aged 18&#x02013;25 with six or fewer sexual partners reported an HPV16 seroprevalence of 63.6% and 50.0% for HPV18 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The difference in seroprevalence between the Cervarix trial and our trial may have been impacted by the different serologic assays that were used <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The serologic assay used in Cervarix vaccine trials, which is the ELISA assay for total IgG, results in higher percentage of seropositives than the serologic assay used in Gardasil vaccine trials which only measures the neutralizing component of IgG <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In addition to the differences by assay used, differences in cutoff values, and the comparison population will result in differences in seroprevalence estimates across studies <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p id="p0080">Not only was the seroprevalence high in this cohort of young South African women, but seroconversion in the placebo arm was surprisingly high in the 7-month time period. HPV infection clearance is mediated by cellular immunity and seroconversion to HPV which typically occurs 6&#x02013;18 months after infection <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In our cohort, women that were both seronegative and DNA negative at the cervix for HPV6, 23% seroconverted during the 7-month time period and the majority of those (7/10) did not have HPV 6 detected at the cervix at the 7-month visit. These seven women were likely either in the process of seroconverting at enrollment from an HPV6 infection that they previously cleared or they were infected with HPV6 during the interval between HPV testing, cleared the infection, and seroconverted by month 7. It is also possible that these women may have been infected with HPV at non-cervical sites and seroconverted to HPV based on those infections. The remaining three women that seroconverted to HPV6 had HPV6 detectable at the cervix at the 7-month visit. Several different scenarios may explain how this was possible. Perhaps the HPV infection was new and the antibody produced was not at a high enough level to prevent infection or the infection may have occurred in the period just before antibody was produced. Our study design limits our ability to determine which scenario occurred given that we only assessed HPV antibodies and DNA at two time points and that we only assessed HPV DNA at the cervix when HPV can infect other anatomic sites.</p><p id="p0085">Natural immunity with high antibody titers to HPV has been shown to partially reduce the risk for future HPV infections <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and precancerous cervical lesions <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Natural immunity to HPV among this cohort of women may prevent a proportion from acquiring new HPV infections and cervical lesions, but without effective screening in this low-resource setting, we cannot rely on natural immunity to protect these women. After we began our vaccine trial, the South African government initiated a school-based vaccination program for 9 year old girls in 2014 using the Cervarix HPV vaccine <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. This program should reach half a million school-aged girls and is currently reporting 91% coverage in the first round of vaccination <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p id="p0090">There are several strengths and limitations to the current study that need to be considered in interpreting the results. HPV DNA and HPV antibodies were only assessed at enrollment and at the 7-month visit; therefore it is unknown when a woman acquired the HPV infection compared to receiving each dose of the vaccine. The 4vHPV vaccine is prophylactic and there is no protective effect against clinical endpoints among women who were HPV DNA positive at the initiation of the vaccine series. In this current study where data are only available one month after vaccine completion, we cannot draw conclusions about clinical efficacy to prevent HPV infection, HPV-related disease or HIV. However, in numerous trials among women and men robust clinical efficacy, and long term duration of protection has been repeatedly demonstrated. We encountered comprehension issues in defining sexual activity that led to errors in questionnaire reporting. Therefore, we designed educational posters for participants mid-study, significantly improving the consistency of questionnaire responses. While HPV antibodies to conformational L1 epitopes are a marker of past HPV exposure, current HPV serologic assays underestimate the true lifetime exposure to HPV infection because not all persons that are exposed develop an antibody. Our findings may not be generalizable to all South African women and likely do not represent STI and risk conditions of women in other sub-Saharan countries.</p><p id="p0095">We were successful at implementing this vaccine feasibility placebo-controlled randomized trial in Western Cape, South Africa with high completion rates of the vaccine at 91%. All of the women that received the 4vHPV vaccine seroconverted to all four HPV genotypes. Women in this cohort not only have a high seroprevalence to HPV, but also have a high prevalence of HPV infections at the cervix (71%), other sexual transmitted infections with 33% having a chlamydia infection and 47% seropositive for Herpes Simplex Virus-2, and 12% having abnormal cervical cytology at trial enrollment <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. HPV vaccines are prophylactic and need to be administered prior to sexual debut to have the greatest effectiveness in preventing disease. Prevention of all STIs and cervical cancer screening needs to continue to be a public health priority in South Africa given that a large proportion of the population is outside of the HPV vaccine age group and will not receive the HPV vaccine.</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><title>Funding source</title><p id="p0100"><funding-source id="gs1">Merck</funding-source> (IISP39582) was the main sponsor of this trial and provided the study product.
