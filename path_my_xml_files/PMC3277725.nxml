However, there is limited evidence to show that eccentric exercises are more effective than other treatments in the management of tendinopathies. The exact mechanism involved in the eccentric exercises is unclear and there is an ongoing debate on the optimal load, frequency and duration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> It is suggested that eccentric training might stimulate remodelling and tissue repair in tendons, the so-called therapeutic mechano transduction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> The classical heel-drop exercise programme first described by Alfredson <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> is time-consuming (180 repetitions per day for 12 weeks). The majority of the published studies have a maximum follow-up of 1 year, and there is a lack of evidence about the long-term (&#x0003e;3 years) outcome.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> Three studies evaluated the long-term (&#x0003e;3 years) results of the eccentric exercises in chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> Only one study used the validated Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Achilles (VISA-A) questionnaire, but in that study the exercise regimen differed from that described by Alfredson <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> The VISA-A questionnaire is a validated score that measures pain and physical activity of the Achilles tendon.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> The test is developed to create an index of severity of Achilles tendinopathy.</p><p>So far, no long-term VISA-A score results (&#x0003e;3 years) are known of the widely used heel-drop programme according to Alfredson. We evaluated the long-term clinical outcome of the heel-drop programme as described by Alfredson with the VISA-A score as the primary outcome measure. We also evaluated the ultrasonographic improvement 5 years after conservative therapy, alternative treatments received, pain status and patient satisfaction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>This study is the 5-year follow-up of an earlier published randomised controlled trial (RCT).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> The RCT evaluated the effect of the addition of a night splint to eccentric exercises in patients with chronic Achilles tendinopathy. At baseline, 58 patients (70 tendons) with chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy were included. Inclusion criteria at baseline were the presence of symptoms for more than 2 months and participation in sporting activities. All patients in the trial preformed the heel-drop programme as described by Alfredson <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> Half of the patients additionally received a night splint. The night splint had no significant influence on the VISA-A score at the 3-month and 1-year follow-up; all patients were therefore merged into one group for the 5-year follow-up.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> After completion of the heel-drop programme, patients were free to choose additional treatment(s); no instructions or recommendations were given to the patients.</p><p>The study protocol was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Hospital (MEC05-21) and informed consent was given.</p><sec id="s3"><title>Follow-up</title><p>All patients were approached by telephone for the 5-year follow-up. At the outpatient clinic, each patient completed the VISA-A score questionnaire and received an ultrasound examination by a single researcher. The VISA-A score was completed with minimal researcher assistance. Secondary outcome scores were obtained using a standardised questionnaire: (1) pain status (pain-free, not pain-free), (2) condition of the uninvolved tendon (affected, not affected), (3) subjective patient satisfaction towards the current status (categorised in poor, moderate, good, excellent), (4) received alternative treatments after the heel-drop programme and, (5) continuation of the eccentric exercises (continued, stopped after the heel-drop programme).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Ultrasound examination</title><p>For ultrasound examination, patients were asked to lie prone with their feet hanging over the edge of the table. During the examination, both Achilles tendons were evaluated in the sagittal plane for thickness and neovascularisation according to the &#x000d6;hberg scoring system. This score was evaluated as 0 (no vessels visible), 1+ (one vessel mostly in the anterior part), 2+ (one or two vessels throughout the tendon), 3+ (three vessels throughout the tendon) and 4+ (more than three large vessels throughout the tendon). Two different power Doppler machines were used to examine the tendons: the MyLab25Gold (Esaote Piemedical, Maastricht, The Netherlands) and the BK Pro Focus (BK Medical, Herlev, Denmark). Both power Doppler machines used a frequency of 12 MHz, 0.5 PRF (pulse repetition frequency). The colour gain setting was optimised for low flow; putting the setting just below that level produces random noise, varying from 66% to 79%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Differences in VISA-A score and tendon thickness between baseline and follow-up were evaluated using a sample t test. Differences between two categorical variables were evaluated using a &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. Dependency analysis of the VISA-A score was performed using a non-repetitive analysis of covariance test. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software (SPSS 17.0) was used. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Results</title><p>Attempts were made to contact all 58 patients (70 tendons). Six patients (six tendons) were not reachable for follow-up and five patients (five tendons) refused to participate (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). Three out of these five patients reported having no or minimal complaints of the Achilles tendon; unfortunately, further details are unknown. The VISA-A score and questionnaire results were obtained from 47 patients (59 tendons): 12 bilateral and 35 unilateral. One patient (one tendon) was excluded from analysis due to a direct trauma to the Achilles tendon 2 days before the follow-up appointment, making the outcome non-representative. For general statistical analysis, 46 patients (58 tendons) were used. Five patients (six tendons) were not able to visit the hospital (no time or living abroad) but filled out the general questionnaire and the VISA-A score (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref> for details).

The VISA-A score increased significantly from 49.2 at baseline to 83.6 at the 5-year follow-up and from the 1-year follow-up to 5-year follow-up from 75.0 to 83.4 (p&#x0003c;0.01).</p><p>Until now the VISA-A score has only been used in one long-term follow-up study on eccentric exercises in Achilles tendinopathy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> Silbernagel <italic>et al</italic> reported a VISA-A score of 90.5 at 5-year follow-up, 65% of symptom-free patients and approximately 6% receiving alternative treatments. In their study, the training programme lasted from 12 weeks to 6 months and was performed under the supervision of a physiotherapist. Patients in the current study received very accurate instruction for the heel-drop programme and were instructed to do the exercises with pain. The compliance for the exercises was good/excellent in the majority of the patients (&#x0003e;70%).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> The basic population of Silbernagel <italic>et al</italic> showed many similarities with our population, however, no competitive athletes were included in the study of Silbernagel <italic>et al</italic>. Maffulli <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> suggested there could be a difference in response to eccentric training in the Scandinavian population. Several Scandinavian studies have demonstrated good/excellent short-term results from the eccentric exercises in the treatment of chronic Achilles tendinopathy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> In recent years, differing results have been found by non-Scandinavian studies showing only moderate short-term results.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> The long-term Scandinavian studies evaluating eccentric exercises in chronic Achilles tendinopathy suggest a good long-term prognosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> Further studies will be needed to reveal if there is a genetic explanation for this difference.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></p><p>Two other studies have reported long-term effects of the heel-drop programme used in this study in patients with Achilles tendinopathy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> However, neither of them used the validated VISA-A score. Ohberg <italic>et al</italic> showed that 22 of 25 (88%) patients were satisfied with the treatment at a mean follow-up of 3.8 years (range 1.6&#x02013;7.75). The second long-term follow-up study reported that 65% of the patients had no or mild pain after 4.2 years (range 29&#x02013;58 months).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> In our study, 39.7% of the study population was completely pain-free at the 5-year follow-up. Almost half of our patients had received one or more alternative treatments. These secondary subjective outcomes suggest a discrepancy with the significant increase of the primary outcome score. For advise to patients it implies that a quantified improvement can be expected, but mild remaining pain symptoms may be present at long term.</p><p>Ultrasonographic evaluation demonstrated a comparable decrease in tendon thickness from 8.8 mm before the heel-drop programme to 7.6 mm at follow-up. However, the clinical relevance of this minor decrease is questionable. In recent years, a debate has arisen about the meaning and the significance of neovascularisation in Achilles tendons. Some studies have found a correlation between the patient's symptoms and the degree of neovascularisation,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> and others found that the presence of neovascularisation did not per se indicate a disease state.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> Also the circumstances during the examination, for example, activity just before the measurement, was not controlled and is unknown. This study found that the VISA-A score was not related to the degree of neovascularisation. Further research is needed to understand the relevance of neovascularisation in Achilles tendons.</p><p>This study has some limitations. The 11 dropouts might have influenced the outcome. In a best case scenario analysis where the dropouts have the best outcome score, 50% of the patients would be pain-free. However, the value of this non-validated subjective outcome measurement is questionable. Patients had to answer questions concerning the last 5 years, which may have given recall bias. The long-term outcome could be influenced by the alternative treatments that the patients received after completion of the heel-drop programme. However, of the patients who did not receive alternative treatments, 56.7% were completely pain-free after 5 years. Robinson <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> recommended to use the VISA-A score in a homogenous group of athletes. Especially at long-term follow-up, the VISA-A score questionnaire can be subject to other influences than solely the symptoms of the Achilles tendinopathy. Factors like general ageing and new comorbidity may have influenced the outcome in this study. Finally, the ultrasonographic examinations at baseline and at follow-up were performed by different observers. However, in an earlier study, an excellent interobserver reliability of grading the neovascularisation was found.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></p><boxed-text position="float"><caption><title>What this study adds</title></caption><p>Patients with chronic Achilles tendinopathy treated with Alfredson's heel-drop exercise programme continue to improve, as measured by the VISA-A score, up to 5 years after completion of the programme.</p></boxed-text></sec><sec id="s14"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first study evaluating the 5-year results of the widely used heel-drop exercise programme as described by Alfredson <italic>et al</italic> with the validated VISA-A score.
