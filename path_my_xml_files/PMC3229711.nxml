The efficacy of initiating and titrating a single bolus dose of insulin glulisine to baseline insulin glargine plus oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHAs) was investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This was a 6-month, parallel-group, randomized, open-label, Phase IV study conducted in the US, UK and Russia. People with T2DM (HbA<sub>1c</sub> 7.5&#x02013;9.5%) using any basal insulin underwent a 3-month run-in period on insulin glargine titrated to optimize fasting blood glucose (BG) control. Those with HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003e;7.0% were randomized to either continue prior therapy (n = 57) or to add a single dose of insulin glulisine (n = 49) immediately prior to the main meal for a further 3 months. Two different titration algorithms were employed for the bolus dose, targeting 2-h postprandial BG &#x02264;135 mg/dL (&#x02264;7.5 mmol/l; Russia and UK) or pre-meal/bedtime BG 100&#x02013;120 mg/dl (5.5&#x02013;6.7 mmol/l; US).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>HbA<sub>1c</sub> and fasting plasma glucose levels decreased during the run-in period.

Rates of hypoglycaemia and mean weight change were comparable between the treatment groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In people with T2DM inadequately controlled on basal insulin plus OHAs, adding a single injection of insulin glulisine prior to the main meal significantly improves glucose control without undesired side effects.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>basal insulin</kwd><kwd>basal-plus</kwd><kwd>rapid-acting insulin</kwd><kwd>type 2 diabetes mellitus</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Over time, the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) requires progressive adjustment of therapy to achieve and maintain adequate glycaemic control in an attempt to reduce the risk of vascular complications. The American Diabetes Association (ADA)/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) consensus statement suggests beginning pharmacotherapy with metformin or, in cases of metformin intolerance, with either a sulphonylurea or a thiazolidinedione, as needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>]. If, subsequently, individual or combinations of oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHAs) are no longer adequate, introducing insulin therapy in the form of an &#x02018;intermediate-acting&#x02019; or &#x02018;long-acting&#x02019; (basal) insulin is amongst the next options. The Treat-to-Target Trial showed that initiation and systematic titration of insulin glargine using a simple algorithm enables a majority of individuals to achieve an HbA<sub>1c</sub> level &#x0003c;7% with low rates of hypoglycaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>].</p><p>The next therapeutic step has been much debated, the leading options being (i) cessation of basal insulin and substitution with twice-daily injections of premixed (rapid-acting plus longer-acting) insulin preparations, or (ii) progression to a basal&#x02013;bolus insulin regimen by continuing basal insulin and adding injections of rapid-acting insulin prior to each meal as required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>]. Recognized limitations of the first option include limited flexibility in insulin dose adjustment resulting in the need for relatively strict lifestyle changes, more frequent hypoglycaemia, and greater weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>]. The second option is limited by the inconvenience of more frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose (BG) to guide dose titration and the potential need for multiple preprandial (three to four) daily injections. A third alternative is to continue basal insulin and prior OHA therapy and add a single prandial insulin injection prior to an individual's main meal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>]. Evidence for the efficacy and safety of this latter strategy remains relatively limited. Here, we report a multicentre, multinational, &#x02018;proof-of-concept' study of this sequential approach using two different algorithms for introducing and titrating the prandial insulin dose.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Eligible individuals for this study were men or women with T2DM, aged 18&#x02013;75 years, with a body mass index of 25&#x02013;45 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, an HbA<sub>1c</sub> level of 7.5&#x02013;9.5% and treated with a basal insulin (neutral protamine Hagedorn [NPH] insulin, lente insulin, insulin glargine or insulin detemir) in combination with metformin (&#x02265;1 g/day) for more than 3 months. Exclusion criteria included type 1 diabetes, current or anticipated pregnancy; treatment with OHAs alone (including thiazolidinediones) or exenatide, pramlintide or any other insulin preparation (i.e. premixed or short-acting insulins). Individuals with proliferative retinopathy or clinically relevant cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, neurological, other endocrine or major disease were also excluded. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and institutional review board/independent ethics committee approval was obtained for each participating study centre.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>This 6-month, parallel-group, randomized, open-label, Phase IV study was conducted at 12 sites in the UK, 17 in the US and four in Russia. It included an initial 1- to 2-week screening phase followed by a 3-month run-in period and a 3-month randomized treatment period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">figure 1A</xref>). There were 11 face-to-face visits at weeks &#x02212;2 (selection), 0 (study entry), 2, 4, 8, 10 (randomization), 12, 14, 16, 20 and 24 (final visit), plus telephone contact at weeks 1, 3, 6, 13, 15, 18 and 22.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>(A) Study design and (B) patient disposition. OHA, oral hypoglycaemic agent; V, visit.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="dom0013-1020-f1"/></fig><p>During the run-in period, patients were transferred from their prior basal insulin (if other than insulin glargine) to insulin glargine, which was titrated seeking to achieve a fasting BG target of &#x02264;100 mg/dl (&#x02264;5.5 mmol/l) using the Treat-to-Target Trial algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>]. At the end of the run-in period, individuals whose HbA<sub>1c</sub> remained &#x02265;7.0% were randomized (1 : 1), using an interactive voice response telephone system, either to continue their current therapy (basal-only group) or to add one dose of insulin glulisine prior to their main meal (basal-plus-bolus group). Both treatment strategies were continued for a period of three additional months (randomized treatment period).</p><p>Titration of the prandial dose of insulin glulisine was performed once a week using one of two different algorithms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In the UK and Russia, insulin glulisine dose adjustment was based on the 2-h, postprandial BG with a target of &#x02264;135 mg/dl (&#x02264;7.5 mmol/l), whereas in the US the target was a pre-meal BG level of 100&#x02013;120 mg/dl (5.5&#x02013;6.7 mmol/l) following the main meal, or at bedtime if the main meal was dinner. The main meal was defined as the meal resulting in the highest postprandial BG value determined from a seven-point daytime BG profile (before and 2 h after each meal, and at bedtime) conducted on three separate days in the week prior to the randomization visit. The timing of insulin glulisine administration was kept constant throughout the 3-month randomized treatment period. Mean daily BG was calculated as the mean of the seven-point BG profiles performed before each visit and variability was characterized by the standard deviations for the mean BG values.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Insulin glulisine dose titration</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1"><bold>Russia and United Kingdom</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1"><italic>Calculation of the initial dose of insulin glulisine for the first injection:</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Dose of insulin glulisine prior to the main meal = PPBG of the main meal in mmol/l divided by 2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Treat to target: PPBG &#x02264;135 mg/dl (7.5 mmol/l)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PPBG &#x02264;135 mg/dL (7.5 mmol/l)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No change</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">135 mg/dl (7.5 mmol/l) &#x0003c;PPBG &#x02264;153 mg/dl (8.5 mmol/l)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+1 U</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">153 mg/dl (8.5 mmol/l) &#x0003c;PPBG &#x02264;80 mg/dl (10 mmol/l)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+2 U</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PPBG &#x0003e;180 mg/dl (10 mmol/l)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+3 U</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">At the discretion of the investigator, small decreases of 1 U of the dose of insulin glulisine are permitted in case of hypoglycaemia</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1"><bold>United States</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1"><italic>Calculation of the initial dose of insulin glulisine for the first injection:</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">6 U prior to the main meal.

Additional analyses for the primary outcome and change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> were also performed for the per-protocol population (PPP), a subset of the mITT population that excluded patients with a major protocol violation. The incidence and rates of hypoglycaemia and occurrence of adverse events were analysed in the safety population, comprising all treated patients. A chi square (<italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup>) test was used to compare the percentage of patients with HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c; 7% at endpoint. Analysis of covariance was used for continuous variables, with treatment used as the fixed effect and baseline value as a covariate. Missing data were imputed by carrying the last observation forward.</p><p>At least 98 patients were needed to be randomized (49 in each arm) in order to demonstrate with 80% power that the addition of a single injection of insulin glulisine prior to the main meal would bring over 40% of patients inadequately controlled with insulin glargine alone plus OHAs to an HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c; 7% compared with 15% of patients continuing insulin glargine only plus OHAs (5% alpha risk, two-sided test). A final sample size of 196 patients was calculated by estimating that &#x0223c;50% of patients would probably not be eligible for randomization having achieved an HbA<sub>1c</sub> level &#x0003c;7.0% during the 3-month run-in period or due to exclusion for other reasons.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Participant Disposition</title><p>Patient enrolment commenced on 9 July 2006 and follow-up of the last patient was completed on 20 August 2008.

During the randomized treatment period, 20 (40.8%) and 28 (49.1%) subjects in the basal-plus-bolus and basal-only control groups reported an adverse event, respectively. Four adverse events during the treatment period were considered to be serious, of which two were in the basal-plus-bolus group (angina pectoris and atrial fibrillation) and two in the basal-only group (scleroderma and tendon disorders). There were no deaths reported during the study.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>These results show that the addition of a single dose of insulin glulisine prior to the meal with the greatest postprandial glucose excursion to ongoing basal insulin glargine plus OHAs significantly improved glycaemic control in terms of mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels. Mean daily PG levels, variability in mean daily PG and the diurnal PG profile were also improved with the basal-plus-bolus strategy versus basal only. Improved glycaemic control was achieved without significant increases in the frequency of hypoglycaemia or weight gain. The findings of this study are consistent with those of the Orals Plus Apidra and LANTUS (OPAL) study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>] in which one injection of insulin glulisine added to insulin glargine plus OHAs significantly improved HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels in people with T2DM, irrespective of whether the prandial insulin was administered at breakfast or at the main meal. The important difference between this and the OPAL study is that the present study had a run-in period to dose titrate insulin glargine prior to the addition of a single dose of insulin glulisine in individuals with inadequate glycaemic control whilst on insulin glargine plus OHAs.</p><p>Both fasting hyperglycaemia and increments of glucose after meals contribute to overall glycaemic exposure. After improvement of fasting hyperglycaemia with basal insulin therapy, much of the remaining glycaemic exposure is due to postprandial excursions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>]. Therefore, when HbA<sub>1c</sub> remains higher than 7% after fasting glucose has been normalized or nearly normalized with basal insulin, further improvement requires attention to postprandial hyperglycaemia. The potential benefits of limiting glycaemic excursions may extend to reducing cardiovascular risk from reduced glycaemic variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>]. The ADA/EASD consensus statement recommends that attempts to intensify insulin therapy should be undertaken if HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels remain above target on a basal insulin-only regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>]. However, methods to achieve this treatment intensification have not been fully investigated. In clinical practice, the main approaches are to either add short-acting insulin at each meal (basal&#x02013;bolus) or switch to twice- or three-times-daily premixed insulin regimens. Both approaches are relatively complex. Individuals and clinicians may experience difficulties in optimizing multiple insulin doses while avoiding hypoglycaemia thereby necessitating frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose. It is likely that the well-documented delay in advancing therapies (clinical inertia) results in part from these complexities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>].</p><p>The findings in this proof-of-concept study suggest that a strategy of adding a single prandial insulin injection to basal insulin may offer a more logical initial step for the intensification of insulin therapy in T2DM. The overall reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> was relatively small, but was achieved in just 3 months of treatment, and without accompanying difficulty with hypoglycaemia or weight gain. This method might be most effective for individuals whose HbA<sub>1c</sub> values are only modestly above the 7.0% target, perhaps in the 7.0&#x02013;7.5% range. In the present study population, participants had been on insulin for at least 2 years, and their mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> level was 8.5% at enrolment and 7.9% at randomization, so that relatively few attained the &#x0003c;7.0% goal. However, this first step in introducing prandial insulin therapy may provide a starting point for advancing to full basal&#x02013;bolus treatment for those needing further intensification given individual clinical requirement based on diabetes duration, age and risk of macrovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>].</p><p>As a proof-of-concept study, this study has several limitations. The number of patients enrolled was relatively small, and the relatively short period of use of basal plus prandial therapy probably underestimated the potential glucose lowering that might have resulted had dose-titration and follow up continued beyond 3 months. The clinical results with the two algorithms employed were not clinically or statistically different. There was a trend in favour of the US algorithm, but the numbers of participants studied were too small to permit a conclusion on this point. In addition, assignment of the algorithms depended on country of residence rather than randomization and so any comparison may be open to bias due to country-specific factors. Further studies are necessary to adequately compare these two algorithms.</p><p>In conclusion, this study clearly supports the rationale, safety and efficacy of adding a single dose of insulin glulisine to ongoing insulin glargine plus OHAs to improve HbA<sub>1c</sub> and mean daily plasma BG when HbA<sub>1c</sub> targets have not been met. This approach may serve as the first logical step from basal insulin plus OHA therapy to a more intensive insulin regimen in the quest to achieve glycaemic targets that are appropriate for clinical needs without requiring a full basal&#x02013;bolus regimen, with its inherent demands on the individual and their carer.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank the medical staff and patients who participated in the study.</p><p>This study was supported by sanofi-aventis, and editorial support for preparing the manuscript was provided by Huw Jones, PhD, Medicus International and funded by sanofi-aventis.
