The phase 3, open-label, randomized DASISION trial (NCT00481247), comparing dasatinib 100 mg once daily (QD) (<italic>n</italic> = 259) with imatinib 400 mg QD (<italic>n</italic> = 260) in newly diagnosed chronic phase CML (CML-CP), included a sizeable East Asian population (<italic>n</italic> = 60: dasatinib; <italic>n</italic> = 48: imatinib). In East Asian patients, dasatinib showed favorable 24-month rates of major molecular response (68% vs. 50% for imatinib) and complete cytogenetic response (92% vs. 88%), and more patients achieved BCR&#x02013;ABL1 transcript levels &#x02264; 10% at 3 months with dasatinib (91% vs. 69%), similar to the overall population. Relative to non-East Asian patients, the incidence of rash, fluid-related events and grade 3/4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia appeared to be higher in East Asians, regardless of treatment. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed statistically non-significant increased dasatinib exposure among East Asian patients. Results support the use of dasatinib 100 mg QD as first-line CML treatment in both East Asian and non-East Asian patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>CML</kwd><kwd>dasatinib</kwd><kwd>imatinib</kwd><kwd>East Asian</kwd><kwd>first-line treatment</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="ss1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dasatinib is a BCR&#x02013;ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which is 325-fold more potent compared with imatinib, <italic>in vitro</italic>. Dasatinib has inhibitory activity against the majority of BCR&#x02013;ABL1 mutations associated with clinical resistance to imatinib [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In the phase 3 DASISION trial (Dasatinib Versus Imatinib Study In Treatment-Naive Chronic Myeloid Leukemia), patients with newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP) were randomized to receive first-line treatment with either dasatinib 100 mg once daily (QD) or imatinib 400 mg QD. After a minimum 12-month follow-up, dasatinib showed superior efficacy compared with imatinib, including higher rates of complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) (83% vs. 72%; <italic>p</italic> = 0.001) and major molecular response (MMR) (46% vs. 28%; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001), and an acceptable safety and tolerability profile [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Results after a minimum 24-month follow-up are consistent with the 12-month findings [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Dasatinib was approved as a first-line therapy for CML-CP based on DASISION trial results. Recent exploratory analyses of DASISION data showed that dasatinib provided faster, deeper responses compared with imatinib, and BCR&#x02013;ABL1 transcript level reduction at 3 months was predictive of 36-month progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Asian patients with CML have different characteristics compared with patients from other regions. There is a lower incidence of CML in Asia (0.4&#x02013;0.9 vs. 1.5 per 100 000 population) than in the United States, and Asian patients with CML tend to be younger (median age at diagnosis of 36&#x02013;55 years vs. 65 years) and have smaller body size [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref>]. A recent report suggested that a proportion of East Asian patients with CML harbor a genetic polymorphism that confers resistance to imatinib [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This polymorphism, a common intronic deletion in the gene encoding BCL2-like 11 (BIM), has not been identified in non-East Asian patients with CML. Previous studies have suggested that the efficacy and toxicity profiles of imatinib in Asian patients are comparable to those observed in Western patients [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, in clinical practice, imatinib doses lower than the recommended 400 mg QD dose are often prescribed to Asian patients. This is due, in part, to concerns relating to drug-induced toxicity and tolerability in Asian patients, who have a lower body surface area compared with their Western counterparts [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Studies of dasatinib in the second-line setting have shown that dasatinib safety and efficacy are similar in Asian and non-Asian patients. A pooled analysis of several single-arm clinical studies found that dasatinib efficacy and safety profiles were similar in Asian and non-Asian patients with CML (all phases), although among patients with CML-CP, Asian patients showed a trend toward higher response rates compared with non-Asians [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters for dasatinib in Asian and non-Asian patients with prior imatinib therapy were also similar [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In a phase 1/2 trial of Japanese patients who had resistance or intolerance to imatinib, efficacy and safety findings for dasatinib were comparable to data from multinational trials [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>East Asians represent a significant percentage of the world population, and there are increasing numbers of East Asians in American, European and Australian cities [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The phase 3 DASISION trial is one of few global multicenter CML trials with a sizeable East Asian population [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. To determine the efficacy and safety of dasatinib 100 mg QD versus imatinib 400 mg QD in East Asian patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP, DASISION trial data were analyzed after a minimum 24-month follow-up. In addition, PK parameters for dasatinib were examined in East Asian and non-East Asian patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="ss2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="ss3"><title>Study design and patients</title><p>DASISION (CA180-056; NCT00481247) is an ongoing open-label, multinational, randomized, phase 3 trial testing dasatinib versus imatinib in patients with CML-CP diagnosed within 3 months who had no previous treatment for CML (excluding anagrelide or hydroxyurea).

However, the very small number of East Asian patients with high Hasford scores makes it difficult to compare response rates in these patients.</p><table-wrap id="T2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table II.</label><caption><p>Major molecular response (MMR) by 24 months according to Hasford risk groups.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" colspan="4" rowspan="1">East Asian patients (<italic>n</italic> = 108)<hr/></th><th align="center" colspan="4" rowspan="1">Non-East Asian patients (<italic>n</italic> = 411)<hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Dasatinib (<italic>n</italic> = 60)<hr/></th><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Imatinib (<italic>n</italic> = 48)<hr/></th><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Dasatinib (<italic>n</italic> = 199)<hr/></th><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Imatinib (<italic>n</italic> = 212)<hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Patients according to risk score, <italic>n</italic></th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Responders, <italic>n</italic> (%)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Patients according to risk score, <italic>n</italic></th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Responders, <italic>n</italic> (%)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Patients according to risk score, <italic>n</italic></th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Responders, <italic>n</italic> (%)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Patients according to risk score, <italic>n</italic></th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Responders, <italic>n</italic> (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">MMR</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Low Hasford score</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">23</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">20 (87%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">25</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 (40%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">63</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">41 (65%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">62</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">37 (60%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Intermediate Hasford score</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">32</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">20 (63%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">20</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">12 (60%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">92</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">56 (61%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">103</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">46 (45%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;High Hasford score</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (20%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (67%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">44</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">27 (61%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">47</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">13 (28%)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>At 24 months, both East Asian and non-East Asian patients had high rates of PFS (dasatinib: 98% vs. 92% for East Asian vs. non-East Asian; imatinib: 98% vs. 91%) and OS (dasatinib: 98% vs. 94%; imatinib: 98% vs. 95%), as well as similar rates of transformation to accelerated phase/blast phase (AP/BP) CML (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Results</xref> to be found online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/10428194.2013.866663">http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/10428194.2013.866663</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="ss10"><title>BCR&#x02013;ABL1 mutational analyses</title><p>BCR&#x02013;ABL1 mutation assessment of patients who discontinued identified 20 patients with mutations (10 dasatinib and 10 imatinib), including three East Asians (two dasatinib [both T315I], one imatinib [E355G]).

In East Asian patients compared with non-East Asian patients, a similar efficacy advantage was seen for dasatinib over imatinib, including higher rates of CCyR and MMR at 12 and 24 months, MR<sup>4.5</sup> by 24 months and BCR&#x02013;ABL1 transcript levels &#x02264; 10% at 3 months. The advantage of achieving 3-month BCR&#x02013;ABL1 levels &#x02264; 10% on long-term outcomes has been shown in retrospective exploratory analyses of DASISION [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and imatinib studies [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;18</xref>]. CCyR and MMR rates in both treatment arms were 5&#x02013;8% higher among East Asian patients compared with non-East Asian patients. Although fewer East Asian patients had a high Hasford risk score compared with non-East Asian patients (6&#x02013;8% vs. 22%), this trend does not explain higher response rates seen in East Asian patients. East Asian patients with low or intermediate Hasford risk scores had higher MMR rates compared with non-East Asian patients with similar risk scores and receiving the same treatment. One exception appeared to be in imatinib-treated patients with low Hasford scores, which occurred at a higher rate in non-East Asian patients. During available follow-up, few East Asian patients have transformed to AP/BP CML, and rates of PFS and OS were similar for dasatinib compared with imatinib, and slightly higher than in non-East Asians. Since differences in response rates between East Asian and non-East Asian patients are small, further investigation is required to confirm these trends. Longer follow-up is needed to determine whether higher response rates for dasatinib versus imatinib will translate into improved long-term outcomes. A minimum 5-year follow-up is planned for the DASISION trial. For the potential differences in efficacy suggested by response rates, CI ranges overlapped in all cases, indicating that interpretations should be viewed with caution. Moreover, the study was not designed or powered to test differences between subpopulations.</p><p>Of the small number of patients for whom mutation data were available, three East Asian patients had BCR&#x02013;ABL1 mutations, two receiving dasatinib and one receiving imatinib. These patients had similar reasons for discontinuation as observed in non-East Asian patients with mutations. Previous publications have reported that &#x002dc;30&#x02013;60% of imatinib-resistant patients with CML-CP have BCR&#x02013;ABL1 mutations: 54/198 (27%) Italian patients [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; 44/134 (32.8%) US patients [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; 28/111 (35.7%) Korean patients [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]; and 40/70 (57.1%) Chinese patients [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Safety profiles for East Asian and non-East Asian populations were largely consistent with previous findings [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], both in categories of AEs observed in &#x0003e; 10% of patients, and in specific AE rates showing differences between dasatinib and imatinib arms. For both populations, most AEs were low grade and most occurred during the first 12 months. Although the strength of the conclusions is limited by the East Asian sample size, this analysis suggests that compared with non-East Asians, East Asian patients may have a higher incidence of grade 3/4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, low-grade fluid-related AEs including pleural effusion, and rash. Potential higher rates of specific AEs in the Asian population may be associated with increased exposure to dasatinib and the higher median age in the dasatinib arm of the East Asian subpopulation. Similar AEs have been observed in Japanese patients receiving dasatinib in non-study settings with myelosuppression and pleural effusion indicated as the most common AEs associated with second-line dasatinib therapy for CML (all phases) or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph + ALL) after imatinib failure [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Larger studies would be needed to fully explore whether certain AEs are truly more or less frequent in East Asian patients receiving a particular treatment.</p><p>Previous analyses have shown that cases of pleural effusion occurring during the DASISION trial were generally manageable by dose modification (interruption and/or reduction) with or without medical intervention (steroids and/or corticosteroids, and/or diuretics, with thoracentesis in occasional cases), and resulted in few discontinuations [<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Despite the higher rate of pleural effusion observed among East Asian patients compared with non-East Asian patients (24% vs. 10%), occurrence of pleural effusion did not appear to impact the efficacy of dasatinib in either East Asian or non-East Asian patients, consistent with previous reports indicating no significant correlation between pleural effusion and outcome [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>PK analysis was used to explore the hypothesis that higher rates of AEs in the East Asian population could be attributed to higher dasatinib exposure due to the mean body weight in East Asian patients being 5 kg lower than in non-East Asian patients. The PK analysis showed that although mean C<sub>minSS</sub>, C<sub>maxSS</sub> and AUC<sub>SS</sub> were all &#x0003e; 30% higher in East Asian patients compared with non-East Asian patients, there was still considerable overlap in the distributions of exposure (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), and no statistical differences were seen. Furthermore, exposure parameters did not show a correlation with body weight (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Figures 1 and 2</xref> to be found online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/10428194.2013.866663">http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/10428194.2013.866663</ext-link>). Given the high variability in the exposure results, however, larger populations need to be analyzed to confirm the relationship between body weight and exposure and the comparison of exposure parameters between East Asian and non-East Asian patients. A larger population would also be needed to explore whether higher exposure may contribute to a trend toward better response and higher incidence of certain AEs in East Asian patients.</p><p>Despite higher rates of certain AEs, overall rates of discontinuation for any reason, including drug-related AEs and treatment failure, were slightly lower in East Asian patients compared with non-East Asian patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table I</xref>), suggesting that AEs were manageable and did not impact efficacy. However, given the few East Asian patients who discontinued, the trend toward lower discontinuation rate needs confirmation, and could be influenced by the lower proportion of patients with high Hasford risk score.</p><p>In a previous comparison of Asian and non-Asian patients with imatinib resistance or intolerance treated with second-line dasatinib at a dose of 70 mg twice daily, no differences were seen in efficacy and safety results and PK profiles [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Patients in the present analysis received a different dasatinib dose (100 mg QD). Furthermore, the present analysis includes a larger population of dasatinib-treated Asian patients with CML-CP (60 vs. 13), a greater number of whom were available for PK analysis (59 vs. 4). Also, the patients had a more homogeneous disease profile in this study (all patients had newly diagnosed CML-CP, whereas in the previous analysis patients with several different disease phases were included), and were treated in a first-line setting (patients in the previous analysis were treated in a second-line setting). These factors help to explain any potential differences in findings. In this study, imatinib-related AE rates were also higher in the East Asian subpopulation, suggesting that PK levels of imatinib might be higher in the East Asian population compared with the non-East Asian population. Unfortunately, PK analysis was not performed for the imatinib arm, as the necessary samples were not collected.</p><p>Overall, findings from analysis of the DASISION 24-month data provide further support for use of dasatinib 100 mg QD as first-line treatment for patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP, in both East Asian and non-East Asian patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the patients who participated in this Bristol-Myers Squibb-sponsored study and acknowledge the efforts of study staff at the investigational sites.
