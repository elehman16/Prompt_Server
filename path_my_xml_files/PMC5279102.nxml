We incised the skin and subcutaneous tissue according to the anatomy of the great saphenous veins from groin to ankle with several intervals to avoid dysfunction of the joint caused by a linear scar. The great saphenous veins were peeled, branches were ligated, and grafts were finally harvested. All operations were performed by the same Surgical group and Anesthesia group. All patients were treated in the same operation room and intensive care unit. A second generation cephalosporins was given half an hour before the operation to prevent infection, and discontinued 72&#x0200a;hours after surgery. We closely monitored the blood sugar of patients during the perioperative period. The postoperative blood glucose was well controlled well in all patients with hypoglycemic therapy.</p></sec><sec><label>2.5</label><title>Implementation of b-NPWT</title><p>The b-NPWT developed by our department was manually implemented as follows: a drainage tube was inserted in the bottom of the wound after harvesting of the great saphenous veins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A, B). Sterilized gauze pads (3.5&#x0200a;cm thick) were placed on the surface of the skin after the incision was directly closed by suturing. The gauze coverage was 2.5 to 3.0&#x0200a;cm over the incision line in width bilaterally. A second drainage tube was placed over the gauze pad (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C). After another 3 to 5 layers of gauze were applied over the second drainage tube, and the system carefully sealed with the skin using an adhesive film.

Our previous study showed that a manually implanted bilayered NPWT system was effective for a long-term poorly healed postmastectomy seroma.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> This system produced a dynamic constant local pressure and constant fluid discharging simultaneously, steadily minimizing the regional dead space and promoting wound healing. This led us to test a similar system for complication control in the saphenous vein donor site after bypass surgery using a single center randomized controlled trial (RCT).</p><p>This short pilot study successfully provided important support for postoperative morbidity prevention after bypass surgery by the application of b-NPWT. Compared with the control group, wound related complications were significantly reduced in the thighs of the treatment group. Furthermore, control was also preset in the shank of the treatment group since the general risk of complications is much higher in the groin region than in the lower limb due to lymph circulation. Several patients (4/32) who developed severe complications, including lymphorrhagia and wound dehiscence, in the shank of the treatment group, and the thigh incision healed uneventfully under b-NPWT. This statistically significant difference in the same patient who received the same medical care provides meaningful support for this therapy. We find the protective effect of b-NPWT only occurs within the suction coverage area, and supports our hypothesized mechanism of b-NPWT, that it mainly relies on the physical pressure and discharge of abnormal fluid.</p><p>An important controversy regarding NPWT is the lack of high-quality research evidence regarding its clinical and cost effectiveness.<sup>[<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> This clinical trial demonstrated the efficacy of a novel modification of NPWT in problematic wound protection. Moreover, this method does not rely on hydrophobic foam media, which is required in commercial NPWT system.<sup>[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> All components of b-NPWT were clinically available, and such a treatment would not increase the economic burden of the patients. Because wound complications only occurred in a fraction of total patients and were notable to clinicians for signs of abnormal fluid seeping and inflammation, we propose this method for patients after harvesting of the great saphenous veins because previously it has been used to successfully treat various complications following similar incisions.</p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study showed that a self-designed b-NPWT was a helpful treatment for reducing leg incision complications in CABG patients. More cases should be collected or a multiple-center study needs be initiated in the future to further evaluate the best indications of this method for other similar problems.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: b-NPWT = bilayered negative pressure wound therapy, CABG = coronary artery bypass graft, C-shank = control shank, C-thigh = control thigh, mmHg = millimetre(s) of mercury, RCT = randomized controlled trial, SAS = statistic analysis system, T-shank = treatment shank, T-thigh = treatment thigh.</p></fn><fn fn-type="equal"><p>Yongchao Yu and Zhigang Song have contributed equally to this work.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>KB</given-names></name><name><surname>Lim</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
