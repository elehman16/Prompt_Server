In the United States, there is no approved medication for the long&#x02010;term treatment of chronic pain in cats, despite the clear need for such a treatment.</p><p>Currently, the nonsteroidal anti&#x02010;inflammatory drug(NSAID) meloxicam is approved in Europe for use in treating chronic pain in cats, but has not been approved for this use in the United States. There are concerns about the use of NSAIDs for long periods of time in cats, especially because the majority of cats presenting with DJD&#x02010;associated pain have evidence of chronic kidney disease.<xref rid="jvim13972-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> Because of these concerns, dosages lower than the European&#x02010;approved dosage of meloxicam have been tried, and there are several suggestions from open&#x02010;label studies that these lower dosages are effective in the management of DJD&#x02010;associated pain in cats.<xref rid="jvim13972-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13972-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> Only one blinded, placebo&#x02010;controlled study assessing a dosage lower than the approved 0.05 mg/kg daily dosage has been performed, and that study found that a dosage of 0.035 mg/kg daily produced measureable improvement over a 3&#x02010;week period of administration.<xref rid="jvim13972-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13972-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> Indeed, only 2 placebo&#x02010;controlled, masked, clinical studies of the efficacy of meloxicam in cats have been published.<xref rid="jvim13972-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13972-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13972-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>

Using a proprietary technique for interspecies conversion of antibodies based on expressed cDNA sequence analysis (PETization<sup>&#x02122;</sup>) Nexvet Biopharma developed a novel therapeutic fully felinized anti&#x02010;NGF mAb (named NV&#x02010;02) for the alleviation of pain in cats.<xref rid="jvim13972-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>
</p><p>We hypothesized that a single SC dose of anti&#x02010;NGF antibody would alleviate pain and improve mobility for up to 6 weeks. Improvements would be able to be detected by owners and reflected in objectively measured activity. The primary objective of this pilot study was to assess the overall <italic>efficacy potential</italic> of SC administered NV&#x02010;02 in improving owner&#x02010;evaluated mobility and activity and increasing objectively measured activity counts in cats with DJD as compared with placebo. Secondary objectives were to (1) assess the overall <italic>duration</italic> of SC administered NV&#x02010;02 in improving owner&#x02010;evaluated mobility and activity and increasing objectively measured activity in cats with DJD&#x02010;associated pain compared with placebo over an 11&#x02010;week period (2 weeks pretreatment baseline, 9 weeks posttreatment); (2) to determine the relative efficacy potential and optimal dosage of NV&#x02010;02 using 2 dosage groups; and (3) to assess the adverse effects associated with NV&#x02010;02 in cats beyond preliminary investigations in laboratory cats.</p><sec id="jvim13972-sec-0008"><title>Methods and Materials</title><p>This study was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol # 14&#x02010;043&#x02010;O) at North Carolina State University College of Veterinary Medicine (NCSU&#x02010;CVM), and written owner consent was granted in each case after verbal discussion of the study.

Outcome measures included changes in owner ratings and changes in activity (as measured by accelerometry) after treatment with the active drug or placebo. Additionally, adverse events, including changes in clinical pathology assessments, were evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="jvim13972-sec-0010"><title>Animals</title><p>Animals enrolled in the study were all client&#x02010;owned cats with naturally occurring DJD&#x02010;associated pain and mobility impairment. Subjects were recruited using a combination of advertising directly to owners and to veterinarians. All study&#x02010;related activities were performed at zero cost to the owner. We also employed ideas on recruitment and incentives identified recently on owners' attitudes to clinical studies involving cats.<xref rid="jvim13972-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="jvim13972-sec-0011"><title>Prescreening</title><p>Owners either emailed or telephoned in response to advertisement and outreach. The study and requirements were explained to them, with a focus on the requirements that the cats be indoor only, able to wear a collar with the activity monitor on it, and be impaired in at least 3 activities. Owners were questioned about whether they had any upcoming life changes, such as moves, new babies, new pets, or extended vacations. Suitable cases were scheduled for visits to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital.</p></sec><sec id="jvim13972-sec-0012"><title>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</title><p>Eligibility criteria were similar to previous DJD&#x02010;associated pain studies in cats performed by our program.<xref rid="jvim13972-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> Cats were eligible to participate in the study if they had a qualifying degree of owner&#x02010;noted mobility or activity impairment (described in the next section), evidence of pain during manipulation of at least 2 joints or spinal segments during veterinary orthopedic evaluation (discussed in <italic>Orthopedic evaluation</italic> section), and radiographic evidence of DJD in at least 2 of the painful joints or spinal segments (discussed in <italic>Radiographic evaluation</italic> section). Cats were required to be &#x0003e;1 year old and weigh more than 1 kg. Predetermined exclusion criteria for all cats included the presence of suspected or diagnosed infectious diseases, symptomatic cardiac disease, immune&#x02010;mediated disease, neoplasia, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infection, hyperthyroidism, and diabetes mellitus. These conditions were ruled out using review of the referring veterinarian's medical records, owner history, physical examination, CBC, serum biochemistry panels, T4 testing, and urinalysis. Cats with chronic kidney disease (CKD) up to and including IRIS stage 2 were eligible to enroll, provided the disease was stable as determined by repeated serum biochemistry panels and urinalyses. Cats with CKD of IRIS stage 3 or 4 were excluded from participating in the study.</p></sec><sec id="jvim13972-sec-0013"><title>Owner Evaluation of Mobility Impairment</title><p>During the screening interview, owners were asked to identify 3 activities that their cat showed impairment in performing as described previously.<xref rid="jvim13972-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> These 3 items then were used to construct the client&#x02010;specific outcome measures (CSOM) assessment and used for subsequent study assessments. Owners rated their cat's ability to perform each activity on a Likert scale ranging from 4 (no problem) to 0 (impossible) with intermediate values of 3 (mild difficulty), 2 (moderate difficulty), and 1 (severe difficulty). Owner ratings were converted to numerical scores, and the total CSOM score was the sum of these 3 scores with a possible range of 0&#x02013;12. In order to ensure that cats enrolled in this study were sufficiently impaired by the DJD&#x02010;associated pain (as rated by their owners), cats were eligible for inclusion if they received an owner&#x02010;rated score of &#x02264;5 on day 0 (lower numbers indicating greater impairment). Owners completed the CSOM without knowledge of the cutoff for inclusion.</p></sec><sec id="jvim13972-sec-0014"><title>Orthopedic Evaluation</title><p>Orthopedic evaluations were carried out as previously described<xref rid="jvim13972-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13972-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13972-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> and were performed by a single veterinarian (MG), with a single assistant (AT). Joints were designated a pain score before radiographs were taken and evaluated. As previously described,<xref rid="jvim13972-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> a total pain score was calculated as the sum of all the individual appendicular joint and axial skeletal segment pain scores.</p></sec><sec id="jvim13972-sec-0015"><title>Radiographic Evaluation</title><p>Cats meeting eligibility criteria for owner&#x02010;noted mobility or activity impairment and pain on orthopedic evaluation were sedated, and orthogonal radiographs were taken of every joint and spinal segment.

Randomization of treatment occurred in groups of 3, and the randomization key was held by pharmacy staff. The dispensing of treatment or placebo was performed by pharmacy staff, with all personnel involved in data collection being masked to the treatment given. For balance, cats were stratified by higher or lower impairment based on CSOM score for randomization (CSOM 0, 1, 2 = high impairment; CSOM 3, 4, 5 = low impairment), but not analyzed separately. The randomization code and allocation of cats to NV&#x02010;02 or placebo was only made known to investigators once the data had all been entered and quality control checked by personnel not directly involved in the study (Clinical Studies Core).</p></sec><sec id="jvim13972-sec-0017"><title>Masking</title><p>A preloaded syringe was placed in a brown, light resistant plastic bag labeled with the case number, name, and instructions &#x0201c;Give NV&#x02010;02 OR placebo by SC injection once.&#x0201d; The prescribing veterinarian and the quantity (mL) also were listed on the label. The syringe and contents were allowed to reach room temperature for 1 hour, and the injection was given by a veterinary technician not associated with the study (Clinical Studies Core personnel). Each cat was restrained by AT, who was required to turn her head away as the treatment or placebo was being administered.

The expected duration of efficacy of NV&#x02010;02, if seen, was thought to be 4&#x02013;6 weeks.

If adverse events (AE) occurred, owners were instructed to take their cat immediately to the NCSU&#x02010;CVM Emergency Service or their local emergency veterinary clinic. Adverse events were defined as any observations in the cat that were unfavorable and unintended and that occurred during the study, whether they were considered to be treatment related. A serious adverse event (SAE) for this study was defined as any AE that was either fatal or life&#x02010;threatening, required professional intervention (by a veterinarian), and considered by the investigators to be clinically serious.</p></sec></sec><sec id="jvim13972-sec-0028"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><sec id="jvim13972-sec-0029"><title>Sample Size Estimation</title><p>This study was designed as a pilot study, and a formal power analysis was not conducted because anti&#x02010;NGF antibodies had not been used in cats previously, and the expected difference between treatment groups, therefore, could not be estimated.

Activity data analyses were performed comparing each group (T1 and T2) to placebo.

These counts were averaged for each week to generate a single data point (mean activity per minute) for each cat over each week. Baseline activity was defined as the mean activity count per minute over the first 2 weeks of the study for each cat, before treatment. Values of mean activity count per minute were used to calculate the change from baseline for each week of the study posttreatment (weeks 3&#x02013;11) for each cat. These data were analyzed using a repeated&#x02010;measures ANOVA, including a week &#x000d7; week interaction because the collection of activity data continued for longer than the expected duration of efficacy of NV&#x02010;02.

Repeated laboratory testing 2&#x02013;3 months later showed stable but increased serum creatinine concentrations.

The deformity or mass had been present as the cat was a kitten, was of unknown cause, and had not changed over time. On the day 77 visit, the owner reported that the cat had been hiding more and showing decreased appetite progressively over the past 10 days. The cat had lost 0.72 kg body weight since the start of the study and showed azotemia, hyperglobulinemia, and leukocytosis with a left shift on the day 77 laboratory results.

In a recent study of meloxicam (blinded, placebo&#x02010;controlled; 2&#x02010;week baseline, 3&#x02010;week treatment)<xref rid="jvim13972-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> conducted by our group, the mean increase in activity compared to baseline period was 5.97% over the first 3&#x02010;week period of daily treatment with meloxicam (0.035 mg/kg daily) compared with 2.65% increase over the same time period for cats treated with placebo. The percentage increase in activity from baseline in the treatment group found in the present study (9.3% over the first 3 weeks) compares very favorably with the 0.035 mg/kg meloxicam study.</p><p>The meloxicam study was a full cross&#x02010;over study, and if both periods of meloxicam treatment are included, the mean increase in activity above baseline (where baseline was the period just before each treatment) for a 3&#x02010;week treatment period was 9.45%, and the difference between treatment and placebo phases for changes in activity was 10.62%, favoring meloxicam. As noted above, in the current NV&#x02010;02 study, the mean increase in activity from baseline in the treatment group was 9.3% and the difference between placebo&#x02010;treated and NV&#x02010;02&#x02010;treated cats over the first 3 weeks after treatment was 12.9%. This comparison shows that a single injection of NV&#x02010;02 produces increases in activity in cats that is the same or greater than the increase in activity produced by daily administration of 0.035 mg/kg of meloxicam. There are no other placebo&#x02010;controlled studies measuring activity in client&#x02010;owned cats with which to compare the current study.</p><p>Despite a high caregiver placebo response (60% over the first 3 weeks after treatment, using success/failure criteria), the owner&#x02010;completed client&#x02010;specific subjective assessment system (CSOM) clearly detected a treatment effect, with a significant difference between total scores 3 weeks after treatment and also a significant difference for change in CSOM scores over the first 3 weeks after treatment. The effect size (CI) based on CSOM was 0.74 (&#x02212;0.02 to 1.50), which compares with &#x02212;0.35 (&#x02212;0.98 to 0.28) seen with 0.035 mg/kg of meloxicam.<xref rid="jvim13972-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> The FMPI scores showed similar trends, but the delineation between placebo and treatment groups was less obvious. The FMPI has undergone evaluation in several studies and was found to be readable and reliable,<xref rid="jvim13972-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13972-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> but it did not show responsiveness in 1 study using relatively small numbers of cats.<xref rid="jvim13972-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> The FMPI did, however, show some responsiveness and criterion validity (using activity monitors) in a larger study using meloxicam.<xref rid="jvim13972-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13972-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> The CSOM has detected treatment effects over placebo, but only in our most recent, larger NSAID study using meloxicam,<xref rid="jvim13972-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13972-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> and a small pilot study using highly impaired cats.<xref rid="jvim13972-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> More work is needed to develop owner assessment outcomes or study designs that can robustly distinguish treatment from placebo and show criterion validity. One of the frustrations in the development of owner&#x02010;completed assessment tools is that it is not known if the analgesics (NSAIDs thus far) being used in the development of the subjective tools actually work. We believe that the efficacy seen in our current study was such that it may be the best currently available treatment with which to refine the owner assessment tools; however, the effect of differences in administration routes (oral versus injectable) and frequency of administration (once versus daily) must be taken into account.</p><p>In our study, the duration of effect appeared to be about 6 weeks, based on objectively measured activity. This is similar to the duration of efficacy of 0.2 mg/kg IV in dogs<xref rid="jvim13972-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> of at least 4 weeks, although in the study with dogs, assessments were not performed beyond 4 weeks. In studies of humans, duration of efficacy appears to be somewhat dose dependent,<xref rid="jvim13972-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> with 100 and 200 &#x003bc;g/kg showing efficacy for up to 8 weeks, although the efficacy at 8 weeks appeared to have decreased compared with that at 4 weeks.<xref rid="jvim13972-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref> Reported duration of efficacy depends somewhat on the design of the study and at what intervals outcome measures are collected. We designed this study such that measures of activity would be collected beyond the expected duration of action, giving us the ability to report on the duration of efficacy. We believe that the potential impact in veterinary medicine of an injection lasting approximately 6 weeks for the control of long&#x02010;term pain in the cat is very positive and clinically relevant.</p><p>Toxicity is an obvious concern, especially for novel therapeutics. In studies of humans treated with anti&#x02010;NGF antibodies, reported AEs appear to be generally mild, but, as with efficacy, dose related.<xref rid="jvim13972-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13972-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> Most AEs that seem to be related to NGF antibodies appear to be related to transient changes in sensation.<xref rid="jvim13972-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> In our study with dogs, no evidence of neurologic AEs was seen<xref rid="jvim13972-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> although the study was not powered to evaluate AEs. Subsequently, we have found no effect on sensation in dogs using quantitative sensory threshold (QST) testing (unpublished observations). In this study, no neurologic AEs were seen. In the 1 cat that suffered a decrease in renal function, we found no evidence of any relationship with the monoclonal antibody treatment, given the current body of knowledge. There are no reports of renal toxicity related to anti&#x02010;NGF treatment in any species, but this will obviously remain a concern in cats given the high prevalence of chronic kidney disease in cats.<xref rid="jvim13972-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> Larger studies, including repeated administrations of treatment, are required to fully assess the safety of NV&#x02010;02 in cats. Since the preparation of this report, USAN have adopted the non&#x02010;proprietary name frunevetmab for anti&#x02010;NGF mAB NV&#x02010;02.</p></sec><sec id="jvim13972-sec-0036"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Positive treatment effects in cats with DJD&#x02010;associated pain and mobility impairment were seen with the administration of a single SC injection of NV&#x02010;02, a felinized anti&#x02010;NGF antibody. These positive effects lasted up to 6 weeks, measured by objective activity evaluation. NV&#x02010;02 appears to offer great promise as a treatment for long&#x02010;term pain alleviation in cats with chronic DJD&#x02010;associated pain. Further clinical studies are warranted.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="jvim13972-sec-0037"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors acknowledge Lyndy Harden of the NCSU&#x02010;CVM Clinical Studies Core for performing quality control on the data.
