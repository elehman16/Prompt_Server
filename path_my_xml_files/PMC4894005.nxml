Blepharospasm, which presents with abnormal eyelid closure, is caused by dystonia of the eyelids. In the clinic, blepharospasm is typically diagnosed by excluding any secondary diseases and neuropsychiatric disorders because of the unavailability of specific tests for blepharospasm. Usually, differential diagnosis can be performed easily by observing the symptoms, but sometimes the differences are difficult to identify because of the complicated symptoms of blepharospasm (Roberts et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Hara et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). For example, in a previously encountered case, we administered an edrophonium injection to a patient with abnormal eyelid closure and diplopia, which resulted in improvement of the diplopia, but amplification of the abnormal eyelid closure. Complications of myasthenia gravis (MG) and blepharospasm were suspected in that case. Eyelid closure dysfunction in MG is related to abnormal functioning of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle due to deficient cholinergic transmission at the neuromuscular junction, while in blepharospasm, eyelid closure dysfunction is due to the strong involuntary contraction of the orbicularis oculi muscle.</p><p>In MG, the administration of edrophonium induces acetylcholine release, which then improves the symptoms. Thus, the edrophonium challenge test has been established as a diagnostic tool for MG. However, involuntary contraction of the orbicularis oculi muscle occurs due to blepharospasm or hemifacial spasm among other disorders. Although the clinical symptoms of hemifacial spasms resemble the symptoms of blepharospasm, the causes differ. Therefore, identifying the underlying causes of the spasms can help clinicians make an accurate diagnosis.</p><p>Edrophonium chloride is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor with a rapid onset (approximately 30 s) and short duration (approximately 5 min). Suppression of dysfunctional eyelid closure by edrophonium is used to diagnose MG (Pascuzzi, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Edrophonium is hydrophilic, with a limited capacity to cross the blood&#x02013;brain barrier. In addition, edrophonium is rapidly excreted by the kidneys, suggesting limited direct efficacy in the central nervous system (Back and Calvey, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1972</xref>; Calvey et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1976</xref>; Gemmill et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>). However, in our case, blepharospasm was amplified after administering the edrophonium injection, which suggests that edrophonium may be used to diagnose blepharospasm.</p><p>For the medical treatment of dystonia, Balash and Giladi concluded that high doses of trihexyphenidyl (anticholinergic agent) are effective, especially in the treatment of segmental and generalized dystonia in young patients (Balash and Giladi, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Because it has been reported that anticholinergic agents improve the symptoms of dystonia, if the dysfunctional eyelid closure is caused by blepharospasm, then the symptoms may be made more apparent by edrophonium.</p><p>In this study, we examined whether an edrophonium challenge test would be useful for diagnosing blepharospasm. To accomplish this, we examined the clinical symptoms of 10 cases of blepharospasm after administering edrophonium injections. We also administered physiological saline as a control and examined cases with hemifacial spasms as a disease control.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>The study included 10 patients with blepharospasm (2 men and 8 women; age range, 34&#x02013;77 years; mean [standard deviation] age, 65.1 [11.9] years) and 10 patients with hemifacial spasms (4 men and 6 women; age range, 46&#x02013;78 years; mean [standard deviation] age, 65.3 [9.1] years), who constituted the control group (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). All participants were examined by a single movement disorder specialist (Shinichi Matsumoto), who performed general physical and neurological examinations, laboratory tests, and brain magnetic resonance imaging in order to exclude other causes of dystonia, including birth injury and head trauma. The patients with a history of heart disease and arrhythmia were excluded from participating in the study for their safety. All subjects underwent a 12-lead electrocardiogram examination and a chest X-ray before the study to exclude the presence of cardiac disease.

Before and after the injection, we recorded the clinical symptoms with a video camera to assess the objective signs every 2 min (each video was 1 min long).

We found that the symptoms changed the most around 8 min after edrophonium administration. For this reason, we chose to evaluate the 1-min videos that were acquired at 8 min after administration. We presented videos of &#x0201c;before and after injection of A or B&#x0201d; as a set. We randomly presented the &#x0201c;before and after injection of A or B&#x0201d; videos for blepharospasm and hemifacial spasm.</p><p>We used a modified VAS (mVAS) to evaluate the pre-administration baseline, which was set at 50 mm (midline); amelioration and exacerbation of symptoms were indicated by lower and higher numbers on the mVAS, respectively. The Jankovic score is often used to evaluate blepharospasm (Jankovic et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>) and consists of 5 stages for both the frequency score and the severity score. However, clinically, the difference between the frequency score and the severity score was not clear, thus it really only evaluated five levels instead of 10. Because the Jankovic score was not suitable for evaluating the fine changes in blepharospasm after the edrophonium injection, we used the mVAS for the evaluations. In addition, because hemifacial spasms cannot be evaluated using the Jankovic score, we required another evaluation method.</p><p>The final control and drug mVAS scores for each patient were the sum of each specialist's score. The VAS and mVAS scores were measured from the right side, with a higher score indicating symptoms that were more severe.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Mean VAS and mVAS scores were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test for paired continuous variables.

The relative values were also compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test for paired continuous variables. All statistical tests were two-sided, and <italic>P</italic>-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS statistical software (version 11.0 for Windows; IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>No serious muscarinic side effects such as bronchospasm and bradycardia were observed in this study.

Both the subjective and objective signs of blepharospasm were amplified by edrophonium administration; in contrast, the signs of hemifacial spasm did not change after edrophonium administration. Moreover, typical muscarinic side effects were observed in all patients with blepharospasm. Collectively, these findings suggest that this challenge test may help to distinguish focal eyelid dystonia from other abnormal eye closing syndromes.</p><p>We also found that both the subjective and objective relative values were significantly higher in blepharospasm than they were in hemifacial spasm. Thus, comparing symptoms at the time of the saline injection may result in a more accurate diagnosis.</p><p>Edrophonium is a strong cholinergic drug; therefore, side effects such as bradycardia can occur following its administration. When conducting this study, we performed tests to exclude patients with heart disease, hence no serious muscarinic side effects were observed.</p><p>However, unlike the patients with hemifacial spasm, typical muscarinic side effects (increased sweating, lacrimation, and salivation) were observed in all patients with blepharospasm within the first minute. It has been reported that dystonia is caused by a mismatch between motor and sensory signals. The strong reaction against the edrophonium and the typical side effects that were observed following edrophonium administration may be signs of dystonia.</p><p>As mentioned previously, eyelid closure dysfunction is caused by abnormal functioning of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle or involuntary contraction of the orbicularis oculi muscle. In particular, abnormal functioning of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle is due to muscle disease, neuromuscular junction disease, or peripheral nerve disease. Our diagnoses are based on the results of blood tests, brain imaging studies, and electrophysiological tests. Since the edrophonium test has been established for diagnosing MG, we also examined patients with MG using the protocol of this study. However, we only examined three cases, because performing the edrophonium test in these patients takes longer than usual. We found that these three cases showed a tendency to improve following the edrophonium test (data not shown), similar to the results of previous studies (Juel and Massey, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, involuntary contraction of the orbicularis oculi muscle occurs due to blepharospasm or hemifacial spasm. We did not observe changes in the symptoms of patients with hemifacial spasm. There is now considerable evidence that primary hemifacial spasms are, in almost all cases, related to the vascular compression of the facial nerve at its root exit zone from the brainstem (Abbruzzese et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Cholinesterase inhibitors have been shown to improve the symptoms in patients with neuromuscular junction disorders, but they do not act on peripheral nerve diseases. Therefore, for patients with hemifacial spasms, it was predicted that the symptoms would not change, which is not contradictory to our findings. These results suggest that the edrophonium challenge test is helpful for distinguishing blepharospasm from bilateral hemifacial spasm.</p><p>The obvious symptoms induced by edrophonium are indirect proof that the anticholinergic drug is effective in patients who are edrophonium responders. It has been reported that eyelid closure improved following edrophonium injections that were administered for complications of MG and blepharospasm (Funakawa et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>). In this case, the symptom improved by administering cholinergic drugs. Further research is necessary to establish whether the patients in whom the symptoms became obvious by edrophonium would respond to anticholinergic agents or not.</p><p>Multiple forms of dystonia are associated with genetic mutations, but the pathogenesis of sporadic dystonia is usually unclear. Abnormal plasticity in the basal ganglia (BG) is believed to be important to disease etiology, and acetylcholine is a critical neuromodulator in the BG (Peterson et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). There are two possible sites of action for edrophonium: the central nervous system (including the BG) or the peripheral nerves (Jankovic, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p><p>Edrophonium is hydrophilic and has limited capacity to cross the blood&#x02013;brain barrier. In addition, edrophonium is rapidly excreted by the kidney, suggesting limited direct efficacy in the central nervous system (Back and Calvey, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1972</xref>; Calvey et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1976</xref>; Gemmill et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>). It has been reported that edrophonium mitigates allodynia in an animal model of neuropathic pain, suggesting changes in afferent fiber transmission to the spinal cord that could in turn alter central sensor<underline>i</underline>motor integration (Hwang et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). The effects of edrophonium on the neuromuscular junction and autonomic ganglia have been studied, but those on the central nervous system have not been studied. In this study, dystonia became obvious 4&#x02013;8 min after the edrophonium injection was administered, while the symptoms of MG improved within 1 min. This delay suggests that the effects of edrophonium on blepharospasm are centrally mediated by changes in afferent input.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that the edrophonium challenge test is helpful for distinguishing blepharospasm from hemifacial spasm. Using the edrophonium challenge test can help reduce misdiagnoses and improve treatment efficacy.
