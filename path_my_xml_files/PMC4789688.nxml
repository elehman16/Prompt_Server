<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> or academia.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;6</xref> Notable examples of initiatives to collect behavioural data using mobile technology are the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI)-funded Patient-Centered Clinical Outcomes Research Networks, National Institutes of Health (NIH's) Precision Medicine Initiative, and Apple's Research Kit. Indeed, the use of smart technology appears to be a clear avenue to increase research participation.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Mobile technologies may be particularly useful in improving participant access to and reducing expenses of randomised clinical trials (RCTs). Typical RCTs cost millions of dollars and recruit 200&#x02013;300 participants in 3&#x02013;5&#x02005;years.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Sample demographics are determined by the location of the research institution, limiting the representativeness of many RCT samples. Expense and access problems are exacerbated when trying to study populations who are challenging to recruit, such as those with mental illnesses, people living in rural areas or racial/ethnic minority populations.</p><p>One solution to overcome access and cost issues has been the use of the internet to conduct randomised control studies. These trials are beneficial from the cost perspective, with estimated cost reductions of more than 50% compared with conventional trials,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and from the access perspective, these studies recruit very large samples in short periods of time.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> However, retention issues are particularly problematic for internet studies, with one recent internet-based trial reporting a drop-out rate of over 90% in a sample of 3000 individuals.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Drop-out is likely due in part to the need to access a WiFi connection and dependence on an immobile device (eg, a desktop computer). A potential advantage to research using mobile devices (smart phones and tablets) is that data can be collected anywhere at any time. These devices also facilitate passive data collection such as Global Positioning System (GPS) information from the phone's accelerometer and media usage to gauge social and physical activity that can supplement self-reports. However, while mobile technology may be able to further expand the reach of clinical research, this approach has yet to be tested.</p><p>The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of conducting a fully remote RCT using smart devices in depressed adults 18&#x02005;years old and older. We elected to study depression as our clinical focus given its ubiquitous presence in mental illnesses and disability.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> It is the leading cause of disability worldwide,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and the enrolment of depressed individuals into clinical trials is difficult.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>

Traditional methods were written ads placed in city buses, newspapers and Craigslist postings throughout the USA. Social networking methods included regular postings on sites such as Facebook and Twitter, and contextual-targeting methods to identify and directly push recruitment ads to potential participants, based on their Twitter and other social media comments. Our search engine-based method included using Google Adwords, a historically successful recruitment tool.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Each approach (described further in see online <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://innovations.bmj.com/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1136/bmjinnov-2015-000098/-/DC1">supplementary materials</ext-link>) provided potentially interested participants a link to our custom study website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.brightenstudy.com">http://www.brightenstudy.com</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participant eligibility</title><p>Participants had to speak English, be 18&#x02005;years old or older, own a smartphone (iPhone or Android) with WiFi or 3G/4G capabilities, and own an iPad2 or newer device. iPad ownership was required as our cognitive assessment tool was only available on this device at the time of the study. To characterise recruiting logistics without this restriction, individuals without an iPad but with a smartphone were given the opportunity to participate in phone-only study arms that were not part of the randomised sample. A Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9),<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> score of 5 or greater, or a score of 2 or greater on PHQ item 10 (indicating that they felt disabled in their life because of their mood), was also required for enrolment.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Procedure</title><sec id="s2c1"><title>Screening</title><p>Potential participants were directed to a website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.brightenstudy.com">http://www.brightenstudy.com</ext-link>) explaining the study purpose and procedures.

Eligibility was established after consent was obtained.</p></sec><sec id="s2c3"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Participants were randomised to one of three treatment arms where they viewed a brief video explaining how to download and use the assessment and assigned treatment app. Participants were also given a link to view a custom dashboard of their study progress.</p></sec><sec id="s2c4"><title>Treatment</title><p>Participants were asked to use their assigned app for 1&#x02005;month.

The first app, developed by Ginger.io&#x02122; was used to collect self-reported mood, function and passive analytics such as communication data (text logs including call/text time, call duration, text length and screen usage), and mobility data (activity type and distance travelled using the phone's accelerometer and GPS). The second app was a mobile cognitive assessment app (Adaptive Cognitive Evaluation (ACE)), to measure cognitive control processes (see online supplementary etable 1). Participants were automatically notified every 8&#x02005;h for 24&#x02005;h if they had not completed a survey within 8&#x02005;h of its original delivery. An assessment was considered missing if it was not completed within this 24&#x02005;h time frame.</p><p>The baseline assessment included the collection of demographics including age, race/ethnicity, martial and employment status, income, education, smart device ownership, use of other health apps, and use of mental health services, including use of medications and psychotherapy. We collected information on mental health status using the PHQ-9<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> for depression, the generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)-7,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> for generalised anxiety, a four-item mania and psychosis-screening instrument<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and the four-item <italic>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) Alcohol Screening Test.</italic><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> To assess for self-reported disability, we used the Sheehan Disability Scale.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> We also asked participants to rate their health on a scale of excellent to poor.</p><p>Daily assessments were a combination of self-report and passive data collection. Participants completed the PHQ-2 (mood and enjoyment) every morning. The Ginger.io app collected passive analytics daily. Private information such as actual content of voice calls or text messages or emails was not collected.</p><p>The 4-week, 8-week and 12-week assessments included the PHQ-9 to measure changes in mood, ACE for changes in cognitive control, and the Sheehan for changes in disability. Participants were also asked this question: &#x02018;since using this app, I feel that I am: (1) much worse, (2) worse, (3) no different, (4) improved, (5) much improved&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec id="s2c6"><title>Payment</title><p>Randomised participants were paid a total of $75 for completing all assessments over the 12&#x02005;weeks via Amazon gift vouchers, while participants in the phone-only arms were paid $45 as they did not complete the cognitive assessment. To test if increased payment led to increased adherence and retention, a subset of participants (n=144) were given $75 in bonus pay if they completed all assessments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Procedures to reduce gaming</title><p>&#x02018;Gaming&#x02019; is a situation where a user fraudulently enrols in a study solely to acquire research payment. We utilised the following safeguards to prevent this: (1) locking the eligibility survey if a participant tried to change a submitted answer, (2) using study links that are valid for one user/device, and (3) tracking IP addresses to minimise duplicate enrolment.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>To assess participant <italic>access</italic>, we describe the sample demographics, clinical characteristics and sample comorbidities using the appropriate descriptive statistics. To assess participant <italic>engagement</italic>, we examined the proportion of study drop-outs and the proportion of enrolled individuals who responded to the primary mood outcome measures at each time point using a mixed-model analysis of variance (with Greenhouse-Geisser corrections when needed). To calculate time to drop-out, we tested a survival analysis model with the distribution of the &#x02018;survival&#x02019; times for those assigned each app estimated and non-parametric estimates of the survivor function computed by the Kaplan-Meier method, with curves tested using the log-rank test using Stata V.14.0. We also examined whether there was a significant difference in drop-out rates among the three interventions using Pearson's &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. Pairwise log-rank tests were conducted to determine where there were significant differences between the distributions, and a Bonferroni correction was set at p&#x0003c;0.017 to correct for multiple comparisons. We also compared these outcomes for the entire sample and by sample type (randomised and non-randomised).

First, we recruited a large sample of depressed participants in a short period of time and with minimal cost and effort. Currently, the typical RCT takes 4&#x02013;5&#x02005;years to complete, and another 1&#x02013;2&#x02005;years before the outcomes from these trials are reported publically. Rapid recruitment has the potential for quickly testing intervention efficacy and effectiveness, and ultimately moving effective treatments into practice while identifying and preventing the proliferation of ineffective, even unsafe, treatments. Second, we were able to recruit a highly representative sample of the US population, without any specific cultural adaptations or targeted advertising. Remote research methods could address decades-long concerns about the generalisability of clinical findings to minority samples not typically represented in clinical research. Finally, the cost of a fully remote RCT could allow for greater distribution of dwindling clinical research and development funds from federal, foundation and industry sponsors. Investment in large-scale clinical trials is a costly endeavour, resulting in the need to focus funds on only a few research areas. Although not all mental health RCTs should be fully remote, particularly those that test hypotheses about biological or neurological processes that can only be measured with immobile devices, the methods presented here, such as automated data collection of neuropsychological processes could result in substantial savings, which in turn could be invested in a diverse research portfolio.</p><p>This research method is not without its limitations. Primary among the challenges of fully remote research is the ability to keep participants engaged in the study protocol over time. Although there is an appeal to quickly recruiting and retaining large numbers of participants in an RCT, researchers and developers need to be cautious when interpreting outcomes from samples with a drop-out rate greater than 70%.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30&#x02013;33</xref> However, it is important to point out here that the project was completely automated with very little contact between the participant and research team, and our retention rates were higher than in the typical internet-based RCT.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Internet-based studies have shown that when there is more direct contact between the research team and participant through technologies such as video-over-internet protocols, retention rates are greater and less subject to bias,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> suggesting a hybrid approach may provide an optimal response.</p><p>Although we experimented with two incentive models to encourage retention, we determined that participant payment was not enough to keep engagement from waning across the course of the study, as bonus pay only encouraged participants to complete their assessments, and did not engender any additional motivation to utilise the training apps. Previous work has demonstrated that externalised benefits in the form of compensation can dull motivation,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>
<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> indicating that the creation of internalised reward structure to enhance motivation (eg, individualised presentation of study progress, personalised encouragements) is critical for improved adherence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Mobile technology has an important role in broadening the reach and representativeness of RCTs, while substantially reducing the time to determine intervention effectiveness and reducing study costs. Although study retention remains challenging for technology-based research, innovative methods to increase motivation and study engagement could easily address this important limitation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjinnov-2015-000098-s1.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d36e1128" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank A Brandes-Aitken (UCSF), M Brander (UCSF) and A Bodepudi (UCSF) for assistance in data monitoring, M Gross (UCSF) and J Camire (Ekho.me) for their help in participant recruitment, J Steinmetz (Ekho.me) for database architecture, D Ziegler (UCSF) for helping with app deployment, D Albert (UCSF) for assistance in web design, L Slavik (UCSF) for accounting assistance, C Catledge (UCSF) for administrative oversight, A Piper, E Martucci, S Kellogg, J Bower, M Omerick and the entire Akili Interactive team as well as I Elson, L Kaye, S Goobich and the rest of the Ginger.io team for helping with data collection and partnering with us on this project.
