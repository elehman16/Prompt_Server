The groups were divided based on the patient&#x02019;s choice and affordability of the procedure. Capsulotomy/capsulorhexis was evaluated in terms of size, circularity index (4&#x003a0; [area/perimeter<xref rid="b2-opth-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]), intraocular lens coverage, and continuity. Each group was further subdivided based on the release of white milky fluid on initiation of the capsulotomy/capsulorhexis, and the &#x0201c;fluid&#x0201d; cases were compared with the &#x0201c;no-fluid&#x0201d; cases. The primary outcome measure was capsulotomy/capsulorhexis characteristics in the two groups. The secondary outcome measures were intraoperative phacoemulsification parameters, intraoperative complications, and postoperative visual acuity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The size of the capsulotomy/capsulorhexis was 4.9&#x000b1;0.1 mm in Group I and 5.3&#x000b1;0.4 mm in Group II (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). Mean circularity index was 0.996&#x000b1;0.003 and 0.909&#x000b1;0.047 in Groups I and II, respectively (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). In Group I, free-floating circular capsulotomies were obtained in 52.5% (21/40) eyes; 37.5% (15/40) eyes had microadhesions; and 10% (4/40) eyes had incomplete capsulotomy in 1&#x02013;2 clock hours. The incidence of residual adhesions was more in cases with release of white milky fluid (<italic>P</italic>=0.003). In Group II, a multistep capsulorhexis was performed in 70% (28/40) of the eyes. There was no difference in terms of visual outcomes and intraoperative complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery has the advantage of creating a circular and optimally sized capsulotomy in cases of white cataract. The release of white milky fluid during femtosecond laser delivery is the most important factor affecting the creation of a free-floating capsulotomy.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery</kwd><kwd>white cataract</kwd><kwd>conventional phacoemulsification</kwd><kwd>capsulorhexis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) is superior to conventional phacoemulsification in terms of precise wound construction, capsulotomy, intraocular lens (IOL) centration, and decreased effective phacoemulsification time.<xref rid="b1-opth-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b4-opth-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> FLACS is comparable to traditional cataract surgery in terms of intraoperative complications, although further research is needed to evaluate its long-term safety aspects.<xref rid="b5-opth-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7-opth-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> It may be especially advantageous in white cataracts, where achieving an adequately sized continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis is the major surgical challenge.</p><p>The increased incidence of capsulorhexis-related complications in white cataracts is often associated with posterior capsular rent, vitreous loss, and nucleus drop.<xref rid="b8-opth-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Various maneuvers have been used to facilitate capsulorhexis, such as use of high-molecular-weight viscoelastic,<xref rid="b9-opth-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> trypan blue dye to stain the anterior capsule,<xref rid="b10-opth-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> two-stage capsulorhexis,<xref rid="b11-opth-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> frequent aspiration of liquefied cortical matter,<xref rid="b12-opth-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> use of Vannas scissors,<xref rid="b12-opth-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and endoilluminator.<xref rid="b9-opth-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> However, limited literature exists on the application of femtosecond lasers in white cataracts.<xref rid="b13-opth-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Comparative evaluation of FLACS and conventional phacoemulsification has been done for varying grades of nuclear sclerosis; however, there are no studies that have compared the outcomes of FLACS with conventional phacoemulsification in cases with white cataract.<xref rid="b5-opth-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b7-opth-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>We herein report our results of comparison of femtosecond laser capsulotomies with conventional capsulorhexis in cases of white cataract.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>In this prospective comparative study, 80 eyes of 80 patients with white cataract were enrolled at Dr RP Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. The study conformed to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical clearance was obtained from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences institutional review board.</p><p>Informed consent was obtained from all patients. The white cataracts were classified into Type I, II, and III according to the classification provided by Brazitikos et al.<xref rid="b8-opth-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Type I intumescent, white cataracts are characterized by the presence of liquefied cortex, Type II white cataracts have a voluminous nucleus with little amount of solid white cortex, and Type III white cataracts have anterior capsule fibrosis. Type I and Type II cataracts were included in the study. Type III white cataracts with calcific and fibrotic capsules were excluded from the study.<xref rid="b8-opth-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Eyes with preexisting glaucoma, retinal pathology, pseudoexfoliation syndrome, or pupillary dilatation &#x0003c;6 mm were also excluded. The patients were divided into two groups, each consisting of 40 eyes (40 patients). Group I (n=40) underwent FLACS and Group II (n=40) underwent conventional phacoemulsification performed by an experienced phacoemulsification surgeon (JST). The patients with white cataract scheduled to undergo FLACS or conventional phacoemulsification (based on patient&#x02019;s choice and affordability of the procedure) were compared. Randomization was not done in the study. The preoperative detailed examination included uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), anterior segment evaluation, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, applanation tonometry, biometry (Tonoref III, Nidek Co., Ltd. and OcuScan RxP, Alcon Laboratories, Inc.), and ultrasonography B-scan (Master-Vu ophthalmic ultrasound, Sonomed Escalon). The primary outcome measure was capsulotomy/capsulorhexis characteristics in the two groups. The secondary outcome measures were intraoperative phacoemulsification parameters, intraoperative complications, and postoperative visual acuity.</p><sec><title>Surgical technique</title><p>In Group I, the preoperative planning of the corneal incisions, capsulotomy, and nucleotomy was done on LenSx version 2.23 femtosecond laser system (Alcon LenSx, Inc., Aliso Viejo, CA, USA). A 4.9 mm capsulotomy was planned, with a 2.2 mm temporal clear corneal incision and two 1.1 mm side ports at 90&#x000b0; and 240&#x000b0;. The chop pattern of nucleotomy was selected, with three chops of length 6 mm each. The posterior offset was kept at 800 &#x003bc;m. Successful dock was achieved using a SoftFit&#x02122; (Alcon Laboratories, Inc., California) applanating patient interface. The anterior segment structures were imaged with intraoperative optical coherence tomography and the planned treatment was verified. The femtosecond laser parameters were the same as those used in our routine cases (nonwhite cataract cases) of FLACS. The energy was kept at 6 &#x003bc;J for corneal incisions, 8 &#x003bc;J for capsulotomy, and 12 &#x003bc;J for nucleotomy. The spot and layer separation was 5 &#x003bc;m for the side port incisions, 6 &#x003bc;m for 2.2 mm corneal incision, and 14 &#x003bc;m for the nucleotomy. For capsulotomy, the spot separation was 5 &#x003bc;m, the layer separation was 4 &#x003bc;m, and the anterior and posterior delta value was 350 &#x003bc;m each.</p><p>After femtosecond laser application, the corneal incisions were opened with the help of flap lifter. Sodium hyaluronate 1% was injected to maintain the anterior chamber and trypan blue 0.06% (VisionBlue<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, DORC International, the Netherlands) was injected to stain the anterior capsule. The capsulotomies were lifted and removed with the microcapsulorhexis forceps, and microadhesions, if any, were released (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-opth-10-1357">Figure 1</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01ON6xZez08">Video S1</ext-link>). Gentle hydrodissection was performed, followed by phacoemulsification, irrigation&#x02013;aspiration (IA), and implantation of single-piece hydrophobic acrylic IOL. A hybrid technique of IA using a combination of coaxial and bimanual IA hand pieces was frequently employed to aspirate the subincisional cortical matter in cases with difficulty during removal of cortical matter.<xref rid="b14-opth-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The corneal wounds were hydrated at the end of the procedure.</p><p>In Group II, a 2.2 keratome was used to construct a temporal corneal incision and two side ports were constructed using a 20 G microvitreoretinal blade. The anterior capsule was stained with trypan blue dye 0.06% under 1% sodium hyaluronate. Capsulorhexis was performed with a 26-gauge needle cystotome; microcapsulorhexis forceps was used if required. In cases with intumescence, an initial smaller capsulorhexis was followed by the aspiration of liquefied cortex, thus decreasing the raised intralenticular pressure. Subsequently, the capsulorhexis was enlarged to an adequate size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-opth-10-1357">Figure 2</xref>). The intended width of the capsulorhexis was ~5 mm. The aim was to provide ~0.5 mm IOL coverage all around as the optic of the IOL was 6 mm. Gentle hydrodissection was performed and phacoemulsification was completed. After IOL implantation, the capsulorhexis was further enlarged if required to achieve an adequate size. The corneal wounds were hydrated at the end of the procedure.</p><p>Intraoperatively, the total surgical time, cumulative dissipated energy, total ultrasound time, and total aspiration time were noted. Intraoperative complications such as anterior capsular tears/extension, posterior capsular tears, vitreous loss, need for anterior vitrectomy, and inability to implant IOL were noted. Postoperatively, clinical photographs were captured with the help of slit-lamp-mounted camera on postoperative day 30 and after 6 months, and the capsulorhexis size, shape, continuity, and IOL optic coverage were evaluated. Image-processing software (ImageJ 1.46r, National Institutes of Health, MD, USA) was used to measure the diameter of the capsulorhexis and calculate the circularity index. The diameter of the implanted IOL was used as a scale to calibrate the image. The circularity index was used to assess the shape of the capsulotomy. The circularity index was given by the formula 4&#x003a0; (area/perimeter<xref rid="b2-opth-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) and a circularity index of 1 implied a perfect circle.<xref rid="b3-opth-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The IOL centration and coverage was assessed on the basis of coverage of IOL optic in all four quadrants by the capsulotomy/capsulorhexis margin. Continuity of the capsulorhexis refers to the absence of radial extension/tear of the capsulorhexis edge. UDVA and corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) were assessed on postoperative day 30 and at 6 months.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was done using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS 11.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

A significantly higher incidence of residual adhesions (Type II and Type III capsulotomies) was observed in the subgroup with release of white milky fluid after femtosecond laser delivery (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.003).</p><p>The reason for microadhesions/incomplete capsulotomies was the explosive egress of white milky fluid on initiation of the capsulotomy, which obscures the visual field and hampers the subsequent delivery of the laser at the same plane. The release of the intralenticular pressure after initiation of the capsulotomy causes a slight change in the position of the anterior capsular plane and hence may result in the occurrence of incomplete capsulotomy. During the lifting of the capsulotomy flap with the microcapsulorhexis forceps, the areas obscured by the white milky fluid during femtosecond laser application should be carefully assessed, as they are likely to have microadhesions. It is imperative to use trypan blue dye to stain the anterior capsule in all cases to delineate the area of microadhesions or incomplete treatment pattern. In each of these cases, the free edge of the capsulotomy was grasped with the help of microcapsulorhexis forceps and a circumferential motion tracing the capsulotomy margins was performed, which was akin to the maneuver that one does while performing a manual capsulorhexis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-opth-10-1357">Figure 1</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01ON6xZez08">Video S1</ext-link>). This crucial step ensures the effective release of the underlying residual adhesions in femtosecond laser-assisted capsulotomies. Despite the presence of microadhesions and incomplete treatment patterns, the continuity and circularity of the capsulotomies was achieved in 97.5% (39/40) of the eyes.</p><p>The incidence of incomplete capsulotomies and microadhesions is more in white hypermature cataracts as compared to immature senile cataracts. In a case series of 1,300 cases of senile cataract undergoing FLACS, 96% capsulotomies were free floating or had small areas of nonperforations.<xref rid="b19-opth-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>In our study, one case of anterior capsular extension with radial tear was noted during FLACS. The radial extension occurred while polishing the anterior capsule after IOL implantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-opth-10-1357">Figure 3</xref>). This case was characterized by raised intralenticular pressure as evidenced by a gush of white milky fluid after the initial capsulotomy opening and had a Type II capsulotomy with microadhesions. In cases with microadhesions, the capsular edge is fragile and careful anterior capsular polishing is needed to prevent extension and radial tears.</p><p>In our experience, a raised intralenticular pressure with release of white milky fluid is the most significant factor affecting the femtosecond laser application. The milky fluid results in microadhesions and incomplete sectors of capsulotomy, which may increase the chances of tear extension during subsequent steps of phacoemulsification. This is in contrast to the manual capsulorhexis where the release of fluid is associated with a subsequent decrease in the intralenticular pressure and more safety in completion of capsulorhexis. A two-stage femtosecond laser capsulotomy has also been described in six cases of intumescent white cataract; however, remnant tissue bridges were present in one-third of the mini-capsulotomies.<xref rid="b20-opth-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>In cases undergoing conventional phacoemulsification, a multistep capsulorhexis was performed in 70% cases to achieve an adequately sized capsulorhexis. The circularity of the capsulorhexis was compromised, more so in cases with release of milky fluid. FLACS eases the process of capsulotomy by ensuring a single-step capsulotomy. Microadhesions if present can be easily released during capsulotomy removal with forceps, without jeopardizing the size, circularity, and continuity of the capsulotomy. A previous study has demonstrated the safety and efficacy of femtosecond laser-assisted capsulotomy in 25 cases of white cataracts, with radial anterior tears in two eyes, an adherent tongue-like capsule adhesion in nine eyes, and an incomplete capsulotomy in three eyes.<xref rid="b13-opth-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>The total aspiration time and total surgical duration was longer in FLACS, but the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant. The removal of cortical matter is more difficult in FLACS. A hybrid technique of IA using a combination of coaxial and bimanual IA hand pieces was frequently employed to aspirate the subincisional cortical matter in cases undergoing FLACS, which may explain the longer aspiration times.<xref rid="b14-opth-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>To conclude, femtosecond laser creates single-step, circular, adequately sized capsulotomies and eliminates the difficulty associated with capsulorhexis in white cataracts. The release of white milky fluid during femtosecond laser delivery is the most important factor affecting the creation of a free-floating capsulotomy, and microadhesions and incomplete capsulotomies may be present in up to 47.5% cases of FLACS. There is no significant difference in terms of the intraoperative complications and the final visual outcome between FLACS and conventional phacoemulsification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospective study comparing conventional phacoemulsification with FLACS in white cataracts in terms of intraoperative parameters and postoperative outcomes. Further randomized control trials with a larger sample size should be undertaken to further evaluate the long-term superiority of femtosecond laser over conventional phacoemulsification.</p></sec><sec
