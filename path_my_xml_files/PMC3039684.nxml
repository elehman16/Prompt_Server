Eczema is often associated with other conditions, such as asthma, hay-fever and food allergy and can cause intractable itching leading to thickened skin, bleeding, secondary infection, sleep loss, poor concentration, and psychological distress. Current topical treatments for eczema have side effects, for example, topical corticosteroids may cause skin thinning and the long term safety of topical tacrolimus and pimecrolimus has yet to be determined. Therefore, there is a lot of interest in exploring the benefits of non-pharmacological treatments that have no apparent side effects.</p><p>Water hardness (&#x02265;200 mg/l calcium carbonate) has become a recent focus of attention.</p></sec><sec id="s1a2"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>In addition to some epidemiological evidence linking increased water hardness with increased eczema prevalence, there have been widespread anecdotal reports of improvement in the skin of children with eczema when the family has moved from a hard to a soft water area. In addition, some patients report how their eczema symptoms have rapidly improved following the installation of a water softener. However, to date there have been no relevant published trials evaluating the potential benefit of water softeners for eczema. Given the lack of evidence, the high public interest in their potential benefit and the low risk of adverse effects, the researcher conducted a study to assess whether the installation of an ion-exchange water softener reduces the severity of eczema in children with moderate to severe eczema.</p></sec><sec id="s1a3"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers did a pilot study that showed that it was not possible to blind participants to their treatment allocation using real and &#x0201c;dummy&#x0201d; water softener units because the softened water produced more soap suds. So the researchers conducted an observer-blind randomised controlled trial in which they used trained research nurses to conduct an objective assessment of every participant's skin. The researchers recruited 336 children who all lived in hard water areas in England. Eligible children were aged 6 months to 16 years who had a diagnosis of eczema (in line with the UK working party's diagnostic criteria) and an eczema severity score of 10 or over. Participants were randomised to either installation of an ion-exchange water softener plus usual eczema care, or usual eczema care alone. Trained research nurses examined each child's skin at baseline and at 6, 12, and 16 weeks to record changes in eczema severity. The researchers also analysed any changes in symptoms over the study period such as, sleep loss and itchiness, the amount of topical corticosteroid/calcineurin inhibitors used, the Dermatitis Family Impact questionnaire and the health related Quality of Life (children's version).</p><p>Although both treatment groups improved in disease severity during the course of the trial, the researchers found no difference between the treatment groups in the main outcome&#x02014;eczema severity. Similar finding were found for night movement (scratching) and the use of topical medications (creams/ointments applied to the skin), both of which were blinded to intervention status. Nevertheless, parents in the trial did report small health benefits, and just over 50&#x00025; chose to buy the water softener at the end of the trial because of perceived improvements in the eczema and the wider benefits of water softeners. It is unclear how much of this effect can be explained by prior belief in the effectiveness of the water softeners for the treatment of eczema.</p></sec><sec id="s1a4"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>The results of this study suggest that water softeners provide no additional clinical benefit to usual care in children with eczema so the use of ion-exchange water softeners for the treatment of moderate to severe eczema in children should not be recommended. However, it is up to each family to decide whether or not the wider benefits of installing a water softener in their home are sufficient to consider buying one.</p></sec><sec id="s1a5"><title>Additional Information</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000395">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000395</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The UK's NHS presents information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/eczema-(atopic)/Pages/Introduction.aspx">eczema</ext-link> for patients and families</p></list-item><list-item><p>MedlinePlus gives information for patients, families, and caregivers on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000853.htm">eczema and other similar conditions</ext-link>

It is associated with asthma, hay fever, food allergy, and atopy. The term atopic eczema is synonymous with atopic dermatitis. The World Allergy Organisation now suggests that the phenotype of atopic eczema should be called just eczema unless specific IgE antibodies are demonstrated <xref rid="pmed.1000395-Johansson1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, and we will use the term eczema throughout this report. Eczema is very common, affecting around 20&#x00025; of school children in developed countries <xref rid="pmed.1000395-Schofield1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Eczema can cause intractable itching leading to thickened skin, bleeding, secondary infection, sleep loss, poor concentration, and psychological distress to the child and the entire family <xref rid="pmed.1000395-LewisJones1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The cost of treating eczema is substantial, both for the health provider and for families <xref rid="pmed.1000395-Mancini1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000395-Emerson1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>Epidemiological evidence linking increased water hardness with increased eczema prevalence was first demonstrated in an ecological study of 4,141 randomly selected primary school children living around Nottingham, UK <xref rid="pmed.1000395-McNally1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The 1-year period prevalence of eczema was 17.3&#x00025; in the hardest water category and 12.0&#x00025; in the lowest (odds ratio 1.54, 95&#x00025; confidence interval [CI] 1.19&#x02013;1.99 after adjustment for confounders). Similar but smaller gradients have since been reported in Japan <xref rid="pmed.1000395-Miyake1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and Spain <xref rid="pmed.1000395-ArnedoPena1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. It is possible that hard water could exacerbate eczema, because hard water results in more soap and detergent use, which can directly irritate the dry skin found in people with eczema. Soap also reacts with calcium in hard water to form small chalk particles which can irritate eczematous skin. Indirect effects such as enhanced allergen penetration due to a disruption in the skin barrier <xref rid="pmed.1000395-vandenOord1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, and increased bacterial colonisation of the skin, are also plausible mechanisms of how hard water could worsen eczema symptoms <xref rid="pmed.1000395-Tanaka1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Current pharmacological treatments for eczema have their limitations; topical corticosteroids may cause skin thinning <xref rid="pmed.1000395-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, and the long-term safety of topical tacrolimus and pimecrolimus is still uncertain <xref rid="pmed.1000395-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Given such concerns about pharmacological treatments, it is not surprising that interest in a nonpharmacological treatment that has no apparent side effects is high. There have been widespread anecdotal reports of improvement in the skin of people with eczema when moving from a hard- to a soft-water area. Anecdotal reports from patients also report rapid improvement in the symptoms of eczema following installation of a water softener. A previous systematic review of eczema treatments failed to identify any relevant trials evaluating the potential benefit of water softeners for eczema <xref rid="pmed.1000395-Hoare1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In view of the limited evidence for water softeners in eczema, the high public interest in their potential benefit, and low risk of adverse effects, the UK National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme prioritised and commissioned the Softened Water Eczema Trial (SWET).</p><p>The SWET had two main objectives: (1) to assess whether the installation of an ion-exchange water softener reduces the severity of eczema in children with moderate to severe eczema, and if so, (2) to establish the likely cost and cost-effectiveness of the intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s3"><title>Methods</title><p>Details of the study protocol have been reported previously <xref rid="pmed.1000395-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The study was approved by North West Research Ethics Committee (Ref 06/MRE08/77) and written informed consent was provided by the parent/caregiver of participating children (with signed assent from older children as appropriate). Copies of the trial protocol and CONSORT statement are available as supporting information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1000395.s001">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1000395.s002">Text S2</xref>, respectively).</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Design</title><p>The SWET trial was an observer-blind, parallel-group randomised trial of 12 weeks duration, followed by a 4-week observational period. Participants were randomised to receive either immediate installation of an ion-exchange water softener plus their normal eczema care (Group A) or normal eczema care alone (Group B). Only one child per household was randomised into the study. The primary outcome was assessed at 12 weeks, after which time the water softeners were removed for participants in Group A, or installed for a period of 4 weeks for those in Group B. The observational period between weeks 12 and 16 was included as initial pilot work suggested that participants valued the opportunity to try a &#x0201c;real&#x0201d; softener for themselves, and because it provided an opportunity to look at speed of onset of benefit and duration of treatment effects.</p><p>The trial used an observer-blind design, as a previous pilot trial involving real and &#x0201c;dummy&#x0201d; units <xref rid="pmed.1000395-Thomas2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> suggested that it was not possible to blind participants to their treatment allocation because the softened water produced more suds. When a double-blind design is not possible, it is essential to ensure that the outcome assessment is free of observer bias <xref rid="pmed.1000395-Wood1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. We achieved this by using trained research nurses to conduct an objective assessment of the child's skin at baseline, 4, 12, and 16 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Protocol</title><p>A full copy of the final trial protocol and the analysis plan are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.swet-trial.co.uk">http://www.swet-trial.co.uk</ext-link>. Changes to the protocol following ethics committee approval in January 2007 included minor amendments to trial documents, the inclusion of amounts of topical medications as an additional secondary outcome measure, and an end of trial follow-up questionnaire. One of the secondary outcomes (patient-assessed global improvement in eczema) was replaced with broad categories as defined by the SASSAD score (the proportion of children who had a reasonable (&#x02264;20&#x00025;), good (&#x0003e;20&#x00025; and &#x02264;50&#x00025;) or excellent (&#x0003e;50&#x00025;) improvement in SASSAD score), as this was felt to be more appropriate in a single-blind study. All amendments were implemented before breaking of the treatment allocation code and before finalising the analysis plan.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Recruitment took place between May 2007 and June 2009, in eight UK centres (Nottingham, Cambridge, London <xref rid="pmed.1000395-Schofield1" ref-type="bibr">[2 centres]</xref>, Isle of Wight, Portsmouth, Lincoln, and Leicester). Participants were identified through secondary care referral centres, primary care, or in response to publicity. For those living in rented accommodation, approval to install the unit was obtained from the landlord of the property (including both private and Council tenants). All lived in hard-water areas (&#x02265;200 mg/l calcium carbonate) and had a home suitable for straightforward installation of a water softener.</p><p>Three hundred thirty-six children aged 6 months to 16 years were enrolled in the trial. All had a diagnosis of eczema according to the UK working party's diagnostic criteria <xref rid="pmed.1000395-Williams2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and a minimum eczema severity score of ten points using the Six Area Six Sign Atopic Dermatitis severity score (SASSAD) <xref rid="pmed.1000395-BerthJones1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Children with a SASSAD score of less than ten points were excluded to avoid possible floor effects in measuring treatment response. Children were also excluded if they planned to be away from the home for &#x0003e;21 days during the 12-week study period (to ensure adequate exposure to the intervention), if they had taken systemic medication (e.g., cyclosporin or UV light therapy) in the last 3 months or oral steroids in the last 4 weeks, if they had started a new treatment regimen in the last 4 weeks, or if they already had a water treatment device installed in the home.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Interventions</title><p>Ion-exchange water softeners plus usual eczema care were compared with usual eczema care alone. Ion-exchange water softeners use a synthetic polystyrene resin to remove calcium and magnesium ions from household water, replacing them with sodium ions, thus eliminating the hardness. The resin becomes depleted of sodium and is recharged using sodium chloride (common salt). To avoid favouring any one company, a generic unit was produced for the trial. The units met all necessary regulatory standards and were installed by trained water engineers according to British Water's code of practice <xref rid="pmed.1000395-British1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Water samples were tested once a week to check that the units were working correctly. Any samples with a reading of &#x0003e;20 mg/l calcium carbonate were referred to the engineer for investigation.</p><p>For those allocated to Group A, a water softener unit was installed in the child's main residence as soon as possible after the baseline visit. All water entering the home was softened, with the exception of a drinking water tap at the side of the kitchen sink (unless this was refused by the participant or was technically too difficult to install). Participants were asked to bathe and wash their clothes in the usual way. A written booklet provided at the time of installation of the softeners gave general advice about use of the water softener. This included instructions to (1) check the salt regularly, (2) send water samples for analysis on a weekly basis, and (3) to reduce soap usage by at least half, in line with general advice on the use of water softeners in the home <xref rid="pmed.1000395-Water1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>Participants allocated to delayed installation (Group B), received an active unit after the primary outcome had been collected at 12 weeks.</p><p>Both groups received a support telephone call from the coordinating centre at 8 weeks, and all participants continued with their usual eczema care for the duration of the trial. Usual care was defined as any treatment that the child was currently using to control their eczema (e.g., topical corticosteroids, emollients). Participants were discouraged from starting new treatments during the period of the trial. Any patients who started new treatments were defined as protocol violators and excluded from the per-protocol analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Primary outcome was the difference between Groups A and B in mean change in disease severity at 12 weeks compared with baseline, as measured using SASSAD <xref rid="pmed.1000395-BerthJones1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. This was chosen as the primary outcome because SASSAD has been used extensively in other clinical trials of eczema <xref rid="pmed.1000395-Meggitt1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000395-Takwale1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and because we had personal experience of using the scale in a clinical trial setting. It is easy and quick to complete, does not require an assessment of surface area involvement (which is extremely difficult to do reliably in patients with eczema) <xref rid="pmed.1000395-Charman1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, and most importantly it is entirely performed by the observer, making it a good objective outcome measure for this observer-blind trial. Research nurses were trained in the use of the scale by either a dermatologist or a dermatology nurse consultant. Training was deemed complete when scores were &#x0003c;10&#x00025; of each other. As far as possible the same nurse conducted baseline and follow-up assessments for individual participants. A reduction in the SASSAD score represents an improvement in eczema severity.</p><p>Secondary outcomes were differences in the following measures.</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Proportion of time spent moving during the night.

The programme was created by the Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit (CTU), and held on a secure server. Randomisation was stratified by disease severity (baseline SASSAD &#x02264;20, or SASSAD score &#x0003e;20) and recruiting centre. Access to the sequence was confined to the CTU Data Manager. The allocation group was indicated to the trial manager only after baseline data had been irrevocably entered into the randomisation programme. The sequence of treatment allocations was concealed until all interventions had been assigned and recruitment, data collection, and analysis were complete.</p><p>The research nurses were blinded to treatment allocation throughout the trial and the statistician analysed the results based on treatment code, using an analysis plan that was finalised before the coded allocation sequence was revealed. The only trial personnel in direct contact with participants were the research nurses and water engineers.

Trial participants continued to see their normal health care professionals for their ongoing eczema care.</p><p>Participants were discouraged from discussing their treatment allocation with the research nurse, and the importance of maintaining &#x0201c;blinding&#x0201d; was highlighted in the participant information sheets.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>Analyses were performed by CO (author) in Stata 10.1 <xref rid="pmed.1000395-20071" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.

The primary outcome was analysed as intent-to-treat (ITT) using the randomised treatment allocation rather than actual treatment received. Only participants with complete data were included in the ITT analysis, as the analysis plan specified that imputation of missing values was not required if less than 5&#x00025; of data were missing. Baseline characteristics were summarised and an adjusted analysis was conducted where major imbalances existed. An additional per-protocol analysis was performed excluding protocol violators; these were determined before treatment allocation was decoded (for further details of protocol violators please see full trial report) <xref rid="pmed.1000395-Thomas2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>The average percentage of the night spent moving was calculated by taking the average of the first 3 nights of usable data at baseline and the last 3 nights of usable data at week 12, as these days were closest to the nurses' assessments of eczema severity.

Nevertheless, the parents of two participants believed their child's eczema had worsened as a direct result of installation of the water softener and asked to have the unit removed. Parents of a third participant expressed concern that the water softener appeared to be making their child's eczema worse, but continued to take part in the trial.</p><p>Results of the cost-effectiveness analyses are available in the full trial write-up <xref rid="pmed.1000395-Thomas2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.

There were no clinically important differences between the treatment groups for any of the blinded outcomes. Furthermore, the 95&#x00025; CIs around the primary efficacy estimates were narrow. An improvement of 1.37 points in favour of water softeners (the lower 95&#x00025; CI), to 2.69 points in favour of usual care (the upper 95&#x00025; CI) makes it unlikely that a clinically useful benefit has been excluded by chance. In order to understand the clinical relevance of these results it is helpful to consider the proportion of participants who showed good or excellent improvement during the period of the trial (52&#x00025; in the water softeners group and 56&#x00025; in the usual care group).</p><p>Performing a per-protocol analysis based on those with maximum exposure to the water softener, and excluding those who had changed their usual eczema treatments during the trial, did not change the overall interpretation of these results.</p><p>It is possible that water softeners could prove beneficial in the absence of a change in disease severity if the softeners resulted in a steroid-sparing effect. However, measurement of the amount of topical steroid or calcineurin inhibitors applied during the trial showed that both groups used roughly equivalent amounts of topical therapy throughout the 12-week study period.</p><p>Of the four unblinded secondary outcomes, all except EQ-5D showed small but statistically significant differences in favour of the water softener group. However, the magnitude of improvement seen in these outcomes was small and unlikely to be clinically significant. It is most likely that these differences were a result of response bias.</p><p>Of the children involved in the study, just under 30&#x00025; had at least one filaggrin mutation, but these children showed no additional benefit compared to children without the mutation.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Limitations</title><p>This was an adequately powered randomised trial, with high follow-up rates, that placed special emphasis on objective outcome measures to minimise response bias. Previous pilot work demonstrated the need for an objective outcome, as blinding participants with a sham unit was only partly successful (due to the different feel of softened water and the amount of suds generated) <xref rid="pmed.1000395-Thomas2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. It is possible that our emphasis on objective outcomes meant that some important potential benefits were not captured in the primary analysis. Other factors, such as improvements in quality of life, or a reduction in symptoms (such as perception of skin dryness), may be important drivers in determining whether or not parents choose to buy a water softener. Indeed, many parents in the trial reported small health benefits, and just over 50&#x00025; chose to buy the water softener at the end of the trial. The reasons participants gave for purchasing the units included perceived improvements in the eczema (66&#x00025;); wider benefits of the softeners (27&#x00025;); or both reasons (7&#x00025;).</p><p>It is also possible that treatment effects were masked by the usual eczema care, but given the generally low use of topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors in both groups, this is unlikely to be the case.</p><p>This trial was of relatively short duration, and it is possible that the trial was insufficient to capture any treatment effect. However, both treatment groups improved in disease severity during the trial, and there was no hint that the intervention group was starting to show more improvement than the control group towards the end of the 12-week period. Anecdotal reports from patients returning from holidays claim benefits within 1&#x02013;2 weeks. This led us to anticipate that if a treatment response existed, it was likely to occur more quickly than 12 weeks.</p><p>The continued use of soap and soap products during the trial may have limited the observed benefits if families were using too much soap in conjunction with the water softener. However, this pragmatic study aimed to capture the effects of water softeners according to standard advice. Evidence of how much soap was actually used was not collected, as we did not want to change participant's behaviour by intensive monitoring.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Generalisability</title><p>We believe that this trial has good external validity, because participants were recruited from eight UK centres and included families of diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. Every effort was made to include participants who lived in rented accommodation as well as home owners. The results are applicable only to children with moderate to severe eczema, and it is possible that water softening is beneficial for milder forms of eczema, or in adults with other eczema types.</p><p>One possible reason for the discrepancy between our null trial findings and those of previous observational studies may be that water hardness has an effect on the primary prevention of eczema, rather than on the treatment of established eczema. The current study did not address the issue of prevention of new cases of eczema, which could be investigated by means of a further RCT including families at risk of eczema. An alternative explanation could be that the children in the observational studies ingested the water. In other words, it is possible that ingestion of hard water or a component to water that is related to water hardness actually induces skin inflammation directly or indirectly through inflammatory gene interactions, although we are not aware of any such potential mechanisms from the literature to date.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Interpretation</title><p>The results of this study are clear, and as a result we cannot recommend the use of ion-exchange water softeners for the treatment of moderate to severe eczema in children. Whether or not the wider benefits of installing a water softener in the home are sufficient to justify the purchase of a softener is something for individual householders to consider on a case-by-case basis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1000395.s001"><label>Text S1</label><caption><p>Protocol and analysis plan.</p><p>(0.42 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1000395.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1000395.s002"><label>Text S2</label><caption><p>CONSORT checklist.</p><p>(0.22 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1000395.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all the volunteer families who took part in the trial, and our dermatology and nursing colleagues who referred patients into the trial.</p><p>We are grateful for support from the following individuals and organisations: MRC Clinical Trials Unit; Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit; members of the SWET Service User Panel who commented on study design and participant information sheets; David Paige (Chair of Trial Steering Group) and Nerys Roberts (vice-Chair of Trial Steering Group), for their independent advice on the conduct of the trial; Emma Veysey (Consultant Dermatologist, Singleton Hospital, Swansea) for assessment of digital images of target lesions; the National Eczema Society and the Nottingham Eczema Support Group, who provided assistance in advertising the trial; Linda Campbell (University of Dundee) conducted gene sequencing to identify filaggrin status; Kinetico UK Ltd (Grant Audemard supported the original feasibility study and assisted with trial design; John Kyle coordinated engineering aspects of the main trial); members of the UK Water Treatment Association who provided technical advice and contributed to the cost of the water softeners and salt supplies; staff at Culligan UK who coordinated hardness testing of water samples; engineers from the following companies who installed water softeners: Aquastream, Capital Softeners, Clearwater Softeners, European Water Care, Greens Water Systems, Kinetico UK, MG Heating Ltd; Silkstream and Simply Soft Water Softeners.</p><p>
