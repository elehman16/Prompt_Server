It has been well-documented that the MetS increases the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Several clinical trials have suggested that dietary intervention is an effective way to manage the MetS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), though a specific therapeutic diet for the MetS remains to be determined. We have previously shown that weight-loss diets varying in macronutrient components had similar effectiveness in reducing the prevalence of the MetS in a 2-year randomized clinical trial, the Preventing Overweight Using Novel Dietary Strategies (POUNDS LOST) trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>Genetic factors may play an important role in the development of the MetS.

A total of 811 overweight or obese subjects were randomly assigned to one of four diets for 2 years. Participants had to be 30&#x02013;70 years of age and have a BMI of 25&#x02013;40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The target percentages of energy derived from fat, protein, and carbohydrate in the four diets were 20, 15, and 65%; 20, 25, and 55%; 40, 15, and 45%; and 40, 25, and 35%, respectively. Each participant's caloric prescription represented a deficit of 750 kcal/day from baseline, as calculated from the person's resting energy expenditure and activity level. As part of a two-by-two factorial design, two diets were low fat (20%) and two were high fat (40%) and two were average protein (15%) and two were high protein (25%). Major criteria for exclusion were the presence of diabetes or unstable cardiovascular disease, the use of medications that affect body weight, and insufficient motivation. In the current analysis, 738 subjects with genotype data were included (91% of the total subjects in the POUNDS LOST trial). Among them, 61% were women, 80% were white, 15% were African American, 3% were Hispanic, and 2% were Asian or other ethnic groups by self-report. The study was approved by the human subjects committee at the Harvard School of Public Health and Brigham and Women&#x02019;s Hospital, Boston, MA, and the Pennington Biomedical Research Center of the Louisiana State University System, Baton Rouge, LA, and by a data and safety monitoring board appointed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. All participants gave written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Measurements</title><p>Body weight and waist circumference were measured in the morning before breakfast at baseline, 6 months, and 2 years. Height was measured at baseline. BMI was calculated as weight (kg)/height<sup>2</sup> (m<sup>2</sup>). Fasting blood samples were collected at baseline, 6 months, and 2 years, and serum glucose, insulin, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured at the clinical laboratory at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center. Insulin resistance was estimated by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance calculated by the following equation: (fasting insulin [&#x000b5;U/mL] &#x000d7; fasting glucose [mg/dL]/18.01)/22.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Blood pressure was measured at baseline, 6 months, and 2 years with the use of an automated device (HEM-907XL; Omron). To assess the dietary adherence across the intervention, dietary intake was assessed in a random sample of 50% of the participants by a review of the 5-day diet record at baseline and by 24-h recall during a telephone interview on 3 nonconsecutive days at 6 months and 2 years. In addition, food frequency questionnaires were collected in all participants at baseline, 6 months, and 2 years.

We found a potential interaction between the genetic variant rs1522813 and diet intervention on reversion of the MetS at 6 months and 2 years. Among individuals with the rs1522813 A-allele, the high-fat diets showed greater effect on reversion of the MetS compared with the low-fat diets over the 2-year intervention.</p><p>Although a large body of evidence has shown that dietary interventions are beneficial in the management of the MetS, the ideal dietary intervention remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). In our previous analysis of the POUNDS LOST trial, weight-loss diets with different macronutrient components had similar effectiveness in improving the MetS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Our recent gene&#x02013;diet interaction analyses in the POUNDS LOST trial have suggested that the effects of the diet intervention on body weight and related metabolic traits might be influenced by genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). In the current study, our data indicated that high-fat diets were superior to the low-fat diets for reversion of the MetS among individuals with the A-allele of the rs1522813 variant near <italic>IRS1</italic>. The observed genotype&#x02013;diet interaction on reversion of the MetS might be independent of weight loss or changes in insulin resistance. This is consistent with the results that we did not find significant genotype&#x02013;diet interaction on weight loss or changes in insulin resistance. Moreover, the results were similar when we excluded the criterion for waist circumference in the definition of the MetS, further suggesting that the genotype&#x02013;diet interaction on reversion of the MetS might be less influenced by changes in adiposity. Unlike the weight regain after 6 months, the dietary effect in reducing the prevalence of the MetS persisted at 2 years in the POUNDS LOST trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). This may also explain the consistent results at 6 months and 2 years regardless of weight changes during the intervention. Therefore, these results indicate a stable and long-term modification effect of the genetic variant rs1522813 on the MetS reversion in response to diet interventions. Our data may provide useful information for the development of dietary interventions in the management of the MetS based on genetic background.</p><p>Another genetic variant near <italic>IRS1</italic>, rs2943641, which has been previously shown to interact with dietary fat intake on the changes in body weight and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), did not modulate the dietary effects on the MetS status in the current analysis. However, it should be noted that the currently observed interaction between the genetic variant rs1522813 and diet intervention on reversion of the MetS was independent of changes in body weight and insulin resistance. We did not find any different dietary effects on weight loss according to the rs1522813 genotype (data not shown). The SNPs rs2943641 and rs1522813 fall into two independent linkage disequilibrium blocks with low correlation (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x0003c; 0.01 for all ethnic groups in the HapMap database) and showed independent associations with risk of type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). In addition, there was an interaction between physical activity and the SNP rs1522813, but not the SNP rs2943641, on type 2 diabetes risk in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). However, the SNPs in the same linkage disequilibrium block with the rs2943641 appear to show stronger associations with various metabolic traits than the other SNPs near <italic>IRS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Thus, our findings together with other previous results suggested that different mechanisms might underlie the observed associations and interactions for these two genetic variants. It is possible that the genetic variant rs2943641 might be more related to weight loss and insulin resistance in response to dietary intervention, while the genetic variant rs1522813 is more likely to interact with dietary intervention on changes in blood pressure, plasma HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. However, the biological function of these genetic variants has not been clarified, and experimental studies are needed in the future.</p><p>We did not find significant gene&#x02013;diet interactions or dietary effects on the reversions of the individual components of the MetS, but the high-fat diet showed directionally consistent improvement on reversions of the MetS components compared with the low-fat diets among participants with the rs1522813 A-allele. These results suggested that the dietary effect on reversion of the MetS might reflect the cumulative effects on the individual components rather than on any single component. This is in line with the fact that genetic variants near <italic>IRS1</italic> were associated with multiple features of the MetS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), though the function of these genetic variants has not been clarified. Individuals with the rs1522813 A-allele, which is the risk allele for type 2 diabetes, had a higher reversion rate of the MetS by choosing a high-fat diet compared with those without the A-allele. This is consistent with some previous results that the risk alleles of the genetic variants were associated with greater beneficial effects of diet interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). The potential mechanisms underlying these findings remain to be investigated. In addition, it is difficult to distinguish the effects of dietary fat and carbohydrate responsible for the observed interactions because the high-fat diets have low carbohydrate content.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to date to investigate the gene&#x02013;diet interactions on changes in the MetS status in a large and long-term randomized trial. However, several limitations of our study should be considered. Not all participants included in the analysis had MetS at baseline (&#x0223c;50% of the participants met the criteria for the MetS). This may also limit our statistical power of the analysis for the reversion of the MetS, and our study may be underpowered to detect modest effects and interactions. As expected, our findings barely reached the level of statistical significance, and replication of these results is needed in future. Participants had difficulty achieving the goals for macronutrient intake of their assigned group, but mean differences in fat, carbohydrate, or protein intake among the diet groups were significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Because of the relatively small numbers of incident cases of the MetS, we did not analyze the incidence of the MetS, and it is unknown whether the gene&#x02013;diet interactions were similar to the prevention of the MetS. The participants of our study were overweight or obese; therefore, further studies are warranted to investigate whether our findings are applicable in people with normal weight. In addition, most of the participants were whites (&#x0223c;80%), and it remains to be determined whether our findings could be generalized to other ethnic groups.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that the genetic variant rs1522813 near <italic>IRS1</italic> might modulate the effects of weight-loss diets with different fat content on the MetS status in a 2-year randomized trial. Participants with the rs1522813 A-allele might have a higher reversion rate of the MetS by choosing a high-fat diet compared with a low-fat diet. These novel findings provide supportive evidence for the notion of a personalized dietary intervention in the management of the MetS.</p></sec>
