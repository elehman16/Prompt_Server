Approval from the study was obtained from the research committees of the hospitals which also double as ethics committee. All consenting patients undergoing primary cesarean section in the hospitals that met the inclusion criteria during this period were enrolled into the study. They were randomized into either of two arms of Misgav Ladach method of cesarean section (ML) and Pfannenstiel based Cesarean section method (PB) using computer-generated random numbers. Randomization was hospital based and performed once the decision was made to deliver by cesarean section. Excluded from the study were cases of antepartum hemorrhage, prolonged obstructed labor, chorioamnionitis, preoperative hemoglobin less than 10 g/dl, prolonged premature rupture of membrane and clinically palpable uterine fibroid because the research committees of both hospitals gave their exclusion as condition for approval. Blood loss estimation was by visual inspection by the attending anesthetists. Only surgeons trained and experienced in the two techniques participated in the study.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size expression <italic>n</italic> = <italic>1/d</italic>2 &#x000d7; <italic>Z</italic>2<italic>pq</italic> was used to determine the minimum number of subjects to be included in each arm of the study; where <italic>Z</italic> is the value of the Z score corresponding to the level of confidence; <italic>P</italic> is the estimated proportion of participants with any unfavorable outcome, <italic>q</italic> = 1 &#x02212; <italic>p</italic> and <italic>d</italic> is the tolerable error margin in our estimate. At 95% level of confidence, <italic>Z</italic> = 1.96 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.10, and error margin of 5%, a sample size of 138 was determined. We increased the sample size to at least 152 during the study period in anticipation of nonresponse or withdrawal of consent and the fact that we expected at least 10% of the total sample size in any cell generated in contingency tables. In all 323 women were recruited from the two sites.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Operative technique</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Common postoperative procedures</title><p>Oxytocics were administered after delivery of baby and placenta in all cases and continued for at least six hours postsurgery.

Extended prophylactic antibiotics of Clauvinic acid potentiated amoxicillin and Metronidazole were used in all cases.

The number of cases of postoperative anemia was significantly more in the PB group than in the ML group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01; OR: 2.87; CI: 1.4-6.4). Although more women were transfused with blood in the PB group (5.3%) for postpartum hemorrhage compared to 2.0% in the ML group, the difference was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.38). The mean extra analgesic requirement by the women postsurgery was less in the ML group (2.3 (1.0)) compared to 3.1 (1.3) in the women in the PB group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.02). There was also statistically significant difference between the two groups with respect to the time of first bowel motion (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01; OR: 4.0; CI: 2.6-3.4) and the time of first mobilization (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001; OR: 6.2; CI: 4.7-8.3). The mean time of first bowel motion was 26.2 (5.6) h in the ML group compared to 39.5 (9.4) h in the PB group. The mean postoperative time at mobilization was 22.5 (6.2) h in ML group as against 34.3 (8.9) h in than PB group. Eighteen (8.1%) women in the PB group had postoperative morbidities of anemia, wound infection, febrile morbidity, blood transfusion, and puerperal sepsis compared to seven (3.4%) women in ML group.

We were able to show the advantage of ML technique over PB technique in operation time, blood loss, hemoglobin levels postsurgery, time to first bowel motion, ambulation time, and postoperative morbidity like previous study in Refs. 13, 15, and 17. The mean operation time (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), estimated blood loss (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002), time to first bowel motion (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01), and mean postoperative mobilization time (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) were significantly shorter among the ML arm compared to PB arm. Also among the ML arm, the rate of postoperative morbidity of 8.2% was signifantly lower than rate 22.8% among the PB arm (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001). However, no difference was found between the techniques as it relates to the number of women that were transfused (<italic>P</italic> = 0.69), requiring extra stitch to control bleeding (<italic>P</italic> = 0.38), or stayed more than six days in the hospital (<italic>P</italic> = 0.14).</p><p>The finding above confirms the theoretical basis of Misgav Ladach technique of close relation between tissue trauma and morbidity and supports the assertion that the introduction of ML technique removes the unnecessary step in PB technique including the reduction of CS related morbidity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Every unnecessary surgical step increases tissue damage and inflammatory response, with a consequent rise in hemorrhage and infection risk.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] This study in addition excludes any expected effect of race and environment on the outcome of the new technique.</p><p>Among the fetal outcome parameters of mean fetal extraction time, Apgar score, neonatal admission, and death rates evaluated in the study, it was only in fetal extraction time that ML technique was found to confer significant advantage over PB technique. The mean fetal extraction time of 162 (5.1) s among the ML group was significantly lower than 273 (7.1) s in the PB group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001; CI: 2.7&#x02013;7.8). This finding supports the previous reports by Darj,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Ferrari,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] and Franchi[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] which reported short fetal extraction time in ML technique compared to PB technique. Our study further confirms the conclusion of Carlo Dani and colleague who stated that though ML technique shortens fetal extraction time, it does not influence short-term outcome of the newborn infants.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] It is therefore reasonable to believe that neonatal outcome depends more on other factors such as chronic hypoxia, delayed decision to intervention interval and pre-existing condition, than on the cesarean section.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p><p>This study has shown the superiority of ML technique over PB techniques in Nigerian women like their counterparts elsewhere and is therefore recommended for routine cesarean section both for emergency and elective cases. Though this study was a randomized control study which provides grade A evidence, it has some limitation that may impact on its external validity. The restriction of the study sites to Lagos and the exclusion of complicated cases as requested by the research committees make its generalizability difficult. When these limitations are viewed within the context and aim of the study, which is to evaluate what, is already established in other climes, the limitations are, therefore, not enough to invalidate the study. However, more evaluation of the techniques in the other zones of Nigeria and in high risk case is recommended.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study has confirmed the already established benefit of ML techniques in Nigerian women as it relates to the postoperative outcomes, duration of surgery, and fetal extraction time.
