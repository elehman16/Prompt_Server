progressive resistance training and Russian electrical stimulation on quadriceps femoris
muscle strength in elderly women with osteoarthritis of the knee. [Subjects] Thirty women
over 65&#x02005;years of age diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis participated in the present study.
The subjects were randomly assigned to a control group (n=10), a progressive resistance
training group (n=10), or a Russian electrical stimulation group (n=10). [Methods] Each
group was treated 3 times weekly for 8 weeks, and each session lasted 45 minutes. Muscle
strength was assessed by measuring the peak torque of the quadriceps femoris muscle.
Outcome measurements were performed at baseline and at the fourth and eighth weeks of the
treatment period. [Results] All groups showed significant intragroup differences in the
quadriceps femoris muscle peak torque after the treatment intervention. There were
significant intergroup differences between the Russian electrical stimulation group and
the other groups. [Conclusion] The results of this study suggest that combined application
of progressive resistance training and Russian electrical stimulation can be effective in
strengthening the quadriceps femoris muscle in elderly women with knee osteoarthritis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Knee osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>Progressive resistance training</kwd><kwd>Russian electrical stimulation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is the most common cause of chronic disability in people at
older ages<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Weakness of the quadriceps
femoris muscle (QFM) is one of the major characteristics of knee OA, and a reduced
quadriceps strength has been shown to be associated with the presence of OA in the knee.
Accordingly, many exercise programs place particular emphasis on strengthening this muscle
group<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been documented that
muscle strength can be improved by progressive resistance training (PRT), and numerous
studies have reported the benefits of PRT in individuals with knee OA by strengthening the
QFM<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Electrical stimulation (ES) is also commonly used by physical
therapists in muscle strength rehabilitation<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, there have been few studies that have attempted to
investigate the effects of simultaneous PRT and ES applications on muscle strength
improvement. Therefore, this study was conducted to examine whether a combination of PRT and
ES increases the QFM strength in patients with knee OA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty women over 65&#x02005;years of age diagnosed with knee OA through radiographic images were
recruited in this study. The exclusion criteria were medical comorbidities precluding
participation in an exercise program, implanted electrical devices, participation in an
exercise program that may have caused an increase in muscle strength within last 6 months,
and usage of any anti-inflammatory analgesics. All participants meeting the inclusion
criteria were given verbal and written information on the study, and provided their informed
consent. The protocol of this study was approved by Daegu University.</p><p>Subjects were randomized into a control (CON) group (n=10), a progressive resistance
training (PRT) group (n=10), or a Russian electrical stimulation (RES) group (n=10). The
control group received a general physical therapy treatment that consisted of hot packs,
ultrasound application, and isometric knee extension exercise. Hot packs wrapped in a towel
were placed on the osteoarthritic knee for 20 minutes. During 5 minutes of ultrasound
treatment, continuous ultrasonic waves with a frequency of 1&#x02005;MHz and 1 watt/cm<sup>2</sup>
power were selected, and the transducer head was applied to the treatment region at right
angles to ensure maximum absorption of the ultrasound energy<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Isometric knee extension exercise consisted of 3 sets of 10
contractions of the quadriceps femoris muscle (QFM) and lasted approximately 20 minutes.
Each contraction was held for 5 seconds, and each set was separated by a 2-minute rest
period to minimize fatigue. The exercise was performed with the subjects sitting on the edge
of a treatment bed and leaning on a wall with a pillow placed behind their back. From a knee
flexed position, the subjects extended their knee joint as far as possible and sustained the
position to contract the QFM.</p><p>In the PRT group, the subjects received the same modalities (hot packs and ultrasound) and
were treated using PRT instead of the isometric knee extension exercise. A ten repetition
maximum (RM) was used for the resistance, and the amount of resistance was reevaluated every
week. The subjects were positioned as described in the CON with sandbags loaded anterior to
their ankle joint. The loads applied were set at 50%, 75%, and 100% of the 10 RM for each
set.</p><p>The RES group was given electrical stimulation and the same treatment as the PRT group. ES
was carried out using an Endomed 982 (Enraf-Nonius, Rotterdam, The Nethelands). The ES used
in this study was Russian current: pulse frequency of 50&#x02005;Hz, burst duration of 10&#x02005;ms,
symmetric pulses of sinusoidal form, with a duty cycle of 25% (5 seconds/20 seconds) and a
pulse duration of 400 &#x003bc;s. The anterior area of the thigh of the affected limb was cleaned
with alcohol, and four self-adhesive electrodes were placed on the limb: one electrode on
the rectus femoris, two electrodes on the proximal and distal area of the vastus lateralis,
and one electrode on the vastus medialis<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
After placing the electrodes on the subject&#x02019;s thigh, the subject was instructed to inform
the maximum level of tolerance and contract the QFM while the PRT was performed. All groups
were treated three times weekly for 8 weeks. The amount of time of each session was
approximately 45 minutes for all groups.</p><p>For outcome measurements, subjects were encouraged to perform three maximum contractions on
an isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex Multi-joint System 4 Pro<sup>TM</sup>, Biodex Medical
Systems, Shirley, NY, USA) after a 5-minute warm-up flexion and extension of the knee joint.
The axis of rotation of the knee joint was carefully aligned with the axis of rotation of
the dynamometer arm with the subjects stabilized in the dynamometer chair. The QFM isometric
contractions from the affected limb were collected with the knee joints positioned at 90&#x000b0;
and were sustained for 5 seconds with a 2-minute interval between contractions to prevent
fatigue. The mean value of the three maximum contractions was used for data analysis. The
outcome measurements were carried out at baseline and at the fourth and eighth weeks of the
treatment period.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 12.0. A one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was used to evaluate differences between groups in baseline characteristics (age,
height, and weight). A repeated measures two-way ANOVA was used to compare differences
between groups over time. The level of significance was set at 5% (p&#x0003c;0.05) with Scheffe&#x02019;s
method used for multiple comparisons. Results are expressed as the mean value &#x000b1; standard
deviation (SD).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Baseline characteristics are presented in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table

demonstrated to correlate with knee pain and functional disability<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. McAlindon et al. have reported that the strength of the QFM
has been shown to be an important predictor of walking speed and functional performance in
patients with knee OA<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been also
reported that one aim of physical therapy intervention for patients with OA is to increase
the strength of the musculature surrounding the knee joint<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate whether an intervention of PRT combined
with Russian current stimulation has beneficial effects on strengthening the QFM in elderly
women with knee OA. In this study, two-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed that the peak
torque of the QFM increased in the control group after receiving the general physical
therapy treatment. These findings are in accordance with the results of earlier experimental
studies. In a previous study by Anwer et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, it was demonstrated that quadriceps muscle strength in patients
with knee OA was improved after a 5-week isometric exercise program. Similarly, Miyaguchi et
al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> reported a significant increase
in muscle strength after 8 weeks of isometric quadriceps exercise in knee OA patients.</p><p>The results of the current study also showed significant improvements in strength of the
QFM in the PRT group, and some authors have suggested that a PRT program can increase muscle
strength in women with knee OA<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a
randomized controlled trial of Jusha et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, it was indicated that PRT can strengthen the QFM in patients with
early onset of knee OA and that PRT can be a vital component of knee OA management.</p><p>ES causes an increase in the muscle strength with changes in the muscle fibers and the
capillary system<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. ES is an alternative
and potentially more effective means than volitional exercise alone of increasing the force
of muscles in appropriate patients<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
several studies, it has been reported that the most commonly used ES to increase muscle
strength is that via Russian current<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.
In the trial by Taspinar et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>,
however, the results indicated that Russian current was not sufficient alone to strengthen
the QFM, and it has been suggested that training programs including voluntary muscle
contraction must be considered for strengthening muscles. Furthermore, some authors argue
that muscles cannot be strengthened to their full potential if they cannot be activated
sufficiently to overload the muscle and therefore recommend a combination of ES and muscle
strength training<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. In our study, the
results showed significant intergroup differences in QFM peak torque between the RES group
and the other groups. These findings are consistent with those of Paillard et al<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to their review article, training
programs using ES superimposition (application of an electrical stimulation during a
voluntary muscle contraction) could increase the overall contraction force of muscles.</p><p>The results of this study are subject to several limitations. First, although women are
more likely to have OA than men<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> and
females have significantly lower quadriceps strength than males even when strength is
normalized to weight<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>, the gender of the
participants in this study was limited to females. Accordingly, the results of this study
might not be generalizable to the overall individuals with knee OA. Second, the knee OA
duration or knee OA severity was not identified as a baseline characteristic of the
subjects. Lastly, muscle peak torque was the only parameter examined in this study.
Therefore, it is suggested that further studies are required to ascertain the effects of
combined application of PRT and RES on parameters such as functional abilities and pain in
patients with knee OA.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Meltzer</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Elliot</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group>: The prevalence of disability among adults.
