Epidural anesthesia is a safe and inexpensive technique with the advantage of providing surgical anesthesia and prolonged postoperative pain relief. It has become a common practice to use multidrug approach for the treatment of intra and postoperative pain because no drug has yet been identified that specifically inhibits nociception without associated side effects.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists have both analgesic and sedative properties when used as an adjuvant in epidural anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The anesthetic and the analgesic requirement get reduced to a huge extent by the use of this adjuvants.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>The aim of the study was to compare the effect of dexmedetomidine versus clonidine in combination with ropivacaine during epidural anesthesia on intraoperative and postoperative analgesia, to find out the better adjuvant for regional anesthesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This was a randomized control trial conducted from May 2012 to December 2012. Sixty patients were included in this study with age ranging from 18 to 60 years. Patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) 1 or ASA 2 grade and undergoing lower abdominal and lower limbs surgeries were included. Patients with a history of cardiac diseases, respiratory diseases, significant hepatorenal dysfunction, central nervous system (CNS) diseases, any contraindications to regional anesthesia (local infections, bleeding disorders), drugs that affect CNS and known allergic or hypersensitivity to any drug, uncooperative patients were excluded from this study.</p><p>They were randomized into three groups of 20 patients each in a double-blinded fashion. Group 1 - Patients received 0.75% 19 ml ropivacaine with 1 ml N.S. to make 20 ml. Group 2 - patients received 0.75% ropivacaine 19 ml with 1.5 &#x000b5;g/kg dexmedetomidine (1 ml) to make total volume 20 ml. Group 3 - patients received 0.75% ropivacaine 19 ml with 2 &#x000b5;g/kg clonidine (1 ml) to make total volume 20 ml.</p><p>The onset of analgesia and complete establishment of motor blockade was observed and recorded.</p><p>The bilateral pin-prick method was used to evaluate and check the sensory level. The visual analog scale was used for the sensory level. Modified Bromage scale (0 = no block, 1 = inability to raise extended leg, 2 = inability to flex knee and 3 = inability to flex ankle and foot) was used to measure the motor blockade effect at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 min intervals after the epidural administration of the drugs. Grading of sedation was evaluated by a five-point scale (1 - alert and wide awake, 2 - arousable to verbal command, 3 - arousable with gentle tactile stimulation, 4 - arousable with vigorous shaking and 5 - unarousable). Sedation scores were recorded just before the initiation of surgery and thereafter every 20 min during the surgical procedure. Cardio-respiratory parameters were monitored continuously, and recordings were made every 5 min until 30 min and at 10 min interval thereafter up to 60 min and then at 15 min interval for next hour and finally at 30 min until complete recovery. During the surgical procedure, adverse events such as anxiety, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, shivering, etc., were recorded.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All the data were analyzed using &#x0201c;analysis of variance and Chi-square test.&#x0201d; Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 16.0 for Windows, Chicago III was used to compare the continuous variables between the groups.
