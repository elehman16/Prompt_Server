Rehabilitation, care and safety of people with aphasia may be adversely affected by communication &#x02018;barriers&#x02019; arising from the physical environment, negative staff attitudes or unskilled communication partners.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;5</xref> Effective communication is essential to maintaining patient safety,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> ensuring a good experience of care,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and providing the basis for therapeutic engagement and participation in decision-making through partnerships with healthcare professionals.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Participation in conversational interactions is demonstrably enhanced for people with aphasia by providing &#x02018;supported communication&#x02019; (SC).<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> SC is premised on the view that interactional communication is collaborative,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> with the unimpaired communication partner (eg, healthcare practitioner) jointly responsible for achieving exchange of information and sustaining participation through adaptations to usual communication practices, for example the use of appropriately phrased questions, extra time or low-tech resources (eg, pen and paper).<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>SC for aphasia training is a complex intervention,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> including: interacting components (eg, staff training and subsequent skills-transfer to day-to-day practice); a range of behaviours required by those delivering (eg, staff communication practices) and receiving (eg, patient responses and behaviours) the intervention; a number of outcomes (eg, staff skills; patient participation, psychosocial or quality of life impact); and a degree of flexibility (eg, adapting the intervention according to clinical context).<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>A systematic review of communication partner training for aphasia concluded that partners can be trained to facilitate and support the communication of people with aphasia.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, very few studies of health-professional communication partner training exist; there is a lack of investigation in the first 4&#x02005;months after stroke; and a lack of information on the impact of partner training on psychosocial and quality of life outcomes for people with aphasia. There are no studies examining cost or economic impact.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> More recently, single-group pre&#x02013;post studies of nurse and nursing assistant training have shown positive impacts on staff knowledge and awareness of aphasia,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>

<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>While SC for aphasia training has the potential to improve the participation, well-being and quality of life of people with aphasia,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> key uncertainties in developing and evaluating this intervention must be addressed before a definitive RCT is undertaken. These include: staff recruitment and training under control and experimental conditions; transfer of training to day-to-day practice; patient recruitment and retention early after stroke; adherence to and acceptability of the intervention; selection of suitable staff and patient outcome measures; co-ordination of all intervention components within a multicentre trial.</p><p>Guided by recommendations for developing and evaluating complex interventions<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and reporting feasibility work,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> we examined these methodological issues in order to assess the feasibility of conducting a subsequent trial of supported communication training for patients early after stroke in mutlidisciplinary stroke teams.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design</title><p>A cluster-controlled observer-blinded design was used in line with Medical Research Council (MRC) recommendations,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> where the intervention targets health professionals in order to study the subsequent impact on patient outcomes, protecting against contamination across trial groups where patients are managed within the same setting.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Qualitative interviews, focus groups and ethnographic methods were used to investigate staff experiences and transfer of training to the workplace.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Settings</title><p>Two in-patient stroke rehabilitation units were identified, matched on the basis of: bed numbers; staffing levels; and estimated number of people with stroke admitted each year. We further determined similarity between units by collecting anonymised routine demographic and clinical discharge data on consecutive patients over a 5-month period before the trial onset (34 control and 28 intervention patients). There were no significant differences in: patient demographic characteristics; Therapy Outcome Measures (aphasia),<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> impairment and activity scores at admission and discharge; mean length of stay (LOS) on the units; distribution of stroke types (lacunar stroke (LACS); partial anterior infarct (PACS); posterior circulation stroke (POCS); and total anterior circulation infarct (TACS)). Only &#x02018;LOS on previous (acute) unit&#x02019; was significantly higher for the intervention site (11 (6&#x02013;18) vs 5.5 (2.5&#x02013;9) days, p=0.0002). Units were assigned to control and intervention site, based on the stroke unit from which staff and patient participants were recruited.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Patient and public involvement</title><p>Patient and public involvement (PPI) was integral to the study from bid development through trial conduct and dissemination. A collaborating group of people with aphasia prioritised staff training as a focus for the bid; conducted staff skills assessment, were involved in refining and delivering the intervention, and in disseminating findings. Two PPI collaborators were members of the Trial Steering Committee.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Ethics and informed consent</title><p>Ethical approval for the study was granted by the local research ethics committee (ref: 10/H0310/69).

In total we recruited 33 control and 37 intervention unit staff. Five control staff withdrew and three were unable to complete measures; five intervention staff withdrew and five were unable to complete measures.

This was considered a conservative approach as we did not wish to underestimate such costs. Implementation (pocket guide and pens) costs were estimated at &#x000a3;33.23. For 22/48 responses practising supported communication did not change usual staff-patient consultation time; for the remainder there was a mean increase of 4.2&#x02005;min. Based on the assumption of two consultations per day for the duration of the original in-patient admission this amounted to a cost of &#x000a3;233.33 per participant.

We investigated patient eligibility and collected data on the feasibility of patient recruitment, outcome assessment and collection of data for HE evaluation. The study provided the opportunity to adapt the intervention to the context of in-patient stroke rehabilitation and involve service users in its design and delivery. We were able to gain valuable insights into how all components of the protocol worked together, including the logistics of conducting a multicentre trial.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to test the feasibility of conducting a trial of SC training in an in-patient rehabilitation setting. Staff were recruited to target and retention was good, with only 14% withdrawing and 11% dropping out due to turnover. There was fair representation across professional groups, with over half from staff groups with high levels of patient contact (ie, Bands 2&#x02013;4). Training in the intervention was generally viewed positively, with the involvement of trainers with aphasia highly regarded by staff; their inclusion throughout the study enabled us to ensure that training content was relevant to patient needs, and dissemination strategies reflected patient perspectives as well as academic and clinical ones (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM6">online supplementary file</xref> 6). Transfer of training into day-to-day practice and use of the intervention were found to be acceptable; we developed good insights into how experiences varied across staff groups and grades, and were able to collect video-observations to assess adherence and explore aspects of practice not revealed through interviews or focus group discussions. Close collaboration with clinical teams enabled us to gain an understanding of patient eligibility and recruitment issues in the subacute stage; and to demonstrate the feasibility of collecting anonymised routine data relevant to rehabilitation outcomes, including psychosocial impact (TOMS Well-Being). The feasibility of conducting an economic evaluation was demonstrated by the reasonable response rates for completion of EQ-5D-3L at baseline, discharge and follow-up. The staff learning log was a novel approach not only to sustaining staff awareness of the intervention, but allowed us to collect data on the impact of the intervention on staff time and hence more accurate costs.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM6"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2016-011207.supp6</object-id><label>Supplementary data 6</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss6" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-011207supp6.pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material><p>Although we were able to collect patient self-reported outcome data, there were insufficient numbers to conduct a power calculation. Many patients were deemed unable to consent or still too ill to be approached within the required time-frame, with 62% (n=47/76) of those on the intervention unit and 82% (n=81/99) on the control unit deemed ineligible. Pretrial anonymised clinical data showing higher &#x02018;LOS on previous (acute) unit&#x02019; for intervention patients are open to a number of interpretations&#x02014;for example, differences in local practices; location of acute and rehabilitation units; patients with greater recovery on admission to the rehabilitation unit. However, no other measures suggested systematic differences in patients admitted to the 2&#x02005;units. On the other hand, anonymised data collected during the trial show significant differences in TOMS admission scores (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016011207TB3">table 3</xref>) between units, and a considerably higher proportion of patients were deemed to lack capacity on the control (64%, n=52/81) compared with the intervention (15%, n=7/47) unit. We are unable to comment specifically on this finding as data were not prospectively and systematically collected on this aspect of the recruitment process. Attrition was another factor, with 6 (30%) patient withdrawals, some due to fatigue and a lack of willingness to engage in lengthy self-report measures, even though we offered to complete these assessments over more than one session. Little training was provided in the control arm, and we were unable to make training effectiveness comparisons between groups due to problems establishing inter-rater reliability in the chosen outcome measure for this part of the study.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Recruitment and training of staff</title><p>Despite management buy-in, a commitment to the study at organisational level,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> and staff enthusiasm for being involved in research with the opportunity to gain new skills,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> there were considerable barriers to accessing staff in a timely fashion, due to shift patterns; lack of consistent avenues of communication; non-attendance; and lack of appropriate venues, all adding to overall training costs.
