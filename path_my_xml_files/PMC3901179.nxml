couples, while fulfilling such a need is related to
their ability of fertility. Infertility means inability
of becoming pregnant after one year of sexual intercourse
without use of contraceptives (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The
prevalence rate of infertility in different countries
varies from 5 to 30 percent. About 20% of couples
in developed countries are infertile (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In Iran, approximately,
two million couples are infertile (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Infertile individuals experience a strong psychological
stress. This stress could affect the relationship
between man and woman (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The infertile individuals
experience the symptoms of depression,
grief, loss of control and high levels of anxiety (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).
In a very recent study, the main emotional disorders
of 500 couples from different socio-economic
milieu were shock, anxiety, depression, marital
disharmony, anger, feelings of guilt, frustration
and sense of failure. The infertile couples had, in
all mentioned factors, poor well-being than normal
couples, so they were susceptible to more physical
and psychological stressors (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Some studies
reported that the level of depression and anxiety in
infertile people is equal to cancer patients (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). A
new study reported depression in 57% and anxiety
in 67.2% of infertile women (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>There are different reasons for psychological
problems in infertile people. In societies with cultural
norms considering high value for the role of woman as a mother, the consequences of infertility
are more severe, and some results such as instability
of common life, home violence and loneliness
have been observed (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Different methods of fertility
treatment also cause the symptoms of anxiety
and depression in 10 to 50% of women (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).
After the unsuccessful treatment of zygotic embryos
in vitro fertilization (IVF), 25% of women
become depressed (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In addition, psychological
factors can play a main role in inducing
infertility, whereas these factors can be regarded
as the consequence of infertility, as well (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The
psychological crisis and the concerns caused by
infertility have a direct effect on physiological
functions of body and ultimately, a negative influence
on infertility (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The relaxed and healthy individuals
experience less psychological tensions,
and that consequently increases the possibility of
their fertility (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>The reported evidences about the tensions resulted
in infertility have suggested that fertility
treatment should be followed by psychological
treatment (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). One study (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) found that psychological
interventions improved some patients&#x02019;
chances of becoming pregnant. Although, Boivin
(<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) reported that group interventions using educational
and skills training classes were more effective
than methods applying emotional expression
and/or discussion about thoughts and feelings related
to infertility. One of the psychological treatments
which is in line with needs of such couples
is Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT). Infertility,
as a source of tension, interferes with emotions
(<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In EFT, emotions have central role in couple&#x02019;s
interactions. This approach encourages individuals
to talk about their emotions, to discuss
about the related subject tin the therapy sessions
(<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and to emphasize the restructuring of emotions
to secure attachment bonds between partners.
Emotional responses can lead to the fulfillment of
the person&#x02019;s needs, and accordingly, improvement
of one&#x02019;s awareness toward emotions is the most
fundamental goal of such treatment. Emotion is
seen as target and agent of change (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Harway
(<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) in a review of some couples therapies (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>-<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>)
concluded that behavioral marital treatment and
EFT had powerful theoretical basis, and were experimentally
valid.</p><p>Although both men and women need psychological
treatments, depression and anxiety disorders
are highly prevalent among women visiting an assisted
reproduction clinic for a new course of the
treatment (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Treatment of infertility is a severe
stressors process, and many women undergoing
fertility treatment experience significant emotional
distress (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p><p>Some studies have investigated infertility and
the effectiveness of EFT on couple therapy among
Iranian populations. A study on 150 Iranian infertile
women showed that infertility, accompanied
by numerous psychological and social problems,
could affect personal, social and marital relationships,
resulting in mental instability and divorce
(<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The effectiveness of EFT on marital adjustment
in an Iranian sample was investigated (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).
EFT resulted in increasing positive feelings of
couples toward each other and marital adjustment.
Studying the effects of EFT or attachment styles
of Iranian couples showed that EFT significantly
decreased anxiety and avoidance of couples, while
improving the couples&#x02019; attachment style (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The
effectiveness of EFT on treatment of other psychological
disorders in Iranian couples has already
been reported (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).</p><p>Because infertility implies strong psychological
stress on the individuals, and that influences their
relationships with their partners, the purpose of
this study was to investigate the application of psychological
methods, as complementary treatments,
on Iranian infertile couples in order to decrease depression,
anxiety and stress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Research method</title><p>
The present research was a semi-experimental
study including the experimental and the control
groups, and on the basis of pre-and post-test comparison
of data. The study was approved by the
Ethics Committee of the Shahed University.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>
Participants were recruited from Navid Institute,
a well-known fertility center, in Tehran, Iran, using
convenience sampling method. This institute
was chosen as a main center due to large number
of attendances. The couples were diagnosed as infertile
by an experienced infertility specialist. The
depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), a self-report questionnaire, was completed by all
participants. Patients were also visited by an experienced
clinical psychologist. Those subjects with
a history of alcohol and substance abuse, brain
damage and any other psychiatric disorders, as
measured by DSM-IV-R, were excluded from the
study. The desired sample was selected from the
infertile couples who, according to DASS, had severe
rates (95-98) of depression, anxiety and stress
symptoms. The total number of the sample was 63
couples among whom 12 couples with high levels
of depression, anxiety and stress were selected
(six couples with infertile men and sixcouples with
infertile women). Then, the selected couples were
randomly divided into the control (n=6 couples)
and the experimental groups (n=6 couples). All
subjects participated in the study, voluntarily. They
declared their satisfaction to participate in the sessions
on the basis of a satisfaction form. They also
signed a consent form. All respondents answered
the questions on demographic issues like gender,
age, and educational level.</p></sec><sec><title>Instruments</title><sec><title>Socio-demographic characteristics questionnaire</title><p>In order to obtain the necessary information
from the couples, a questionnaire with the following
parts was designed: name, name of his/
her spouse, age, educational level, job, income,
sexuality, cause of infertility, duration of infertility,
number of surgical operations, date of the last
surgery, history of participating in any other psychotherapy
and infertility counseling sessions, and
history of chronic mental and physical illnesses.</p></sec><sec><title>Depression, anxiety and stress scale</title><p>
DASS was developed by Lovibond S.H and Lovibond
P.F (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) to measure the symptoms of anxiety and
depression. This questionnaire consists of 42 items
related to the symptoms, liked epression, anxiety and
stress. The depression subscale is composed of items
measuring patients&#x02019; features, like an hedonia, sadness,
life futility, worthlessness, hopelessness, unable
to become enthusiastic, difficult to work up initiative,
lack of energy, lack of self-confidence and nothing
to look forward. Anxiety subscale includes items
evaluating physiological arousal, phobias and situational
anxiety. Stress subscale includes items, such
as difficulty in achieving relaxation, state of nervous
tension, agitation, overreaction to situations, irritability
and restlessness. After reading each item, subjects
should rate the severity/frequency of the symptom
during the week before in a 4 degree scale (from 0
to 3). Each subscale of depression, anxiety and stress
has 14 items, and participant&#x02019;s score in each subscale
is obtained by the sum of all items related to a subscale.
In a study with a non-clinical population, the
internal consistency of depression, anxiety and stress
subscales were, respectively, 0.91, 0.84 and 0.90 (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>),
while in a study with a clinical population, the internal
consistency of these subscales were, respectively,
0.96, 0.93 and 0.89 (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). The re-test coefficients of
the three subscales of DASS in a sample of 20 patients
with a 2-week interval were 0.71 to 0.81. The
3-factor structure 0f DASS has been approved in different
studies. The reliabilities of DASS on the basis
of Cronbach alpha, in a study done in Iran (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), were
0.93 for subscales depression, 0.85 for anxiety and
0.87 for stress. Criteria validity of this test showed
that correlation coefficient between the scores of
depression subscale and Beck depression score was
0.85, anxiety subscale and Zung anxiety scale was
0.83, as well as stress subscale and students stress
scale was 0.76. All these findings were significant
(p&#x0003c;.01). DASS is interpreted using cut-off scores.
Lovibond S.H and Lovibond P.F (35) classified the
subjects as normal (0-78), mildly disturbed (78-
87), moderately disturbed (87-95), severely disturbed
(95-98) and extremely severely disturbed
(98-100). In the present study, subjects completed
a Persian version of DASS-42 translated by Afzali
et al. (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Emotionally focused therapy program</title><sec><title>

is described in more details:</p><p>In this session, the couples introduced themselves,
individually. The therapist also introduced
himself, and then talked about his intervention
program. The therapist then explained
the consultation process and let the couple
know that he understood their aims and needs.
He tried to convince them that he was ready
to help them. He asked about their reasons for
seeking therapy. Each patient was asked to talk
individually about his/her problem. The therapist
paid special attention to the patients&#x02019; initial
emotional reactions like crying, blushing,
emotional imbalances, etc. He listened to their
life story, encouraged them to say more, paid
attention to negative/harmful views, organized
them as part of a negative cycle, as well as carefully
observed their behavior and the way they
responded to each other, including where they
sat. Attention to the reactions shown by each
one of the couple toward the other and the type
of emotional, cognitive, behavioral, and interpersonal
interactions that they manifested,
in response to questions raised, could help to
find suitable solutions for their problems. The
therapist continued with structured-questions,
and directed the session toward their emotional
bonds. The therapist then developed his own
hypothesis on the main obstacles damaging
friendly ties and accordingly resulting in emotional
challenges between the couples. He then
analyzed the interactions in terms of emotional,
cognitive, behavioral and interpersonal relations
of the couples, in an attempt to formulate
a proper interaction pattern.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedure</title><p>Subjects completed the socio-demographic characteristics
questionnaire and DASS in Navid Institute.
After completing the questionnaires, 12
couples who had high scores on DASS were selected
and randomly assigned as experimental and
control groups. Six couples went through couple
therapy sessions, while the other six couples, as
control group, just waited to be treated. After ending
the sessions, both groups again completed the
DASS. The therapy sessions were carried out by
the first author of the article at the family health

emotional
reactions like depression, anxiety and stress. The
effectiveness of EFT in order to reduce the rate of
negative emotions of infertile couples in different
cultures and societies has been reported. Meanwhile,
some studies have reported the effectiveness
of EFT in treating other problems in therapy
sessions arranged for families and couples in Iran.
The present study investigated the effect of EFT
on decreasing negative emotions in Iranian infertile
couples. The findings indicated that EFT could
reduce the rate of depression, anxiety and stress in
this group.</p><p>These findings are consistent with the results of
some studies in different cultures (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>-<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) which
have referred to the effectiveness of EFT in reducing
emotional discomforts. According to other
studies, compared to pharmacotherapy, EFT was
more effective in reducing depression among couples
(<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), especially for couples with anxious wife
(<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). The findings of present study are in line with
the findings of some studies in Iran, according to
which EFT elevated the couples&#x02019; positive feelings
toward each other resulting in marital adjustment
(<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>); in addition, it significantly decreased anxiety
and avoidance of couples, while improving their
attachment style (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>It is important to consider that such positive effects
may be rooted in the characteristics of EFT
because the program only focuses on emotions,
and the aim is to complete catharsis of each couple&#x02019;s
emotions. The therapist should discuss issues
such as discovering attachment insecurity and couples&#x02019;
fears, clarifying the emotional key response,
developing emotional experiences of couples,
deepening individual relationship with emotional
experience, deepening emotional struggles, identifying
the basic fears and ultimately inducing secure
attachment in the sessions; this can be one of
the reasons for the effectiveness of EFT pattern
among these couples. Therefore, we selected couples
who had an emotional disorder (depression,
anxiety and stress) and a specific problem (infertility)
because emotional problems such as depression,
anxiety and stress are very familiar experiences
for couples with infertility. The main focus
was, therefore, the problems of infertile couples
and the effectiveness RFT pattern in treating such
groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Infertile couples experience negative emotions
like anxiety, stress, and especially depression
which could result in social and marital problems.
Fertility problem involving man or woman is a
problematic issue in Iranian society. It was revealed
that EFT can reduce the rate of depression, anxiety
and stress in Iranian infertile couples. Therefore,
due to its significant effect in preventing severe
psychological problems, EFT is recommended as
a remedy for reducing infertility problems. The infertile
persons are encouraged to use psychological
services. Nonetheless, it is necessary to mention
that this study used just a limited number of
subjects with infertility problems. Also, the study
did not investigate the effect of the participants&#x02019;
sex, although it may have a share in inducing emotional
problems. As well as, the cause of infertility
can play an important role in psychological disorders
of patients, but it was not investigated in this
research. The future studies can account for such
limitations. Despite such limitations, the current
study proved to be a success; however, the question
still waiting to be answered is whether future
studies would supports the findings of the current
work. Undoubtedly, execution of a significant
number of studies on intensive emotional therapy,
in different groups of patients, under various
socio-cultural conditions could indicate if there is
sufficient evidence to remain positive for similar
interventions in future.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors declare that they have no conflict
