However, the long-term clinical outcome of these interventions is not established. Our aim was to establish whether an e-counselling program is independently associated with improved clinical outcomes over a 12-month period, as defined by the following criteria: (1) reduction of systolic BP, diastolic BP, pulse pressure and associated risk factors for cardiovascular events; and (2) adherence to self-management behaviour (diet, exercise, smoke-free living and prescribed medication).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>Reducing risk with e-based support for adherence to lifestyle change in hypertension is a two-parallel group, double-blind randomised controlled trial that will utilise a two (Groups: e-counselling vs control) by three (assessment intervals: baseline, 4-month and 12-month outcome) design. BP, lipoprotein cholesterol, physical activity and dietary behaviours and psychological distress will be measured at each assessment. We plan to recruit 528 participants (35&#x02013;74&#x02005;years of age) diagnosed with stage 1 or 2 hypertension (systolic BP, 140&#x02013;180&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg; diastolic BP 90&#x02013;110&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg) from three major cities (Toronto, London, Vancouver) and one rural area (Grey Bruce region) across Canada between February 2012 and July 2015.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> This is a matter of concern as the risk of cardiovascular mortality among adults 40&#x02013;69&#x02005;years of age rises with elevated blood pressure (BP), doubling with each increase of 20mm&#x02005;Hg systolic or 10&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg diastolic, from the base index of 115/75&#x02005;mmHg.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></p><p>Best practice guidelines in North America<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> and Europe<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> advocate the strategy of combining pharmacotherapy with lifestyle counselling for patients diagnosed with hypertension and/or those who are at elevated risk for CVD. Meta-analyses indicate that programs aimed at improving self-management behaviours significantly decrease systolic BP (SBP) by 3.0&#x02013;8.7&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg relative to controls.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8 R9 R10">8&#x02013;10</xref> A major challenge for a community-based CVD prevention strategy is to extend the reach of therapeutic lifestyle counselling to individuals with hypertension and/or high CVD risk without overtaxing patient care resources. Currently, 73% of the Canadian population reports personal access to the internet, which includes 61&#x02013;69% of Canadians in the two lowest income quartiles, and 61% of older Canadians (aged 55&#x02013;64&#x02005;years).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> The use of e-based programs that are designed to improve self-management behaviours for diet, exercise, smoke-free living and medication adherence may be well suited to meet this challenge.</p><p>Our previous trials of COHRT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> and I-START<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> have shown that it is feasible to apply an evidence-based model of behavioural counselling with motivational interviewing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> to a telehealth or e-based program in order to achieve a reduction in SBP, diastolic BP (DBP) and pulse pressure (PP). This was achieved by means of increased adherence to self-reported diet and exercise, and it was independent of the therapeutic benefit of medications. However, it is not established whether e-counselling improves clinical outcome and adherence over a long-term interval of at least 12&#x02005;months. Thus, the aim of the reducing risk with e-based support for adherence to lifestyle change in hypertension (REACH) trial is to establish whether an e-counselling program is independently associated with improved clinical outcomes over a 12-month period, as defined by the following criteria: (1) reduction of BP and associated risk factors for cardiovascular events; and (2) adherence to self-management behaviour for diet, exercise, smoke-free living and prescribed medication.</p><p>Our primary hypotheses are that e-counselling (vs control) will significantly reduce (1) SBP, DBP and PP at the 4-month and 12-month assessment intervals, as measured by a validated protocol for automated BP assessment in the clinic; and (2) lipoprotein cholesterol (total, low-density and total/high-density ratio) and the Framingham index of 10-year absolute risk for CVD.</p><p>Our secondary hypotheses are that e-counselling (vs control) will significantly increase adherence to self-management behaviours at the 4-month and 12-month outcomes, as measured by the following objective and validated indices: mean 4-day step count recorded by a triaxial pedometer, dietary sodium &#x02264;100&#x02005;mmol/day measured by 24&#x02005;h urinary sodium, smoke-free living measured by salivary cotinine, fruit and vegetable intake &#x02265;9&#x02013;12 servings/day as measured by the Diet History Questionnaire (DHQ) assessment and physical activity &#x02265;150&#x02005;min/week as measured by the Recent Physical Activity Questionnaire (RPAQ); and medication adherence as defined by the medication possession ratio (derived from the pharmacy refill data) among participants who are prescribed antihypertensive medications at baseline.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>REACH is a two-parallel group, double-blind randomised controlled trial that will utilise a two (groups: e-counselling vs control) by three (assessment intervals: baseline, 4-month and 12-month outcome) design.

Among participants not prescribed medication, hypertension status will be confirmed at baseline by a medical doctor or a nurse practitioner. Participants prescribed antihypertensive drugs will be required to have the prescription unchanged for at least 2&#x02005;months before enrolment. In order to prevent &#x02018;floor effects&#x02019; for the analysis of primary outcomes, participants prescribed antihypertensive medications will also be required to have a baseline BP that is at least in the high normal range (SBP&#x02265;130mm&#x02005;Hg and/or DBP&#x02265;85mm&#x02005;Hg).

From a methodological perspective, it is a priority to balance e-based support across the control and experimental arms of the trial to ensure that potential improvement in clinical outcome is not confounded by differences in non-specific support and attention. Therefore, controls will be supported with educational material that will include brief articles on heart healthy living that are selected from the Resources section of the Heart and Stroke Foundation Blood Pressure Action Plan. The e-based articles for controls will provide information regarding appointments with physicians, BP measurement, lifestyle and antihypertensive medication.</p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>e-Counselling</title><p>Participants will receive e-messages that will guide them in self-assessing their current stage of motivational readiness for adhering to self-management behaviours as a daily lifestyle routine. These participants will be directed to select their behaviour change priority according to the recommended goals for exercise, diet, smoke-free living and adherence to prescribed antihypertensive medications. In keeping with the guidelines from motivational interviewing, participants will be sent an e-counselling message that is tailored to their self-reported stage of readiness for change. Each message will provide a link to the e-counselling program on the Heart and Stroke Foundation website. A menu of stage-appropriate e-resources for lifestyle change will be presented which will include brief video-taped counselling messages that validated to each participant's presenting stage of readiness for change. This feedback will be supplemented by online self-monitoring charts and e-handouts that provide guidelines/tips for initiating or maintaining lifestyle change.

The stages of change are conventionally defined as follows: precontemplation (not ready to adhere to the target behaviour in the next 6&#x02005;months), contemplation (ready to adhere to the target behaviour in the next 6&#x02005;months), preparation (ready to adhere to the target behaviour in the next 4&#x02005;weeks), action (adhere to the behaviour but for less than 6&#x02005;months) and maintenance (adhere to the behaviour for 6&#x02005;months or more).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2e6"><title>Psychological distress</title><p>Diagnostic screening tools will be used to assess anxiety and depression: Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, respectively. Psychological stress will be assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale. The validity and reliability of these questionnaires are well established.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23 R24 R25">23&#x02013;25</xref></p></sec></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size estimation was based on the meta-analysis by Neubeck <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> who evaluated the efficacy of randomised controlled trials of preventive telehealth and e-based programs in modifying BP: weighted mean difference in SBP between experimental versus control groups=&#x02013;4.69&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg, common pooled variance=354, pooled SD=18.81. In order to replicate this outcome, the estimated sample=254 participants per group (using a two-parallel group design, type 1 error=5% and power=80%). Dropouts from this study will be interpreted as an intervention failure. Therefore, we will recruit a sample of 528 participants.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Linear Mixed Models with a random effects intercept will be used to evaluate whether within-participant change across assessment intervals is independently and significantly associated with the e-counselling group, for each primary and secondary outcome.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> Generalised estimation equations for repeated measures will be used to analyse categorical outcomes (eg, smoking cessation status).

Ethics approval will be renewed on an annual basis.</p><p>Meta-analytic evidence clearly supports the use of lifestyle counselling to reduce SBP and risk for premature mortality. Programs aimed at improving self-management behaviours significantly decrease SBP by 3&#x02013;8.7&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg relative to controls.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8 R9 R10">8&#x02013;10</xref> In order to optimise the efficacy of lifestyle change interventions, it is essential to develop strategies to sustain long-term adherence to recommended self-management behaviours.</p><p>Once the long-term efficacy of preventive e-counselling is established as exemplified by this trial, it is likely that this strategy will become increasingly prominent in the development of community-based initiatives for CVD prevention. This point is highlighted by evidence that there is only low-to-moderate long-term adherence to recommended standards for exercise, diet and smoke-free living following conventional behaviour change programs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28 R29 R30">28&#x02013;30</xref> Moreover, there is high potential to use e-counselling to increase long-term adherence to antihypertensive pharmacotherapy. Our team and others have reported that non-adherence to antihypertensive medication ranges from 15% to 50%,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
