Methods] The subjects were 30 healthy elderly people aged 65 or older. They were equally
and randomly divided into a visual block (VB) group (those whose eyes were covered) and a
visual permission (VP) group. The subjects performed the complex exercise program for 30
minutes, twice a day, five day a week for 4 weeks a total of 20 times. Outcome measures
were the10 meter walking test (10MWT), stair up/down test (SUDT), Berg balance scale
(BBS), vestibular stepping test (VST), proprioception test (PT). [Results] After the
intervention, the VB group showed improvements in 10MWT, VST, and PT. The VP group showed
improvements in 10MWT and PT. The significant improvement in VST observed in the VB group
was significantly greater than that in the VP group. [Conclusion] The complex exercise
program for elderly people helped enhance their balance ability and gait, and improved
their vestibular sense.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Complex exercise</kwd><kwd>Elderly</kwd><kwd>Visual block</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The proportion of elderly people aged 65 or older is for 9.1% of Korea&#x02019;s population. The
nation is expected to enter an aging society in 2018 with the elderly comprising up 14.3% of
the total population<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Due to the aging
process, physical changes such as decreased balance, atrophy of neurological functions,
reduced gait ability, and the weakening of muscle strength occur increasing the risk of
falls. A fall may restrict activities of daily living, leading to loss of independence, and
increase medical costs hospitalization<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.
As a sequela of a fall, activities of the elderly may be through loss of independence,
decrease in physical activity, and fear of another fall.</p><p>The factors that trigger a fall are divided into internal and external factors. Internal
factors are visual disturbance, weakened lower limb muscle strength, reduced balance and
gait ability, cognitive disorder, chronic diseases, and administration of medication.
External factors include an unsafe environment<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Balance results from appropriate interaction between the senses, movement, and the
cognitive system<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Visual sense plays an
important role in perceiving space and distance, and risks from the surrounding environment.
Visual sense also provides information on the location of each part of the body, and the
required intensity of effort for postural adjustment<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The vestibular system provides information on the movements of the
head and the location of the head related to gravity or inertial force. Proprioceptive
senses include the position sense that senses the locations of joints, and kinesthesia that
senses the movements of joints. These senses continuously maintain and correct posture, and
enable conscious perception of body movements<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. If information from the visual sense is not precise, the central
nervous system ignores visual input and depends on accurate vestibular and proprioceptive
inputs<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In research conducted on elderly people, balance ability has been found to correlate with
function of the somatosensory system of the lower extremities, and although there is high
correlation between proprioceptive sense and balance maintenance ability, the visual and the
vestibular senses have been found to be auxiliary factors of balance maintenance<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the rehabilitation of hemiplegic
patients, when somatosensory and vestibular sense information is utilizated in a
compensatory balance strategy, more effective balance improvement was observed when the
visual sense was blocked<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The present study conducted a complex exercise program for elderly people who had
experienced a fall, to investigate the changes in their balance, gait, vestibular senses,
and proprioceptive senses when their visual sense was blocked, to assess the program&#x02019;s
utility as a fall prevention program.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 30 healthy elderly people aged 65 or older registered with
a welfare center located in J City, Jeollabuk-do. They understood the purpose of this study
and voluntarily consented to participate in this study. This study was approved by welfare
center, and all the participants provided their written informed consent. The subject were
equally and randomly divided into a VB (visual block) group (those whose eyes were covered)
and a VP (visual permission) group (those whose eyes were not covered) through coin
flipping. The average age and height of the VP group were 71.9&#x02005;years old and 154.5&#x02005;cm,
respectively, and the average age and height of the VB group were 73.2&#x02005;years old and
153.5&#x02005;cm, respectively, with no significant differences between the two groups (p = 0.64).
The weight of the VP group was 63.26&#x02005;kg and that of the VB group was 59.48&#x02005;kg, with no
significant difference (p = 0.46). The criteria for inclusion as the subjects of this study
were: a fall event in the last three months. The exclusion criteria were: lesion in the
central or peripheral nerves; mental disorder; orthopedic problem in the lower limbs;
cardiopulmonary disease; or taking medicine that would affect balance ability.</p><p>The subjects performed a complex exercise program for 30 minutes, twice a day, five days a
week for four weeks, a total of 20 times. The VB group wore an eye shade during exercise.
After safety education for five minutes, the subjects conducted stretching exercise for 10
minutes, took a rest for three minutes, walked on a treadmill and pedaled on a cycle
ergometer for 10 minutes, took a rest for three minutes again, and walked on a track with
obstacles with the help of an assistant for 10 minutes.</p><p>For outcome measurement, the following instruments were used. For the 10 meter walking test
(10MWT), the subjects walked at a comfortable speed over a distance of 14 meter. In
consideration of acceleration and deceleration, the time taken to walk the 10 meter
excluding the first and last 2 meter was measured<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. For the stair up/down test (SUDT), the subjects ascended and
descended stairs whose width was 135&#x02005;cm, whose height was 15&#x02005;cm, and whose depth was 30&#x02005;cm.
The average time of the two measurements was calculated. The rest time between each
measurement was 30 seconds<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The berg
balance scale (BBS) has a total of 14 assessment items which are categorized into three
areas: sitting, standing, and postural change. Each item is scored on a 5-point scale with a
minimum score of zero (cannot perform at all) and a maximum score of four (can perform
normally). The scores of each item are summed and the minimum score (zero) indicates &#x0201c;very
severe damage&#x0201d; and the maximum score (56 points) indicates &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d;; a lower score suggests
a higher risk of fall<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The methods of
measurement were demonstrated to the subjects with explanation and then measurements were
taken. In the vestibular stepping test (VST), the subjects put on an eye patch and walked on
the spot for one minute<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Then, distance
from the start point was measured. The subjects stood barefoot in a comfortable position
with the right big toe over a circle with a radius was 1&#x02005;cm. The subjects concentrated on
not deviating from the circle while walking on spot. After one minute, the deviation
distance was recorded. After one practice, the subjects performed the test twice, and the
average value was calculated. In the proprioception test (PT), the subjects had their eyes
covered with an eye patch and stood in front of a paper whose width and length were marked
at intervals of 0.1&#x02005;cm. The subjects put their right foot on the paper. Then the subjects
placed the left foot shoulder width apart with their the left big toe at the location the
subjects perceived to be in line with the right big toe. The difference in alignment of the
two big toes was calculated. After one practice, measurements were taken twice and the
average value was calculated.</p><p>For comparison between the groups, the independent t-test was used, and for within group
comparisons balance, gait, vestibular function, and proprioceptive senses between before and
after the training, the paired t-test was employed. The significance level was chosen as
&#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were significant improvements in 10MWT, VST, and PT in the VB group after the

performed with the eyes covered, to assess its utility as a program for improving the
balance and gait ability of elderly people who have experienced a fall. This study divided
the subjects into a VP group and a VB group. There were significant differences in 10MWT,
VST, and PT after the intervention in the VB group (p&#x0003c;0.05), and in 10MWT and PT after
the intervention in the VP group (p&#x0003c;0.05). However, there were no significant differences
in SUDT and BBS after the intervention in either group.</p><p>For elderly people to lead a safe and ordinary life, they need balance ability as well as
muscle strength. Decreased balance ability increases the risk of a fall and degrades their
quality of life. Therefore, research on postural and balance adjustment is being
continuously carried out. Decline in proprioceptive sense due to aging is closely related to
decreased balance ability, and the elderly complain of difficulties in activities of daily
living and movement<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, these
difficulties take place during walking and climbing stairs. In addition, because of
fracture, brain injury, or musculoskeletal system disease after a fall, elderly people&#x02019;s
fall is related to decreased self-confidence about balance and movement. Stolze et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> and Carmeli et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that performance of a complex exercise program
led to an improvement in balance ability, enhancements in muscle strength and endurance, and
an increase in gait speed. Their study results are similar to those of present study. Both
groups&#x02019; gait speed and balance improved in the present study because muscle strength was
enhanced by pedaling, stepping and treadmill training.</p><p>VST significantly changed after the intervention in the VB group, and there was also a
significant difference in VST between the two groups after the intervention. PT
significantly changed after the intervention in the VB group. The present study result was
similar to the results of a study that conducted muscle strengthening exercises for elderly
people<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. When visual senses are
blocked, muscle response is primarily organized and postural control is made more swiftly,
because maintenance of vestibular and proprioceptive senses increases the capabilities of
the postural control system. Some researchers also consider that the proprioceptive and
vestibular systems are engaged in balance control<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Research on balance and visual sense examines balance ability with subjects&#x02019; eyes open and
closed, but the present study measured balance ability after training with the eyes covered
and the uncovered. This method is a meaningful technique since the subjects participate in
the intervention without the visual sense completely blocked.</p><p>The limitations of this study are that the experimental period was short and the subjects&#x02019;
ordinary life was not controlled.</p><p>In conclusion, a complex exercise program for elderly people helped enhance their balance
ability and gait, and improved their vestibular senses.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This paper was supported by research funds provided by the Howon University.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Maki</surname><given-names>BE</given-names></name><name><surname>McIlroy</surname><given-names>WE</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Postural control in the older adult</article-title>.
