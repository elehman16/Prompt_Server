The main complaint of patients after open-heart surgery is dysrhythmia, tachycardia, and hypertension due to stress and pain. Due to the side effects of chemical drugs, such as opioids, use of non-invasive methods such as aromatherapy for relieving stress and pain parallel to chemical agents could be an important way to decrease the dose and side effects of analgesics. </p><p>In a multicenter, single-blind trial, 40 patients who had open-heart surgery were recruited. Inclusion criteria were full consciousness, lack of hemorrhage, heart rate &#x0003e;60 beats/min, systolic blood pressure &#x0003e; 100 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure &#x0003e; 60 mmHg, not using beta blockers in the operating room or ICU, no history of addiction to opioids or use of analgesics in regular, spontaneous breathing ability and not receiving synthetic opioids within 2 h before extubation. Ten minutes after extubation, the patients&#x0203a; vital signs [including BP, HR, Central Venous Pressure (CVP), SPO2, and RR] were measured. Then, a cotton swab, which was impregnated with 2 drops of Lavender essential oil 2%, was placed in patients&#x02019; oxygen mask and patients breathed for 10 min. Thirty minutes after aromatherapy, the vital signs were measured again. Main objective of this study was the change in vital sign before and after aromatherapy. Statistical significance was accepted for P &#x0003c; 0.05. There was a significant difference in systolic blood pressure (p &#x0003e; 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.001), and heart rate (p = 0.03) before and after the intervention using paired t-test. Although, the results did not show any significant difference in respiratory rate (p = 0.1), SpO2 (p = 0.5) and CVP (p = 0.2) before and after inhaling Lavender essential oil. Therefore, the aromatherapy could effectively reduce blood pressure and heart rate in patients admitted to the open heart surgery ICU and can be used as an independent nursing intervention in stabilizing mentioned vital signs. The limitations of our study were sample size and lack of control group. Randomized clinical trials with larger sample size are recommended.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key Words</title><kwd>Aromatherapy</kwd><kwd>Lavender</kwd><kwd>Vital Sings</kwd><kwd>Open-heart surgery</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nowadays, heart surgery is one of the most common surgeries and the development of cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass techniques has reduced the mortality rates of these surgeries but it has its own side effects (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The problems in surgery are the neuroendocrine, metabolic, and inflammatory aspects of injury that are part of the overall &#x02018;stress response&#x02019; in relation to surgery. Catecholamines are released from the adrenal medulla and norepinephrine spills over from presynaptic nerve terminals in response to hypothalamic stimulation. Marked activation of the sympathetic nervous system results in tachycardia, hypertension and other side effects (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Whatever the extent of the surgery is greater, equally the physiological changes that occur are greater like heart surgery (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). All heart surgeries make variable levels of pain and postoperative pain for patients, which are not negligible at all (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Researches have shown that patients that their postoperative pain is poorly controlled may experience heart failure and infection three and five times more than others, respectively (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Moreover, open-heart surgery pain and stress occur during 24-72 h after surgery (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and it usually increases by stressful environmental factors and surgical conditions like coughing, movement, and changing position (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Meanwhile, open-heart surgery pain causes ineffective respiration that will make a delay in leaving the bed, immobility, and stagnation of blood flow and the risk of pulmonary embolism (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Also, acute pain effects on the immune, respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and endocrine systems. In addition, the postoperative stress and pain actuate the sympathetic system that will cause to increase blood pressure, pulse, heart rate and breathing increases and becomes superficial as well. In fact, each of them increases oxygen demand required by the body, which will cause pressure on the heart muscle and subsequently, the pressure on the heart will increase. All these situations are very dangerous, especially in patients undergoing cardiac surgery (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Recent evidences indicated that the pain was not given appropriate and adequate care in more than 75% of open-heart surgery patients and patients had painful experiences of the time in hospital (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Wang <italic>et al.</italic> also wrote that although the pain of incision was inevitable, it was controllable and in the absence of rapid and appropriate controls, it could become severe and lead to chronic pain (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Besides, it could cause immobility, reduction of pulmonary ventilation, and consequently delayed recovery, prolonged hospital admission, and increasing the costs (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Postoperative stress and pain control are one of the major challenges for nurses. They can use pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Morphine is the most common used pain relievers after heart surgery (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The opioids have some unwanted side effects that may include nausea and vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, hypotension, constipation, and respiratory depression (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). It also can increase patient&#x0203a;s tolerance to the drugs (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Drugs are not the only way to control stress and pain, although they are the most effective available means for nurses (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Due to the side effects of chemical drugs and opioids, some procedures with low complications will be used to relieve the stress and pain as a nursing skill (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Conceivably, not only the use of non-invasive methods can be effective in relieving stress and pain but also the side effects of taking too many analgesics, which in many cases are threatening the health and lives of patients, can decrease. However, the patient suffering from stress and pain can benefit from various methods of complementary medicine. Among these, aromatherapy is a technique of using volatile oils, for psychological and physical health (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Specifically, efforts to scientifically demonstrate the effects of aromatherapy as a holistic intervention and as a relaxation mediator have been actively pursued in nursing (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Aromatherapy has been reported to reduce stress (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) as well as increasing sleep quality (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Previously, the effects of some other herb extracts were exanimate clinically (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>-<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>Lavender (<italic>Lavandula officinalis</italic>) from Labiatae family with many therapeutic properties is vastly used in the variety of aromatherapy methods (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The primary components of lavender oil are linalool (51%) and linalyl acetate (35%). Other components include &#x003b1;-pinene, limonene, 1,8-cineole, cis- and trans-ocimene, 3-octanone, camphor, caryophyllene, terpinen-4-ol, and lavendulyl acetate (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Applying a few drops of Lavender essential oil to handkerchief and inhaling it is useful for treating insomnia, fatigue, stress, and fear. Warm compress is used in menstrual cramps, stomachache, arthritis, migraines and muscle cramps (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p><p>It is the first assessment report of the effect of Lavender essential oil on vital signs in Open heart surgery ICU. The researchers studied on the effectiveness of aromatherapy with Lavender essential oil on vital signs of open-heart surgery patients with fewer side effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study is a single-blind clinical trial, which has the ethical approval from Ethics Committee of Islamic Azad University of Tehran Medical Branch and registered with code IRCT2013061813711N1 in Iranian registry of clinical trials, and was conducted on 40 patients who had undergone open-heart surgery, cardiac ICU departments in Moheb Hospital and Tehran Heart Center.

In order to reduce inhalation and skin absorption of the lavender, One drop of lavender oil was dropped to their ankle, the test patch was immediately covered with an occlusive dressing and removed after a two-minute exposure. Then, on the day of surgery, ten minutes after extubation, the vital signs were measured by a nurse. Then a cotton swab, which was impregnated with 2 drops of Lavender 2%, was placed in patients&#x02019; oxygen mask, and patients breathed for 10 min.
