physiological functions. [Subjects and Methods] This study enrolled 46 male and female
participants aged 21&#x02013;69&#x02005;years. In the experimental trial, participants walked at natural
paces for 15 minutes while chewing two gum pellets after a 1-hour rest period. In the
control trial, participants walked at natural paces for 15 minutes after ingesting powder
containing the same ingredient, except the gum base, as the chewing gum. Heart rates,
walking distances, walking speeds, steps, and energy expenditure were measured. [Results]
Heart rates during walking and heart rate changes (i.e., from at rest to during walking)
significantly increased during the gum trial compared with the control trial. Walking
distance, walking speed, walking heart rate, and heart rate changes in male participants
and walking heart rate and heart rate changes in female participants were significantly
higher during the gum trial than the control trial. In middle-aged and elderly male
participants aged &#x02265;40&#x02005;years, walking distance, walking speed, steps, and energy
expenditure significantly increased during the gum trial than the control trial.
[Conclusion] Gum chewing while walking measurably affects physical and physiological
functions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Walking</kwd><kwd>Gum chewing</kwd><kwd>Physical and physiological functions</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Obesity has become widespread, and a global obesity pandemic has been reported<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Obesity has been reported to be related to
the development of various chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular diseases, metabolic
diseases, musculoskeletal disorders, and cancer<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. To prevent the onset and progression of these chronic diseases,
effective preventive methods and treatments for obesity are needed.</p><p>Gum chewing has been reported to stimulate sympathetic nervous activity, and increase heart
rate and energy expenditure<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, because gum chewing increases the body&#x02019;s energy
expenditure, it may be an effective method of weight management. In addition, because
exercise increases the energy expenditure, gum chewing while simultaneously exercising is
expected to increase this metric more than either exercise or gum chewing alone. Combining
exercise and gum chewing may be an effective way to manage weight. However, although
previous studies have examined the effect of gum chewing while at rest on physiological
functions such as heart rate and energy expenditure, to date, no studies have focused
specifically on the effect of gum chewing while exercising. Currently, the effects of gum
chewing while exercising on physical functions as well as physiological functions are not
well understood. Walking is the most widely performed movement in Japan<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, this study focused on walking, and the effect
of gum chewing while walking on physical and physiological functions was investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study enrolled 50 participants aged 20s to 60s; five male and five female participants
were enrolled in each 10&#x02005;year age group. The participants were recruited so that there was
little variation in the body mass index (BMI) within each age group. The selection criteria
for this study required participants aged 20&#x02013;69&#x02005;years, have a BMI of 22&#x02013;30&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>
and with a habit of gum chewing at least once per week. Two prospective participants met the
study exclusion criteria (BMI &#x0003e;30&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and gum chewing less than once per
week), and two participants&#x02019; measurement values were outliers. Therefore, four participants
were excluded from the study, and 46 were ultimately included (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Characteristics of the participants</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><col width="14.5687%" span="1"/><col width="14.2386%" span="1"/><col width="14.2386%" span="1"/><col width="14.2386%" span="1"/><col width="14.2386%" span="1"/><col width="14.2386%" span="1"/><col width="14.2386%" span="1"/><thead><tr><th rowspan="3" align="left" colspan="1"/><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">All (n=46)</th><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">Young group (n=20)</th><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">Middle-aged/elderly group (n=26)</th></tr><tr><th colspan="6" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male (n=22)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Female (n=24)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male (n=10)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Female (n=10)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male (n=12)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Female (n=14)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">43.4 &#x000b1; 14.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">44.2 &#x000b1; 14.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">29.9 &#x000b1; 4.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">29.9 &#x000b1; 6.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">54.6 &#x000b1; 9.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">54.4 &#x000b1; 9.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">170.1 &#x000b1; 5.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">158.7 &#x000b1; 5.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">170.8 &#x000b1; 3.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">159.2 &#x000b1; 4.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">169.5 &#x000b1; 6.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">158.2 &#x000b1; 6.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Body mass (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">71.8 &#x000b1; 7.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.7 &#x000b1; 7.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">71.5 &#x000b1; 6.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.4 &#x000b1; 6.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">72.1 &#x000b1; 8.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.9 &#x000b1; 8.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24.8 &#x000b1; 2.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24.9 &#x000b1; 2.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24.5 &#x000b1; 2.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24.6 &#x000b1; 2.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.0 &#x000b1; 2.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.1 &#x000b1; 2.6</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>All values are given as the mean &#x000b1; SD.

Review Committee (approval number: 2016-314). Participants were briefed regarding this study
both orally and in writing, and their written informed consent was obtained.</p><p>This study was conducted as a two-arm, randomized, open crossover study. In the
experimental arm (gum trial), participants walked at a natural pace for 15 minutes while
chewing two pellets of gum after a 1-hour rest period. In the control trial, participants
walked at a natural pace for 15 minutes after ingesting powder containing the same
ingredient, except the gum base, as the chewing gum. This powder was provided to the
participants after being dissolved in 30&#x02005;ml of water. In the gum trial, participants
ingested 30&#x02005;ml of water before walking. The experiments were performed in our university&#x02019;s
sports hall at a temperature of 24 &#x000b1; 2&#x02005;&#x000b0;C [mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD)], with 47 &#x000b1; 9%
humidity.</p><p>In the gum trial, participants chewed two gum pellets (1.5&#x02005;g and 3&#x02005;kcal per pellet); in the
control trial, participants ingested water containing dissolved powder that contained the
same ingredients (6&#x02005;kcal) as the gum. The test material for the gum trial consisted of
maltitol, sweetener (xylitol), flavoring (apple flavor), thickener (gum arabic), starch, and
gum base. For the control trial, participants ingested a powder containing the same
ingredients, except the gum base, that were dissolved in water.</p><p>A heart rate monitor (RCX 3, Polar Co., Kempele, Finland) was attached to the chest, and
the heart rate was measured. The heart rate while walking and that at rest were measured,
and heart rate changes from at rest to during walking were calculated. The walking distance
was measured by having participants walk for 15 minutes on a 98.04&#x02005;m track in our
university&#x02019;s sports hall. Participants walked individually in a counterclockwise direction
and at a natural pace. The walking speed was calculated based on the walking distance and
time (15 minutes). A stride sensor (s3+ stride sensor W.I.N.D., Polar Co., Kempele, Finland)
was attached to the shoelaces of the participants&#x02019; right shoes, and cadence was measured.
The steps were calculated based on the cadence value. In addition, the oxygen uptake was
estimated based on the walking speed, and energy expenditure was calculated from the
estimated oxygen uptake value and participants&#x02019; body masses (using the American College of
Sports Medicine&#x02019;s formula)<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>:</p><p>Estimated oxygen uptake (ml/kg/min) = 3.5 (ml/kg/min) + 0.1 (ml/kg/m) &#x000d7; walking speed

differences between the trials were observed regarding the walking distance (control trial
vs. gum trial: 1,442 &#x000b1; 146 vs. 1,475 &#x000b1; 144 m/15 min), walking speed (96.2 &#x000b1; 9.8 vs. 98.3 &#x000b1;
9.6 m/min), resting heart rate (74 &#x000b1; 10 vs. 71 &#x000b1; 9 beats/min), walking heart rate (107 &#x000b1; 13
vs. 109 &#x000b1; 15 beats/min), and heart rate changes (33 &#x000b1; 9 vs. 38 &#x000b1; 8 beats/min). Energy
expenditure also exhibited statistically significant trends between the trials (69.4 &#x000b1; 10.3
vs. 70.5 &#x000b1; 10.1&#x02005;kcal/15 min, p=0.059). Among the female participants, significant
differences between the trials were observed with respect to the walking heart rate (114 &#x000b1;
13 vs. 118 &#x000b1; 12 beats/min) and heart rate changes (40 &#x000b1; 10 vs. 43 &#x000b1; 11 beats/min).</p><p>In the stratified analysis of the results obtained from the young and middle-aged/elderly
participant groups, heart rate changes (38 &#x000b1; 10 vs. 41 &#x000b1; 12 beats/min) in the young group
increased significantly during the gum trial than the control trial. In the
middle-aged/elderly group, the walking heart rate (110 &#x000b1; 16 vs. 115 &#x000b1; 15 beats/min) and
heart rate changes (36 &#x000b1; 10 vs. 40 &#x000b1; 9 beats/min) were also significantly higher during the
gum trial than the control trial.</p><p>A stratified analysis was performed with respect to male and female participants in the
young and middle-aged/elderly groups (<xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).
For male participants in the young group, no measurement items exhibited a statistically
significant difference. For male participants in the middle-aged/elderly group, significant
differences were observed between the trial results in the walking distance, walking speed,
steps, resting heart rate, walking heart rate, heart rate changes, and energy expenditure.
For female participants in the young group, heart rate changes increased significantly
during the gum trial compared with the control trial. Meanwhile, for female participants in
the middle-aged/elderly group, the walking heart rate increased significantly during the gum
trial compared with the control trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The results revealed that the heart rate increased when the participants chewed gum while
walking. This effect was particularly apparent in middle-aged and elderly male participants,
in whom the walking distance, heart rate, and energy expenditure (estimated from walking
speed) increased.</p><p>Gum chewing while at rest has been reported to stimulate sympathetic nervous activity, and
increase heart rate<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hasegawa et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that participants&#x02019; heart rates increased by 12 beats/min while chewing two sheets
of gum (5.8&#x02005;g) over a 5-minute period while at rest<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, Suzuki et al.<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that participants&#x02019; heart rates increased by 8 beats/min
while chewing two sheets of gum (6.18&#x02005;g) over a 10-minute period while at rest<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. By contrast, in the present study, the
participants&#x02019; heart rates increased by 3 beats/min while chewing two gum pellets (3&#x02005;g)
during a 15-minute walking period. Although the increases in heart rate during gum chewing
while walking were small, consistent with the results of previous studies<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>,
the present study found that the heart rate increased within the healthy range during gum
chewing.</p><p>An increase in energy expenditure was observed, particularly in middle-aged and elderly
male participants, due to gum chewing during walking. A previous study in which participants
chewed 8.4&#x02005;g of gum for 12 minutes while at rest reported that energy expenditure increased
by 2.4&#x02005;kcal due to gum chewing<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Meanwhile, here, chewing two gum pellets (3&#x02005;g) for 15 minutes during a walking task
increased the energy expenditure by 1.8&#x02005;kcal in the middle-aged and elderly male
participants. Energy expenditure was calculated based on the walking speed. The present
findings suggest that in middle-aged and elderly male participants, energy expenditure may
increase due to increased walking speed calculated by the walking distance and time. Since
gum chewing stimulates sympathetic nervous activity, and increases heart rate and energy
expenditure<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, gum chewing while walking may also affect energy expenditure.
However, further investigation is necessary to verify this conclusion.</p><p>In the present study, gum chewing while walking increased various physical functions of
middle-aged and elderly male participants, including walking distance and steps. Although
the mechanism by which gum chewing while walking increases these physical functions is
unknown, one possible mechanism is cardiac-locomotor synchronization (CLS) or
cardiac-locomotor coupling, which involves synchronization of the heart rhythm and locomotor
rhythm<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The physiological
significance of CLS is believed to arise from an increase in the maximum blood flow to
active muscles, reduced cardiac afterload, and increased systole volume accompanying
increased venous return<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. CLS is more
likely to occur in elderly people than in young people<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, middle-aged and elderly male participants exhibited
the greatest difference in the heart rate between the gum and control trials compared with
young male participants and young, middle-aged and elderly female participants. Gum chewing
increased the heart rate, and CLS possibly led to increases in the physical functions of
walking distance and steps.</p><p>The results of this study were affected by the participants&#x02019; gender and age. Previous study
indicated that females exhibit less masticatory muscle activity during chewing than males,
while it did not differ by age in males<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Masticatory muscle activity during chewing in middle-aged and
elderly females was less energy intensive than in young females<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The number of chews required to swallow food has also
been reported to increase with age; that is, the effectiveness of chewing decreases with
age<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. It may, therefore, be inferred
that, in this study, the effect of gum chewing while walking on physical and physiological
functions may be affected by differences in gender and age.</p><p>The number of chews while walking could not be measured due to methodological limitations.
In future studies, it will be necessary to measure the number of chews both at rest and
while walking to compare these values. It will also be necessary to measure the amount of
at-rest energy expenditure during gum chewing or after ingesting solutions containing the
same ingredients as gum, as in this study. Collecting these additional data can allow for
more detailed characterization of the effects of gum chewing while walking on physical and
physiological functions.</p><p>The present study demonstrated that gum chewing during walking had a measurable effect on
physical and physiological functions. These results also suggested that gum chewing during
walking may increase the physical and physiological functions of middle-aged and elderly
male participants in particular.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Funding</title><p>This study was supported by a research grant from Lotte Co., Ltd.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>S.K. and T.A. are employees of Lotte Co., Ltd. and were not involved in the data
