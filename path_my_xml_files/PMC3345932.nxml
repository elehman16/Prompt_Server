The significant benefit of acotiamide over placebo in OTE and elimination rate was maintained during the 4&#x02005;week post-treatment follow-up. All other secondary efficacy end points, including quality of life, were significantly improved with 100&#x02005;mg of acotiamide as compared with placebo. The number needed to treat was 6 for OTE and 16 for symptom elimination rate.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> Epidemiological surveys suggest that 20&#x02013;30% of the general population has <italic>dyspepsia</italic> over the course of a year and this percentage is reasonably consistent around the world.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> In Japan, about 25.6% of the population report dyspeptic symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> In most of these subjects, additional examinations fail to identify a cause for the symptoms and this is referred to as <italic>functional dyspepsia</italic> (FD).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> According to the Rome III consensus, FD is defined as the presence of symptoms thought to originate in the gastroduodenal region (postprandial fullness, early satiation, epigastric pain or burning), in the absence of any organic, systemic or metabolic disease that might explain the symptoms. FD has considerable impact on quality of life (QoL), healthcare use and loss of productivity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref></p><p>The underlying pathophysiology in FD is incompletely understood, possibly because of the heterogeneous nature of the disorder.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> Based on a presumed relationship between symptom pattern and underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, the Rome III consensus subdivided FD into two subcategories: postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) and epigastric pain syndrome.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> PDS; characterised by postprandial fullness and early satiation, is also referred to as meal-related FD, and is thought to be caused by disturbed gastric motor function.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> It has been suggested that this group of patients may respond to drugs that alter gastric motility, such as prokinetic and fundus-relaxing drugs, but to date no drug has been approved for the treatment of FD or PDS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref></p><p>Acotiamide (Z-338) is a first-in-class drug which exerts gastroprokinetic activity by enhancement of acetylcholine release.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> It does so by acting as an antagonist on muscarinic autoreceptors in the enteric nervous system and by inhibiting cholinesterase activity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9 b10 b11">9&#x02013;11</xref> Acotiamide may act directly on the gut and also indirectly through the brain&#x02013;gut axis via actions in the central nervous system.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> In animal models and in man, acotiamide enhances gastric emptying and gastric accommodation, two factors which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of PDS symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8 b9 b10 b11">8&#x02013;11</xref> In a rat model, acotiamide reversed stress-induced inhibition of gastric emptying and food intake.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> In phase II trials in Europe, the USA and Japan, acotiamide has been shown to have beneficial effects in FD, particularly for meal-related FD symptoms such as postprandial fullness, upper abdominal bloating and/or early satiation, without major adverse events.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13 b14 b15 b16">13&#x02013;16</xref> Based on the Japanese and European studies, 100&#x02005;mg three times a day was identified as the most effective dose.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref></p><p>In the present phase III, placebo-controlled trial, we aimed to determine the efficacy, safety and effect on QoL of oral acotiamide at a dose of 100&#x02005;mg three times a day for 4&#x02005;weeks, in patients with FD as defined by the Rome III classification.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase III trial was conducted at 67 centres in Japan over a period of 21&#x02005;months, from October 2008 to June 2010. For all evaluations, patients were asked to attend the centres after having fasted in the morning. The study design is summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Trial design. Daily dose: three times a day before meal.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gutjnl-2011-301454fig1"/></fig><p>The trial was conducted in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice Guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, the Declaration of Helsinki and local laws and regulations. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the ethics committees of participating centres. Written informed consent was obtained from every patient.</p></sec><sec><title>Eligibility of patients</title><p>We recruited Japanese patients with FD aged between 20 and 64&#x02005;years, who had FD-PDS as defined by the Rome III classification.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref></p><p>In agreement with the Rome III PDS definition, patients were included if they had had postprandial fullness or early satiation for at least 6&#x02005;months before inclusion. Patients were also eligible if they had had two or more of the following symptoms at a moderate or severe level within the previous 3&#x02005;months: upper abdominal pain, upper abdominal discomfort, postprandial fullness, upper abdominal bloating, early satiation, nausea, vomiting or excessive belching. Patients were not necessarily excluded if they had coexisting epigastric pain syndrome symptoms (epigastric pain, epigastric burning), but the symptom causing the most distress at the time of obtaining informed consent had to be one of the following meal-related symptoms: postprandial fullness, upper abdominal bloating or early satiation. All patients underwent upper abdominal endoscopy in the screening period. Those with any changes in the oesophagus, duodenum or in the stomach were excluded. Patients who had experienced heartburn within 12&#x02005;weeks before the baseline period were excluded. Patients with the comorbidity irritable bowel syndrome were excluded. <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> status was not assessed as part of the study.</p><p>The following exclusion criteria were also applied: presence of any symptom indicating serious or malignant disease, drug or alcohol abuse and severe abnormality in the electrocardiogram at rest or the clinical or laboratory examination during the baseline period. Anti-secretory drugs, antacids, prokinetics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antidepressant drugs were not allowed after the baseline period. Pregnant or breastfeeding women and those of childbearing age who were not using an approved method of contraception were also excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation</title><p>The 4-week treatment period was preceded by an 8-day baseline period after the screening visit and followed by a 4-week post-treatment follow-up period. Before undergoing randomisation at the end of the baseline period, patients had symptoms evaluated each week during the baseline period. Randomisation was performed with a computer-generated program. At the end of the baseline period, eligible patients were assigned a randomisation number according to a predetermined list at each centre. These numbers were allocated in sequential order and registered in the patient enrolment list and the allocation was concealed. Emergency envelopes containing the randomisation code were provided to the investigators and were examined at the end of the trial to ensure that the trial blinding had been maintained.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments</title><p>No universally accepted end point has been established for therapeutic trials in FD and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has provided no specific guidelines.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> A well-recognised approach is the assessment of global outcome by the &#x02018;overall treatment effect&#x02019; (OTE) approach, where the patients is asked at intervals during, or at completion of the treatment, whether symptoms have remained the same, improved or deteriorated compared with pretreatment phase.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> The advantage of this end point is that it closely resembles the way in which doctors evaluate treatment benefit in clinical practice, but it does imply recall of pretreatment symptom severity. OTE has been used as a secondary outcome measure in several therapeutic trials in FD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19 b20 b21 b22 b23">19&#x02013;23</xref> OTE was used most recently in the tegaserod FD studies, where a weekly global assessment of change was rated on a seven-point Likert scale and this end point generated the most consistent improvements with tegaserod over placebo.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> For our phase III study, OTE was evaluated weekly and severity ratings of individual symptoms were obtained in daily diaries using Likert scales. QoL was assessed using a validated scale.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref></p><sec><title>Symptoms and global assessment</title><p>During the 8-day baseline period, the 4-week treatment period and the 4-week post-treatment follow-up period, patients rated each of nine symptoms (upper abdominal pain, upper abdominal discomfort, postprandial fullness, upper abdominal bloating, early satiation, excessive belching, nausea, vomiting and heartburn) on a severity scale of 0&#x02013;3 (none, mild, moderate and severe) using paper diaries. Each week, patients completed a global assessment of the OTE questionnaire. The question asked was &#x02018;How were your gastric symptoms during the past week in comparison with the baseline period?&#x02019;. This was scored in the paper diaries on a seven-point Likert scale, ranging from &#x02018;extremely improved compared with the baseline period&#x02019;, &#x02018;improved compared with the baseline period&#x02019;, &#x02018;slightly improved compared with the baseline period&#x02019;, &#x02018;not changed&#x02019;, &#x02018;slightly aggravated compared with the baseline period&#x02019;, &#x02018;aggravated compared with the baseline period&#x02019; and &#x02018;extremely aggravated compared with the baseline period&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary efficacy end points</title><p>The two primary efficacy end points were OTE and elimination rate of all three cardinal symptoms: postprandial fullness, upper abdominal bloating and early satiation (no symptoms) at the last survey point.</p></sec><sec><title>Disease-specific QoL</title><p>To assess the effects of treatment on validated disease-specific QoL, the Japanese version of the Short Form-Nepean Dyspepsia Index questionnaire (SF-NDI)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> was used at baseline, at week 4 of treatment and week 4 of the post-treatment follow-up period. Data for 10 items were obtained and consisted of five subscales: tension, interference with daily activities, eating/drinking, knowledge/control and work/study. The scores ranged from 1 to 5, with lower scores indicating a better QoL.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Safety assessments</title><p>Data from patients who took at least one dose of the trial drug were included in the full analysis set (FAS) and safety population. Adverse events were reported at weeks 2 and 4 of treatment and week 4 of the post-treatment follow-up period. Vital signs were evaluated at the baseline visit, at week 4 of treatment and week 4 of the post-treatment follow-up period. Results of electrocardiography, clinical laboratory tests and physical examinations were evaluated at the baseline visit, at week 4 of treatment and at week 4 of the post-treatment follow-up period.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Based on our previous phase IIb trials, the proportions of the acotiamide and placebo responders for OTE were expected to be 50% and 40%. For elimination of all the three symptoms, proportions were expected to be 20% and 10%, respectively. The two-sided significance level was 0.05. A sample size of 820 (410 patients in each arm) was estimated to have at least 80% power to detect the differences. The power was calculated as the product of the power of each end point, 81.7%, 98.0%.</p><p>The efficacy analysis was based on both the FAS and per protocol (PP) populations. Adverse effects were evaluated in the safety population.</p><p>For evaluation of the primary end point, patients who were &#x0201c;extremely improved&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;improved&#x0201d; on the OTE scale were considered responders. The elimination rate was the proportion of patients who achieved elimination of all three symptoms&#x02014;that is, postprandial fullness, upper abdominal bloating and early satiation. Primary efficacy variables were evaluated over the entire treatment period using Fisher's exact test method. The level of significance was set at 0.05 (two sided).</p><p>A frequency distribution table was prepared for the OTE at the last survey point and improvement rates were determined from this. Treatment effects and 95% CIs were obtained for each variable.</p><p>Recently and well after the design and start of this phase III study, the FDA issued a statement on the use of patient-reported outcome measures in the evaluation of therapeutic efficacy of drugs for medical conditions, in general, and irritable bowel syndrome, in particular.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> In these documents, the FDA no longer recommends overall symptom assessment in binary questions, or in comparison with a previous time points, but advocates assessment of the severity of individual clinically important symptoms and defining responders on the basis of a clinically meaningful improvement of these symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> In the absence of an existing validated instrument for FD and in order to allow better estimation of the magnitude of the therapeutic response to acotiamide, we performed a post hoc responder analysis on changes in severity of individual symptoms. For each symptom, a responder was defined as a patient with a more than 50% reduction in symptom severity during the last observation week in comparison with baseline severity (weekly average), as derived from the daily diaries.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Enrolment and baseline characteristics of the patients</title><p>We screened 1394 outpatients with a suspected diagnosis of patients with FD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">figure 2</xref>) and of these, 497 were excluded during the baseline period. The remaining 897 patients were randomly assigned to receive one of two trial drugs: 100&#x02005;mg of acotiamide (452 patients) or placebo (445 patients) three times a day.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> The advantage of this end point is that it closely resembles the way in which doctors evaluate treatment benefit in clinical practice.

Acotiamide was better than placebo in eliminating symptoms of postprandial fullness and upper abdominal bloating, but the margin over placebo at the end of the 4-week trial was modest, with an estimated NNT of 16. More robust efficacy in symptom resolution was seen for early satiation (37.8% vs 25.4% with acotiamide and placebo, p&#x0003c;0.001). The elimination rate of all three symptoms was also significantly higher for acotiamide than with placebo at the last survey point and further increased during the 4-week post-treatment week. Gradual symptom improvement over the 4-week treatment period was seen in both arms, but acotiamide showed a higher rate of improvement, and significantly better responses on OTE were already reached in week 2. Moreover, the efficacy over placebo persisted during the 4&#x02005;weeks after the end of the treatment period and there were no signs of immediate relapse or rebound symptom aggravation. Both the rapid onset of efficacy and the lack of rapid relapse upon interruption of treatment are attractive aspects when considering the use of acotiamide in clinical practice.</p><p>Similar to previous studies,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13 b14 b15 b16">13&#x02013;16</xref> acotiamide was well tolerated and the incidences of adverse events were similar between the acotiamide group and placebo group. Furthermore, no clinically relevant changes in vital signs or electrocardiographic variables were obtained. A number of drugs that have been used or were under development for the treatment of FD, such as cisapride or tegaserod, have been associated with major cardiovascular side effects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> Affinities of these drugs for the HERG channel or for 5-HT receptors have been implicated in the occurrence of major cardiovascular events.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> Acotiamide has little or no affinity for these receptors, which contributes to its favourable benefit&#x02013;risk profile, and thorough QTc studies in the USA with acotiamide up to 900&#x02005;mg showed no arrhythmogenic potential.</p><p>Strengths of the study are the large number of patients studied and the multicentre double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Limitations are the short treatment duration of only 4&#x02005;weeks for a condition which is often chronic relapsing, but this study duration was chosen in agreement with the regulatory authorities in Japan. The study does not examine efficacy upon prolonged treatment or re-treatment. Reassuringly, however, the post-treatment follow-up period does not show rebound tachyphyllaxis but, on the contrary, shows sustained symptomatic benefit. Future studies will need to examine the relapse rate over longer post-treatment periods and the response to re-treatment.</p><p>The mechanism underlying the clinical benefit seen with acotiamide in FD-PDS is incompletely elucidated and may well be multifactorial. Animal studies have shown that acotiamide can enhance the gastric emptying rate, and meal-induced gastric accommodation and impaired accommodation as well as delayed gastric emptying have been established as key pathophysiological mechanisms in FD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> Mechanistic studies in patients with FD have confirmed the ability of acotiamide to enhance gastric accommodation and to enhance gastric emptying, and these may be particularly relevant in the improvement of symptoms of early satiation and postprandial fullness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> In addition, many patients with FD have increased anxiety levels, which are associated with decreased gastric compliance and enhanced gastric sensitivity in patients with FD and in healthy controls.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref> In an animal model, acotiamide pretreatment inhibited the expression of central mediators of induced stress (neuromedin U and BDNF) and the associated delayed gastric emptying and feeding inhibition.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref></p><p>In conclusion, in this 4-week randomised placebo-controlled phase III trial, acotiamide was effective, safe and well tolerated in the treatment of patients with FD-PDS according to the Rome III diagnostic criteria. Acotiamide 100&#x02005;mg three times a day was better than placebo in improving OTE and meal-related symptoms and this benefit became apparent during the second week of treatment. Acotiamide achieved a higher rate of elimination of meal-related FD symptoms and this was associated with significant improvement on all subdomains of the disease-specific SF-NDI QoL assessment. When treatment was stopped, no rapid symptom relapse or rebound occurred. Taking into account the favourable tolerability and safety profile in this and previous studies, acotiamide is a drug for the treatment of FD, a highly prevalent condition for which there is no treatment with established or approved efficacy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the site investigators for their participation in the trial.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold>
