Physical contributors such as dyskinesias, decreased mobility, fatigue and motor complications worsen QOL.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Psychological variables like depression[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] correlate with reduced QOL. QOL remains important as PD symptoms, secondary complications and declining functional independence mount. Although treatments target motor symptoms, proper identification and subsequent treatment for psychological measures may be overlooked.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Compromised pulmonary function may also lead to impairment in activities of daily living (ADLs) and physical function[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and affect exercise tolerance,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] causing fatigue and thereby reducing QOL.</p><p>Exercise intervention has well-documented beneficial effects on PD symptoms and QOL. Several forms of exercise show improvement in ADLs, perceived health status, fall risk, QOL and motor performance.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Yoga improves depression, fatigue, wellbeing and QOL for people with chronic conditions.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Yoga also improves respiratory pressure,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] while yogic breathing techniques have an immediate effect on lowering blood pressure in healthy people.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] We reported the positive impact of yoga on motor function in people with PD.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The purpose of this study was to discern if physiological and QOL-related benefits of yoga exist in individuals with PD. Because overall function measured by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) was investigated, we wanted to discern whether yoga affects the non-motor aspects of PD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>The participants and procedures have been described previously.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] This pilot study presents additional findings. Medical information and self-reported symptoms included time of PD diagnosis, current medications, PD-related symptoms, physical and social activity levels, and fall incidents. If there was a major medication change, participants were allowed to complete yoga training but data were not used after the medication change.</p><p>The UPDRS was the primary clinical measure of function. Health-related QOL measures included the modified falls efficacy scale (FES), the geriatric depression scale (GDS) and the SF-36. Physiological measures included weight, resting heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure and standard pulmonary function tests calculated by a Puritan - Bennett Renaissance II spirometer (Covidien - Puritan Bennett&#x02122;, Boulder, CO, USA). All measures were gathered at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks.</p><p>Data were analyzed using the Sigma Plot 11.0 (SyStat Software, San Jose, CA, USA). Frequencies of self-reported questionnaire items were analyzed. The primary analysis used independent <italic>t</italic>-tests to assess the baseline group differences and one-way repeated measures ANOVA to measure change over time, with <italic>P</italic> = 0.05 considered statistically significant. Non-parametric tests were used if assumptions were not met.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> reflects the participant characteristics at baseline and changes over time. The control group's mean age was older than that of the yoga group.

Although UPDRS mentation, behavior and mood subsection scores improved with yoga, they were not significantly different in either group [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>].</p><p>At baseline, one control and two yoga participants had reached the ceiling on the modified FES.

Certain QOL and physiological measures resulted in improvement or maintenance in activity and exercise tolerance, suggesting that positive effects of yoga may be possible. Because of the progressive nature of PD, lack of deterioration of yoga participants' self-reported symptoms and improvement in clinical outcome measures suggest that yoga is potentially an effective intervention to maintain the current activity level. These results are consistent with studies of exercise-related benefits in PD.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>UPDRS scores were significantly improved, especially during the initial 6 weeks of yoga training. The 95% confidence intervals indicate that clinical benefit is likely to result from the intervention. Improvement in UPDRS scores could be explained by improved motor symptoms,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] but it is possible that non-motor symptoms could cumulatively contribute to the score. Select improvements in QOL and physiology support a theory that yoga impacts multiple factors. Decreased falling episodes may link to the improved balance previously noted.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] It is possible that with more participants, improvements would have been noted in other SF-36 domains or the group gender discrepancy could alter these perceptions. Our results resemble aerobic and strengthening exercise interventions where emotional reactions, social interactions, physical activity and QOL scores improve in PD participants.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Depression has a major impact on the symptoms of PD[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and is often overlooked and undertreated. Yoga practice shows improvements in memory, stress, depression and anxiety in a healthy population,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] possibly due to improved cortisol levels.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] People with chronic pain who participated in yoga demonstrate improvements in depression, anxiety, fatigue and pain,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] while yoga in those with multiple sclerosis has a significant impact on QOL, fatigue and cognition.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Our results support the continued investigation of yoga for improving QOL in PD.</p><p>Our results of improved FVC after 6 weeks is consistent with another study showing that as little as 8 weeks of yoga in inactive older adults improves respiratory function, blood pressure and aspects of mental wellbeing.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness, specifically pulmonary function parameters, rate of perceived exertion and exercise tolerance after aerobic exercise training has been reported in PD.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>The intensity of our yoga intervention seemed to have some effect on cardiopulmonary function. It is known that different types of yoga breathing techniques have different effects on blood pressure. Healthy participants increase absolute and relative maximal oxygen uptake in addition to improved strength and flexibility, showing health-related improvement in physical fitness.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Healthy elderly have improved maximum expiratory function and inspiratory pressures after yoga.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Our results support these findings and those that found improvements in blood pressure,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] but changes in blood pressure may be confounded by the existence of multiple comorbidities and medications.</p><p>Yoga may contribute to efficacy via improvement in physiological and psychological variables associated with PD. A proposed mechanism of mental and physical health benefits has been postulated through the down-regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Differences in stress responses between novice and expert yoga practitioners allude to this pathway as having health benefits.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Psychological effects have been related to increased &#x003b3;-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) activity. Improved mood with decreased anxiety was correlated with acute changes in thalamic GABA levels in a healthy yoga group, which was different than a metabolically matched walking group.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Studies are needed to confirm the psycho - neuro immunological hypotheses in neurological disease.</p><p>Given the pilot nature of this study, there are a number of limitations: Small sample size, coin toss randomization method, no control for social interaction, confounding variables like comorbidities, no correction for multiple comparisons between outcome measures and the measures selected may not have captured important changes in other relevant non-motor symptoms that might be positively impacted by yoga.</p><p>Yoga appears to improve physiological and non-motor factors that can affect QOL over a relatively short period of time for PD participants. It is important to determine conservative intervention to treat physiological functions and clinical outcomes contributing to QOL in PD for which yoga appears to be a viable intervention.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors would like to thank Suzette Scholtes for her expert yoga instruction, the staff at The Yoga Studio for their assistance during yoga intervention, statistician Wendy Hu for her consultation and review of SF36 statistical analysis and Jill Stanhope and Jessica Vandehoef for taking the UPDRS motor measures.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> An internal grant from the KUMC School of Allied Health Research Committee to Yvonne (Searls) Colgrove supported the study.
