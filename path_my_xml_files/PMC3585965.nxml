The main objectives of the phase I clinical studies in early development were to characterize the pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and safety of GLPG0259 in healthy subjects, including the development of a solid dosage form (free-base pellets and fumarate salt capsules) and the potential for interaction of GLPG0259 with methotrexate.</p></sec><sec><title>Subjects and Methods</title><p>Four phase I studies were initiated. Study 1 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single ascending doses (1.5&#x02013;150 mg) and multiple oral doses (20 and 50 mg once daily) of GLPG0259 in healthy male subjects (n = 34). Study 2 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of oral multiple ascending doses of GLPG0259 (25&#x02013;75 mg once daily) given for 14 days to healthy male subjects, and to get preliminary information on the potential pharmacokinetic interaction between GLPG0259 and methotrexate (n = 24). Studies 3 and 4 were open-label, randomized, crossover studies to compare the oral bioavailability of two solid dosage forms of GLPG0259 (a capsule) relative to an oral solution after a 100 mg or 50 mg single dose and to evaluate the effect of food on these formulations (n = 12 for each study).</p></sec><sec><title>Main Outcome Measures</title><p>The non-compartmental pharmacokinetic parameters for plasma concentrations of GLPG0259 were determined, and a population pharmacokinetic model of GLPG0259 was developed to support the planning of the number and timing of the sparse samples to be taken per patient in the phase II study. Safety and tolerability data are also summarized.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The absorption of GLPG0259 was slow, with a decrease in the absorption rate with increasing dose, and there was decreased elimination, with an apparent terminal elimination half-life of 26.0 hours. On the basis of statistical analysis of variance, the exposure to GLPG0259 increased in proportion to the dose over a 30&#x02013;150 mg single-dose range and a 25&#x02013;75 mg repeated-dose range. Between- and within-subject variability in GLPG0259 pharmacokinetics was low/moderate (coefficient of variation [CV] 16&#x02013;30%). After once-daily repeated dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations were reached at between 5 and 8 dosing days, which is consistent with the long apparent elimination half-life of GLPG0259. Food increased the bioavailability of GLPG0259 given in a solid dosage form. Co-administration of GLPG0259 with a single dose of methotrexate 7.5 mg did not result in any change in the pharmacokinetic profiles of either GLPG0259 or methotrexate.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, the investigation of safety/tolerability and pharmacokinetics in the early development phase showed that single and repeated doses of GLPG0259 were safe and well tolerated. The most common adverse event reported was mild gastrointestinal discomfort. The pharmacokinetics characterized in healthy male subjects showed no major obstacles and supports a once-daily oral regimen in patients.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Colau et al., publisher and licensee Springer International Publishing AG 2012</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory and joint degenerative disease, which affects almost 1% of the adult population worldwide, with onset classically occurring between the ages of 30 and 50 years, and a higher prevalence in women. The disease is characterized by pain, stiffness, and restricted mobility due to persistent symmetrical inflammation of the synovial membranes of multiple joints, which ultimately results in irreversible damage of the joint cartilage and bone.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]</p><p>Development of the disease involves an inflammatory response of the synovial membrane, accompanied by infiltration of a variety of immune cells, which leads to the build-up and maintenance of a cytokine network. One of the cytokines central to this network is tumor necrosis factor (TNF), as is clearly demonstrated by the clinical success of TNF blockers in treating RA. TNF and other proinflammatory cytokines contribute to cartilage and bone erosion by inducing release of degradative enzymes, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and stimulating the release of receptor-activated NF&#x003ba;B-ligand (RANKL), which triggers differentiation of hematopoeitic cells into bone-resorbing osteoclasts. When left untreated, the disease leads to significant disability associated with high economic costs.</p><p>In recent years, the therapeutic management of patients with RA has undergone major evolution. Up to 10 years ago, therapeutic approaches relied on synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate and sulphasalazine, which had only partial clinical benefit and were associated with significant toxicity. A considerable advance in the effective treatment of RA came from the introduction of the biologic therapeutics that neutralize cytokines or their receptors (TNF&#x003b1; and interleukin [IL]-6) or that inhibit cellular activation (B-cell or T-cell activation).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]</p><p>However, because of the high production costs, inconvenience of parenteral administration, increased risk of infections, and potential immunogenicity of biologics, there is still a need for less expensive and orally administered drugs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] Hence, the development of small-molecule inhibitors targeting disease-relevant signal transduction pathways is being pursued by various companies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]</p><p>GLPG0259 is a small-molecule inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase&#x02013;activated protein kinase 5 (MAPKAPK5), a kinase enzyme that plays a role in important inflammatory pathways. Inhibition of MAPKAPK5 with GLPG0259 represents a novel mechanism of action in the treatment of RA. MAPKAPK5 belongs to a family of mitogen-activated protein kinases that play an important role in several cellular processes, including inflammation, proliferation, and differentiation. MAPKAPK5 is involved in a transduction pathway in RA patients that ultimately leads to secretion of catabolic enzymes such as MMP1, which cause damage to the bone and cartilage in these patients. GLPG0259 is a potent inhibitor of MAPKAPK5, and <italic>in vitro</italic> it reduces the release of several mediators of inflammation and bone degradation, such as MMP1, MMP13, TNF, and IL6. After oral administration in mice, GLPG0259 reduces paw inflammation as well as bone destruction in the mouse collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model of human RA at a dose of 1 mg/kg and higher. Even in mice with late-stage CIA disease, GLPG0259 reduces inflammation and bone destruction.</p><p>The main objectives of the phase I clinical studies in early development were to characterize the pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and safety of GLPG0259 in healthy subjects, including the development of a solid dosage form and the potential for interaction of GLPG0259 with methotrexate (the anchor drug in RA patients).</p><p>However, an exploratory phase II study in a small number of RA patients with an insufficient response to methotrexate showed no significant clinical benefit of GLPG0259 compared with placebo, and the development of GLPG0259 was discontinued (Westhovens R et al., unpublished data).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><p>All studies were conducted in accordance with accepted standards for the protection of subject safety and welfare, and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments, and were in compliance with Good Clinical Practice.

There was a minimum period of 7 days between the two cohorts.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Treatment allocation was determined by a computer-generated randomization schedule. Subjects were admitted to the clinical unit on the evening prior to dosing (day -1) and were confined until 24 hours after the last dose.</p><p>In both parts, GLPG0259 free-base solution (1&#x02013;10 mg/mL in 40% [w/v] hydroxypropyl-&#x000df;&#x02013;cyclodextrin, pH 3) or a matching placebo was given using a graduated syringe. A volume of 200 mL of water was given to each subject immediately at the time of dosing. Treatments were administered after a standard breakfast (i.e. four slices of whole-wheat bread, one slice of salami, one slice of cheddar cheese, one tablespoon of butter and jam, totaling 590 kilocalories) except during the last dosing period of part 1, where the treatment was administered after an overnight fast to assess the food effect on GLPG0259 bioavailability. Drinks were standardized to at least 1000 mL of mineral water per day.</p><p>Blood samples for pharmacokinetics were collected at regular intervals over 24 hours (part 1: 1.5&#x02013;15 mg; part 2: 20 mg and 50 mg on day 1), 4 days (part 1: 30&#x02013;150 mg), or 7 days postdose (part 2: 20 mg and 50 mg on day 5). Blood was collected in tubes containing lithium heparinate as an anticoagulant in order to obtain plasma for analysis of the concentrations of GLPG0259. Within 30 minutes after blood collection, the plasma was separated in a refrigerated centrifuge (4&#x02013;8&#x000b0;C) for 10 minutes at approximately 1500 <italic>g</italic>, transferred into two polypropylene tubes with at least 500 &#x003bc;L of plasma per tube, and stored at -20&#x000b0;C until analysis. Three urine fractions were collected in part 2 on days 1 and 5 over a 24-hour period to determine the amount of GLPG0259 excreted in urine. After homogenization and recording of the total weight, two 10 mL samples for the GLPG0259 assay were stored at or below -20&#x000b0;C until analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study 2: Multiple Ascending Oral Doses and Methotrexate Drug-Drug Interaction</title><p>This was a phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of oral multiple ascending doses of GLPG0259 given for 14 days to healthy subjects (n = 24), and to get preliminary information on the potential pharmacokinetic interaction between GLPG0259 and methotrexate. The criteria for subject eligibility were the same as those listed for study 1.</p><p>A total of 24 healthy male subjects were randomized into three cohorts of eight subjects dosed orally once daily with either placebo or GLPG0259 25 mg, 50 mg, or 75 mg (active or placebo in a 3 <bold>:</bold> 1 ratio). In addition, the subjects from the 50 mg cohort received one single dose of methotrexate 7.5 mg on two occasions: 7 days prior to dosing with GLPG0259 (on day -7) and on day 14 at the same time as the last GLPG0259 dose.</p><p>GLPG0259 free base (10 mg/mL in 40% [w/v] hydroxypropyl-&#x000df;&#x02013;cyclodextrin, pH 3) or a matching placebo was administered once daily for 14 days, using a syringe, as for study 1. Subjects in the 50 mg dose group were additionally administered an oral dose of methotrexate 7.5 mg (3 tablets of Ledertrexate&#x000ae; 2.5 mg; Wyeth-Pfizer) on two occasions. A dose of 4 mg of folic acid (Folavit&#x000ae;; Kela Pharma NV) was administered 24 hours after each methotrexate administration as a preventive measure for methotrexate toxicity. Folic acid was administered after all safety and pharmacokinetic assessments had been done.</p><p>Blood samples for pharmacokinetics were collected at regular intervals over 24 hours (on days 1 and 13 [in the 50 mg cohort only]) or over 7 days after the last dose on day 14 (i.e. up to day 21) to assess plasma concentrations of GLPG0259. Blood sample handling was similar to that described for study 1. For methotrexate (in the 50 mg cohort only), blood samples were collected at regular intervals over 24 hours (on day -7 and day 14) in tubes containing lithium heparinate, in order to obtain plasma, and were stored at -20&#x000b0;C until analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study 3: Oral Relative Bioavailability and the Food Effect</title><p>This was a phase I, open-label, randomized, three-period, three-treatment crossover study to compare the oral bioavailability of a solid dosage form of GLPG0259 (a capsule) relative to an oral solution, and to evaluate the effect of food on oral bioavailability of GLPG0259 formulated as a capsule in healthy subjects (n = 12).

The four studies showed a consistent pattern of AEs. Nausea, abdominal discomfort, and loose stools were the most frequently reported AEs, showing a dose-related pattern of incidence and severity from a dose of 50 mg upward. The feeding status or type of formulation had no influence on these AEs. All other AEs were typical phase I environment events, such as somnolence, fatigue, headache, oropharyngeal pain, and nasopharyngitis. No clinically relevant trends or changes were observed in the median laboratory and urinalysis values over time. A single case of a mild alanine aminotransferase increase was observed in a subject at the 75 mg dose in the second study. Across the four studies, no clinically relevant trends or changes were observed in the median vital sign values and ECG parameters over time. No treatment-emergent abnormalities related to vital signs or ECG parameters were observed in more than one subject during the trials. None of the abnormalities related to vital signs or ECG parameters were considered clinically relevant by the investigators.

This is a simpler model than the final population pharmacokinetic model, adjusted to reflect the structure of the library model prior to performing the sample time optimization. The absorption process was simplified from the sequential zero- then first-order process to a first-order process only, and the IOV terms for D1, F<sub>rel</sub>, and k<sub>a</sub> were also removed. The actual parameter values used for the sample time optimization are presented in <xref rid="Tab9" ref-type="fig">table IX</xref>. The simplified model retained the influence of dose on k<sub>a</sub>, thus the value for k<sub>a</sub> (0.403/hour) is that calculated for a 50 mg dose.

Further, the imprecision in the estimated CL/F value under this design was only 4.2%, indicating that the design was able to estimate CL/F well.</p><p>The poor design (a single sample per subject after each of the 7th, 14th, 28th, 56th, and 84th doses, at 2 hours postdose) gave a criterion value that was 0.026% of that for the gold-standard design, and CL/F was estimated extremely imprecisely.</p><p>Design no. 4, where a single sample was taken per subject but at different times per visit and always in the afternoon (thus at 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 hours postdose across the visits) gave rise to a criterion ratio of 4.1%, and CL/F was estimated with 64.4% imprecision. Thus design no. 4 was not very good but was a considerable improvement over the poor design. Design no. 5 was similar to design no. 4, but samples were allowed to be taken both in the morning and in the afternoon, and the criterion ratio improved to 8.0% and CL/F was estimated with 22.1% imprecision. As can be seen in <xref rid="Tab9" ref-type="fig">table IX</xref>, various designs were tested, but the greatest improvement came when the spread of the timing of the samples over the dosing interval was as wide as possible across the visits (design no. 8), and the criterion ratio was 25.8% and CL/F was estimated with 6.2% imprecision. Allowing more than one sample to be taken on one of the visits (design nos. 11 and 12) did not improve the criterion ratio or improve the precision with which CL/F was estimated, probably because a design with five samples per subjects was already adequate as a sparse sample design.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>After single and daily repeated administration, GLPG0259 was slowly absorbed and eliminated. On the basis of a statistical ANOVA, the exposure to GLPG0259 increased in proportion to the dose over a 30&#x02013;150 mg single-dose range and a 25&#x02013;75 mg repeated-dose range.</p><p>In the population pharmacokinetic model developed with data from the three first phase I studies, the F<sub>rel</sub> for GLPG0259 increased with increasing dose, while the k<sub>a</sub> decreased with increasing dose up to 50 mg and was then reasonably constant. Conversely to the conclusion drawn from the ANOVA on dose-normalized parameters, these changes in F<sub>rel</sub> and k<sub>a</sub> detected during the development of the population pharmacokinetic model would be a sign of non&#x02013;dose-proportional pharmacokinetics. It is not unusual to observe deviation from dose proportionality within a dose range as wide as 1.5&#x02013;150 mg. In addition, a population approach is much more sensitive than standard statistical analysis for finding and characterizing dose non-linearity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] More data would be needed, especially at higher dose levels, to refine the model and the relation of k<sub>a</sub> and F<sub>rel</sub> to the dose to draw definitive conclusions on the dose linearity of GLPG0259 pharmacokinetics. The most frequently reported AEs following repeated administration with GLPG0259 were related to gastrointestinal disorders (loose stools, nausea, abdominal pain, or discomfort). These events, reported only at doses of 50 mg and higher, could be explained by the residence time of GLPG0259 in the gastrointestinal tract. Indeed in a whole-body autoradiography with [<sup>14</sup>C]-radiolabeled compound administered in a mouse model (3 mg/kg [<sup>14</sup>C]-GLPG0259), a huge amount of radioactivity was localized 4 and 8 hours postdose in the small and large intestine contents, as well as in the gallbladder, suggesting slow and incomplete absorption and/or intestinal secretion directly or via the bile (data not shown). Apart from gastrointestinal disorders, no systemic AEs were reported after repeated dosing with GLPG0259. Thus an increase in F<sub>rel</sub> with increasing dose should not be of concern as long as systemic exposure in humans remains below the &#x02018;no observed adverse effect level&#x02019; (NOAEL) exposures in animal species.</p><p>Methotrexate is an antifolate used with varying degrees of success in the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] Low-dose pulse methotrexate has emerged as the anchor drug in patients with RA because of its favorable risk-benefit profile.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] Methotrexate is mainly eliminated by the kidney as intact drug, regardless of the route of administration. Glomerular filtration is the predominant pathway, with an additional active secretory process via organic anion transporters (OATs). Active biliary secretion also plays a role in methotrexate elimination, with variable amounts of methotrexate available for enterohepatic recirculation. Many drugs currently used in RA are known to interact with methotrexate pharmacokinetics: chloroquine reduces intestinal absorption; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can lead to a decrease in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration, and can compete with drug transporters for active renal tubular secretion; and calcium folinate has been shown to shorten the mean residence time of methotrexate in the kidney and liver.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] GLPG0259 was eliminated by metabolism as well as renal excretion. Total body clearance of GLPG0259, predicted using allometric scaling of intravenous data from several animal species corrected for their maximum lifespan, as described by Mahmood,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] was moderate, with a value of 54 L/h (data not shown). CL<sub>R</sub> determined in healthy subjects accounts for about 9 L/h of the total body clearance. As reported previously, the presence of radioactivity in the gallbladder after [<sup>14</sup>C]-GLPG0259 administration in a mouse model may suggest the elimination of GLPG0259 or metabolites via bile secretion and a possibility for re-absorption and enterohepatic recirculation. As GLPG0259 was intended to be developed for use as a monotherapy or in combination with drugs such as methotrexate, and taking into account the common routes of elimination of both methotrexate and GLPG0259, it was of interest to get preliminary information on the potential for drug-drug interaction between these two compounds at an early stage in drug development. Although this analysis was performed on a small subset of subjects (n = 6), no modification of the absorption or the elimination of methotrexate was noted after a daily dose of GLPG0259 50 mg. The t<sub>1/2,&#x003bb;z</sub> values for methotrexate estimated with and without GLPG0259 were about 3.4 and 3.1 hours, respectively. The range of boundary values for t<sub>1/2,&#x003bb;z</sub> reported in the literature is quite large (6&#x02013;69 hours).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] This variability may be partly related to differences in blood sampling between studies. The terminal log-linear phase cannot be determined accurately if the sampling interval is too short and/or too few blood samples are collected after 12 hours postdose.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] Concerning GLPG0259, concomitant dosing with methotrexate had no impact on its bioavailability (C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>24h</sub>).</p><p>Although the GLPG0259 free-base oral solution showed good bioavailability, this formulation is not easy to handle in long-term trials. Consequently, development of an oral solid dosage form was envisaged. GLPG0259 free base is poorly soluble in aqueous media, and its solubility decreases with increasing pH (&#x0003c;0.01 mg/mL at pH 7). Two approaches were developed in parallel to overcome this low solubility and to improve compound bioavailability after dosing in a solid dosage form. The first approach was a salt screening, which resulted in the selection of the fumarate salt for further formulation development work. The water solubility of the GLPG0259 fumarate salt, as compared with that of the free base, was increased to 1.9&#x02013;2.7 mg/mL. The impact of the improvement in solubility was confirmed in a comparative bioavailability study in fasted dogs. In that study, GLPG0259 fumarate salt (suspension in 20% [w/v] hydroxypropyl-&#x000df;&#x02013;cyclodextrin, pH 3, or as crystalline powder in capsule form) resulted in plasma exposure similar to that of GLPG0259 free base in suspension in 20% acidified hydroxypropyl-&#x000df;&#x02013;cyclodextrin, but 4-fold higher plasma exposure than that of GLPG0259 free-base crystalline powder in capsule form (data not shown). In humans, administration of GLPG0259 fumarate salt as a crystalline powder in capsule form leads to 50% lower bioavailability than that of GLPG0259 free base given as a solution in 40% (w/v) hydroxypropyl-&#x000df;&#x02013;cyclodextrin, pH 3 (study 3). The lower performance of the fumarate capsule in humans than in dogs is explained by the higher percentage of hydroxypropyl-&#x000df;&#x02013;cyclodextrin (40% versus 20%) in the liquid formulation, which enhances GLPG0259 free-base solubility. Concomitant food intake with the solid dosage form prevents this decrease in bioavailability by increasing the solubility further. The second approach was the improvement of GLPG0259 solubility by physical modifications of the drug substance &#x02013; in particular, the development of solid dispersion formulations with GLPG0259 free base in an amorphous form homogenously dispersed in a polymer matrix. The free-base solid dispersion as a powder or pellets filled into capsules was tested in fasted dogs, and both solid dispersion formulations showed GLPG0259 plasma exposure similar to that of the fumarate salt as a crystalline powder in capsule form. Similar results were obtained in humans (study 4).</p><p>In the Biopharmaceutical Classification System, drugs are classified according to measurements of solubility and permeability.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] Regarding GLPG0259, it is a poorly soluble compound, with solubility that decreases with increased pH. The absorption of GLPG0259 was not measured <italic>in vivo</italic> in humans (there are no data after intravenous dosing), but its permeability assessed using the well established <italic>in vitro</italic> system, based on the human adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2, was good, with an apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) of 12.4 10<sup>-6</sup> cm/s and limited efflux (Papp B2A/Papp A2B = 2). Thus on the basis of these data, GLPG0259 could be classified as a class 2 compound, with <italic>in vivo</italic> drug dissolution then being the rate-limiting step for its absorption. Salt selection or solid dispersion development allows this issue to be overcome and increases the solubility and dissolution rate of GLPG0259, leading to an improvement in the bioavailability of the oral solid dosage forms to be used in future clinical trials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, the investigation of safety/tolerability and pharmacokinetics in the early development phase showed that single and repeated doses of GLPG0259 were safe and well tolerated.
