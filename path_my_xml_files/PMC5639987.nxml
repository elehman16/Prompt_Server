Population-based screening programmes are widely implemented in high-income countries, although adherence is often low. In Portugal, just over half of the women adhere to cervical cancer screening, contributing for greater mortality rates than in other European countries. The most effective adherence raising strategies are based on patient reminders, small/mass media and face-to-face educational programmes, but sequential interventions targeting the general population have seldom been evaluated. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a stepwise approach, with increasing complexity and cost, to improve adherence to organised cervical cancer screening: step 1a&#x02014;customised text message invitation; step 1b&#x02014;customised automated phone call invitation; step 2&#x02014;secretary phone call; step 3&#x02014;family health professional phone call and face-to-face appointment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A population-based randomised controlled trial will be implemented in Portuguese urban and rural areas. Women eligible for cervical cancer screening will be randomised (1:1) to intervention and control. In the intervention group, women will be invited for screening through text messages, automated phone calls, manual phone calls and health professional appointments, to be applied sequentially to participants remaining non-adherent after each step. Control will be the standard of care (written letter). The primary outcome is the proportion of women adherent to screening after step 1 or sequences of steps from 1 to 3. The secondary outcomes are: proportion of women screened after each step (1a, 2 and 3); proportion of text messages/phone calls delivered; proportion of women previously screened in a private health institution who change to organised screening. The intervention and control groups will be compared based on intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Northern Health Region Administration and National Data Protection Committee. Results will be disseminated through communications in scientific meetings and peer-reviewed journals.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial number</title><p>NCT03122275</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>mass screening</kwd><kwd>early detection of cancer</kwd><kwd>uterine cervical neoplasms</kwd><kwd>text messaging</kwd><kwd>reminder systems</kwd><kwd>directive counselling</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ACeS Porto Ocidental</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Instituto de Sa&#x000fa;de P&#x000fa;blica da Universidade do Porto</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ACeS Mar&#x000e3;o e Douro Norte</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Randomised controlled trial, using a stepwise approach, with increasing complexity and cost of interventions, to improve adherence to organised cervical cancer screening.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Interventions tested are technological and innovative.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Use of a population-based approach and not specific groups or minorities.</p></list-item></list><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Contamination of interventions may occur, because randomisation units are individuals and not primary care units.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Unavailability of women&#x02019;s mobile phone may restrict intervention delivery.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The study is restricted to women aged below 50 years, and therefore the findings may not apply to older women with limited digital literacy skills.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cancer is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality, especially in high-income countries.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> A substantial part of cancer cases can be detected earlier and undergo treatment with curative intent.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Improvements in early detection of cancer may be achieved through increases in population awareness, enabling early consultation with health professionals, and screening programmes.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Cervical cancer screening is one of the oldest and most effective screening programmes, with relevant decreases in mortality since its implementation.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Although the increasing coverage of vaccination against high-risk human papillomavirus strains is expected to play a major role in the prevention of cervical cancer,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> screening will still be needed, at least for non-vaccinated women and high-risk groups. With the expected decrease in the number of women eligible for screening, cost reduction, including variable costs (invitation and screening), may be needed to guarantee sustainability.</p><p>Currently, in Portugal cervical cancer screening is recommended to be performed every 5 years, for women aged between 25 and 65 years.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Women registered at a primary care unit are invited to perform cervical cancer screening through a written letter. At a national level, just over half<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> of the invited women adhere to the cervical cancer screening and 23.5%<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> have never performed screening during life. Limited adherence to screening is expected to contribute to greater cervical cancer mortality rates in Portugal (age-standardised mortality rate: 4.9/100&#x000a0;000),<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> in comparison with the average in Europe&#x02019;s rate (27 countries, age-standardised mortality rate: 3.7/100&#x000a0;000).<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</p><p>Different strategies to increase adherence to cervical cancer screening have been developed and evaluated, including interventions based on patient reminders (written letters,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;13</xref> operator-dependent phone calls<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12 14 15</xref> or text messages<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), small media<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;20</xref> (videos, brochures, pamphlets or fact sheets), mass media<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and face-to-face educational programmes.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 22</xref>
</p><p>Results from a systematic review,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> including studies conducted in high-income countries, enrolling both deprived and non-deprived women, show overall increases in cervical cancer screening adherence of just over 10% with printed or phone reminders, and 4% and 8%&#x02009;when using small media or one-on-one education, respectively. Regarding the strategies based on the use of reminders, phone calls are more effective and cost-effective (37% uptake, costing US$67/response) than text messages (24% uptake, costing US$100/response) or written letters (19% uptake, costing US$133/response).<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> To our knowledge, no automated (machine performed) and customised phone calls have been used or compared with other methods. Additionally, text messages have been tested as cervical cancer screening reminders or invitation methods,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> but with no patient customisation or built-in mechanisms for reply to the messages. This method was tested as appointment reminders in hospitals<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and primary healthcare services,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> with 10% increases in adherence to scheduled appointments, but also as part of obesity control programmes.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Some of these programmes allow for patient interaction, enabling them to make a data input on their health status or simply reply after receiving the intervention.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> This bidirectional approach could be used for cancer screening invitation and appointment scheduling, by allowing the invited people to confirm their interest to be screened, using a text message or a reply to an automatic phone call. A recent systematic review on the use of automated telephone communication systems highlighted the effectiveness of unidirectional/bidirectional phone-delivered interventions on the uptake increase of screening programmes.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
</p><p>Educational programmes aiming to increase adherence to cervical cancer screening have been implemented using face-to-face interventions with trained professionals,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 22</xref> sometimes using support videos or pamphlets<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> or delivered through motivational phone call.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> These programmes are highly tailored to each patient, and therefore difficult to implement at a population level, because these are resource-intensive activities. In a population-based approach, a multistage intervention is needed, implementing first, cheaper and easier-to-use interventions such as text messages and automated phone calls. Women refractory to these strategies should receive more expensive and patient-tailored interventions such as phone calls performed by trained professionals as reminders or face-to-face appointments to provide information on cervical cancer screening. Most of the interventions described in the literature target only deprived populations<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 15 18</xref> or from an ethnic group/social minorities<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 18 19 29</xref> and only a few cases use multistage approaches, where different interventions (written letter invitation, written letter reminder, phone call reminder) were sequentially applied till women adhere to screening.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>

We expect this 10% increase because two different techniques of invitation will be used (text message and automated phone call) and an electronic reminder will be sent 24&#x02009;hours prior to the appointment.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The minimum sample size determined for each group is 519 women.</p></sec><sec id="s2f2"><title>Steps 1 and 2</title><p>We expect a 45% cumulative adherence proportion in the control group, after the interventions based on steps 1 and 2; an increase in relation to the expected adherence in the control group after steps 1, from 40% to 45%, may be anticipated because for step 2 there will be a longer period between baseline and outcome assessment. We expect a cumulative adherence proportion of 60% in the intervention group, which is a conservative estimate, considering the published effectiveness of phone calls.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> The minimum sample size determined for each group is 244 women.</p></sec><sec id="s2f3"><title>Steps 1&#x02013;3</title><p>We expect 50% and 70%&#x02009;cumulative adherence proportion in the control and intervention groups, respectively after the interventions based on steps 1&#x02013;3. In the control group, an increase in comparison to the expected adherence after steps 2, from 45% to 50%, may be anticipated due to the longer period between baseline and outcome assessment. The magnitude of increase in adherence in the intervention group was estimated based on the previously observed effectiveness of face-to-face appointments in other settings.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The minimum sample size determined for each group is 134 women.</p><p>The overall sample size needed is 1038 (519&#x000d7;2), determined by step 1 interventions, since the remaining primary outcomes require a smaller sample size. Nevertheless, a 10% greater number of participants will be recruited to account for the potential withdrawal of one healthcare unit before the completion of the stepwise intervention. We anticipate that the drop-out rate&#x000a0;of individual participants will be lower than 1%, during the steps 2 and 3 of the intervention; this low value is expected because we will use an opt-out strategy, so that only women who actively express their willingness for not receiving further interventions are considered as dropouts.</p><p>The statistical analysis for accomplishment of secondary objectives are exploratory and therefore the sample size was not determined to consider them. Nevertheless, the sample size defined for the study is expected to have enough power to test the superiority of the isolate effect of step 1b, step 2 or step 3. Additionally, the sample size is also enough to test non-inferiority secondary objectives, assuming one-sided tests, a significance level of 2.5%, power of 90%, an adherence proportion in control group of 40% and 50% in experimental group and a non-inferiority limit of 5%.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Women will be randomised 1:1 into the intervention or control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). A woman randomised to the intervention or control will belong to that study arm until the end of the study. Primary care units will extract a list of eligible women for screening, fulfilling study criteria, from SiiMA Rastreios <italic>software</italic> (national software for cancer screening eligibility). Principal investigator will generate the randomisation sequence through a newer version of Excel Office 365. All women registered and fulfilling eligibility criteria will be assigned to intervention or control by the primary care unit secretaries. If a woman is randomised to the intervention group, she will be randomised again to receive a neutral or a positively framed invitation text message/automated phone call on a 1:1 ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>). There will be no blinding of the participants, health professionals or elements of the research team.</p><p>Contamination is possible, especially because screening can be obtained for free in both groups and women exposed to interventions may live geographically near women belonging to control group. Therefore, the participation of women from the intervention arm may influence the adherence of women in the control group. Contamination will dilute the effect of the interventions to be tested, and all the effectiveness estimates computed will be conservative. Although we cannot accurately predict the extent of the contamination, we may speculate that it will increase with the complexity of the interventions, being higher for step 3 than for step 1. Zip-code randomisation would contribute to minimise contamination, but it would not be feasible due to the unavailability of complete zip-codes on SiiMA Rastreios. We did not opt for randomisation of primary care units because the number of randomisation units available is low.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Data collection</title><p>Information about adherence to cervical cancer screening after interventions or standard of care (invitation letter) will be obtained using the national software for cancer screening eligibility&#x02014;SiiMA Rastreios. This platform will also be used to collect data about women&#x02019;s previous participation in cervical cancer screening.</p><p>Patient appointment confirmation obtained from text messages and phone calls will be saved directly by the software into the study laptop database.</p><p>Sociodemographic characteristics, including age, education level, parity, marital and employment status and type of job will be manually extracted from the electronic medical record (EMR). Age and parity will be collected as continuous variables and all the others as categorical. Education level will comprise the categories lower than 9 years of education, 9&#x02013;11 years, 12 or more years. Marital status will be coded as single, married or divorced. Employment status will be defined as student, employed, unemployed or retired and the occupation as upper white collar, lower white collar, high skilled blue collar and low skilled blue collar.</p><p>All the information written in the database will be pseudo-anonymised, using a unique identifier and only the principal investigator will have the encryption key. Only members of the research team will have access to the database. All medical data will be collected from EMR by medical doctors belonging to the research team.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Intention-to-treat analysis will be used as the primary strategy for all comparisons between interventions and control. Two secondary per-protocol analyses will also be conducted, considering only the following subsets of participants:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>women who receive the invitation<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>experimental arm: women who receive a text message/phone call, as confirmed by the software used for automated delivery of the intervention</p></list-item><list-item><p>control arm: women who received a written letter, that is, no invitation letter returned</p></list-item></list>

</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Adherence proportions will be determined for step 1a, step 1b, step 1a+1&#x02009;b, step 2, step 3 and sequences of steps from 1 to 3. Differences of adherence proportions between the intervention and control groups will be tested using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test as appropriate. Binary logistic regression may be used to control for confounding, or in secondary analyses of the isolate effects of steps 1b, 2 and 3. Adherence to screening will be considered as the dependent variable. Independent variables will include study arm and potential confounders selected among age, education, marital status, number of children, employment status, type of living area (rural vs urban), previous adherence to cervical cancer screening and deprivation index.</p><p>Additionally, a stratified analysis will be performed, using as strata variables age (high vs low), rurality (rural vs urban), deprivation (deprived vs non-deprived), regularity of previous participation (regular vs irregular participation) and previous participation (ever vs never participation).</p><p>Missing data are expected to be low for all the variables obtained from medical records, because they are collected on a regular basis by all general practitioners during appointments, using a structured entry form. No imputation of missing data is being planned.</p><p>All tests are two-tailed, with a p&#x000a0;value of 0.05 indicating statistical significance for superiority objectives or one-tailed with a p&#x000a0;value of 0.025 for non-inferiority objectives.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This study was approved by Portuguese regional ethics committee&#x02014;<italic>Comiss&#x000e3;o de &#x000c9;tica da Administra&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o Regional de Sa&#x000fa;de do Norte</italic> (number: 20/2017) and by National Data Protection Committee (number: 11467/2016). The trial was registered and assigned the number NCT03122275.</p><p>For step 1 interventions (automated text messages/phone calls) obtaining an informed consent is not feasible, however, we consider that the benefits for participants and society outweigh the ethical aspects raised and the ethics committee recognised it. Women participating or not will not influence access and type of healthcare provided.</p><p>In steps 2 and 3, the secretaries or health professionals will explain the study and obtain verbal informed consent during the phone calls. In step 3, the health professionals will obtain written informed consent from all participants undergoing this step of the intervention.</p><p>All the software used to perform automated text messages and phone calls follow the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act protocol and article number 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights.</p><p>A manuscript addressing the primary objective of this trial will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Additional manuscripts will be submitted for publication, intending to answer the secondary objectives. Communications in national and international scientific meetings are also expected. Technical reports will be made available to the primary care units and institutions involved in this study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e221" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-017730.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e222" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-017730.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All the authors of the manuscript follow the four criteria of authorship defined by ICMJE.
