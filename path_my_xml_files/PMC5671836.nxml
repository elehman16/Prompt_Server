Many studies have been conducted on the effectiveness of preparations for the improvement of intestinal cleanliness,<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> but no preparation is universally regarded as the most effective. This is because the following issues remain unresolved: the optimal choice of laxative, its dosage and time of administration, the best method of eliminating bile in the small intestine, the best method of reducing gas bubbles, and the most effective method for evaluating intestinal cleanliness.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of senna, 20% mannitol, simethicone, and 3 days&#x02019; fasting in the elimination of bile, chyme, fecal residue, bubbles, and opaque intraluminal mucus in the preparation of the bowel.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Patients</title><p>This randomized controlled trial enrolled patients who were undergoing CE examination for suspected small bowel disease at Sanming First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University during the period March 2014 to March 2017. It conformed to the 1995 Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of Sanming First Hospital. This study was registered on March 9, 2014, in the Chinese Clinical Trial Register (ChiCTR) (number ChiCTR-DDT-1400440).</p><p>One hundred eighty inpatients were eligible and were randomly allocated into 3 groups using a computer-generated random number. This part of the study was conducted by a gastroenterology assistant, who also administered the study medications. Exclusion criteria were: known or suspected obstruction, constriction or perforation of the gastrointestinal tract, chronic renal or cardiac failure, pregnancy, difficulty swallowing, history of gastrointestinal or abdominal surgery, use of antispasmodic, analgesic or prokinetic drugs, thyroid disease, diabetes mellitus and an inability to obtain informed consent. Patients with impaired intestinal motility were also excluded, because this can affect enteric cleansing. Before the procedure, all patients were given an explanation of what was to follow and informed consent was obtained.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Bowel preparation</title><p>Patients randomized to Group A took 250&#x0200a;mL 20% mannitol and 1&#x0200a;L 0.9% saline orally at 05:00&#x0200a;hours on the day of the procedure. Patients randomized to Group B took the same medication at 20:00 on the day before and at 05:00 on the day of CE, and 20&#x0200a;mL oral simethicone (Simethicone Emulsion (Espumisan) Berlin-Chemie AG Glienicker, Berlin, Germany, 40&#x0200a;mg/mL) was taken 30&#x0200a;minutes before CE. Patients randomized to Group C were treated identically to Group B, except that they fasted for 3 days and took 3&#x0200a;g oral senna 3 times daily before CE. During the 3 days of fasting, Group C patients were infused intravenously with 2.5 to 3.0&#x0200a;L glucose-containing fluid to provide the daily caloric requirement. Adverse events were recorded by a gastroenterology assistant.</p></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Capsule endoscopy procedure</title><p>The OMOM CE system (Chongqing Jinshan Science and Technology Group, China) is composed of a smart capsule, image recorder, and image workstation. After ingesting a capsule, it is moved through the gut by gastrointestinal peristalsis and transmits a video signal to an image recorder carried on the body of the patient. It captures an image every 2&#x0200a;seconds, has a field of view of 140&#x000b0;, and has a capsule battery life of about 10 to 12&#x0200a;hours. Therefore, a total of about 20,000 images are captured per patient, using a charge-coupled device. Patients were permitted to move during the procedure. The recorder was disconnected after approximately 11&#x0200a;hours, and data were downloaded to a workstation and Chongqing Jinshan Image Processing Software, version 6.05, was used to evaluate the CE images.</p></sec><sec><label>2.4</label><title>Interpretation of capsule endoscopy</title><p>Two blinded, experienced investigators, who had reviewed images from over 300 patients, independently evaluated small bowel cleansing and the CE images. The gastric emptying time (GET) and small bowel transit time (SBTT) were recorded for all patients. The GET was defined as the time from the first gastric image to the time of the first duodenal image. The SBTT was defined as the time from the first duodenal image to the time of the first cecal image, for patients in whom the capsule reached the cecum, and the time from the first duodenal image to the time of the last small intestinal image, for patients in whom the capsule did not reach the cecum. SBTT was divided into 2 equal intervals describing the proximal and distal small bowel transit times.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>2.5</label><title>Evaluation of bowel cleansing</title><p>Small bowel cleansing was evaluated using the previously described computed assessment of cleansing score (CAC) grading system.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>2.6</label><title>Evaluation of bile contents</title><p>The Rapid reading station software (Given Imaging, Yoqneam, Israel)<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> and the Jinshan OMOM Imaging Station 6.05 use a tissue color bar for the identification of anatomic landmarks and for the maintenance of an appropriate perspective on the images, and generates a summary of the color representations of individual CE images. It often demonstrates greenish segments of gut, corresponding to individual CE images of luminal contents, consisting mostly of bile. To measure the amount of green luminal contents, an electronic high-resolution image of the Rapid user interface was captured using commercially available software (Screen Print and Capture 32 3.5, Provtech Ltd, West Kilbride, UK). The color bars for the entire region, the stomach, the small bowel, and the proximal and distal segments of the small bowel, were captured individually. The lengths of gut containing green luminal contents in the latter 4 segments were calculated using ImageJ 1.45 (National Institutes of Health).</p></sec><sec><label>2.7</label><title>Analysis of endoscopy findings</title><p>Endoscopy findings were described by our previously published article.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>2.8</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Quantitative data are summarized using the mean (standard deviation (SD)).

The indications for CE were obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (83 patients), abdominal pain (44 patients), chronic diarrhea (37 patients), and others (comprising 16 patients, including 8 patients with abdominal, 3 patients with suspected small bowel Crohn disease, and 5 patients who did not want to undergo gastrointestinal endoscopic examination and asked to check the CE by themselves).</p><p>All patients swallowed the CE spontaneously. In total, 7 patients (2 patients in Group A, 3 patients in Group B, and 2 patients in Group C) were not included in the analysis because the capsule had not reached the cecum before the end of the examination. Two patients in Group A were excluded owing to capsule retention by a stromal tumor in the jejunum and delayed gastric emptying (the capsule stayed in the stomach for 128&#x0200a;minutes). Three patients withdrew from Group B: 1 refused the procedure, 1 withdrew because the capsule was trapped in the cecum because of Crohn disease, and 1 because the capsule was trapped in the ileum due to the presence of a large adenomatous polyp. Two patients in Group C were excluded because of capsule retention at a region of ileal stenosis, caused by a lymphadenoma and a malignant tumor, respectively.

This is because the contents of the small intestine (food residues, fecal residue, and opaque secretions) continue to empty into the colon. It is difficult to prevent this occurring by taking laxatives on only 1 occasion. Thus, many papers claim that the cleanliness of the distal small intestine is not ideal when laxatives are used once on the day of examination, or if they are taken twice, on the day before the examination and on the day of examination.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup></p><p>In this study we used 3 full days of intestinal preparation, which is 3 times the length of the normal bowel clearance regimen, during which the patient also fasts. Bowel clearance was aided by the administration of 20% mannitol at 20:00 the day before and at 05:00 on the day of the examination. This protocol aimed to ensure that the distal content of the small intestine was cleared effectively. Indeed, our data confirmed that the cleanliness of the small intestine in Group C was significantly higher than that of Groups A and B.</p><p>Liver cells constantly secrete bile during the interdigestive phase, which is stored in the gallbladder. The gallbladder can absorb water and inorganic salts from the biliary secretion and concentrate the bile 4- to 10-fold. Bile can be discharged into the duodenum from the liver and gallbladder during the interdigestive phase, but food, especially if rich in fat and protein, is the most important initiating cause of bile secretion in the digestive tract. Three days of fasting and administration of oral senna, combined with 20% mannitol and simethicone, alongside intravenous infusion of glucose-containing fluid to ensure daily calorie supply, thus prevents the majority of bile secretion. Our study showed that the green segments of the tissue color bar often correspond to individual CE images of green luminal contents, which consist mostly of bile. This implies that the green segments of the image will be smaller if bile secretion is lower, thereby improving the quality of bowel preparation in advance of CE.</p><p>Although polyethylene glycol (PGE) is usually the first choice laxative used before CE in the recommended scheme for bowel preparation, we used 20% mannitol for this study, and these preparations are reported to be equally effective (European Association, 2013<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>). In the same year, the <italic>J. Curr. Med. Res. Opin.</italic> published consensus guidelines that also recommended 20% mannitol as the effective drug for bowel preparation before CE. Mannitol is an osmotic laxative that softens stools, stimulates gastrointestinal peristalsis, accelerates fecal expulsion, and washes out intraluminal contents. When cost effectiveness is taken into consideration, 20% mannitol is superior to PGE. However, oral administration of mannitol can cause the production of hydrogen gas, which is added to the gas produced by bacteria and intestinal gas exchange, and the gas (oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide) that is swallowed. All of these gases generate bubbles that adhere to the surface of the intestinal mucosa and which seriously detract from intestinal cleanliness. Simethicone is an antifoaming agent that decreases the surface tension of such bubbles, thereby reducing foaming and enhancing visualization of the mucosa.</p><p>Assessment of small bowel cleanliness has been difficult for gastroenterologists for decades. At present, evaluation of small bowel cleanliness is usually undertaken using the visualized area percentage assessment of cleansing scores (AAC) or the CAC.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> The disadvantages of using the AAC are that the data generated vary significantly between clinicians, and that the calculation of the visualized area is complex and time-consuming. The advantages of using the CAC are that it can be used to evaluate a single image or a number of images of any part of the small intestine, that it is relatively quick and simple, and is less time-consuming, and that the results are not influenced by variation between clinicians. This method is increasingly being adopted by gastroenterologists.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> Furthermore, the incorporation of these scores into the CE reading software would permit the generation of a fully automated score. Our study has demonstrated that the use of CAC to assess small bowel cleanliness is rapid, simple, and practical.</p><p>This study had several limitations. First, 3 days of bowel preparation is a long period of time and this is less convenient for patients, and left some patients feeling hungry. Second, a disadvantage of the use of CAC to assess small bowel cleanliness and the extent of green luminal contents is that it uses a visual analog scale (color intensity ratio of red to green) to evaluate the images. Although the green segments of the tissue color bar mainly represent bile, chyme, fecal residue, bubbles, and opaque secretions may also influence appear this color, and the visual analog scale cannot differentiate among these.</p><p>CE cannot deliver water or air into the intestine, and cannot suction, inflate or wash the intestinal lumen like a gastrointestinal endoscope. Moreover, it is a disposable product that cannot be reused, while the diagnostic yield of CE and quality of mucosal visualization may be impaired by the presence of bile, chyme, fecal residue, bubbles, intraluminal opaque mucus, or brightness. We have shown that bile in the intestine was the most important factor influencing small bowel cleanliness, with the second most important being chyme and fecal residue, followed by bubbles, intraluminal opaque mucus, and brightness. However, the brightness can be adjusted using the imaging software to ameliorate this particular problem.</p><p>In conclusion, our prospective study suggests that 3 days&#x02019; fasting and oral senna, combined with 20% mannitol and simethicone, before CE can reduce the effects of the aforementioned factors and improve image quality in the entire small bowel. In particular, this protocol can improve visualization of the distal small intestinal mucosa, facilitating more accurate capture of lesions during an hour-long video observation, thereby increasing the diagnostic yield of the procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We wish to thank our colleagues, technicians, and nurses for their great help and cooperation during performing this study, and we also thank Fujian Department of Science and Technology and Fujian Medical University for this study was supported by Fujian Provincial Natural Science Foundation (2014J01396) and Fujian Medical University fund (FZS13032Y).</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: AAC = visualized area percentage assessment of cleansing scores, AVM = arteriovenous malformation, CAC = computed assessment of cleansing score, CE = capsule endoscopy, ChiCTR = Chinese Clinical Trial Register, GET = gastric emptying time, PGE = polyethylene glycol, SBTT = small bowel transit time.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Funding: This study was supported by Fujian Provincial Natural Science Foundation (2014J01396) and Fujian Medical University fund (FZS13032Y).</p></fn><fn fn-type="con"><p>Authors&#x02019; contributions: CH-b, HY, and WX-z initiated the study design; CH-b and HC reviewed all capsule endoscopy studies; LX-l, PL-x, and XS-p performed the majority of the data analysis.
