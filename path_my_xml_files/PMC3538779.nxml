Estrogen deficiency induces myocardial contractile dysfunction and increases cardiovascular disease risk in postmenopausal women. Our aim was to investigate whether carvedilol, a beta receptor blocker, would prevent ovariectomy-induced myocardial contractile dysfunction. Female rats (8 weeks old) that underwent bilateral ovariectomy were randomly assigned to receive daily treatment with carvedilol (OVX+CAR, 20 mg/kg), placebo (OVX) and SHAM for 58 days. Left ventricle papillary muscle was mounted for isometric tension recordings. The inotropic response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> (0.62 to 3.75 mM) and isoproterenol (Iso 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> to 10<sup>&#x02212;2 </sup>M) were assessed. Expression of calcium handling proteins was measured by western blot analysis. Carvedilol treatment in the OVX animals: prevented weight gain and slight hypertrophy, restored the reduced positive inotropic responses to Ca<sup>2+</sup> and isoproterenol, prevented the reduction in SERCA2a expression, abolished the increase in superoxide anion production, normalized the increase in p22<sup>phox</sup> expression, and decreased serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity. This study demonstrated that myocardial contractile dysfunction and SERCA2a down regulation were prevented by carvedilol treatment. Superoxide anion production and NADPH oxidase seem to be involved in this response.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from The National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq, Brazil) and the Esp&#x000ed;rito Santo Research Foundation (FAPES/FUNCITEC, Brazil).

Cardiomyocytes are sensitive to oxidative stress and ROS are capable of influencing cellular calcium regulation at several levels, including calcium overload and oxidation of proteins involved in calcium handling such as ryanodine receptor, SERCA2a, Na<sup>+</sup>-Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger and phospholamban <xref rid="pone.0053226-Zima1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053226-Dandona1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.

Briefly, rats were anesthetized, and a dorsal midline skin incision was made caudal to the posterior border of the ribs. The posterior abdominal muscle wall was bluntly dissected, the abdominal cavity was opened and the ovary was gently exteriorized and removed. The uterine horn was returned to the abdomen. The skin incision was closed with sterile nylon sutures, and the process was repeated on the other side. The rats were randomly assigned to receive treatment with carvedilol (OVX+CAR, 20 mg/kg in a 0.05% sodium carboxymethylcellulose solution and administered through canula by an oral route, daily) or placebo (OVX), and the last group underwent a SHAM operation and served as normal controls. All treatments lasted for 58 days.</p><p>Left ventricle papillary muscle contractility was studied 60 days postsurgery. At the time of sacrifice, the adequacy of the ovariectomy was grossly determined by the absence of ovarian tissue and marked uterine atrophy. We also determined the weight of the entire animal, as well as the weight of the left ventricle and the uterus.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Isometric Tension and Myocardial Contractility</title><p>Rats received 500 units of heparin intraperitoneally (i.p.) and were anesthetized 10 minutes later with urethane 1.2 g/kg (Sigma). The hearts were rapidly removed and perfused through the aortic stump as the left ventricle papillary muscles were dissected. Muscle preparations were mounted for isometric tension recording and maintained in 20 mL Krebs&#x02013;Henseleit solution (in mM: NaCl 118, KCl 4.7, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1.25, KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.2, MgSO<sub>4</sub> 1.2, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 23 and glucose 11) at 30&#x000b0;C and pH &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;7.4, which was continuously aerated with 95% O2 and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Resting tension was adjusted to produce maximal contractile force (Lmax). The twitch contraction rate was controlled by isolated rectangular pulses (10 to 15 V, 12 ms duration) through a pair of platinum electrodes. The standard stimulation rate was 0.5 Hz (steady-state). Isometric force development was measured with an isometric force transducer (TSD105A, Biopac) and normalized to muscle weight (g/g). Recording started after 30 minutes to permit the muscle to adapt to the new environmental conditions. Myocardial contractility was tested by measuring the positive inotropic response to changes in extracellular calcium (CaCl<sub>2</sub>, Merck) concentration (0.62 to 3.75 mM) and by adding isoproterenol (Sigma) concentrations to the bath (10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> M).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Hemodynamic and Ventricular Compliance Measurements</title><p>Animals were anesthetized with a mixture of the ketamine/xylazine (90 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively). The right carotid artery was isolated, and a polyethylene catheter (PE-50) was inserted and connected to a data acquisition system to measure the hemodynamic parameters. Following an adaptation period of 30 min, arterial pressure acquisition started. The catheter was advanced into the left ventricle, and systolic pressures (LVSP), end-diastolic pressures (LVEDP), dP/dt +, dP/dt &#x02013; and heart rate (HR) were continuously monitored for 15 min. To define the passive pressure-volume characteristics of the left ventricle, the heart was arrested in diastole with potassium chloride (1 M) and a double lumen catheter (PE 50 inside PE 200) was inserted 6 mm into the left ventricle via the aorta. The right ventricular free wall was incised to avoid fluid accumulation and variable compressive force on the interventricular septum. The atrioventricular groove was tied, and the ventricle was manually compressed to expel blood and create a negative pressure of &#x02212;5 mm Hg, which was taken as zero volume. Physiological saline was infused at 0.68 mL/min via one lumen, while the intraventricular pressure was continually recorded through the other lumen over the pressure range of &#x02212;5 to 30 mmHg. At least three reproducible pressure-volume curves were obtained within 10 minutes of cardiac arrest and well before the onset of rigor mortis. Ventricular volumes at pressures of 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 mmHg were determined from the pressure-volume curve.</p><p>The obtained curves were segmented and then separately analyzed. Pressure follows a linear pattern from 0 to 5 mmHg during volume infusion, and the slope is indicative of left ventricular dilatation. For the 5 to 30 mmHg segment, the curve was adjusted to a monoexponential model. Thus, to determine the stiffness constant during the 5&#x02013;30 mmHg intervals, a logarithmic transformation was performed on the pressure scale to create a linear fit.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Western Blot Analysis</title><p>Western blot was performed as previously described <xref rid="pone.0053226-Ribeiro2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053226-Simoes1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053226-Fiorim1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.

<italic>In vivo</italic> studies using transgenic mice that overexpress cardiac specific PLB suggested that the &#x0201c;functional stoichiometry&#x0201d; of PLB/SERCA2 is less than 1&#x02236;1 in native cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes <xref rid="pone.0053226-Kadambi1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Here, we show that this ratio is three-fold higher in the OVX group compared to the sham group. Phospholamban is a repressor of left ventricular basal contractile parameters, and alterations in the levels of phospholamban would be expected to result in alterations in myocardial contractility. Two-fold higher PLB protein levels in transgenic mice compared to wild type resulted in decreased Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase affinity for Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which was associated with decreased contractility and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport in cardiomyocytes <xref rid="pone.0053226-Kadambi1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Carvedilol treatment did not change phospholamban levels, however, it increased SERCA2a levels, thereby improving PLB/SERCA ratio.</p><p>In summary, our data indicate that treatment with carvedilol prevented the weight gain, myocardial contractile dysfunction and slight hypertrophy induced by ovariectomy. Moreover, this myocardial contractile dysfunction appeared to be dependent on superoxide anion production, which has detrimental effects on SERCA2a levels. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that carvedilol prevented myocardial contractile dysfunction in ovariectomized female rats by decreasing the renin angiotensin system activity.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0053226-BuphaIntr1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Bupha-Intr T, Wattanapermpool J (2006) Regulatory role of ovarian sex hormones in calcium uptake activity of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum.
