We hypothesise that electroacupuncture pretreatment improves insulin sensitivity and leads to a higher ovulation rate and greater chances of live birth after the induction of ovulation. The effect of electroacupuncture pretreatment followed by ovulation induction in women with anovulatory PCOS has not been investigated before, and we present here a randomised controlled trial to test this hypothesis by comparing electroacupuncture pretreatment followed by letrozole versus letrozole alone in anovulatory women with PCOS.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/analysis</title><p>This is a multicentre, randomised,and controlled trial. A total of 384 patients will be enrolled in this study and will be randomly allocated by a central randomisation system to the treatment group or the control group in a 1:1 ratio. The treatment group will undergo 16&#x02005;weeks of electroacupuncture pretreatment followed by 4 cycles of letrozole, and the control group will only undergo 4 cycles of letrozole. The primary outcome will be the live birth rate. All statistical analyses will be performed using the SPSS program V.21.0 (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA), and a p value &#x0003c;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics/dissemination</title><p>This study has been approved by the ethics committees of each participating centre. Written consent will be obtained from each patient and her husband before any study procedure is performed. Adverse events will be categorised, and the percentage of patients experiencing adverse events or serious adverse events during the treatment period will be documented. The results of this trial will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and presented at international meetings.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=NCT02491333&#x00026;Search=Search">NCT02491333</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>acupuncture pretreatment</kwd><kwd>live birth rate</kwd><kwd>letrozole</kwd><kwd>polycystic ovary syndrome</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This is the first randomised controlled trial comparing electroacupuncture pretreatment followed by letrozole versus letrozole alone on live birth in anovulatory infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).</p></list-item><list-item><p>This is the first trial that seeks to improve insulin sensitivity in women with PCOS by using electroacupuncture as the pretreatment.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Complications during pregnancy will also be recorded to verify the prospective effects of acupuncture on women with PCOS in this study.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Placebo or sham acupuncture will not be offered in the control group because it might not be truly inert and might still have some physiological effects.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The researchers, acupuncturists and the participants cannot be blinded to treatment allocation.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec id="s1"><title>Background</title><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine and metabolic disorder affecting 6&#x02013;10% of women of reproductive age,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and it accounts for 70&#x02013;80% of anovulatory infertility.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> PCOS is characterised by amenorrhoea, hirsutism, acne, obesity, polycystic ovaries and infertility, and it can have serious effects on the general health and quality of life. Insulin resistance (IR), hyperinsulinaemia and dyslipidaemia worsen with ageing, and the risk of miscarriage is three times greater in women with PCOS compared with healthy women.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Women with PCOS are also at an increased risk of pregnancy complications such as impaired glucose tolerance, gestational diabetes mellitus, pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia, and small for gestational age (SGA) children.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Thus, the metabolic abnormalities of PCOS can affect the woman's health as well as that of her children.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Ovulation induction in women with PCOS suffering from anovulatory infertility includes the use of antioestrogen, insulin sensitisers, aromatase inhibitors, gonadotropin and surgical treatment.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Clomiphene citrate has been the first-line medication, but a recent large multicentre randomised study<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> demonstrated that letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, results in a higher ovulation rate and a higher live birth rate than clomiphene citrate.</p><p>Despite the fact that pharmacological methods of ovulation induction are often effective, a large number of patients still have difficulty conceiving and they have a high risk of miscarriage that might be related to reduced endometrial receptivity.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The high prevalence of IR (up to 60%) in women with PCOS is considered to be one of the major pathophysiological changes in PCOS<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and studies indicate that IR and hyperinsulinaemia affect endometrial receptivity in many ways, leading to difficulty in conceiving and an increase in miscarriage.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Acupuncture is becoming popular in research and clinical practice, and recent studies indicate that acupuncture can increase the ovulation rate,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref> improve endocrine profile by decreasing circulating sex steroids, increase menstrual frequency<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>

<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> It has been shown that acupuncture can regulate endogenous systems, including the sympathetic nervous system, the endocrine system and the neuroendocrine system.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Acupuncture appears to improve endometrial receptivity in rats<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> by decreasing the impedance of the uterine artery blood flow and improving the blood flow to the uterus,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> which might enhance implantation and increase the chances of successful pregnancy and live birth.</p><p>Furthermore, electroacupuncture has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity in experimental trials. Electroacupuncture can significantly enhance the decrease in blood glucose levels after insulin injection, suggesting an improvement in insulin sensitivity.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The result indicates that electroacupuncture improves glucose tolerance both in wild-type and transgenic mice fed a high-fat diet, and that the effect is related to the stimulation parameters used and is probably due to the reduction of free fatty acid.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In rat PCOS models, repeated acupuncture has also been demonstrated to normalise insulin sensitivity.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Another study showed that electroacupuncture can normalise insulin sensitivity, and ameliorate IR and hyperinsulinemia in rats with PCOS, probably by regulating the function of pancreatic islets &#x003b2;-cells and by reducing oxidative stress and free androgen.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> During stimulation, electroacupuncture improves insulin sensitivity in a dihydrotestosterone-induced rat PCOS model more than does acupuncture with manual stimulation. However, poststimulation, both electrical stimulation and manual stimulation show equal effects, and this might be due to the activation of sensory afferents by both methods.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>Until now, there are still no studies investigating whether low-frequency electroacupuncture pretreatment followed by ovulation induction will increase the live birth rate. On the basis of previous studies, we hypothesise that acupuncture pretreatment improves insulin sensitivity and leads to a higher ovulation rate and higher live birth rate.

The present study is the first RCT to compare acupuncture pretreatment followed by letrozole with letrozole alone on live birth in anovulatory infertile women with PCOS. The hypothesis is that acupuncture pretreatment improves insulin sensitivity and leads to a higher ovulation rate and live birth rate, which is different from the available evidence suggesting that acupuncture influences ovulation by affecting the levels of various hormones. We are also interested in the prospective effects of acupuncture on women with PCOS, and complications of pregnancy such as impaired glucose tolerance, gestational diabetes mellitus, pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia, SGA, low birth weight, preterm delivery, pre-eclampsia, antepartum haemorrhage, congenital anomaly, perinatal mortality and multiple pregnancies will all be observed to verify the efficacy of the treatment in this study.</p><p>According to a recent systematic review,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> there are no studies that have been designed to investigate live birth&#x02014;which is one of the important clinical outcomes&#x02014;and there is no evidence of a difference in pregnancy rate between true and sham acupuncture. Based on this, live birth was chosen as the primary outcome in this study, and we chose letrozole alone as the control to replace placebo or sham acupuncture. In addition, low numbers of participants is one of the factors that has limited the quality of the studies performed until now. A high-quality study with an adequate sample size is urgently needed, and our estimates suggest that 384 patients recruited from three hospitals at the same time will ensure a sample size that is sufficient to test our hypothesis.</p><p>The study was designed in 2014, and the first participant was randomised on 18 August 2015. At the time of manuscript submission, we have recruited 90 patients and the recruitment is ongoing.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> JL and EHYN contributed equally to this work.
