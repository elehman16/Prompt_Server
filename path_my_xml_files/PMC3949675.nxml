Despite this agreement, there is little rigorous evidence that community action is effective: of the six randomised trials of community action published to date, all were US-based and focused on young people (rather than the whole community), and their outcomes were limited to self-report or alcohol purchase attempts. The objective of this study was to conduct the first non-US randomised controlled trial (RCT) of community action to quantify the effectiveness of this approach in reducing risky alcohol consumption and harms measured using both self-report and routinely collected data.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>We conducted a cluster RCT comprising 20 communities in Australia that had populations of 5,000&#x02013;20,000, were at least 100 km from an urban centre (population &#x02265; 100,000), and were not involved in another community alcohol project. Communities were pair-matched, and one member of each pair was randomly allocated to the experimental group. Thirteen interventions were implemented in the experimental communities from 2005 to 2009: community engagement; general practitioner training in alcohol screening and brief intervention (SBI); feedback to key stakeholders; media campaign; workplace policies/practices training; school-based intervention; general practitioner feedback on their prescribing of alcohol medications; community pharmacy-based SBI; web-based SBI; Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services support for SBI; Good Sports program for sports clubs; identifying and targeting high-risk weekends; and hospital emergency department&#x02013;based SBI. Primary outcomes based on routinely collected data were alcohol-related crime, traffic crashes, and hospital inpatient admissions. Routinely collected data for the entire study period (2001&#x02013;2009) were obtained in 2010. Secondary outcomes based on pre- and post-intervention surveys (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2,977 and 2,255, respectively) were the following: long-term risky drinking, short-term high-risk drinking, short-term risky drinking, weekly consumption, hazardous/harmful alcohol use, and experience of alcohol harm. At the 5% level of statistical significance, there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the interventions were effective in the experimental, relative to control, communities for alcohol-related crime, traffic crashes, and hospital inpatient admissions, and for rates of risky alcohol consumption and hazardous/harmful alcohol use. Although respondents in the experimental communities reported statistically significantly lower average weekly consumption (1.90 fewer standard drinks per week, 95% CI&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;3.37 to &#x02212;0.43, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.01) and less alcohol-related verbal abuse (odds ratio&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.58, 95% CI&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.35 to 0.96, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.04) post-intervention, the low survey response rates (40% and 24% for the pre- and post-intervention surveys, respectively) require conservative interpretation. The main limitations of this study are as follows: (1) that the study may have been under-powered to detect differences in routinely collected data outcomes as statistically significant, and (2) the low survey response rates.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This RCT provides little evidence that community action significantly reduces risky alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harms, other than potential reductions in self-reported average weekly consumption and experience of alcohol-related verbal abuse.

According to the World Health Organization's 2010 Global Burden of Disease Study, alcohol use is the fifth leading risk factor (after high blood pressure and smoking) for disease and is responsible for 3.9% of the global disease burden. Alcohol use contributes to heart disease, liver disease, depression, some cancers, and many other health conditions. Alcohol also affects the well-being and health of people around those who drink, through alcohol-related crimes and road traffic crashes. The impact of alcohol use on disease and injury depends on the amount of alcohol consumed and the pattern of drinking. Most guidelines define long-term risky drinking as more than four drinks per day on average for men or more than two drinks per day for women (a &#x0201c;drink&#x0201d; is, roughly speaking, a can of beer or a small glass of wine), and short-term risky drinking (also called binge drinking) as seven or more drinks on a single occasion for men or five or more drinks on a single occasion for women. However, recent changes to the Australian guidelines acknowledge that a lower level of alcohol consumption is considered risky (with lifetime risky drinking defined as more than two drinks a day and binge drinking defined as more than four drinks on one occasion).</p></sec><sec><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>In 2010, the World Health Assembly endorsed a global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol. This strategy emphasizes the importance of community action&#x02013;a process in which a community defines its own needs and determines the actions that are required to meet these needs. Although community action is highly acceptable to community members, few studies have looked at the effectiveness of community action in reducing risky alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harm. Here, the researchers undertake a cluster randomized controlled trial (the Alcohol Action in Rural Communities [AARC] project) to quantify the effectiveness of community action in reducing risky alcohol consumption and harms in rural communities in Australia. A cluster randomized trial compares outcomes in clusters of people (here, communities) who receive alternative interventions assigned through the play of chance.</p></sec><sec><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers pair-matched 20 rural Australian communities according to the proportion of their population that was Aboriginal (rates of alcohol-related harm are disproportionately higher among Aboriginal individuals than among non-Aboriginal individuals in Australia; they are also higher among young people and males, but the proportions of these two groups across communities was comparable). They randomly assigned one member of each pair to the experimental group and implemented 13 interventions in these communities by negotiating with key individuals in each community to define and implement each intervention. Examples of interventions included general practitioner training in screening for alcohol use disorders and in implementing a brief intervention, and a school-based interactive session designed to reduce alcohol harm among young people. The researchers quantified the effectiveness of the interventions using routinely collected data on alcohol-related crime and road traffic crashes, and on hospital inpatient admissions for alcohol dependence or abuse (which were expected to increase in the experimental group if the intervention was effective because of more people seeking or being referred for treatment). They also examined drinking habits and experiences of alcohol-related harm, such as verbal abuse, among community members using pre- and post-intervention surveys. After implementation of the interventions, the rates of alcohol-related crime, road traffic crashes, and hospital admissions, and of risky and hazardous/harmful alcohol consumption (measured using a validated tool called the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) were not statistically significantly different in the experimental and control communities (a difference in outcomes that is not statistically significantly different can occur by chance). However, the reported average weekly consumption of alcohol was 20% lower in the experimental communities after the intervention than in the control communities (equivalent to 1.9 fewer standard drinks per week per respondent) and there was less alcohol-related verbal abuse post-intervention in the experimental communities than in the control communities.</p></sec><sec><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings provide little evidence that community action reduced risky alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harms in rural Australian communities. Although there was some evidence of significant reductions in self-reported weekly alcohol consumption and in experiences of alcohol-related verbal abuse, these findings must be interpreted cautiously because they are based on surveys with very low response rates. A larger or differently designed study might provide statistically significant evidence for the effectiveness of community action in reducing risky alcohol consumption. However, given their findings, the researchers suggest that legislative approaches that are beyond the control of individual communities, such as alcohol taxation and restrictions on alcohol availability, may be required to effectively reduce alcohol harms. In other words, community action alone may not be the most effective way to reduce alcohol-related harm.</p></sec><sec><title>Additional Information</title><p>Please access these websites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001617">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001617</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The World Health Organization provides detailed information about <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/topics/alcohol_drinking/en/">alcohol</ext-link>; its <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs349/en/index.html">fact sheet on alcohol</ext-link> includes information about the global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol; the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/gho/alcohol/en/index.html">Global Information System on Alcohol and Health</ext-link> provides further information about alcohol, including information on control policies around the world</p></list-item><list-item><p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/">US National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</ext-link> has information about <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health"/>alcohol and its effects on health</p></list-item><list-item><p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a website on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/">alcohol and public health</ext-link> that includes information on the health risks of excessive drinking</p></list-item><list-item><p>The UK National Health Service Choices website provides detailed information about <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nhs.uk/LiveWell/Alcohol/Pages/Alcoholhome.aspx">drinking and alcohol</ext-link>, including information on the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/alcohol/Pages/Effectsofalcohol.aspx">risks of drinking too much</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/alcohol/Pages/Alcoholtracker.aspx">tools for calculating alcohol consumption</ext-link>, and personal stories about alcohol use problems</p></list-item><list-item><p>MedlinePlus provides links to many other resources on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/alcohol.html">alcohol</ext-link>

Contiguous communities in the list were provisionally classified as matched pairs. Each pair was checked to ensure the communities were at least 100 km apart geographically, to minimise the risk of cross-contamination of intervention impacts. One community in each pair was randomly allocated to the experimental condition using an Excel program. It was not possible to blind the ten experimental communities to their condition. The mayor of each experimental community consented to the involvement of his or her community in the project, and facilitated the implementation of the interventions in his or her community.

Direct engagement involved working with community stakeholders (such as the mayor and police) to engage and promote the view that alcohol-related harm was a community-wide issue that required a community-wide response. Regular meetings were held to clarify the project and identify roles. Indirect engagement occurred with government departments that had administrative oversight for staff based in the communities, to obtain support for their involvement.</p></sec><sec id="s3d2"><title>General practitioner training in alcohol screening and brief intervention</title><p>As part of a broader general practitioner (GP) training program being implemented concurrently in NSW, clinical addiction specialists provided two 2-h training sessions for local GPs in screening and brief intervention (SBI), using the ten-item Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) with a standard drink chart <xref rid="pmed.1001617-Selin1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Feedback was based on the FLAGS process, used as part of the adopted Drinkless Kit, comprising the following: feedback to patients on their level of drinking relative to normative data, listening to patients' views on their own drinking patterns and behaviours, advising patients on lower risk levels of drinking and the benefits they would obtain from drinking less, goal setting, and identifying strategies to help achieve goals. None of these GP training sessions were held in an AARC control community.</p></sec><sec id="s3d3"><title>Feedback to key stakeholders</title><p>During the engagement process, the communities nominated a group of key stakeholders who became a community coalition group with whom the researchers liaised as the project progressed.

Those weekends were targeted with the co-ordinated implementation of multiple strategies: the mayor wrote to venues licensed to sell alcohol in the week leading up to the problematic weekend to encourage them to be vigilant about their responsible service of alcohol requirements; there was a media campaign; local police agreed to increase their visibility by conducting foot or car patrols late at night and early in the morning on the Friday and Saturday of the problematic weekend, especially around licensed venues and the central business district; and there was feedback immediately after the targeted weekend from the research team to the local media on the number of alcohol-related crimes that had occurred, compared to the same weekends in previous years <xref rid="pmed.1001617-Navarro3" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.

GP training in SBI and a Good Sports program were exceptions, both of which were implemented in all communities opportunistically to coincide with other projects. A unique feature of this study was that it co-ordinated different types of interventions (e.g., SBI, GP prescribing, media campaign) implemented in different settings (e.g., primary care, schools, workplaces). Commencement of the intervention phase was planned for 2005. Although a lag period was anticipated between the implementation of the interventions and their effectiveness, the duration of this lag for different types of interventions was unknown.

For the logistic and linear models, sex and age group were included as covariates given their known association with alcohol harm <xref rid="pmed.1001617-Calabria1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1001617-Livingston1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. For count data, three terms were included for seasonal variation, and an additional term for year and quarter (to adjust for trends over time). In addition to these adjusted models, which account for possible sources of variation other than the intervention, results are also presented for an unadjusted analysis, which compares the experimental and control communities in the post-intervention period, controlling only for clustering (and population size for the count data). The standard errors of parameters in the generalised estimating equation models were estimated using the jack-knife method given that the number of clusters was small (<italic>n</italic>&#x0003c;50) <xref rid="pmed.1001617-Mancl1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>.</p><p>For the logit and negative binomial models, the interaction terms are not relative risks (RRs) or odds ratios (ORs) per se, but rather are the post-intervention ratios divided by the pre-intervention ratios: a result less than one indicates positive intervention effectiveness. Alternatively, these can be considered as the relative ratio (risk or odds) for experimental versus control communities post-intervention, adjusted for the pre-intervention ratio. For the linear regression model, the interaction term is the post-intervention difference in means between intervention and control groups, minus the pre-intervention difference.</p></sec><sec id="s3h"><title>Sample Sizes</title><p>For routinely collected data (primary outcomes), the availability of ten experimental and ten control communities allowed detection of relative between-group differences in outcomes of 30% (80% power, <italic>p</italic>&#x02264;0.05), assuming a pre-intervention outcome rate of 10 per 1,000 population and a coefficient of variation of 0.1.

Although the unadjusted analysis showed statistically significantly fewer inpatient admissions for alcohol dependence in the experimental communities post-intervention, relative to the control communities, this result most likely reflects that pre-intervention inpatient admissions for alcohol dependence were also statistically significantly lower in the experimental communities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-1001617-t005">Table 5</xref>): the post-intervention difference was not statistically significant after adjusting for this pre-intervention difference. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-1001617-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows that alcohol-related street offences, as the most significant of the alcohol-related crime outcomes, did not reduce over time, but did increase at a slower rate in the experimental, relative to the control, communities. Based on the survey data (secondary outcomes), respondents in the experimental communities post-intervention reported statistically significantly lower average weekly consumption and less alcohol-related verbal abuse.</p></sec><sec id="s5b"><title>Methodological Considerations and Implications</title><p>The results that were not statistically significant are unlikely to be a consequence of unobserved bias: an RCT design was used, and pre-intervention community characteristics likely to be associated with rates of alcohol consumption and harm were comparable in the experimental and control communities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-1001617-t003">Table 3</xref>). Bias related to the statistical methods is also unlikely: the jack-knife method was used to control for possible under-estimation of the variance of parameters in the generalised estimating equation models; adjustment for multiple comparisons was not required given that the majority of findings showed no intervention effectiveness; and the results that were not statistically significant showed small to moderate effectiveness and high levels of uncertainty (wide 95% CIs). This last observation may reflect that the study had insufficient power to detect any true intervention effectiveness as statistically significant because of the limited sample size of 20 communities, or that there was variation in the extent to which communities were exposed to the different interventions, or that the observed differences were smaller than those hypothesised. The web-based intervention, for example, had low rates of use across all communities, while the community engagement, feedback to stakeholders, media campaign, and school-based interventions were applied consistently because the researchers had a relatively high degree of control over their implementation. Conversely, although researchers provided the relevant training and resources, the extent to which GPs, pharmacists, EDs, workplaces, sports clubs, and police (on high-risk weekends) actually implemented their respective interventions in practice most likely varied substantially between communities.</p><p>Interpreting the statistically significant results is also difficult. Although the survey response rates were low (40% and 24% for the pre- and post-intervention periods, respectively), they were weighted to control for response rate bias, the survey items had at least some evidence for their reliability and validity (e.g., AUDIT <xref rid="pmed.1001617-Selin1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>), there was consistency within the self-report outcomes (e.g., a significant reduction in average weekly consumption is consistent with a reduction in the proportion of individuals reporting long-term risky drinking), and there was consistency between self-report and routinely collected data (e.g., a significant reduction in verbal abuse is consistent with a marginally significant reduction in street offences, while a lack of effectiveness on self-reported short-term risky drinking is consistent with a lack of effectiveness on alcohol-related assaults). If the impact on average weekly alcohol consumption truly represents the effectiveness of the intervention, it equates to a 20% reduction in average alcohol consumption in the experimental communities (1.9 fewer standard drinks per week [intervention effectiveness]/9.5 standard drinks per week [mean post-intervention consumption in the control communities]). This could provide a practical health benefit to the individuals who are consuming less alcohol and to communities: a 10% reduction in average consumption in a community has been estimated to equate to 25% fewer individuals engaging in heavy drinking (&#x02265;24 standard drinks/week) <xref rid="pmed.1001617-Rose1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s5c"><title>Conclusions</title><p>To our knowledge, this study provides the most methodologically rigorous data to date of the impact of community action, as defined by the suite of interventions implemented, on risky alcohol consumption and harm. It provides insufficient evidence to conclude that community action is effective in reducing a range of risky alcohol consumption patterns and alcohol-related harms, other than potentially reducing average weekly consumption and rates of alcohol-related verbal abuse. Despite these modest outcomes, the broader AARC project provides some unique insights for community-action approaches.</p><p>First, unlike existing randomised trials of alcohol community action <xref rid="pmed.1001617-Perry1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1001617-Saltz1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, the AARC project showed that it is possible to use routinely collected data to measure the impact of community-based interventions, and to identify rates of different types of alcohol-related harm in different communities <xref rid="pmed.1001617-Breen2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001617-Czech3" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, although the data may need to be tailored to measure a specific outcome (e.g. measuring alcohol-related serious assaults only) and to the psychometric properties of the specific measure examined <xref rid="pmed.1001617-Czech2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001617-Breen3" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. This study demonstrates the potential for key stakeholders to identify and target the particular harms that are most problematic in their own communities.</p><p>Second, although the AARC project is the first randomised trial of community action to focus on alcohol outcomes across the whole community, as opposed to only among young people, its results were broadly comparable to those of the existing randomised trials of alcohol community action: one found no impact on primary outcomes <xref rid="pmed.1001617-Komro1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, while the remainder found some impacts on self-reported outcomes <xref rid="pmed.1001617-Perry1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001617-Schinke1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1001617-Saltz1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Given that the only statistically significant effects in the AARC project were also on self-reported (secondary) outcomes rather than routinely collected data (primary) outcomes, it might be that community action is more effective on the less severe harms and drinking behaviours that are reported by respondents than on the more severe harms that are recorded in routinely collected datasets. Alternatively, these findings may highlight a potential limitation of self-reported data associated with a range of methodological factors, such as their reliability, their validity, and survey response rates.</p><p>Third, the AARC project showed that the majority of survey respondents agree with the idea of a community-action approach <xref rid="pmed.1001617-Czech1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, and that households are willing to pay to reduce alcohol-related harm <xref rid="pmed.1001617-Petrie2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Indeed, the economic analysis of the AARC project used a counterfactual methodology to estimate a cost&#x02013;benefit ratio that was favourable, essentially because of the value households placed on reducing alcohol-related harm <xref rid="pmed.1001617-Shakeshaft2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>Fourth, the primary purpose of this RCT was to test the collective impact of a suite of interventions that were feasible for communities themselves to implement and enforce. The intervention costs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-1001617-t002">Table 2</xref>), for example, highlight that communities could implement all 13 interventions for approximately AUD$61,000 (total cost of AUD$608,102 divided by ten experimental communities). Despite the interventions being feasible for communities to implement, the modest outcomes suggest that legislative approaches that are beyond the direct control of communities, such as pricing mechanisms <xref rid="pmed.1001617-Cobaic1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, restrictions on alcohol availability <xref rid="pmed.1001617-Breen2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001617-Cobaic1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001617-Ludbrook1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, and drink driving laws targeting young people <xref rid="pmed.1001617-Czech3" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001617-Hall1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, may be more cost-effective than community action in actually reducing a wide range of alcohol-related harms, as opposed to limiting the rate of increase of a subset of harms. Indeed, the general increase in alcohol-related crime over time in both the experimental and control communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-1001617-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-1001617-g002">2</xref>) may reflect the current strength of alcohol legislation in Australia. This interpretation challenges the view that community action alone is most likely to sustainably reduce alcohol-related harm.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1001617.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
