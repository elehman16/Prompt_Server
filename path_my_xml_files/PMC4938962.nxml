Few studies have evaluated the impact of alcohol warning advertising on alcohol consumption and possible mechanisms of effect. This pilot study aimed to assess whether alcohol warning advertising is effective in reducing urges to drink alcohol, if emotional responses to advertising explain any such effect or perceived effectiveness, and whether effects differ among heavier drinkers.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>One hundred fifty-two young adult (aged 18&#x02013;25) alcohol users completed an online experiment in which they were randomly assigned to view one of three sets of six advertisements: (i) alcohol warning; (ii) alcohol promoting; or (iii) advertisements for non-alcohol products. Urges to drink alcohol were self-reported post-exposure. Affective responses (pleasure and arousal) to each advertisement and perceived effectiveness of each advertisement were recorded. Typical level of alcohol consumption was measured as a potential effect modifier.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Participants exposed to alcohol warning advertisements reported significantly lower urges to drink alcohol than those who viewed either alcohol promoting or non-alcohol advertisements. This effect was fully mediated by negative affective responses (displeasure) to the alcohol warning advertisements. Perceived effectiveness of alcohol warning advertisements was associated with high arousal responses. Impact of the advertisements was unaffected by typical level of alcohol consumption, although the study was not powered to detect anything other than large effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In line with findings from the tobacco literature, alcohol warning advertisements that elicit negative affect reduce urges to drink alcohol. Their impact upon actual consumption awaits investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12889-016-3192-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Alcohol</kwd><kwd>Alcohol advertising</kwd><kwd>Alcohol marketing</kwd><kwd>Alcohol warnings</kwd><kwd>Craving</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>NIHR School for Public Health Research</institution></funding-source><award-id>SYAG/019 - Task 4 &#x02013; RG67185</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marteau</surname><given-names>Theresa M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>It is estimated that 5.9&#x000a0;% of global deaths and 5.1&#x000a0;% of the global burden of disease are attributable to alcohol consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In England, although young adults are less likely than other age groups to report drinking any alcohol at all, they are the age group most likely to report very excessive alcohol consumption (over 8 units) on at least one day in the previous week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Among females, those in the 16&#x02013;24 age group have the highest prevalence of hazardous and harmful drinking and of alcohol dependence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], whilst among young adult males there was a 57&#x000a0;% increase in alcohol-related hospital admissions from 2002 to 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Young adults are frequently the target of alcohol marketing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. One policy option to reduce harmful alcohol consumption in this age group is to restrict the marketing of alcoholic products. However, despite consistent evidence that exposure to alcohol advertising has a dose&#x02013;response association with earlier initiation of alcohol use and increased consumption in young people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], there is a lack of high quality evidence to support the implementation of alcohol marketing bans or restrictions to reduce alcohol consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This is one reason that such strategies have not found favour with policymakers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>An alternative approach to restricting alcohol marketing is to counter alcohol advertising&#x02019;s messages about the positive effects of alcohol consumption with public health messages presented as advertisements that warn about the negative consequences of alcohol use. The use of counter-advertising has been well studied in relation to tobacco, and there is a broad evidence base detailing strategies to maximise effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. There is very little comparable evidence for alcohol counter-advertising. Whilst evidence exists suggesting that advertisement campaigns to reduce alcohol impaired driving can be effective when professionally executed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], there is very little information available as to whether campaigns focusing on more general negative consequences of alcohol use have any effect in reducing alcohol consumption or changing the psychological predictors of consumption, such as attitudes towards alcohol, expectancies of use, and desire or craving for alcohol.</p><p>In addition to assessing <italic>if</italic> alcohol warning advertisements are effective, it is necessary to understand <italic>how</italic> they are effective so that campaigns can be designed to have maximum impact. Findings from the tobacco counter-advertising literature indicate that advertisements evoking strong negative emotions, such as fear and disgust elicited by graphic imagery of the damaging health effects of smoking or anger elicited by highlighting disingenuous practices of the tobacco industry, are more likely to promote smoking cessation, reduce the intention to smoke, and to have high perceived effectiveness (i.e. the perception that advertisements will be effective in convincing smokers to reduce or quit) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. There is also indication that emotionally evocative advertisements have the potential to reduce socioeconomic inequalities in smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. As yet, it is not known whether alcohol warning advertising that elicits strong negative emotional responses is similarly potent in influencing alcohol-related cognition or behaviour.</p><p>A further consideration in developing alcohol warning messages is the possibility for counterintuitive &#x02018;boomerang&#x02019; effects whereby exposure to the message increases the likelihood of the behaviour being warned against. There is some evidence of a boomerang effect in response to alcohol warning advertisements among heavier drinkers. In a recent study, heavier drinkers who viewed alcohol warning advertisements showed a reduction in negative implicit attitudes towards alcohol after viewing, compared to lighter drinkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This result may be explained by incentive sensitisation theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], which suggests that alcohol cues such as those present in alcohol warning advertising (i.e. words and images related to alcohol) might stimulate alcohol craving among heavy drinkers. In the current study, heaviness of drinking will be tested as a moderator of any effect of condition.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims and Hypotheses</title><p>The primary aim of this pilot study is to assess whether exposure to alcohol warning advertising is effective in reducing the urge to drink alcohol, and whether affective responses to advertising help to explain any such effect. We predict that participants exposed to alcohol warning advertisements will report fewer urges to drink alcohol compared to those exposed to alcohol promoting or non-alcohol advertisements (<italic>H1</italic>), and that, if present, this effect will be mediated by affective responses (low pleasure and high arousal) to advertisements (<italic>H2</italic>). The second aim is to assess whether any effects of alcohol-related advertising on urges to drink alcohol are stronger amongst heavier drinkers. We predict that heavier drinkers exposed to alcohol warning advertisements will report higher urges to drink compared to those exposed to non-alcohol advertisements (<italic>H3</italic>). The third aim is to assess whether emotional responses to advertisements are associated with their perceived effectiveness. We predict that affective responses to alcohol warning advertisements (low pleasure and high arousal) will be associated with higher perceived effectiveness (<italic>H4</italic>). The fourth aim is to identify appropriate advertisements for use in a laboratory-based study on the impact of alcohol-related advertising on alcohol consumption in young adults.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants comprised 152 young adults (50&#x000a0;% female, 49.3&#x000a0;% male, 1 did not report gender). Inclusion criteria were that participants were aged between 18 and 25 and were current alcohol users, defined as drinking at least one alcoholic beverage during a typical week. The mean age was 21.47 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.31). The majority of the sample reported their ethnicity as &#x02018;White British&#x02019; (65.1&#x000a0;%) or &#x02018;Any other White background&#x02019; (17.8&#x000a0;%). Participants were recruited via a UK based research agency, <italic>YouthSight</italic> (youthsight.com), that sent a request for participation to members of their existing panel of over 135,000 16&#x02013;30 year olds residing in the UK. Participants who responded to this request and met our inclusion criteria, assessed using an online pre-screening questionnaire, were given a web link to complete the study using the Qualtrics survey platform. Participants were paid &#x000a3;6 for participation. This incentive was delivered via the agency to those who completed the study.</p><p>As the current study used a pilot sample to test exploratory research questions, a formal sample size calculation was not conducted and the sample size was based on practical constraints.

Participants gave informed consent and then completed a battery of questionnaires. Following the questionnaires, participants were presented with a random selection of six of 15 condition-specific advertisements. Following each advertisement, participants reported their current pleasure and arousal, and the degree to which they perceived the advertisement to be effective. After rating six advertisements, participants reported their urges to drink alcohol. At the end of the study participants were shown a debrief page that included a link to online information about alcohol and health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Stimuli</title><p>A total of 45 advertisements (15 per condition) were selected for the study.

Criteria for inclusion were that advertisements were professionally produced, appeared to be relevant to young adults, and highlighted short-or long-term negative consequences of alcohol consumption. Selected advertisements were produced between 2006 and 2015 in the United Kingdom (7 advertisements), Australia (4), New Zealand (1), the Republic of Ireland (1), Sweden (1), and Iceland (1).

Our primary hypothesis was supported. Participants who viewed alcohol warning advertisements reported fewer urges to drink than those who viewed either alcohol promoting or non-alcohol advertisements. Our second hypothesis was partially supported: the effect of alcohol warning advertisements on reduced urges to drink alcohol was fully mediated by displeasure, although not by high arousal, felt in response to the advertisements. Our third hypothesis, that effects would differ among heavier drinkers, was not supported. In partial support of the fourth hypothesis, high arousal, but not pleasure, was associated with higher perceived effectiveness of alcohol warning advertisements.</p><p>These findings are in line with the literature on tobacco counter-advertising, which indicates that advertisements evoking negative emotion are particularly effective in promoting smoking cessation. Similarly, it has been shown that viewing aversive health-related images related to obesity alongside images of snack foods can make implicit attitudes towards these foods more negative and choice of such foods less likely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Taken in concert, these findings support the idea that negative imagery can influence health-related cognition and behaviour, perhaps via a priming process whereby viewing images of ill health activates motivation for good health. An understanding of how affective processes can be targeted to influence decision making and behaviour change may be beneficial in designing health communications.</p><p>Participants who viewed alcohol promoting advertising did not report greater urges to drink than those who viewed non-alcohol advertising. This may indicate that alcohol promoting advertising does not encourage alcohol use by stimulating alcohol craving. However, inducing or increasing alcohol craving using only alcohol-related imagery is known to be difficult in settings where no immediate opportunity for alcohol consumption is provided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In addition, our index of alcohol craving &#x02013; self-reported urges to drink alcohol &#x02013; involved explicit, deliberative questions. Previous studies have shown that explicit alcohol attitudes are not influenced by exposure to alcohol advertising, but that implicit measures are [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Future studies in this area should focus on implicit measurement of alcohol-related cognition.</p><p>The current findings should be considered alongside evidence that exposure to alcohol cues can produce negative affect and craving in alcohol dependent individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. We did not find evidence for a &#x02018;boomerang&#x02019; effect of exposure to alcohol warning advertising in the total sample or in heavier drinkers specifically in this study. However, around half of participants were non-hazardous drinkers, and the study had limited power to detect such a moderation effect. It is not clear from these data whether the alcohol cues present in alcohol warning advertising could have adverse effects among dependent drinkers. More research is needed to clarify whether inducing certain negative emotional states through alcohol warning advertising may have iatrogenic effects in certain populations, or whether the pairing of alcohol cues with negative emotional imagery may even be an effective way of disrupting conditioned alcohol use patterns in dependent drinkers.</p><p>There was a positive association between average levels of arousal felt in response to the selection of alcohol warning advertisements viewed and the perceived effectiveness of these advertisements. This finding complements recent evidence on neural responses to graphic cigarette warning labels, which show that images evoking stronger affective responses also evoke patterns of brain activation related to hazard perception and emotional memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Emotionally salient, arousing images appear to facilitate transmission of the health message, memory of its content, and, as shown in this study, thoughts that the message will be effective. However, high arousal did not predict changes in urges to drink. This may be an important consideration when designing alcohol warning advertisements. Although people <italic>perceive</italic> messages containing shocking, arousing imagery to be influential, messages that induce negative affect (with or without high arousal) may be more likely to influence alcohol-related cognition and behaviour. Negative affect has been shown to impact upon information processing and motivation, reducing reliance on pre-existing knowledge and increasing the expected value of future achievements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Motivations for future good health may also be stimulated by negative affect in response to health warnings.</p><sec id="Sec27"><title>Implications</title><p>Producing alcohol warning advertising may be a valuable addition to policies aiming to reduce harmful alcohol consumption in young adults. The observation of reduced urges to drink immediately following exposure suggests that such advertisements could have an impact if presented at times and locations where urges to consume alcohol are highest, for instance on Friday and Saturday evenings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] in or near to drinking establishments. This needs to be evaluated.</p><p>In the United Kingdom, the reliance on self-regulation of alcohol marketing by the alcohol industry has meant that few alcohol warning messages have been independently produced in recent years. Instead, responsible drinking messages, typically embedded within alcohol promoting advertising, have become common. Recent research suggests that responsible drinking messages have no clear definition, are predominantly used to promote alcohol products, and may encourage increased alcohol consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Indeed, many participants in the current study believed the term &#x02018;drink responsibly&#x02019; meant to drink, but within unspecified personal limits. In contrast, the current findings suggest that alcohol warning messages, not produced by the alcohol industry, can be effective in reducing cravings to drink alcohol. The alcohol warning advertisements used highlighted various negative consequences that can results from excessive alcohol use, rather than focusing on responsible drinking messages. Future research might consider directly comparing the effectiveness of these two types of messages on alcohol-related cognition and behaviour. Most pertinently, evidence is needed on whether the type of messages used in the current study are effective in reducing alcohol consumption.</p><sec id="Sec28"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This is the first study, to our knowledge, to examine the effects of alcohol warning advertising on urges to drink alcohol, a marker of problematic alcohol use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The focus on affective processes is novel and aligns with current theories of health decision making that emphasise automatic processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. There were, however, design limitations. As the study was conducted online participant understanding of the questions and tasks could not be monitored, although &#x02018;catch&#x02019; questions were employed to screen out participants not attending fully to the study. Affective responses to advertisements were measured by self-report. Whilst such methods show some convergence with objective physiological measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], self-reports could be complemented by objective measures in future studies. All participants saw the same number of advertisements so we were unable to examine possible dose&#x02013;response relationships, or emotional exhaustion effects of overexposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This research focused on immediate effects of advertising and it is unclear whether reductions in urges to drink would be sustained over time. Finally, the current findings do not indicate whether viewing alcohol warning advertising leads to immediate or long-term reductions in actual alcohol consumption.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Viewing advertisements that warn about the negative consequences of alcohol use can reduce urges to drink alcohol in young adults, compared to viewing alcohol promoting or non-alcohol advertising.
