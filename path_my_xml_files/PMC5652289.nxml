Vacc-4x is administered intradermally for uptake by dendritic cells in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Dendritic cells are potent antigen presenting cells that have the capacity for cross presentation allowing for epitope presentation on human leukocyte antigen (HLA) classes I and II. Following peptide uptake and intracellular proteolytic processing within dendritic cells, presentation of conserved epitopes on HLA class II stimulates CD4+ T cells. Moreover, presentation of epitopes on HLA class I stimulates CD8+ T cells, which can then kill infected cells presenting these conserved epitopes. Since sustained cytolytic effects of CD8+ T-cells require immune help from CD4+ T-cells, Vacc-4x carries both HLA class I and class II epitopes. Effective cell-mediated immune responses that can control and/or reduce virus levels, may maintain CD4+ T-cell counts and/or slow their decline during analytical treatment interruption (ATI).</p><p>Vacc-4x was shown to be safe and immunogenic in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 clinical study enrolling 137 HIV-1-infected participants who were virologically suppressed on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Pollard et al., 2014</xref>). Six immunizations were given between week 1 (baseline) and week 18 while participants continued cART. At week 28 eligible participants underwent ATI and were removed from cART for up to six months until week 52. Although no differences between the treatment groups for the pre-specified efficacy endpoints (cART resumption and changes in CD4 count change during ATI) were observed, there was a significant reduction in viral load (VL) set-point (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Pollard et al., 2014</xref>) and better preserved CD4 counts (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2016a</xref>) in the Vacc-4x group compared to placebo. In addition, both groups demonstrated increases from baseline in HIV-1-specific IFN-&#x003b3;-secreting peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) against p24 antigens by Enzyme-linked ImmunoSpot (ELISPOT) assay at week 52; however, only in the Vacc-4x group was this increase associated with a statistically significant reduction in VL set-point compared to the placebo group during ATI (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Pollard et al., 2014</xref>). This finding suggests the quality of cell-mediated immune responses (CMIs) during ATI may have differed between the two treatment groups and that specific CMIs elicited by Vacc-4x contributed to the beneficial Vacc-4x effect (VE) on VL and CD4 count.</p><p>The objective of this study was to follow up on the prior observations by systematically assessing CMIs at week 28 relative to baseline (wk28/wk1) or on their own (week 28) as predictors of VE during ATI. We hypothesized that T-cell immunity in terms of the magnitude and/or the presence (yes or no) of immune biomarkers (with or without reference to baseline values), especially those related to immune stimulation, T-cell proliferation and inflammation would predict the effect of Vacc-4x (vs. placebo) on controlling VL and/or maintaining CD4 count during ATI. To address these hypotheses, we considered immune biomarkers including interferon-gamma (IFN-&#x003b3;) secreting T-cells measured by ELISPOT, CD4+ and CD8+ and Total (CD3+) T-cell proliferation measured by a carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) assay, and cytokines released from T-cell proliferation supernatants ex vivo measured by the Luminex assay.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Study Procedures</title><p>The Vacc-4x study took place between July 2008 and June 2010 in Spain, Italy, the USA, the UK, and Germany (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Pollard et al., 2014</xref>). Participants aged 18&#x02013;55&#x000a0;years and virologically-suppressed on cART prior to enrollment were randomized to receive four weekly Vacc-4x or placebo priming immunizations and two boosting immunizations at weeks 16 and 18, followed by ATI by week 28. During ATI, participants returned to cART if their CD4 count reached 350&#x000a0;cells/&#x003bc;l or fell by 50%. Pre-ART VL and CD4 count were also available for most participants.

The VL and CD4 count endpoints were log<sub>10</sub>-transformed VL and CD4 count at weeks 44, 48, and 52 during ATI, with and without subtracting log<sub>10</sub>-transformed pre-ART VL and CD4 count, respectively. VE on VL (VE<sup>VL</sup>) and CD4 count (VE<sup>CD4</sup>) were defined as the mean difference of VL and CD4 count endpoints, respectively, between the Vacc-4x and placebo groups. A positive (or negative) immune predictor indicates a positive (or negative) association between immune response levels and Vacc-4x benefit. Vacc-4x benefit is indicated by having a lower VL or a higher CD4 count in the Vacc-4x group compared with placebo.<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT diagram showing the availability of immunological samples for the vaccine effect prediction analysis of the phase 2 Vacc-4x clinical study.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0005">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p><p>For each VL and CD4 count endpoint, univariate and multivariable linear regression models of observed complete-case data were used to identify potential predictors of VE. Missing data due to insufficient specimens were assumed to be missing completely at random. Wald tests were used to evaluate statistical interactions between each immune variable predictor and treatment assignment. All reported results are from multiple regression models adjusted for at least one of the following baseline confounding variables identified as predictors of the VL or CD4 count endpoint in the Vacc-4x or placebo group: preART VL or CD4, median-dichotomized LDH (for VL endpoints), continuous LDH (for preART-adjusted VL endpoints), median-dichotomized WBC (for preART-adjusted VL endpoints), anti-C5/gp41<sup>732&#x02013;744</sup> antibodies, LDH or WBC (for CD4 endpoints), or dichotomized WBC or anti-C5/gp41<sup>732&#x02013;744</sup> (for preART-adjusted CD4 endpoints). Sex at birth was also considered in the analyses of the Vacc-4x group or the combined Vacc-4x and placebo groups. However, due to the sparsity of female participants, especially in the placebo group, analyses did not adjust for sex at birth when models were unstable. When considering what baseline covariates might contribute to the analysis of immune responses as predictors of vaccine effect (our study objective), we first examined all available baseline demographic and clinical factors as potential predictors of VL and/or CD4 count during ATI within each treatment group as previously described (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2016a</xref>). Specifically, we considered gender (male or female), age (both continuous and dichotomized), country (Germany, Spain, US, or UK and Italy combined), time on cART (continuous and dichotomized), time since HIV diagnosis (continuous and dichotomized), CD4 nadir (continuous and dichotomized), preART VL (continuous and dichotomized), preART CD4 count (continuous and dichotomized), as well as host genetics class I HLA type. Among these baseline factors, together with safety factors considered in a separate analysis (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2016b</xref>), age, gender, preART VL, LDH and WBC were identified as significant predictors of VL and/or CD4 count during ATI, which were subsequently included in the analyses of vaccine effect predictors reported here. Other baseline factors were found to be only marginally or not predictive and hence were not included in further analysis.</p><p>Q-values were calculated to account for multiple comparisons within the analysis of each endpoint and predictor type (continuous or categorical) (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>). Multiple testing adjustments for interaction tests were applied across immune variables that were identified as a significant predictor in either the individual or combined treatment groups.

Besides HLA class I alleles and CCR5 mutations, no immune biomarkers have been reported to be associated with either the natural control of HIV-1 VL (e.g. in elite controllers) or intervention-induced (e.g. therapeutic vaccination) control of HIV-1 VL. The Vacc-4x phase 2 study was one of the largest placebo-controlled clinical trials of a therapeutic HIV-1 vaccine and included up to 6&#x000a0;months ATI, permitting establishment of a VL set-point. As previously reported, there was no difference in the time to viral rebound between Vacc-4x and placebo groups, although the viral load set point was significantly lower for the Vacc-4x group compared to placebo, and compared to their own preART levels. These findings suggest that Vacc-4x immunization yielded potential vaccine benefit through improved cell-mediated immune responses to HIV compared to the placebo group (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Pollard et al., 2014</xref>). The Vacc-4x phase 2 study therefore provides a unique opportunity to carry out analyses to determine prospective immune correlates of Vacc-4x effect.</p><p>Prior analysis of safety parameters in the Vacc-4x phase 2 study revealed that lower post-vaccination C-reactive protein concentrations in serum and higher anti-C5/gp41<sup>732&#x02013;744</sup> antibody levels were associated with VE in Vacc-4x participants (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2016b</xref>), suggesting that low immune activation and/or inflammation may facilitate attaining vaccine effect. It was therefore of further interest to determine the effect of CMIs on VE, including cytokine production from T-cell proliferation supernatants that are not usually addressed in clinical trials of HIV-1 therapeutic or preventative vaccines.</p><p>Baseline anti-HIV immune response variability is a particular challenge in the field of therapeutic HIV-1 vaccines because the varying nature and magnitude of baseline immune responses to HIV-1 may influence the ability to effectively detect vaccine-induced immunity. We found that ELISPOT and CFSE responses at baseline were highly correlated with week 28 responses. This finding suggests that the immune systems of individuals with higher baseline immune responses while still on cART may be more responsive to immune stimulation by vaccination than those who had lower baseline immune responses. Similar findings have been made regarding the presence of baseline delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses in an earlier Vacc-4x clinical study (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Nyhus et al., 2006</xref>). This observation may have important implications for future therapeutic and preventative vaccine studies of potential correlates of vaccine effect, because strong predictors of post-vaccination biomarkers will greatly increase the statistical efficiency of such evaluations (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Follman, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Gilbert et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Vacc-4x aims to induce CD8+ T-cell-mediated killing of infected cells, however, this was not measured directly in this study because such assays were less developed at the time the study was conducted. T-cell proliferation is nevertheless considered a central parameter for measuring the immunogenicity of interventions aimed at inducing cell-mediated immunity and ultimately killing of infected cells. T-cell proliferation is a complex process and immune markers associated with T-cell proliferation leading to CD8-mediated killing are not fully understood. We therefore assessed cytokines released during ex vivo T-cell proliferation to determine whether it was possible to identify potential biomarkers for T-cell proliferation associated with the production of CD8+ T-cells that could lead to vaccine-associated reductions in viral load.</p><p>Several positive week28/wk1 and week 28 predictors of vaccine effect were identified. Regarding PBMC biomarkers, we found that higher week 28 CD4+ T-cell proliferation but lower wk28/wk1 fold-changes were associated with Vacc-4x benefit in terms of better preserved CD4 counts in the Vacc-4x group vs. the placebo group during ATI. This suggests that vaccine-matched T-cell responses at week 28 may be more focused towards conserved (vulnerable) regions of HIV-1 p24, hence providing benefit in maintaining CD4 counts in the Vacc-4x group as compared to the placebo group. Meanwhile, lower wk28/wk1 fold-changes may be a consequence of higher baseline response levels and the relative difference among participants being greater at baseline than week 28. Another possibility could be the potential effect of Vacc-4x immunization on reducing HIV reservoirs in peripheral blood as has been reported in more recent studies (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Rockstroh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Leth et al., 2016</xref>). This could theoretically have resulted in lower viral burden in PBMCs by week 28 and T-cell proliferative responses that did not lead to a fold-rise from baseline.</p><p>Regarding T-cell proliferation supernatant biomarkers, we found that higher wk28/wk1 TNF-&#x003b1; fold-changes were associated with Vacc-4x benefit in terms of lower VL and better preserved pre-ART adjusted CD4 counts. Such positive correlation was also observed for week 28 TNF-&#x003b1; and preART-adjusted CD4 counts. Moreover, higher wk28/wk1 IFN-&#x003b3; fold-changes were associated with Vacc-4x benefit in terms of lower VL. Both TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3; are established Th1 cytokines that activate effector functions of macrophages, neutrophils and CD8+ T-cells to kill cells infected with intracellular pathogens. Ex vivo IFN-&#x003b3; production in PBMCs following antigen stimulation (e.g. ELISPOT) has been used as a standard measure of vaccine immunogenicity. However, it is now clear that cytokines induced by vaccination rarely act alone, but rather in concert which complicates identification of immune correlates. For example, measurements of IFN-&#x003b3; alone have been insufficient to predict efficacy for both tuberculosis (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Mittr&#x000fc;cker et al., 2007</xref>) and HIV (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Buchbinder et al., 2008</xref>). Indeed, in the STEP study of a preventive adenovirus 5-vectored HIV vaccine, cell-mediated immune responses as measured by IFN-&#x003b3; ELISPOT, did not correlate with protection, rather, more participants in the vaccinated group became infected (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Buchbinder et al., 2008</xref>). Subsequent efforts have focused on the induction of polyfunctional T-cells producing more than one cytokine on antigen stimulation as measured by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Burgers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Corey et al., 2009</xref>). Recently, alternate statistical methods have been developed to address polyfunctional T-cell responses, such as COMPASS (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2015</xref>). This approach revealed strong inverse correlations between CD8+ T-cell responses and HIV-1 infection risk in the efficacy study of another preventive DNA/rAd5 vaccine (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Janes et al., 2017</xref>). The T-cell responses were based on intracellular cytokine staining of T-cells producing IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-2 and/or TNF-&#x003b1;.</p><p>Our findings nevertheless support the concept that induction of IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1; cytokines during ex vivo T-cell proliferation, which involves longer term culture of cells than for ELISPOT and ICS, may be associated with virus control and/or preservation of CD4 count during ATI. As such, cytokine analysis of T-cell proliferation supernatants could emphasize the breadth of cytokines and chemokines released on antigen stimulation and thereby serve to complement ELISPOT and ICS analyses that detect cytokine production from individual cells following short term culture.</p><p>We also found that higher wk28/wk1 fold-changes of IL-6 in proliferation supernatants were associated with VE. Interestingly, serum IL-6 was associated with chronic immune activation and adverse events during ATI in the SMART study, where participants underwent treatment interruption in the absence of any therapeutic intervention (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">El Sadr et al., 2006</xref>). In the Vacc-4x study, serum IL-6 levels remained within normal range (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Pollard et al., 2014</xref>). Our findings could therefore suggest that transient IL-6 released during T-cell proliferation responses is associated with virus control, but that persistent (serum-detectable) IL-6 induction drives HIV replication and disease progression, particularly in the absence of cART. Higher levels of week 28 IL-17 in the placebo group were associated with lower CD4 counts at week 44; the converse was true for the Vacc-4x group. This is consistent with prior observations where higher plasma levels of IL-17 were associated with lower CD4 counts (&#x0003c;&#x000a0;200&#x000a0;cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) in HIV-1-positive volunteers (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Saing et al., 2016</xref>). Higher week 28 IL-13 (proinflammatory cytokine) levels above the median were also associated with higher VL at week 48 in the Vacc-4x group vs. the placebo group. Taken together, these findings highlight the complexity of cytokine responses in vaccine studies where induction of some cytokines (e.g. IL-6, IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1;) in T-cell proliferation supernatants is associated with Vacc-4x effect whereas induction of other cytokines (e.g. IL-13 and IL-17) did not. These responses sometimes conflict with reported cytokine levels measured in serum or plasma and related to HIV pathogenesis, perhaps because the in vivo measurements may be complicated by underlying immune activation. These observations also emphasize the importance of including placebo controls in clinical studies evaluating therapeutic vaccines.</p><p>ELISPOT and CFSE are functional assays that measure ex vivo immune responses to antigen stimulation and can be compared between pre- and post-vaccination time-points. The CFSE positivity criteria were stringent compared to other clinical studies (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Danta et al., 2008</xref>), which may have influenced the extent of positive proliferation assay responses obtained. Of note, the p24 antigens used in this study corresponded only to the conserved regions in the vaccine, from which there has been little reported immune escape following Vacc-4x immunization (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Kran et al., 2010</xref>). The Luminex assay analyzed CFSE supernatants following stimulation with full-length recombinant p24, and could therefore also have included responses to p24 epitopes outside the conserved regions in Vacc-4x.</p><p>Limitations of this study include 1) limited sample size for well-powered assessment of immune biomarkers as correlates of the observed vaccine effect. The small number of female participants also hindered assessment of the impact of gender. 2) The identified immune biomarkers were only assessed as predictors of vaccine effect, not as biomarkers in the causal pathway of the observed vaccine effect. Future research is needed to determine the clinical implications of these biomarkers. 3) Given the small sample size and the large number of potential biomarkers, we only assessed each biomarker univariately. Future research could examine biomarker interplay and their collective influence on vaccine effect. 4) Limited specimen availability from all time-points precluded more comprehensive characterization of vaccine-induced immune responses (e.g. T-cell exhaustion markers, and ICS analysis).</p><p>Nevertheless, to our knowledge, previous studies on HIV immune correlates of protection are predominately in the field of preventative HIV vaccines, where baseline responses are absent (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Thakur et al., 2012</xref>). In our analyses, we presented results with and without accounting for baseline responses, highlighting their unique role in predicting VE in the context of therapeutic HIV vaccines. Furthermore, much focus of current research remains on the induction of humoral responses, with emphasis on broadly neutralizing antibodies. On the other hand, therapeutic vaccines have largely focused on the induction of cell-mediated immune responses. Immunogenicity following therapeutic vaccination has been described with reductions in viral load (<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Vardas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Garcia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Pollard et al., 2014</xref>), as well as with no or limited effects on the rate of viral rebound or control of viral load (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Jacobson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Thompson et al., 2016</xref>). No immune correlates have yet been clearly defined from these generally small studies. <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Perera et al. (2016)</xref> evaluated one HIV-1 elite controller, who had received a p24 therapeutic vaccine in 1993. Responses associated with virus control included high fold-changes in plasma levels of fractalkine, Interferon-inducible T-cell alpha chemoattractant (I-TAC), insulin-like-growth factor binding protein (IGFBP)-2, and MIP-1&#x003b1;. It is also not clear whether the correlates for virus control (i.e. reducing viral load set point) are going to be the same as those for delaying viral rebound. Our findings based on one of the largest therapeutic HIV vaccine trials emphasize the importance of baseline-adjusted correlation analyses of immunological markers, and the potential value of assessing cytokine production in T-cell proliferation supernatants harvested from ex vivo antigen stimulation in placebo-controlled clinical trials.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bi0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bb0005"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bart</surname><given-names>P.-A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Goodall</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Barber</surname><given-names>T.</given-names></name><name><surname>Harari</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Guimaraes-Walker</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Khonkarly</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Sheppard</surname><given-names>N.C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Bangala</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Frachette</surname><given-names>M.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Wagner</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Liljestr&#x000f6;m</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Kraehenbuhl</surname><given-names>J.P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Girard</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Goudsmit</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Esteban</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Heeney</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Sattentau</surname><given-names>Q.</given-names></name><name><surname>McCormack</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Babiker</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Pantaleo</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Weber</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name><surname>EuroVacc Consortium</surname></name></person-group><article-title>EV01: A phase I trial in healthy HIV negative volunteers to evaluate a clade C HIV vaccine, NYVAC-C undertaken by the EuroVacc Consortium</article-title><source>Vaccine</source><volume>26</volume><year>2008</year><fpage>3153</fpage><lpage>3161</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18502002</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0010"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0010"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Benjamini</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Hochberg</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Controlling the false discovery rate: a practical and powerful approach to multiple testing</article-title><source>J.
