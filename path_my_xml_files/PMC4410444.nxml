Since the intervention was based on the TTM and the instructing people for health have used these processes in their teachings, it is clear that positive changes are created in the intervention group and people use these strategies for changing their attitudes and stabilizing their behaviors.

Almost to the end, the participants showed no inclination to fill the questionnaires. On the other hand, the physical activities were measured and considered only through the questionnaire that was completed in a self-administered method. Thus, it seems that brief questionnaires and more subjective tools such as pedometers should be used in considering physical activities, in the future. It is recommended that in future studies, five groups of people are entered, and results are compared with them.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>According to the obtained results, it was defined that training physical exercises according to TTM increases physical activities in women affected by metabolic syndrome and improving abdominal indices, TG, and HDL. Thus, this model could be used to train such people for treatments or even preventing a lot of chronic and cardiovascular diseases.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This study was granted by the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.
