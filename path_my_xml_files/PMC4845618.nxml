Ethical approval was obtained from University of Ibadan/University College Hospital Joint Ethics Committee.</p><p>All patients were aged 50 years and above and were scheduled for elective surgery for uncomplicated cataract under local anesthesia. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient after a detailed explanation about the conduct of the study. The study followed the tenets of Helsinki declaration.</p><p>One hundred and fifty-two patients; 76 in each arm was studied. Each patient was randomly allocated to either group A (peribulbar block) or group B (posterior sub-Tenon block) using a computer-generated block of four random numbers with an epitable software.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> All anesthetic injections were administered by one the authors (ION) who also assessed the complications of the procedures. Pain and globe akinesia were assessed by an independent assessor. The patient, the independent assessor and the surgeons were masked to the type of anesthesia administered.</p><p>The patients underwent either manual small incision cataract surgery (MICS) or extracapsular cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Posterior sub-Tenon's anesthesia</title><p>Tetracaine 0.5% eye drops was instilled into the eye to be operated on. The patient was instructed to close the eye for 2 min and timed with the stop clock. The eyelids and periocular area were subsequently cleaned with 5% povidone iodine. Eyelid wire speculum was inserted to gain good exposure and the patient was instructed to look upward and outward to expose the inferonasal quadrant. The conjunctiva was lifted up in the inferonasal quadrant with Moorfields forceps. A small conjunctival nick was made with a blunt Westcott's scissors 5 mm from the limbus and a blunt dissection into the sub-Tenon space was made to expose the sclera. To minimize subconjunctival hemorrhage, any visible blood vessel was avoided. A 19G curved posterior sub-Tenon cannula attached to 5 ml syringe containing anesthetic injection was inserted into the sub-Tenon space glided along the contour of the globe. Five milliliters of 2% lignocaine mixed with adrenaline 1:200,000 (5 &#x003bc;g/ml) and hyaluronidase 150 IU/ml was injected slowly into the sub-Tenon space. In a situation where there was resistance in injecting anesthetic, the direction of the cannula was changed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Peribulbar anesthesia</title><p>The eyelid and periocular areas were cleaned with 5% povidone iodine. The patient was instructed to look straight ahead to ensure that the eye was in the neutral position of gaze. The injection was given at the inferotemporal site using 1<sup>1/4</sup> -inch 23 gauge sharp needle attached to 5 ml syringe containing the anesthetic agent with the eye in neutral position of gaze. The needle was inserted through the lid as lateral as possible toward the junction of the inferior orbital rim and the lateral margin parallel to the floor of the orbit and tangential to the globe. The needle was advanced until the hub touched the skin. After negative aspiration for blood, 5 ml of lignocaine 2% mixed with adrenaline 1:200,000 (5 &#x003bc;g/ml), and hyaluronidase 150 IU/ml was injected. The eye was massaged digitally for between 5 and 10 min.</p><p>Appropriate supplemental anesthetic injection was given through the medial canthal route to any participant in either group where needed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Assessment of pain</title><p>An 11-point (0-10) numerical pain reporting scale (NRS)<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> was used to assess patient-reported pain during injection of anesthesia, intraoperatively and postoperatively by the independent assessor. NRS is a linear scale subdivided into 10 equal intervals, with the left end marked 0, indicating no pain, and the right end marked 10, representing the worst pain imaginable. Patient-reported pain during administration of anesthesia, during surgery, and after surgery was recorded as none, mild, moderate, or severe with none defined as a score of zero on the 11-point scale, mild as 1-3, moderate as 4-6, and severe as more than 6. The chart was explained to the patients after randomization. The patients were asked to grade the pain experienced during the injection of the anesthetic on the NRS before massaging was done. The patient was asked to grade the intraoperative pain on the NRS during the surgery after insertion of the intraocular lens. The postoperative pain was assessed within 5 min after surgery as soon as the patient got to the recovery room using the same scale.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Assessment of motility</title><p>Measurement of ocular movement in all four quadrants (inferior, superior, medial, and lateral) was performed using a transparent plastic rule by the independent assessor who was not aware of the anesthetic technique used. The reference point was the limbus of the appropriate quadrant. The patient was instructed to look in the primary position of gaze where possible. The zero mark of the rule was aligned with the limbus of the appropriate quadrant and patient instructed to look toward that quadrant and the extent of limbal excursion in that direction read off from the rule. Excursion was scored as follows, (0) no movement, (1) movement of 2 mm and (2) movement of more than 2 mm. Overall movement score was obtained by combining the scores of these four directions of movement. This score ranges from 0 (no movement) to 8 (complete movement) and was categorized into two groups, akinesia (score 0-4) and no akinesia (score 5-8). The motility was assessed every 2 min until akinesia was attained or up to 10 min after the injection of anesthesia if otherwise. The serial measurement was terminated once akinesia was attained. Supplemental injection was given if akinesia was not achieved at 10 min.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data collected were entered into a database and analyzed with Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA).

The proportion of patients that achieved akinesia increased with time. The two anesthetic techniques were comparable in providing globe akinesia for cataract surgery (<italic>P</italic> = 0.06). This is in agreement with some authors<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> who reported that sub-Tenon block was comparable to peribulbar block in providing adequate globe akinesia and anesthesia for cataract surgery. Some other studies,<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> however, reported that sub-Tenon block provided a better globe akinesia than peribulbar anesthesia during surgery. In these studies,<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> different volumes of the anesthetic agent were used for the peribulbar and posterior sub-Tenon groups while in the present study, equal volumes were given in both groups. The different volumes of anesthetic agents used may account for the variation. However, in another study Al-Yousuf<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> in Bahrain used equal volumes of the same anesthetic mixture in both groups and reported that the sub-Tenon's anesthesia was more effective in achieving globe akinesia compared to peribulbar anesthesia. However, he did not state the time interval for grading the akinesia.</p><p>The number of patients who received supplementary injection was statistically significantly higher in peribulbar group compared to the sub-Tenon's anesthesia (<italic>P</italic> = 0.02). Eighty-seven percent and 100% of respondents who received supplementary injection in the peribulbar and sub-Tenon groups respectively were given 2-3 ml. The average volume of supplementary anesthetic injection for peribulbar group was 3 ml (range 2-10 ml) while that of sub-Tenon was 2 ml (range 2-3 ml). The volume of top up injection was individualized according to the level of akinesia achieved at 10 min. This was given once except in two patients in the peribulbar group who received 5 ml and 10 ml each in two divided volumes. This suggests that higher volume of supplementary injection of same mixture of anesthetic agent might be needed in peribulbar compared to sub-Tenon's anesthetic injection. Similar studies<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> also reported that significantly higher number of patients who received peribulbar anesthesia were given supplementary injection compared to sub-Tenon group.</p><p>A high proportion of the patients reported mild pain in both groups during anesthetic injection, (75% in peribulbar vs. 83% in the sub-Tenon group, <italic>P</italic> = 0.64) and during surgery (87%), while a small proportion reported moderate pain during injection and surgery. There was no report of severe pain at any stage of the surgery in both groups while a high proportion of patients (71% peribulbar vs. 70% posterior sub-Tenon group, <italic>P</italic> = 0.88) reported no pain immediately after surgery. There have been similar reports in studies done by Azmon <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> in Israel, Budd <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> in the United Kingdom, Parkar <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> in India and Al-Yousuf<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> in Bahrain that both techniques caused the patients similar level of pain during administration and intra-operatively. However, in another study, Briggs <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> in the United Kingdom reported that more patients experienced pain during peribulbar injection compared to sub-Tenon's anesthetic injection (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Overall, there was no difference in the pattern of patient reported pain between the two techniques during injection of anesthesia, surgery and in the immediate postoperative period, suggesting that both techniques provided a similar level of comfort to the patients at each stage of the surgery.</p><p>The incidence of chemosis was found to be significantly higher (<italic>P</italic> = 0.005) in the sub-Tenon technique compared to the peribulbar group in this study. Budd <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and Parkar <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> however, found no difference in the incidence of chemosis between sub-Tenon and peribulbar anesthesia. Probably the injection was deposited into wrong anatomical planes such as mid sub-Tenon space in some presumed cases of posterior sub-Tenon injection. Incidence of chemosis and subconjunctival hemorrhage increases with injection into anterior and mid sub-Tenon spaces compared to posterior sub-Tenon space.<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Although equal volume arm was used in both peribulbar and posterior sub-Tenon groups, the closeness of the sub-Tenon space to the subconjunctival space may also have accounted for higher rate of chemosis in the latter. This study equally revealed statistically significant higher (<italic>P</italic> = 0.00) rate of subconjunctival hemorrhage in the sub-Tenon technique compared to the peribulbar technique. Budd <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> also reported that it was significantly higher in sub-Tenon group compared to peribulbar group. This may be due to severance of the subconjunctival vessels during dissection into the sub-Tenon space. These complications, however, did not lead to cancellation of any surgery in the study.</p><p>No life or sight-threatening complications such as globe perforation, retrobulbar hemorrhage, optic nerve injury, central retinal vessel occlusion or brainstem anesthesia were recorded. This is similar to findings in other studies.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>This study shows that peribulbar and sub-Tenon routes of administering anesthetic substance are comparable in providing adequate akinesia and analgesia for cataract surgery among Nigerians. Both anesthetic blocks caused mild pain during injection, but provided comparable good analgesia during surgery and in the immediate postoperative period. The occurrence of chemosis and subconjunctival hemorrhage though significantly higher in the sub-Tenon group compared to peribulbar group did not result in cancellation of any surgery. There was no life- or sight-threatening complication recorded. This study, therefore, suggests that both techniques are effective and safe.</p><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Alhassan</surname><given-names>MB</given-names></name><name><surname>Kyari</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Ejere</surname><given-names>HOD</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Peribulbar versus retrobulbar anaesthesia for cataract surgery</article-title><source><italic>Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</italic> 2008, Issue 3.
