For a smooth extubation, there should be no straining, movement, coughing, breath holding or laryngospasm. Extubation at light levels of anesthesia or sedation can stimulate reflex responses via tracheal and laryngeal irritation. Various agents like lidocaine, opioids, esmolol, calcium channel blockers,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] magnesium sulphate and propofol have been shown to attenuate these responses, but they all have limitations and side effects. Dexmedetomidine, an &#x003b1;2-adrenoreceptor agonist with a distribution half-life of approximately 6 minutes has been successfully used for attenuating the stress response to laryngoscopy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Currently, dexmedetomidine is indicated for intensive care unit sedation in mechanically ventilated patients and for sedation of non intubated patients before or during surgical and other procedures.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>We hypothesized that dexmedetomidine might be a useful agent to attenuate the response to extubation as it provides sedation, hemodynamic stability and does not depress respiration. We designed this prospective, randomized, double blind trial to determine if dexmedetomidine can serve as an effective alternative to the commonly used agents for blunting the hemodynamic response to tracheal extubation. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of dexmedetomidine on hemodynamic and recovery responses during extubation, quality of extubation and postoperative sedation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This study was carried out on 50 patients (25 in each group) between 20 to 45 years of age of either sex belonging to American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II and scheduled for elective general surgical, urological and gynecological surgeries. Patients with cardiovascular or respiratory disorders, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, difficult airway, medications that effect heart rate (HR) or blood pressure (BP), pregnant, currently breast feeding women, history of sleep apnea and those for emergency procedures were excluded.</p><p>Institutional board approval was taken and written informed consent was taken from each patient. Pre-anesthetic check up was conducted and a detailed history and complete physical examination recorded. Routine investigations like complete blood picture, blood grouping/typing, blood urea and serum creatinine were done. Using computer generated random allocation, patients were divided into two groups (25 patients in each group). The enrolling investigator prepared the drug solution to be given before extubation and had no role in patient&#x02019;s assessment.</p><p>Routine anesthetic technique was used using propofol, fentanyl, vecuronium, nitrous oxide-oxygen and halothane. Standard monitoring with electrokardiography (EKG), pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>) and noninvasive BP was done. About 15 minutes before the estimated time of end of surgery, inhalation agent was cut off and patients in each group received the specified solution intravenously over 15 minutes.</p><p>Patients in group A received dexmedetomidine 0.75 mcg/kg intravenous (IV) in 100 ml normal saline (NS) over 15 minutes while in group B, patients received 100 ml NS over 15 minutes.</p><p>HR, systolic BP and diastolic BP were recorded at the start of bolus drug injection and thereafter at 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 minutes. Residual neuromuscular blockade was reversed with neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and atropine 0.02 mg/kg IV. When patients&#x02019; spontaneous respirations were considered sufficient and patients were able to obey simple commands, suction of throat was done and trachea was extubated. The anesthesiologist performing the extubation was blinded to the study drugs. HR, systolic BP and diastolic BP were recorded at the time of extubation and thereafter at 1, 3 and 5 minutes after extubation followed by every 5 minutes for 30 minutes. Occurrence of any event like laryngospasm, bronchospasm, desaturation, respiratory depression, vomiting, hypotension, bradycardia or undue sedation was noted.</p><p>Hypotension was defined as a decrease in systolic BP of more than 30 mmHg from baseline or a mean arterial pressure of less than 60 mmHg and was corrected with IV fluids and if required, with small dose of mephentermine 3 mg IV. Bradycardia was defined as a HR of less than 60/minute and was corrected, if associated with hemodynamic instability, with atropine 0.6 mg IV.</p><p>Quality of extubation was evaluated based on cough immediately after extubation, using a 5 point rating scale (Extubation Quality Score):[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] 1 = no coughing, 2 = smooth extubation, minimal coughing (1 or 2 times), 3 = moderate coughing (3 or 4 times), 4 = severe coughing (5-10 times) and straining, 5 = poor extubation, very uncomfortable (laryngospasm and coughing &#x0003e;10 times).</p><p>Postoperative sedation was evaluated on a 6 point scale (Ramsay Scale):[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] 1 = Anxious or agitated and restless or both, 2 = Cooperative, oriented and tranquil, 3 = Drowsy but responds to commands, 4 = Asleep, brisk response to light glabellar tap or loud auditory stimulus, 5 = Asleep, sluggish response to light glabellar tap or loud auditory stimulus, 6 = Asleep and unarousable.</p><p>Power of study was calculated assuming a 15% change in HR and BP between baseline and extubation. According to statistical power analysis, 23 patients per treatment group were needed to get a 90% power in detecting a 15% difference between treatment groups with a 5% type I error. Assuming a 5% dropout rate, the final sample size was set at 50 patients (25 patients per group). The parameters were recorded and data was entered into Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS 15.0). Statistical analysis was done using paired-samples <italic>t</italic>-test for between-group comparisons. The &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test or the Fisher exact test was used to analyze extubation quality, sedation scores, and adverse events. <italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c;0.05 was considered as statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>The patients in the two groups were comparable for age, weight and male:female ratio, ASA physical status, amount of halothane used, duration of surgery and the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic profile of two groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOACP-29-162-g001"/></table-wrap><p>We observed a statistically significant difference (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in HR between the two groups from 5 minutes after starting administration of the agent till 20 minutes after extubation [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>].

These changes are usually transient and well tolerated by most patients, but may be deleterious in certain subgroups of patients.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine has been successfully used to attenuate the hemodynamic responses to tracheal intubation. Basing on its characteristics of sedation, hemodynamic stability, and lack of respiratory depression, along with its relatively short half-life and analgesic effects, the present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of dexmedetomidine in a dose of 0.75 mcg/kg on hemodynamic responses during extubation, the quality of extubation, the level of postoperative sedation and the prevalence of complications.</p><p>The dose of dexmedetomidine ranges from 0.5-1 mcg/kg.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] A pilot study, using three different doses (0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg, 0.75 &#x003bc;g/kg and 1 &#x003bc;g/kg) of dexmedetomidine, was conducted. In this pilot study, a dose of 1 mcg/kg resulted in hemodynamic instability while a dose of 0.5 mcg/kg gave insignificant results. The present study was therefore, conducted with a dose of 0.75 mcg/kg, although there is evidence in favor of a dose of 0.5 mcg/kg.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>Dexmedetomidine activates receptors in the medullary vasomotor center, reducing norepinephrine turnover and decreasing central sympathetic outflow, resulting in alterations in sympathetic function and decreased HR and BP. In the present study, the hemodynamic parameters in the study group were significantly stable during extubation when compared to the placebo group. Dexmedetomidine 0.5 mcg/kg administered 5 minutes before the end of surgery has been shown to stabilize hemodynamics, allow easy extubation, provide a more comfortable recovery and allow early neurological examination following intracranial operations.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Dexmedetomidine 0.5 mcg/kg, given 5 minutes before extubation has been found to be more effective than fentanyl 1 mcg/kg in attenuating airway reflex responses to tracheal extubation and maintaining hemodynamic stability without prolonging recovery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] In patients undergoing vascular surgery, dexmedetomidine (plasma concentrations in the range of 0.18 to 0.35 ng/ml) attenuated the increase in HR and plasma norepinephrine concentrations during emergence from anesthesia and did not attenuate postoperative increases in HR or BP after emergence from anesthesia or affect intraoperative anesthetic or postoperative analgesic requirements.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] An infusion of dexmedetomidine started 20 minutes before anesthesia and continued until the start of skin closure in patients undergoing supratentorial brain tumor surgery was found to blunt tachycardic response to intubation and the hypertensive response to extubation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic> studies indicate that &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> stimulation can cause smooth muscle relaxation thereby preventing bronchoconstriction. In our study, most patients in the study group could be extubated smoothly with minimal coughing (Extubation Quality Score 2) when compared to control group, where most patients had moderate cough (Extubation Quality Score 3). Dexmedetomidine 0.5 mcg/kg given as a single-dose bolus before tracheal extubation has been shown to attenuate airway-circulatory reflexes during extubation with no difference between the groups in the incidence of breath holding or desaturation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>Central stimulation of parasympathetic outflow and inhibition of sympathetic outflow from the locus coeruleus in the brainstem plays a prominent role in the sedation and anxiolysis produced by dexmedetomidine. Decreased noradrenergic output from the locus coeruleus allows for increased firing of inhibitory neurons including the &#x003b3;-amino butyric acid system resulting in anxiolysis and sedation. We found that most patients in study group were drowsy but responding to verbal commands (Ramsay Sedation Scale 3) after extubation when compared to control group, where most patients belonged to Ramsay Sedation Scale 2. Dexmedetomidine 0.25 mcg/kg/hour has been used for sedation during mechanical ventilation in pediatric patients and found to be as effective as midazolam 0.22 mg/kg/hour.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] The quality of sedation is better and the need for rescue sedation is less with dexmedetomidine use as compared with midazolam and there is no significant adverse effect on hemodynamic or respiratory function.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>The activation of &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenoceptors, imidazoline-preferring receptors, or both in the ventrolateral medulla and especially in the solitarius nucleus tract by dexmedetomidine causes bradycardia. In our study, the incidence of bradycardia and hypotension was higher in study group than in control group. Dexmedetomidine 2.5 mcg/kg followed by 0.2-2.5 mcg/kg/hour has been found to reduce HR in patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] A higher frequency of postoperative hypotension has been reported when patient controlled analgesia with dexmedetomidine is administered.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>Our study found insignificant difference in the incidence of vomiting between the two groups. However, others have found a higher, though not statistically significant, prevalence of adverse events (i.e., hypotension, bradycardia, and perioperative nausea and vomiting) with use of dexmedetomidine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>In our study, none of the patients in either group developed respiratory depression, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, undue sedation or desaturation. Similar findings have been made by <italic>Guler et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Dexmedetomidine use in morbidly obese patients has been found not to induce respiratory depression at clinical doses although it improved quality of postoperative analgesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]</p><p>To conclude, use of dexmedetomidine before extubation attenuates the hemodynamic response to extubation. It enables smooth extubation of the trachea and provides adequate sedation postoperatively. Dexmedetomidine increases the incidence of bradycardia and hypotension, but does not cause side effects like respiratory depression, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, undue sedation and desaturation.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None
