steps on body composition, physical functions, vascular functions, health-related quality
of life (HR-QOL) and self-efficacy in elderly people. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects
were 47 elderly persons who resided in Port Island in the Chuo Ward of Kobe City in Hyogo
Prefecture, Japan. After the calculation of the mean preintervention physical activity
(PA), the subjects were instructed to increase their PA to a target baseline + 1,300
steps/day. Body composition, physical functions, vascular functions, HR-QOL, and
self-efficacy were measured at baseline, after 3 and 6 months. These items were compared
between a group that increased their PA and a group that did not. [Results] After 6
months, 26.1% of the subjects achieved the PA target. No significant improvements were
observed in body composition, physical functions, vascular functions, or self-efficacy for
either group after 3 and 6 months. However, the HR-QOL improved significantly after 6
months in the achievement group. [Conclusion] Although the intervention to increase PA did
not produce significant improvements after 6 months in body composition, physical
functions, vascular functions, or self-efficacy, the HR-QOL improved significantly during
this relatively short period.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Physical activity</kwd><kwd>Local elderly</kwd><kwd>Physical functions</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Physical inactivity is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, diabetes<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, cancer<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, osteoporosis<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, cerebral infarction<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, and other
diseases, and is closely related to survival prognosis<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. A large cohort study
(Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study) of about 80,000 subjects in Japan found
that physical activity (PA) associated with the mortality rates of cancer, heart disease,
and cerebrovascular disease<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. A report
by the World Health Organization ranked physical inactivity as fourth among the global risk
factors for mortality, after hypertension, smoking, and hyperglycemia<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, whereas a Japanese study ranked it third after smoking
and hypertension<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. We previously
surveyed and studied the influence of daily PA on the physical functions and prognoses of
patients with cardiovascular disease. We observed reduced physical functions and higher
rates of recurrence and re-hospitalization among patients with low PA levels for all
diseases<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. As decreased PA can
reduce physical functions and increase disease-specific mortality, we believe that
maintaining high levels of PA is extremely important from the standpoints of disease
prevention and survival prognosis.</p><p>The &#x0201c;Health Japan 21&#x0201d; program of the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare aims
to extend healthy life expectancies by supporting health promotion programs for the general
public. Increasing PA is an important part of Health Japan 21, which encourages elderly
people (age 70&#x02005;years and older) to increase their PA by 1,300 steps per day (about 15&#x02005;min,
650&#x02013;800 m)<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is expected that
increased PA will improve physical functions (muscle strength, balance ability), body
composition (reduce body weight and fat mass, increase muscle mass), cardiovascular
functions (reduce blood pressure and degree of arteriosclerosis), and quality of life (QOL),
and that maintaining a healthy lifestyle will produce a variety of physical and
psychological benefits, such as increased self-efficacy. However, Health Japan 21 does not
state a specific target duration by which increasing PA by 1,300 steps per day can be
expected to have physical and psychological effects on healthy elderly people, nor did it
specify what the expected effects are. Thus, it is important to show the chronological and
quantitative effects of increasing PA by 1,300 steps/day.</p><p>The objective of this study was to clarify the effects of increased PA during 6 months on
physical functions, body composition, cardiovascular functions, health-related QOL (HR-QOL),
and self-efficacy in community-dwelling elderly people. The subjects were categorized into 2
groups based on whether they had met a PA target. The effects were monitored at 3 and 6
months to clarify the physical and psychological changes in the subjects, quantitatively and
chronologically. For this study, PA was defined in steps per day.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects were elderly people (at least 65&#x02005;years old but younger than 85&#x02005;years old) who
resided in Port Island in the Chuo Ward of Kobe City in Hyogo Prefecture, Japan. Through
announcements in our university&#x02019;s homepage, newspapers, and community bulletin boards in May
and June 2014, we sought participants for a project aimed at increasing PA and for this
study. The applicants were invited to a lecture on PA (covering the relationship between PA
and disease incidence, effects of higher PA, and specific methods of increasing PA) and an
explanatory meeting about this study. Sixty-nine subjects agreed to participate in the
project and the study, and provided their consent in writing. We excluded subjects with
cerebrovascular disease, orthopedic disease, respiratory organ disease, heart disease, or
other underlying disease that limited their level of PA; those for whom increased PA was
deemed not beneficial; and those who could not walk independently outdoors. Furthermore, all
subjects underwent cognitive function screening in the form of the Rapid Dementia Screening
Test<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, to confirm that they do not
have reduced cognitive function (7 points or lower). This study was conducted with the
approval of the ethics committee of the Hyogo University of Health Sciences (no. 14042).</p><p>Of the 69 subjects, 22 were excluded because they could not undergo the regular evaluations
for some reason, leaving 47 subjects for the analysis. The mean age of the subjects was
71.9&#x02005;years (65&#x02013;82&#x02005;years); there were 12 men and 35 women; their mean body mass index (BMI)
was 22.4&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (16.5&#x02013;29.2&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>); and their mean preintervention PA
was 9110 steps (3,569&#x02013;19,800 steps). The subjects were categorized into 2 groups: those who
had achieved the PA target (achievement group=18 subjects) and those who did not achieve the
target (non-achievement group=29 subjects).</p><p>PA monitors (Mediwalk MT-KT-2DZ, Terumo Corp.) had been distributed to the subjects; these
had been used to measure PA for 7 continuous days before the intervention. The mean PA
calculated from these measurements was used as the baseline value. The subjects were given a
full explanation on how to use the PA monitors. They were instructed to wear them on their
waists at all times, except during sleeping and bathing, to measure their total daily PA.
The mean PA was calculated during 7 days in late June and early July 2014. The weather
during this period was clear or cloudy, with an average temperature of 23.7&#x02005;&#x000b0;C. The PA
target (mean PA + 1,300 steps) was set based on the mean preintervention PA, and the
subjects were instructed to increase their PA by using this target as a standard. They were
also instructed to record the total PA for each day on a special form, before sleeping. The
PA monitors and PA records were collected at 3 and 6 months after the start of the
intervention. Data on the PA monitors were transferred to a computer, and the total PA per
day was calculated by using a special software (Smile Data Vision, Terumo Corp.). Subjects
whose mean PA after 6 months reached the target level were placed in the achievement group,
whereas those who did not reach the target were placed in the non-achievement group. The
body composition, vascular functions, physical functions, HR-QOL, and self-efficacy were
compared between the groups. Each item was measured before the intervention, after 3 months,
and after 6 months.</p><p>Body fat percentage, muscle mass, muscle mass percentage, basal metabolic rate, and
estimated bone mass were measured with the bioelectric impedance method by using a
high-precision body composition monitor (DF860, Yamato-Scale). Each measurement was taken at
the same time each day. The subjects were asked to avoid excessive eating and drinking the
day before, and to refrain from eating or drinking for 2&#x02005;h before the measurements.</p><p>An ABI/PWV device (BP-203RPEIII form, Omron Co.) was used to measure the brachial-ankle
pulse wave velocity (baPWV) and ankle-brachial index (ABI). Measurements were taken after
the subjects had rested while lying on a bed for 5&#x02005;min. Two measurements of each variable
were taken, and the mean values were used.</p><p>The grip strength of the dominant hand was measured with a grip meter (Hand Grip Meter
6103, Tanita Corp.) in the standing position. Two measurements were taken and the maximum
value was used. The knee-extension strength of the dominant leg was measured with a handheld
dynamometer (HHD) (Mutas F-1, Anima Corp.) in a sitting position. Two measurements (with at
least 30&#x02005;s rest between them) were taken after the subjects practiced the procedure, and the
maximum value was used. The arm length was measured as the distance from the center of the
knee joint to the middle of the HHD sensor. Torque (Nm) was calculated by multiplying the
force applied to the sensor (N) by the arm length (m), which was then divided by the
subject&#x02019;s body weight (kg) to obtain the torque-to-weight ratio (Nm/kg).</p><p>Balance ability was measured as the time the subjects could stand on the dominant leg. Two
measurements were taken by using a stopwatch, and the maximum value was used. The maximum
one-leg standing time was set at 120 s. If a subject could stand on one leg for 120&#x02005;s, the
test was stopped at that point. Walking ability was evaluated on a 15-m walking path in a
hallway with no obstructions. A stopwatch was used to measure the time it took the subjects
to walk 10&#x02005;m at a comfortable pace and at maximum speed. For comfortable walking, the
subjects were instructed to walk at their normal speed in daily life. For maximum walking,
they were instructed to walk as fast as they could without running. The walking speed was
calculated as 10&#x02005;m &#x000d7; 60&#x02005;s &#x000f7; walking time.</p><p>HR-QOL was measured by using the standard version of the MOS 36-Item Short-Form Health
Survey (SF-36v2) in a self-administered format. The points for each item were calculated on
a SF-36v2 scoring program (iHope International). The PA self-efficacy scale of Oka et al.
was used to evaluate self-efficacy<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Five grades of activity stress (intensity, time, number of times) were set for walking
activity. The subjects self-recorded their current degree of walking, and the mean values
were calculated.</p><p>The achievement group and the non-achievement group were compared by using a t-test and the
&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. Comparisons between baseline, 3 months, and 6 months were performed
with one-way analysis of variance (Bonferroni method). The significance level was set at
&#x0003c;5%. As a sub-analysis, correlation coefficients were calculated between the PA rate of
change and the rates of change of the other items. Rates of change were calculated as (6
months &#x02212; baseline) / baseline &#x000d7; 100. SPSS Statistics version 21.0 was used for statistical
analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Baseline characteristics of the study participants (n=47)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variables</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total(n=47)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Achievement group (n=18)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Non- achievement group(n=29)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">71.9 &#x000b1; 4.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">71.9 &#x000b1; 4.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">71.8 &#x000b1; 3.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (male/female)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12 / 35 </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 / 12</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14 / 35</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">High (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">156.1 &#x000b1; 9.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">155.9 &#x000b1; 9.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">156.2 &#x000b1; 9.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">54.9 &#x000b1; 9.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">54.3 &#x000b1; 8.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">55.3 &#x000b1; 10.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.4 &#x000b1; 2.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.2 &#x000b1; 2.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.4 &#x000b1; 2.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hypertension (%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">29.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">38.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hyperlipidemia (%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">33.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Diabetes (%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Musculoskeletal disorders (%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">29.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Baseline PA (steps/day)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9,110 &#x000b1; 3,240</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8,270 &#x000b1; 2,591</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9,631 &#x000b1; 3,431</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Data are mean &#x000b1; standard deviation or %.

between the achievement and non-achievement groups were observed in age, gender, BMI, or
concomitant disease, the subjects in the achievement group walked about 1,500 steps more
than their baseline PA, which means they added a certain amount of exercise in their daily
lives. Moreover, the baseline number of steps in both groups was higher than that of the
average elderly Japanese person (males 5,436, females 4,604)<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, which suggests that many of the people who were interested in this
study had a high degree of health awareness.</p><p>No significant differences in the body composition items were observed between baseline and
after 3 or 6 months. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 182 subjects conducted by
Slentz et al. reported strong correlations between PA and body fat mass, lean body mass, and
waist circumference<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The PA level used
in their RCT differed from that of the present study; however, the length of the
intervention was roughly the same. However, the subjects of the RCT were generally
overweight, with BMI from 25 to 35&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and mean body fat percentage of about
35%, whereas the mean BMI and mean fat percentage of our subjects were 22.4&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>
and 30%, respectively. Thus, most of the subjects in the present study had standard
physiques. This indicates that increased PA during a short period of about 6 months can
improve body composition in obese subjects; however, when the subjects have a standard
physique, there is almost no impact on body composition. Furthermore, Nakae et al. reported
that subjects who took at least 1,000 more steps per day for 1&#x02005;year after receiving support
for increasing their PA had significantly lower body weight, fat percentage, and BMI<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. The age, BMI, and fat percentage of the
subjects in their study were similar to those in our study. To improve body composition in
subjects with standard physiques, PA may need to be increased for at least 6 months.</p><p>Neither group exhibited significant differences in vascular functions after 3 or 6 months.
The baPWV reflects the degree of vascular stiffness, with higher values indicating higher
stiffness<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies have
found links between daily PA and baPWV<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>; however, the effects of interventions
that increase PA on the baPWV have yet to be established. As the baPWV is affected by
vascular stiffness, we hypothesized that increased PA would improve the baPWV; however, our
results did not show an impact on vascular stiffness. This may be because the baPWV values
of the subjects were within the normal range, or because of the short 6-month duration of
the intervention.</p><p>For physical functions, no significant differences were observed in balance ability or
walking ability. The knee-extension strength, balance ability, and walking ability mainly
reflect lower-limb functions, and previous studies have reported a link between PA and
lower-limb function<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, Takahashi et al. reported that elderly persons
who engaged in 30&#x02005;min of walking per day, 5 days per week, for 12 weeks did not exhibit
significant differences in the cross-sectional area of lower-limb muscles<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. They concluded that walking alone cannot
increase muscle mass&#x02014;a finding supported by the present study. It seems to be difficult to
improve lower-limb functions by increasing PA by 1,300 steps per day for a short period of 6
months.</p><p>For HR-QOL, the achievement group showed significantly higher scores on role functioning
after 6 months compared with baseline, whereas the scores in the non-achievement group
decreased significantly after 3 and 6 months. It has been previously reported that
maintaining or increasing PA contributes to maintaining or improving HR-QOL<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>&#x02014;a finding supported by the present study.
We surmise that obtaining sufficient exercise by increasing PA has positive mental and
psychological effects that lead to increased HR-QOL. In contrast, role functioning decreased
significantly after 3 months and 6 months in the non-achievement group, and PA also declined
significantly at these time points. A significant correlation was also observed between the
PA rate of change and the rate of change of role functioning, which indicates an association
between PA and role functioning even over a short period of 6 months.</p><p>The limitations of this study were that many of the subjects had relatively high levels of
PA and a high degree of health awareness. Therefore, the subjects&#x02019; levels of psychological
and physical functions may have differed from a random sample of community-dwelling elderly
people. However, many health-related initiatives for community-dwelling elderly people
attempt to increase PA, such as that in this study. We thus believe that our results would
be relevant to future initiatives for increasing PA in community-dwelling elderly people. In
the future, it will be important to accurately assess the effects of increased PA on
physical functions, body composition, vascular functions, and mental/psychological areas
through large studies on increasing PA in community-dwelling elderly people.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the Furukawa Medical and Welfare Foundation.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Sattelmair</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Pertman</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Ding</surname><given-names>EL</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Dose response between physical activity and risk of
