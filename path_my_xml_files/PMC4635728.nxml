Twenty-eight hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)&#x02013;positive pregnant women and their newborns were assigned to an experimental (n = 12) or control group (n = 16) according to whether they received HBIG during pregnancy. HBV DNA load and markers titer of the mothers and newborns were tested. These markers and HBV DNA load in mothers of the experimental group did not fluctuate significantly and were comparable to the control. In the experimental group, there was a positive correlation between mothers and their newborns with regard to hepatitis B surface antibody titer. Immunohistochemical staining of placenta sections showed that HBsAg-positive areas mainly included trophoblastic cells and villous mesenchymal cells without HBIG colocalization, whereas HBIG-positive areas principally included villous capillary endothelial cells and villous mesenchymal cells. Additionally, compared with the control group, the positive rate and mean density of HBIG in the experimental group were remarkably higher. HBIG deposition was seen in Hofbauer cells. Thus, rather than influencing virus replication, HBIG forms an immune barrier between the mother and fetus to prevent HBV transmission.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>HBV</kwd><kwd>hepatitis B immunoglobulin</kwd><kwd>intrauterine infection</kwd><kwd>immune barrier</kwd><kwd>placenta</kwd><kwd>virus replication</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="2"/><ref-count count="40"/><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Wide implementation of vaccination program against hepatitis B virus (HBV) in China has significantly decreased the rate of HBV infection<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Mother-to-child transmission, including intrauterine transmission and transmission during labor, breast-feeding, and daily contact, has become the major route of HBV infection<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,3</sup></xref> With combined hepatitis vaccination and hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) treatment of newborns, transmission during delivery and the postpartum period can be efficiently prevented.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4-6</sup></xref> However, approximately 5&#x02013;10% of vertical transmission of HBV remains to be prevented because of failure to protect against intrauterine infection.<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7-11</sup></xref> which is reported to be the bottleneck for further prevention of vertical transmission of HBV worldwide. Considering the largest population and high prevalence of HBV infection in China, there are about 1 million infants born every year facing high risk of HBV infection, which would be serious economic pressure for their families and the society. It is essential to take every effective measure to prevent mother-to-infant transmission.</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no standard strategy in gestational period to prevent mother-to-infant intrauterine transmission. The first approved oral nucleoside analog to inhibit HBV replication, lamivudine, is widely used with considerable efficiency and safety in HBV-infected pregnant women to prevent HBV vertical transmission.<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9,12</sup></xref> Telbivudine and tenofovir are considered class B drugs by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in pregnant women with HBV infection. The following problems with nucleoside and nucleotide analogs require attention: 1) a risk exists for sudden exacerbation of liver disease after withdrawal, 2) the rate of drug resistance may increase in the future, and 3) the long-term impact on children requires further investigation.</p><p>Administration of HBIG constitutes another approach for preventing vertical transmission. In a prospective randomized controlled trial, Xu et&#x000a0;al. showed that HBIG can interrupt HBV vertical transmission in both hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)&#x02013;positive and &#x02013;negative pregnant women.<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Other groups have also confirmed protection with HBIG during pregnancy.<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8,14</sup></xref> Most recently, a meta-analysis of HBIG efficacy emphasized the importance of HBIG in reducing the risk of intrauterine transmission.<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> On the contrary, several other studies showed no influence of HBIG on vertical transmission.<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> The route and dose of HBIG administration in the individuals investigated may have contributed to this discrepancy.</p><p>For more than 20&#x000a0;years, our group has focused on HBV vertical transmission, and a large amount of our data from clinical trials have demonstrated that HBIG is effective in reducing HBV intrauterine infection.<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17-19</sup></xref> However, its effects on HBV DNA load and the defense mechanism are still poorly understood. In this prospective study, HBV-infected pregnant women were divided into 2 groups, those who received and those who did not receive HBIG during pregnancy. In the mothers, the changes over time in HBV serum markers (hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb), HBeAg, hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb)), and the DNA load were investigated. Immunohistochemical staining with custom-made antibodies against HBIG revealed both the level and distribution of HBIG in placentas.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s0002"><title>Results</title><sec id="s0002-0022"><title>Characteristics of the mothers</title><p>Eventually, 12 samples from experimental group and 16 from control group with complete information were included for final analysis.

In the late 1990s, Zhu et&#x000a0;al. reported that HBV vertical transmission in HBsAg-positive women is reduced with HBIG injections during pregnancy.<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30,31</sup></xref> A meta-analysis of data from 37 individual research centers in China and other countries also supports this conclusion.<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Zhu and colleagues later demonstrated that HBIG can decrease HBV DNA and thus prevent vertical transmission during pregnancy.<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> However, Yuan and other groups obtained opposite results.<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> The following reasons may account for this discrepancy: 1) the doses of HBIG used during pregnancy were different; 2) the criteria for HBV infection of newborns were not identical; and 3) the sample sizes of some studies were not sufficiently large. HBIG has been used in our clinical work for over a decade and provides marked protection of the fetus from their HBV-infected mothers.<xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> In our current study, after 1 y of follow-up, all infants were free of HBV infection whether their mothers had received HBIG or not during pregnancy. Because of the small study population in the current study, determining the difference in the infection rate between the 2 groups was difficult.</p><p>We observed that the level of maternal HBV DNA increased slightly during late pregnancy, which was consistent with a previous report.<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> This may be due to the special immune status during the gestational period. Furthermore, the titers of HBV markers (HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBcAb) did not change following HBIG injection. We hypothesize that HBIG may prevent HBV transmission through other mechanisms, rather than serving as a virus inhibitor to block intrauterine transmission.</p><p>Studies from as early as 1961 have shown that the placenta can actively transfer IgG to the fetus beginning at &#x0223c;12 weeks of gestation.<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> The average HBsAb titer increased in mothers of the HBIG-injected group, although no significant difference was observed when comparing with control group. Additionally, we observed a positive correlation when further analyzing HBsAb titer between mothers and neonates from the experimental groups (<italic>r</italic> = 0.839, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001). The titer was even higher in some neonates than in their mothers. This may be due to the transfer of HBIG from mother to fetus actively, which may be another mechanism for protecting neonates. Whereas, levels of HBsAb from all mothers were lower than <bold>t</bold>he established seroprotective threshold of HBsAb (10 mIU/mL).<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21-23</sup></xref> which supported our hypothesis HBIG protect fetus by other mechanism instead of directly neutralizing HBV virus in serum. The response to the vaccine by these neonates with higher HBsAb at birth requires further investigation and a longer follow-up period.</p><p>Using immunohistochemical staining and in situ hybridization, Xu et&#x000a0;al. determined the distribution of HBsAg, HBcAg, and HBV DNA in the placenta of HBsAg-positive women. In addition, the positive rate of HBV DNA in villus capillary endothelial cells is closely correlated with intrauterine infection (<italic>r</italic> = 16.15, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0076).<xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> Histological staining has shown that HBIG is also deposited in fetal capillary endothelial cells and villous mesenchymal cells. Thus, HBIG may form a protective immunoglobulin &#x0201c;barrier&#x0201d; between the maternal and fetal blood, playing a complementary role to the placental barrier and thus preventing HBV components from permeating the placenta and thereby protecting the fetus from HBV infection.</p><p>As the main target cell of virus infection in the placenta, Hofbauer cells comprise 43% of interstitial cells in the placenta <xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26,27</sup></xref> In addition, because the virus preferentially infects Hofbauer cells, these cells may work as ideal transporters for the virus from the mother to fetus.<xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35,36</sup></xref> The data showed the deposition of HBIG in Hofbauer cells in the absence of HBsAg, we hypothesized that HBIG may &#x0201c;neutralize&#x0201d; the virus by an unknown mechanism to prevent intrauterine transmission. Moreover, whether HBIG influences Hofbauer cell function to affect immune regulation and migration requires further study.</p><p>The HBIG used in this study was a custom-made polyclonal antiserum that exhibited lower specificity than monoclonal antibodies are expected to display, and this may also explain the positive areas of HBIG staining in sections from the control group. Furthermore, the study population was too small to tell the difference of infection rate of infants between experimental and control groups. Additionally, whether HBIG injection during pregnancy influences HBV mutation or the response of the newborn to HBV vaccination requires additional study.</p><p>This prospective study provides further evidence for the safety and efficacy of HBIG use in pregnancy. Rather than influencing virus replication, HBIG may form an &#x0201c;immune barrier&#x0201d; between the mother and fetus to prevent HBV transmission. The effect of HBIG on Hofbauer cells, a &#x0201c;transporter&#x0201d; of virus from mother to fetus, requires further study.</p></sec><sec id="s0004"><title>Patients and Motheds</title><sec id="s0004-0001"><title>Participants</title><p>From May 2012 to May 2013, HBsAg-positive pregnant women who underwent consultation were recruited from the Department of Infectious Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Shaanxi, China.
