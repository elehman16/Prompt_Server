Here, we investigate the utility of network science methods to assess the pharmacological alterations of the large-scale architecture of brain networks in rats and humans. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study in humans and a placebo-controlled two-group study in rats, we demonstrate that the application of ketamine leads to a topological reconfiguration of large-scale brain networks towards less-integrated and more-segregated information processing in both the species. As these alterations are opposed to those commonly observed in patients suffering from depression, they might indicate systems-level correlates of the antidepressant effect of ketamine.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Ketamine, a potent <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor antagonist, has spurred considerable interest in the preclinical as well as clinical applications.

The actual measurements took place with a mean interval of 7.7 days (s.d.: 2.5; range: 4&#x02013;16 days). On each of the three scanning visits, and approximately 60&#x02009;min before the start of the MRI scan, the subjects received intravenous cannulation followed by an infusion scan via a certified intravenous pump (Braun Medical, Melsungen, Germany). The subjects received counterbalanced single intravenous doses of either saline (placebo condition), ketamine (0.5&#x02009;mg&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> body weight) or scopolamine (4&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> body weight) following previously published protocols.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> All the study participants and personnel involved in the experiments were blind to the respective substance given. Individual doses of ketamine hydrochloride were adjusted to the body weight (0.5&#x02009;mg&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) following previously published protocols,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> diluted in saline and applied over 40&#x02009;min. The placebo condition consisted of a 40-min saline infusion. During the infusion, the subjects were seated comfortably in a chair under the supervision of a board-certified psychiatrist. To avoid order effects, the sequence of substance applications was randomly permutated across all the 23 participants. The MRI scanning took place after drug administration, with the resting-state measurement starting approximately 20&#x02009;min after the end of the infusion. The data from the scopolamine challenge were not analyzed for the current report.</p><p>All the participants provided written informed consent for the study approved by the local ethics committee (Medical Faculty Mannheim, University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany). A total of 23 participants completed the study (11 female, mean age: 25.13&#x000b1;2.51 years, mean body weight: 70.24&#x000b1;11.56&#x02009;kg, mean height: 1.75&#x000b1;0.80&#x02009;m, mean body mass index 22.76&#x000b1;2.71). One subject that initially participated was excluded from the study, as she was not able to complete all the three required MRI measurements.</p><p>As this was an exploratory study, no formal power or sample-size estimation was performed. The group size was selected on the basis of prior experience and literature reports of pharmacological-fMRI studies in healthy subjects, and is toward the high end of the range of sample sizes typically used.</p></sec><sec><title>Animals and ketamine application</title><p>Eighteen Sprague Dawley male rats (weight: 373&#x02013;447&#x02009;g, age: 10&#x02013;11 weeks; Janvier Laboratories, Le Genest-St-Isle, France) were used for the fMRI experiments. The animals were housed under controlled conditions (19&#x02013;23&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, 40&#x02013;60&#x00025; humidity) with a 12:12&#x02009;h light&#x02013;dark cycle (lights on at 0700&#x02009;h).</p><p>All the procedures were performed according to the regulations covering animal experimentation within the European Union (European Communities Council Directive 86/609/EEC) and within the German Animal Welfare Act and were approved by the German animal welfare authorities (Regierungspr&#x000e4;sidium Karlsruhe). The rat rs-fMRI data were originally analyzed using a seed-based approach, the results of which have been reported elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> As that study was exploratory in nature, no formal power or sample-size estimation was performed, but the group sizes (<italic>N=</italic>9 per group) are toward the high end of the range typically used in rat fMRI experiments. The exploratory nature of the experiment was explicitly mentioned in the discussion section of ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>. No blinding was done, as for the given type of experiment it is not possible: ketamine solution had to be prepared before each experiment depending on the dose.</p><p>The experimental design comprised two groups of <italic>N=</italic>9 rats each. In one group, S-ketamine (Ketanest, Pfizer Pharma, Berlin, Germany) was injected subcutaneously at a dose of 25&#x02009;mg&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> dissolved in saline (total volume 1&#x02009;ml&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). The second group received the same volume of vehicle (saline). The rats were assigned to the groups randomly. The order of ketamine and saline injections was randomized across the animals and time of day. The fMRI resting-state measurements were acquired immediately before and starting at 15&#x02009;min after the ketamine/vehicle injection.</p><p>These animals represent two groups from the study previously reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> The 25&#x02009;mg&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> group was selected for the present analysis as it yielded plasma concentrations closest to those obtained in the human study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> The rat data were re-analyzed using methods as closely aligned as possible to those used for the human data (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Data acquisition and preprocessing&#x02014;human fMRI</title><p>Blood-oxygen-level-dependent fMRI was acquired at a 3-Tesla MR scanner (Siemens TIM-Trio, Erlangen, Germany), with the Syngo MR VB17 Software, maximum 45&#x02009;mT&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<italic>z</italic> axis) and 40&#x02009;mT&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> axis) gradient strength, a 32-channel head-coil and an echo-planar imaging sequence with full brain coverage with the following parameters: repetition time=1790&#x02009;ms, echo time=28&#x02009;ms, 34 oblique slices (aligned to the anterior commissure&#x02013;posterior commisure plane) in descending acquisition order, 3&#x02009;mm slice thickness, &#x0002b;1&#x02009;mm gap, flip angle=76&#x000b0;, FoV=192&#x02009;mm, 64 &#x000d7; 64 matrix, 3 &#x000d7; 3&#x02009;mm in-plane voxel size and 332 volumes. Preprocessing of functional data consisted of slice time correction, realignment and smoothing by a 6&#x02009;mm full-width half maximum Gaussian kernel (FSL 5.0.6) followed by noise correction with the AROMA framework.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> In short, this includes removal of noise that is related independent by means of an automated detection of noise components based on their time course correlation with movement parameters, as well as their high frequency fraction and the overlap of their maps with brain edges and cerebrospinal fluid maps (for details, see ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). The data were afterwards corrected for nuisance covariates of white matter and cerebrospinal fluid signal as well as the six motion parameters obtained during the realignment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> The data were finally normalized to MNI standard space echo-planar imaging template (SPM8).

Transmission and reception were achieved using a linear whole-body volume transmitter coil combined with an anatomically shaped four-channel receive-only coil array for the rat brain.</p><p>The rats were anesthetized under 4&#x00025; isoflurane (Baxter Deutschland, Unterschleissheim, Germany) in a mixture of N<sub>2</sub> (70&#x00025;)/O<sub>2</sub> (30&#x00025;). After positioning in the scanner (head first, prone), 2.5&#x00025; isoflurane was provided for adjustments. Then, a bolus of 0.5&#x02009;ml medetomidine solution (Domitor, Janssen-Cilag, Neuss; 0.07&#x02009;mg&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> subcutaneously) was administered; isoflurane was slowly discontinued within the next 10&#x02009;min, after which a continuous infusion of medetomidine solution started at 0.14&#x02009;mg&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> rate.</p><p>The breathing and cardiac signals were monitored using a respiration pad placed beneath the chest (Small Animal Instruments, Stony Brook, NY, USA) and a pulse oximeter attached to the hindpaw, respectively. A signal breakout module (Small Animal Instruments) and a four-channel recorder (Velleman, Gavere, Belgium) were used to record signals (10-ms resolution).</p><p>The MRI acquisition protocol for each animal comprised a Field Map and a rs-fMRI measurement. To acquire the rs-fMRI time series, an echo-planar imaging sequence was used with the following parameters: repetition time/echo time 1700/17.5&#x02009;ms, flip angle 60&#x000b0;, one segment, 29 coronal slices (ascending slice order), 96 &#x000d7; 96 imaging matrix, field of view 35 &#x000d7; 35&#x02009;mm<sup>2</sup>, slice thickness 0.5&#x02009;mm with 0.2&#x02009;mm interslice gap, in-plane voxel dimension 0.365&#x02009;mm, 300 acquisitions over 8.5&#x02009;min.

In addition, the images were spatially normalized (SPM8) to a rat brain template with co-registered atlas in the Paxinos stereotactic coordinate system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> and finally the signal from the cerebrospinal fluid was filtered out. A single time series was extracted for each of the 90 anatomically defined regions of interest (Schwarz <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup>) by averaging single-voxel time series over all the voxels in a region of interest.</p></sec><sec><title>Network analysis&#x02014;humans and rats</title><p>The brain networks for humans and rats were constructed by computing the Pearson correlation coefficient between the time series extracted from each pair of regions of interest. The correlation coefficients were transformed to Fisher's <italic>z</italic>-scores. Subsequently, networks were created by binarizing these correlation matrices. As there is no current consensus on the selection of network density (fraction of all possible links that is actually present), we computed all graph metrics over a range of densities (0.05 to 0.2 in steps of 0.01&#x02014;for details, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref>) as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> The selection of density thresholds was led by two methodological considerations. On one hand, we wanted our analysis to be sensitive to subtle alterations in network topology. Because of the large number of possible connections and the relatively small number of connections actually being different under ketamine, a threshold beyond 0.2 would significantly impair this sensitivity. One the other hand, given the high degree of network fragmentation (that is, the number of disconnected nodes) at lower densities, we chose a density of 0.05 as the lowest cutoff to ensure a reasonable degree of connectedness.</p><p>This procedure normalizes all networks to have the same number of links and removes the effect of global differences in correlation strength. Standard network parameter computation was implemented in MATLAB, using the Brain Connectivity Toolbox.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> For each subject and each density level, we computed the following network parameters: clustering coefficient <italic>C</italic>, characteristic path length <italic>L</italic>, small-worldness <italic>&#x003c3;</italic>, global efficiency <italic>E</italic><sub>glob</sub> and local efficiency <italic>E</italic><sub>loc</sub>. The details on the computation and interpretation of the specific graph metrics can be found in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref>.</p><p>Furthermore, we calculated the networks' motif frequencies, also using functions implemented in Brain Connectivity Toolbox, for a sequence of eight motifs consisting of (undirected) connections of three to four nodes.</p></sec><sec><title>Network Based Statistics&#x02014;humans and rats</title><p>Although network analysis can detect changes in the topological organization of brain networks, we also aimed to test for global differences in absolute connectivity. To that end, we used the Network Based Statistics (NBS) toolbox<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> to identify alterations in specific connections after ketamine application. The NBS deals with the multiple comparison correction for <inline-formula id="equ1"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="tp201653e1.jpg"/></inline-formula> tests by evaluating the null hypothesis on the level of connected subcluster rather than individually for each connection.

To further illustrate the importance of specific brain areas to the large-scale reconfiguration observed before, we evaluated the number of altered connections for each node (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Two frontal areas, namely frontal superior medial cortex and the middle frontal cortex, as well as the mid cingulate cortex exhibited the highest number of altered connections, identifying them as being prominently involved in ketamine-induced reconfigurations of brain networks.</p></sec><sec><title>Alterations of functional connectivity by ketamine in rats</title><p>A subnetwork of 31 edges with a <italic>T</italic>-statistic of <italic>T</italic>&#x0003e;5.1 and 21 nodes was identified in rats after ketamine application (<italic>P</italic>-corrected &#x0003c;0.05).

However, it should be noted that NBS is suitable for identifying cluster-wide connectivity changes, not for making inferences on specific connectivity pairs. This precludes detailed interpretation of the individual regions displaying altered connectivity in our data.</p><p>The connectivity increase was accompanied by a topological reconfiguration of large-scale brain networks towards a conformation characteristic of less-integrated and more-segregated information processing, as evidenced by decreases in global efficiency and a decrease in small-worldness. A higher abundance of cyclic motifs points towards a network organization more tuned to local processing and less suitable for efficient long-range communication in both the species. This is further supported by the decreased occurrence of acyclic motifs in rats, although this finding was not significant in humans. In line with a previous study using a different imaging modality, cross-animal correlations rather than within-subject temporal correlations and a different NMDA receptor antagonist,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> we observed a loss of small-worldness properties after ketamine injection. Our study therefore adds further support to the idea of a compromised functional integration in NMDA receptor dysfunction models of disease. It is interesting to note that a previous study from our group using the same human and rat data as in the current work reported an increased prefrontal&#x02013;hippocampal coupling after NMDA receptor blockade to be a cross-species phenotype altered by ketamine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup></p><p>Although a direct statistical comparison between the species would be misguided for several reasons, the placebo-controlled design of both studies enabled us to compare findings between species qualitatively. Overall, we found highly concordant and directionally consistent network reconfiguration in humans and rats. In both the species, we observed an increased total connectivity. Topologically, we detected a less globally integrated and more-segregated network architecture following ketamine administration.</p></sec><sec><title>Discrepant findings in humans and rats</title><p>Interestingly, although motif analysis revealed a significant increase of cyclic motifs after ketamine infusion in both the species, we found no difference in the clustering coefficient in humans. This might be a consequence of triangles being introduced primarily around the nodes with a high degree, for which the clustering coefficient is less sensitive due to its normalization by the number of all possible triangles.</p><p>Surprisingly, in rats, we observed a decrease in the path length after ketamine application, contrasting with effects on other parameters indicating a less-integrated network architecture. However, this might be a result of our focus on sparsely connected networks, which often suffer from a higher fragmentation to which the characteristic path length (in contrast to global efficiency) is very prone.</p></sec><sec><title>Relation to mental disorders</title><p>Interestingly, the network reconfigurations identified here are opposite to network alterations in depressed patients, who show increased global efficiency and small-worldness compared with healthy controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup> We hypothesize that this may indicate a network mechanism supporting the action of ketamine as rapidly acting antidepressant. This idea is further supported by a previous study showing ketamine effects on network topology opposite to those observed in depressed subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup></p><p>The studies investigating brain network properties in schizophrenia consistently report reduced total connectivity, as well as higher integration (for example, increased local efficiency, decreased characteristic path length) and less local processing (for example, decreasing clustering coefficient and local efficiency).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref></sup> These findings are in contrast to the observed network reconfigurations in our data, suggesting that acute ketamine application rather resembles a different glutamatergic state than observed in chronic schizophrenia.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Despite our efforts to align protocols of the human and rat studies, there still remain some differences. First, ketamine was applied differently&#x02014;subcutaneous bolus injection in rats versus intravenous continuous infusion in humans&#x02014;and therefore might evoke different biological responses. Further studies are urgently needed, as application protocols might explain clinically diverse effects and could account for the heterogeneous results in previous human<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> and rat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> studies. Second, in rats, anesthesia as well as interactions of the anesthetic agent with ketamine might also influence the behavior of brain networks, although previous studies have shown a high correspondence of human and rat functional brain networks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref></sup> A further potential limitation results from the different number of nodes used in humans and rats. However, by choosing a proportional thresholding approach, we aimed at examining the changes in network architecture independent of the absolute number of links in a given network. Because of the thresholding approach, our results are specific to the chosen range of network densities (5&#x02013;20&#x00025;), which surely is not the only possible choice of densities. Along with network size, the composition of nodes is a possible restriction to comparability. In humans, 90&#x00025; of the nodes are cortical, whereas in rats, the fraction is considerably smaller (40&#x00025;), which reflects the substantially developed and differentiated cortex in humans. Despite this asymmetry in the fraction of cortical nodes, the results in both the species can be compared, thanks to the placebo-controlled design of the study in both species. We compare the changes in network organization qualitatively rather than absolute quantities of network metrics in both the species. Moreover, a closer look at the brain regions that experience most significant change in connectivity and number of connections reveals that in rats as well as humans, the effects of ketamine occur (almost) exclusively in the cortical regions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Another potential confound is the influence of the cerebral blood flow (CBF) increase induced by ketamine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup> The blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal correlation changes that we observed could include contribution from CBF increase <italic>per se</italic> or the differences in correlation may be modulated by CBF increase. Regrettably, we did not measure CBF independently and therefore cannot access its impact on network results. Given the promising results on ketamine effects on functional connectivity in this study (and others in recent literature), further studies examining the effect of CBF are recommended. Finally, while the animal study had a two-group design, the human study was designed as a placebo-controlled double-blind cross-over study. The missing control for between-subject variance in the animal study might account for the observed higher differences in rats, but a comparison between the groups before ketamine applications revealed no differences between network parameters (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Relevance for translational research and drug discovery</title><p>These findings are encouraging for translational research and its application to drug discovery. The use of global brain parameters reflecting functional network topology has the advantage of reducing complex, high-dimensional imaging data to a few summary measures, reducing the multiple comparisons burden and avoiding the need to pre-specify specific brain regions or connections. The latter is valuable, and the involvement of specific brain systems is important to increase biological understanding, but can be difficult to apply with confidence, especially when dealing with novel compounds or mechanisms. The global brain network parameters may thus represent a more robust end point for translational functional imaging at the early phase of drug discovery and development. Importantly, the similarities in the pharmacological effects across species suggest that preclinical experiments can be used to inform early clinical phase biomarker studies. That said, the differences in the observed effects serve as a reminder that effects in humans are unlikely to be a perfect simulacrum of those observed in the preclinical setting. This observation is consistent with other recent translational pharmacological imaging studies, where consistency between rodent and human effects was high but not complete.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup></p><p>Another important caveat is that ketamine is a highly psychoactive compound. Novel compounds being developed as potential medicines are unlikely to induce such strong subjective effects <italic>per se</italic>, and their effects on brain functional connectivity may be more subtle. The sensitivity of network topology measures to a broader range of compounds and mechanisms remains to be established. However, as a pharmacological model of a hyperglutamatergic state, ketamine-induced changes in functional connectivity may serve as an example of brain function perturbation that can be reversed by pre-treatment with compounds of interest.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref></sup> Finally, the sensitivity of results to methodological aspects such as brain parcellation scheme, image post-processing variations, choice of connectivity metric and thresholding or weighting scheme remains an important area of investigation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Using network analysis and task-independent brain imaging, we observed highly concordant cross-species topological reconfigurations of large-scale brain networks induced by acute ketamine administration in rats and humans.
