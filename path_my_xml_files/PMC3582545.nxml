A 2-week washout period was followed by a 4-week dose-titration phase during which patients received lanthanum carbonate titrated up to 2250&#x000a0;mg/day. This was followed by a 4-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase during which patients continued to receive either lanthanum carbonate at the titrated dose, or a matched dose of placebo. The main outcome measure was control of serum phosphate levels (1.3-1.8&#x000a0;mmol/l) at the end of the parallel-group phase.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Serum phosphate was controlled in 3/39 (8%) patients at the beginning of the dose-titration phase (after washout) and in 18/31 (58%) patients treated with lanthanum carbonate at its end. After the parallel-group phase, 60% of lanthanum carbonate-treated patients and 10% of those receiving placebo had controlled serum phosphate. There was no difference in mean (95% confidence interval) serum phosphate levels between groups at randomization: lanthanum carbonate, 1.57 (1.34-1.81) mmol/l; placebo, 1.58 (1.40-1.76) mmol/l (p = 0.96). However, a difference was seen at the end of the parallel-group phase: lanthanum carbonate, 1.56 (1.33-1.79) mmol/l; placebo, 2.25 (1.81-2.68) mmol/l (p = 0.0015). There were no clinically important changes in nutritional parameters and no serious treatment-related adverse events were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>At doses up to 2250&#x000a0;mg/day, lanthanum carbonate is well tolerated and controls hyperphosphatemia effectively. Treatment with higher doses of lanthanum carbonate may allow patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis the potential to increase their dietary protein intake without compromising their phosphate control.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Chronic kidney disease</kwd><kwd>Lanthanum carbonate</kwd><kwd>Nutrition</kwd><kwd>Peritoneal dialysis</kwd><kwd>Phosphate control</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Up to 80% of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5 have levels of serum phosphate above the normal range (0.8-1.5&#x000a0;mmol/l) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis are typically used as part of the management strategy in patients with CKD stage 5, but even with regular dialysis, serum phosphate often exceeds 2.1&#x000a0;mmol/l [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], a level associated with increased morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Restricting the intake of dietary phosphate to 800&#x02013;1000&#x000a0;mg/day is recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] to help manage hyperphosphatemia. However, care must be taken to maintain adequate protein intake because poor nutrition is also associated with increased mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Recent reimbursement changes in the US healthcare system may result in greater use of peritoneal dialysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Malnutrition and comorbidities (including cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory or liver disease, and carcinoma) are independently associated with mortality in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis, and these two factors in combination are associated with the worst outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Protein loss across the peritoneal membrane during peritoneal dialysis places a greater nutritional burden on patients compared with those on hemodialysis, and this loss of protein is exacerbated by peritonitis, a major complication of peritoneal dialysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Maintaining adequate protein intake is therefore an important part of the management strategy for patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis. However, protein intake can be impeded by poor appetite, and increasing dietary protein can place an increased phosphate burden on the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Poor appetite can be a side effect of peritoneal dialysis. Patients using a dialysate that contains dextrose, are exposed to an increased glucose load of 40&#x02013;80&#x000a0;g/day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This can result in both early satiety and gastroparesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], which, combined with compression of the stomach caused by the dialysate, lead to appetite suppression. Anorexia can also be caused by uremia, which can be a consequence of under dialysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis can develop dyslipidemia, because the high glucose load stimulates synthesis of hepatic lipoprotein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and increases insulin levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>The importance of maintaining adequate dietary protein intake in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis was highlighted in a recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. A daily protein intake of more than 0.94&#x000a0;g/kg/day was associated with the best outcomes in terms of both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, and incidence of first-episode peritonitis, whereas an intake of less than 0.73&#x000a0;g/kg/day was associated with the worst outcomes. One way to manage the additional phosphate burden that results from increased protein intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] is concomitant use of a phosphate binder. Lanthanum carbonate is a highly effective phosphate binder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] with demonstrated efficacy in patients receiving renal replacement therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]; however, little has been published on its efficacy in managing hyperphosphatemia in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis. Here, we report the results of a prespecified subgroup analysis of a previously published phase 2 study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] in which the efficacy of lanthanum carbonate was assessed in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Men and women were eligible to enter the study if they were aged 18&#x000a0;years or over, had undergone continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis for 6&#x000a0;months or more, and had serum phosphate levels consistently above 1.8&#x000a0;mmol/l following washout of previous phosphate binders. Exclusion criteria included: patients with serum calcium levels above the upper limit of the normal range; severe hyperparathyroidism (parathyroid hormone [PTH] levels &#x0003e; 53 pmol/l (500&#x000a0;ng/l) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]); serum phosphate levels &#x0003e; 3.0&#x000a0;mmol/l after the washout phase; other clinically significant abnormal laboratory values; a positive pregnancy test; significant gastrointestinal disorders (including known active peptic ulcer, Crohn&#x02019;s disease, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, and past or present gastrointestinal malignancies); unstable dietary habits; life-threatening malignancy; or a positive status for human immunodeficiency virus. Patients with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or who, in the opinion of the investigators, were unlikely to comply with treatment requirements, were also excluded. Patients were withdrawn if their serum phosphate levels exceeded 3.0&#x000a0;mmol/l, or if it was felt that continuation would be detrimental to them. The trial was conducted in accordance with the Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, and with the Declaration of Helsinki and its subsequent revisions. Ethical approval of the final protocol and its amendments was granted by the South and West Multicentre Research and Ethics Committee. Written informed consent was given by all patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This was a phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ranging study with a washout phase and two treatment phases (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Patients did not receive any phosphate binder medication during the 2-week washout phase that followed screening. At the end of the washout phase, patients whose serum phosphate levels exceeded 1.8&#x000a0;mmol/l entered a 4-week, open-label phase, in which their dose of lanthanum carbonate (FOSRENOL&#x000ae;, Shire Pharmaceuticals, Nyon, Switzerland) was titrated to attain serum phosphate levels in the range 1.3-1.8&#x000a0;mmol/l. During this dose-titration phase, lanthanum carbonate doses were adjusted weekly according to patients&#x02019; serum phosphate levels, from an initial daily dose of 375&#x000a0;mg up to a maximum of 2250&#x000a0;mg.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Patient flow.</bold> Dose-titration and parallel-group phases include patients in the safety set.

short-term clinical study demonstrates that lanthanum carbonate is an effective option for the control of serum phosphate in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Of the 45 patients screened, six had a serum phosphate level of 1.8&#x000a0;mmol/l or less after washout and were thus excluded prior to dose titration. The use of food diaries was implemented during the washout phase so this may have reinforced the need for dietary control and led to a reduction in dietary phosphate intake in some patients. Following washout, 39 patients with uncontrolled serum phosphate (&#x0003e; 1.8&#x000a0;mmol/l) underwent dose titration with lanthanum carbonate, and after 4&#x000a0;weeks of treatment, the group mean serum phosphate level was 1.68&#x000a0;mmol/l, compared with a mean baseline value (after washout) of 2.23&#x000a0;mmol/l. During the parallel-group phase, the mean serum phosphate level in the placebo group was 2.02&#x000a0;mmol/l after 1&#x000a0;week, whereas serum phosphate levels remained stable in patients receiving lanthanum carbonate (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). After 4&#x000a0;weeks, the between-group difference in mean serum phosphate level was statistically significant (p = 0.0015). At the end of the study, 60% of patients had controlled serum phosphate in the lanthanum carbonate group compared with only 10% in the placebo group.</p><p>Serum phosphate levels can be managed in dialysis patients by restricting their intake of phosphate, but this may limit their intake of dietary protein, thereby compromising their nutritional status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Maintenance of good nutritional status is important in terms of overall outcome for dialysis patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and in those undergoing peritoneal dialysis there is an additional nutritional burden compared with hemodialysis patients, caused by serum protein loss across the peritoneal membrane. A small reduction in mean body weight that was recorded during the dose-titration phase of this study may have been caused by dietary adjustments made by patients trying to standardize their dietary phosphate intake in response to advice from dietitians. However, during the parallel-group phase, no change in mean body weight was seen in the lanthanum carbonate group, and other measures of nutritional status (mean serum albumin and total serum protein levels) were also unchanged. In comparison, mean body weight, serum albumin concentration and total serum protein concentration fell slightly in the placebo group during the parallel-group phase. Such changes may not be indicative of an overall trend given the short duration of treatment, but relatively small changes in serum albumin concentration over a sustained period can be associated with major changes in outcome. An increase of 0.3&#x000a0;g/dl or more over a 6-month period has been associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis, while a reduction of 0.2&#x000a0;g/dl or greater over the same period has been associated with a significant increase in mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Lanthanum carbonate was well tolerated in this study; the majority of adverse events were gastrointestinal and occurred to a similar extent in both randomized groups. This is in contrast to a recent study in patients on peritoneal dialysis where 15/35 patients on lanthanum carbonate were withdrawn, 10 of whom had gastrointestinal complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Other studies have reported no withdrawals due to adverse events and variable numbers of mild or moderate events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In the present study adverse events led 5/39 patients to be withdrawn from the dose-titration phase; three of these were thought likely to be treatment-related. Levels of serum markers relevant to CKD (such as calcium and PTH) were essentially unchanged throughout the study. The maximum daily dose of lanthanum carbonate used in this study was 2250&#x000a0;mg and most patients received 1500&#x000a0;mg/day or less. This is considerably lower than the daily dose of 3000&#x000a0;mg now used in many countries. At this higher dose, it would be anticipated that more dietary phosphate could be removed and, therefore, if patients were to receive lanthanum carbonate at this dose they may have the potential to improve their nutritional status by increasing their dietary protein intake without compromising serum phosphate control. While not clinically important, the mean levels of serum albumin observed (as a marker of nutritional status) were slightly below the level of 4&#x000a0;g/dl that is recommended in maintenance dialysis patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Increasing the dose of a medication is usually associated with an increase in tablet burden, a factor that is an important consideration in a patient group in which therapeutic regimens are demanding. However, lanthanum carbonate can be given at a dose of 3000&#x000a0;mg/day in three tablets, so the daily dose can be increased to this level without increasing tablet burden. A recent study found that when patients switched from another phosphate binder to lanthanum carbonate, their daily tablet burden was reduced by approximately 2&#x02013;8 tablets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Oral phosphate binders alone are unlikely to fully control serum phosphate levels, and must be administered in conjunction with a careful review of peritoneal dialysis adequacy and prescription, as well as dietetic review and counselling to ensure that dietary intake is controlled. These three measures taken together will provide optimal phosphate control in the majority of cases.</p><p>Potential limitations of this study, relating to possible bias introduced by exclusion criteria and the protocol for withdrawals from the trial, were considered and placed in context in a previous publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Additional limitations include the short duration of the study and the small number of patients following randomization. However, recent longer-term (8&#x02013;48&#x000a0;week) studies have demonstrated that lanthanum carbonate has a phosphate-lowering effect on patients on peritoneal dialysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. A further limitation is that dialysis adequacy was not assessed throughout the study, and any between-group differences in this parameter could contribute to altered phosphate levels.</p><p>It is also worth noting that dietary data were collected in this study primarily for the purpose of ensuring consistency of dietary phosphate intake. Given the importance of maintaining adequate nutritional status in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis, this trial would have benefited from more extensive data collection on calorie and protein intake. Given the promising data presented here on the level of serum phosphate control achievable with a relatively modest dose of lanthanum carbonate in patients on peritoneal dialysis, a longer and more detailed investigation into the nutritional status of such patients receiving higher doses of lanthanum carbonate may be warranted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>At doses up to 2250&#x000a0;mg/day, lanthanum carbonate is well tolerated and controls hyperphosphatemia effectively. Treatment with higher doses of lanthanum carbonate may allow patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis the potential to increase their dietary protein intake without compromising their phosphate control.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CI: Confidence interval;CKD: Chronic kidney disease;PTH: Parathyroid hormone</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>AH has received research funding and honoraria from Shire Pharmaceuticals for various activities.
