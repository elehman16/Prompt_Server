Consistent with above findings, eribulin appeared to prolong OS than capecitabine in this additional sensitivity analysis in several subgroups, including those with HER2-, ER-, and triple-negative disease (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1-bcbcr-10-2016-077">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In light of the observed survival benefit seen in Study 305/EMBRACE,<xref rid="b10-bcbcr-10-2016-077" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> eribulin is recommended by all major guidelines for the treatment of patients with advanced/MBC.<xref rid="b1-bcbcr-10-2016-077" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-bcbcr-10-2016-077" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b12-bcbcr-10-2016-077" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> As reported previously, eribulin was not statistically superior to capecitabine in Study 301 in terms of OS or PFS, although a numerical improvement in OS was seen with eribulin compared to capecitabine (<italic>P</italic> = 0.056).<xref rid="b11-bcbcr-10-2016-077" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The current analyses provide important information on the efficacy of eribulin compared to capecitabine in a number of patient subgroups, especially those with HER2-, ER-, and triple-negative disease.</p><p>In prespecified analyses of well-known prognostic factors, improvement in OS appeared to be seen in some subgroups with eribulin compared to capecitabine. In particular, median OS was longer in patients with HER2-, ER-, and triple-negative disease receiving eribulin versus capecitabine (by 2.4, 3.9, and 5.0 months, respectively; all <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). These results are clinically relevant because HER2-negative disease is the largest subgroup, comprising almost 85% of women with breast cancer;<xref rid="b13-bcbcr-10-2016-077" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> in addition, systemic treatment options for triple-negative disease are limited to chemotherapy.<xref rid="b14-bcbcr-10-2016-077" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15-bcbcr-10-2016-077" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Although capecitabine is active in patients with triple-negative breast cancer, eribulin appears to represent a more effective treatment option for these women, who represented a large subgroup of the Study 301 population, and those treated in routine clinical practice; further studies are, however, warranted to confirm this finding.</p><p>A potential survival advantage was suggested in patients with nonvisceral disease and those with &#x0003e;2 organs involved receiving eribulin compared to capecitabine (9.5 and 3.3 months longer OS, respectively; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Both findings, especially the subgroup of patients with nonvisceral disease where a greater survival advantage was implied, merit further investigation in larger trials. Patients from Latin America receiving eribulin also appeared to derive greater OS benefit compared to capecitabine treatment. Further exploration of this subgroup indicated no major differences between the treatment arms in terms of receptor status or dose intensity of study drug; this may, therefore, represent a chance finding, together with the apparent benefit in PFS in patients from Eastern Europe receiving capecitabine.</p><p>A small increase in OS (1.5 months) with eribulin versus capecitabine was observed in patients who had received &#x02265;1 prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced/metastatic disease. Additional analyses suggested that eribulin prolonged OS compared to capecitabine in several subgroups, including those with HER2-, ER-, and triple-negative disease. These findings provide clinicians and patients with additional evidence specific to the patient population now approved in the EU and elsewhere (but not in the US) for treatment with eribulin.</p><p>Similar to the primary analysis of this study<xref rid="b11-bcbcr-10-2016-077" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and the EMBRACE study,<xref rid="b10-bcbcr-10-2016-077" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> eribulin consistently had a greater impact on OS than PFS. This may, at least in part, be attributable to the phenotypic changes and/or eribulin-induced changes in tumor phenotype and vasculature observed in preclinical models, which may enhance the efficacy of subsequent therapies<xref rid="b6-bcbcr-10-2016-077" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-bcbcr-10-2016-077" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and improve outcomes. Further translational studies are needed to confirm these preclinical findings.</p><p>A limitation of these analyses is that all <italic>P</italic> values must be interpreted in the context of the primary analysis for Study 301 not achieving statistical significance. All subsequent secondary and subgroup analyses are, therefore, essentially exploratory. Accordingly, no adjustment was made for multiple testing in the current analyses, and the <italic>P</italic> values are presented for descriptive purposes only; further studies would be needed to confirm these results. While the majority of subgroup analyses were prespecified, some were not, including the additional sensitivity analyses in patients who had received &#x02265;1 prior chemotherapy for advanced/metastatic disease and the use of an adjusted Cox model with added covariates. These analyses resulted, however, from interaction with the EU regulatory authorities. They are important in the absence of data from prospective studies in patient populations that match the approved indication for eribulin in the EU, namely the second-line or later treatment of MBC. In that context, these exploratory and retrospective analyses may provide clinicians and patients with valuable additional data for eribulin relative to capecitabine, especially in women with HER2-, hormone receptor-, and triple-negative breast cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this subgroup analysis, eribulin was an effective therapeutic option for the treatment of patients with advanced/MBC and may especially benefit those with HER2-negative, ER-negative and triple-negative disease. These data in patients treated in the first-, second-, and third-line settings support eribulin as an active single agent for patients with advanced/MBC who have received prior chemotherapy, including an anthracycline and a taxane.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="s1-bcbcr-10-2016-077"><caption><p><bold>Supplementary figure 1</bold>.
