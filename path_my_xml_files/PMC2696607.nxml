BoNTA&#x02019;s safety and efficacy, as well as its recommendations for use in treating glabellar and other facial lines, have been well documented in randomized controlled trials, numerous clinical studies, and consensus recommendations based on experts&#x02019; clinical experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Nevertheless, the preponderance of this research has been based on clinical trials involving female Caucasian subjects. It is well recognized that ethnicity and skin color are associated with variations in properties of facial skin and musculature; therefore, it was deemed important to establish the safety and efficacy of BoNTA in Japanese subjects in a systematic, well-controlled clinical trial.</p><p>Randomized controlled trials in predominantly Caucasian populations have shown that 20-U doses of BoNTA are effective and well tolerated in treating glabellar lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A pilot study conducted in 125 Japanese subjects showed similar results (unpublished data). The objectives of this study were to confirm and validate the effective dose of this formulation of BoNTA (BOTOX<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Allergan, Inc., Irvine, CA) and characterize the efficacy and safety profile in this patient population. This study included physician assessments and subject-reported outcomes, which have become increasingly recognized as key outcome measures in aesthetic trials and clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study Design</title><p>This multicenter, 16-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial compared the efficacy and safety of two doses (10 and 20&#x000a0;U) of BoNTA versus placebo in Japanese subjects with glabellar lines of at least moderate severity at maximal contraction. This study was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Standards for the Implementation of Clinical Trials on Pharmaceutical Products, and with the approval of the institutional review boards of the participating centers. The planned number of enrolled subjects was 135 (45 for each of the three treatment groups).</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>BoNTA-na&#x000ef;ve patients aged 20&#x02013;64 years with glabellar lines of at least moderate severity at maximal contraction, based on standardized photography, were eligible for the study. Key exclusion criteria included any condition (such as myasthenia gravis, Lambert-Eaton syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or systemic neuromuscular junction disorder) that could influence the effect of treatment (e.g., deterioration in atonia); pregnancy; history of hypersensitivity to any component of the treatment product; any condition that could impair the safety of the subject (e.g., severe heart, kidney, liver, or respiratory disease); infection or skin disease at the injection site(s); use of a peripheral muscle relaxant within 2 weeks of the start of the study; history of surgery at the treatment site(s); or previous aesthetic procedures within 6 months of the beginning of the study. Subjects had to provide written informed consent after receiving an explanation of the study. Discontinuation criteria included voluntary retraction of consent, serious clinical abnormality, unsuitability for evaluation, inability to present for evaluation, protocol violation, or investigator&#x02019;s decision due to medical or nonmedical reasons.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study Treatments</title><p>Active treatment was a 10- or 20-U dose of BoNTA supplied in vials containing 100-U doses of BoNTA, 0.5&#x000a0;mg albumin (human), and 0.9&#x000a0;mg sodium chloride. The placebo contained 0.9&#x000a0;mg sodium chloride only. Vials were reconstituted with physiologic saline (Japanese Pharmacopoeia) to deliver 2 or 4&#x000a0;U per site in equal volumes (total of five injection sites of 2 or 4&#x000a0;U/0.1&#x000a0;ml/site) or an identical volume of placebo. Vials used for treatment administration were coded to maintain the blind.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study Procedures and Clinical Outcome Measures</title><p>Subjects meeting enrollment criteria provided a medical history before enrollment and treatment, and females of childbearing age had to have a negative pregnancy test. Previous and concomitant therapies were documented. Using the random-number-generation function of SAS (Statistical Institute, Inc., Cary, NC), subjects were allocated to one of three treatment groups: 10-U BoNTA, 20-U BoNTA, or placebo. Vital signs and laboratory tests were evaluated at pretreatment, week 4, week 16, and on the day the subject discontinued.</p><p>Pretreatment line severity at rest and maximal contraction was assessed by a physician and photographed on the day of treatment. Each subject then received two injections in each corrugator supercilii muscle and one injection in the procerus muscle for a total of five injection sites (similar to other controlled trials of this formulation of BoNTA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The volume of each injection was 0.1&#x000a0;ml for a total of 0.5&#x000a0;ml. Follow-up evaluations occurred at week 1&#x000a0;and then at 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks after treatment. Each follow-up visit included a physician&#x02019;s evaluation of line severity at rest and maximal contraction, photographic documentation, and the subject&#x02019;s assessment of line improvement. The measurement scales for assessing line severity and improvement in line severity used the same scoring as the Facial Wrinkle Scale and subject&#x02019;s global assessment of change in wrinkle appearance as the United States pivotal trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition, subjects rated their degree of satisfaction with the effects of treatment at weeks 4 and 16 (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The week-16 satisfaction assessment requested subjects to consider their satisfaction over the period of the trial and whether they would like to be treated again. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored throughout the course of the study and assessed for severity and possible relationship to the treatment.

Neither the incidence of AEs nor that of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) differed significantly between groups. The incidence of AEs was 67.4% (31/46) in the 10-U group, 75.0% (33/44) in the 20-U group, and 59.2% (29/49) in the placebo group. The rate of ADRs was 32.6% in the 10-U group, 27.3% in the 20-U group, and 22.4% in the placebo group. There were no deaths, nor any serious AEs requiring emergency interventions. Of the 139 subjects, 2 developed blepharoptosis (1 in each active-treatment group), and 12 experienced heavy eyelids (5 in the 10-U group, 6 in the 20-U group, and 1 in the placebo group). Each of these events was mild in severity and resolved over the course of the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study confirms the utility of BoNTA for the treatment of glabellar lines and demonstrates its safety and efficacy in Japanese subjects. Doses of 10 U and 20&#x000a0;U were effective in treating glabellar lines based on both physician and subject ratings. BoNTA treatment resulted in significant improvement of line severity at both maximal contraction and rest, which is consistent with previous controlled clinical trials of this formulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Subjects rated their satisfaction with treatment as high at weeks 4 and 16, and for the entire study period. Overall duration of effect in this study also was similar to that of earlier studies.</p><p>The overall results of this study indicate that the two doses of BoNTA did not differ significantly on several of the endpoints but suggest that the 20-U dose may provide somewhat higher response levels, greater improvement from baseline, and a somewhat longer duration of effect, as measured by between-group differences at the various time points. This study did not assess the absolute duration of effect because relapse rates (return to pretreatment line severity) were not included. Also, as all subjects in this study were na&#x000ef;ve to BoNTA treatment, repeated treatment without dosing changes could perhaps extend the duration of benefit or result in progressive improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The findings of this study are consistent with those of other studies in which responses appear to be dose dependent but which were not always statistically significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In the present study, only two doses were used, both of which were effective overall. These findings, coupled with the subgroup and covariate analyses, suggest that fruitful areas for additional research include the impact on efficacy and the interaction of variables such as age, gender, BoNTA dose, and pretreatment line severity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Doses of 10 U and 20&#x000a0;U of BoNTA are effective and well tolerated in treating glabellar lines in Japanese subjects; however, the 20-U dose provides greater efficacy and a somewhat longer duration of effect than does the 10-U dose.</p><p><bold>Note</bold> These results do not apply to any formulation of BoNTA other than that used in the present study, due to well-documented differences in formulations and lack of interchangeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].
