The purpose of this clinical study was to evaluate the effectiveness of PRF in the treatment of intrabony defects and to assess the ability of bone graft to enhance the regenerative effects of PRF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The present randomized, controlled clinical trial was conducted in the Department of Periodontics, from December 2012 to March 2015. The study was performed according to the Helsinki declaration, and ethical clearance (SHDCH/2012-13/336(4) Dated on 21.11.2012) for the study was obtained from the institutional ethics committee. The participants enrolled for the study were informed verbally, and written consent was obtained before the start of the trial. A total of 38 patients were screened from the outpatient department of periodontics.</p><p>Each patient contributed one defect per site. In case of multiple defects, site with deepest probing depth was selected. The sample size was calculated based on the formula. <inline-graphic xlink:href="JISPCD-6-153-g001.jpg"/> Thirty six intrabony defects were selected (18 males and 18 females, age range: 35-50) based on following inclusion criteria: systemically healthy patients diagnosed with chronic periodontitis based on the international workshop for the classification of periodontal disease,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] having &#x02265;20 teeth and &#x02265;30% of sites with &#x0003e;4 mm clinical attachment loss (CAL), probing depth (PD) &#x02265;5 mm, and presence of intrabony defect (IBD) &#x02265;3 mm (measured from alveolar crest to the base of the defect on intraoral periapical radiograph). Exclusion criteria were patients with use of tobacco or tobacco-related products; systemic or local application of antibiotics within the previous 6 months; patients with poor oral hygiene (plaque index (PI) &#x02265;3) after the revaluation of cause-related therapy. The present study was conducted for a period of 9 months. After verification of the inclusion criteria, 2 patients were excluded from the screening group as they failed to meet the study protocol. Total 36 patients (sites) were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment regimens, group A, PRF with DBM, group B, PRF alone, and group C, control (OFD) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Allotment of participants within the groups was performed randomly by creating a randomization list by means of a freeware link (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.graphad.com/quickcalcs/randomize1.cfm">http://www.graphad.com/quickcalcs/randomize1.cfm</ext-link>). The treatment allocation of the patients was prepared and sealed in the numbered opaque envelopes and were opened during surgery immediately after completing the defect debridement. Allocation protocol was unavailable to the periodontal examiner (RS) throughout the study. Patients were masked for allocation to particular group and treatment. All the surgical procedures in three groups were performed by a trained periodontist (NC). The pre and postoperative assessments were performed by another examiner (RS) without knowledge of the nature of intervention.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Consolidated standard of reporting trials (CONSORT) flow chart. <italic>N</italic>: Number of patients, PRF: Platelet. rich fibrin, DBM: Demineralized bone matrix xenograft</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISPCD-6-153-g002"/></fig><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Clinical parameters</title><p>Clinical measurements were performed using the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) or a fixed reference point, when applicable. All measurements were recorded to the nearest millimetre using University of North Carolina no. 15 (UNC-15, Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA) periodontal probe. Plaque scores were assessed using Silness and Loe[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] PI and gingival condition was assessed with the help of Loe and Silness[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] gingival index (GI). Gingival recession (GR) was measured as the distance from CEJ to the crest of the receded free gingival margin. Probing depth (PD) was measured as the distance from gingival margin to the base of the pocket. An occlusal stent was prepared with cold cure acrylic resin and a groove was made on the stent in relation to each selected tooth to guide the probe position.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Relative attachment level (RAL) was measured from apical border of the stent to the base of the pocket. All clinical parameters were assessed by a single examiner. Examiner calibration was conducted in 7 participants with similar clinical situation with an interval of 48 hours. The examiner calibration was found reproducible if measurements were similar to the mm at the &#x02265;90% level.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Radiographic assessment</title><p>Intraoral periapical (IOPA) radiographs were obtained by long cone paralleling technique at baseline and 9 months postsurgery using a Flow RAPD right angle positioning device and a size 2 E speed IOPA X-ray film (Kodak intra oral X-ray film, care stream health India private limited, Mumbai) in an X-ray unit (70 kV, 7 mA). Individually customized bite blocks were prepared by asking the patient to bite on putty index along with holder and were used pre and postoperatively to standardize the position of exposure. These radiographs were scanned and computer assisted image analysis of the radiographs was done with the help of AutoCAD image analysis software (2010, Autodesk, India Pvt. Ltd, Mumbai, India) [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>]. All radiographic parameters were assessed by the same evaluator who was masked to the surgical intervention performed. The intraexaminer calibration was assessed by performing radiographic measurements in 10 radiographs, not involved in study groups. The anatomical landmarks of the defects were selected based on the criteria set by Schei <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] which include CEJ, alveolar crest (AC), and base of the defect (BD). Defect depth (DD) was assessed by drawing an auxiliary line (AUX 1) parallel to the long axis of the tooth. A second auxiliary line (AUX 2) perpendicular to AUX 1 was drawn from the AC. The DD was measured from the lateral extension of intrabony defect to the point where AUX 2 crossed the root surface to the BD.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Radiographic appearance at baseline for site treated with PRF + DBM.

Sites treated with PRF (group A and B) showed less GR compared to control group.</p><p>The better PD reduction observed in PRF treated sites (groups A and B) may be related to the elevated concentrations of polypeptide growth factors, which might have enhanced soft tissue healing. The present finding is in accordance with the previous studies by Choukroun <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and Dohan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The significant improvement in RAL, LBG, and %BF in this trial can be attributed to the use of DBM, which maintains the space for tissue formation to occur and osteoconductive property of the graft may act as scaffold for the growth of mineralized tissue.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] One more positive effect of DBM is the presence of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), which are released during the demineralization process.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] It is speculated that BMPs in their active state (osteoinductive) promote the effects of growth factors within the platelets, which provide a synergetic effect on the different cell populations of the surgical wound.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] The results of the present trial are in accordance with previous study by Lekovic <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] which showed a defect fill of 4.06 &#x000b1; 0.87mm on buccal and 3.94 &#x000b1; 0.73 on lingual sites in PRF + BPBM (Bovine porous bone mineral) compared to PRF group (2.21 &#x000b1; 0.68 mm on buccal and 2.06 &#x000b1; 0.64 mm on lingual sites).

Clinical attachment level (CAL) gain is considered one of the most important parameter reflecting the soft tissue healing, and LBG and %BF were considered as parameters for bone formation. The results of this study clearly show a significant improvement in CAL gain in sites treated with PRF [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>]. Similarly, addition of DBM significantly enhanced the bone formation at 9 months. This supports the significance of growth factors in PRF that may improve the soft and hard tissue healing.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>GR observed at 3 months was maintained for a period of 9 months in PRF treated sites. This finding may be explained by additional biological properties of PRF. The 3D fibrin matrix in PRF has mechanical adhesive properties and acts like fibrin glue: which hold and maintain the flap in a stable position. Agarwal <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] reported a complete root coverage (100%) in 33.3% sites treated with coronally advanced flap with PRF using microsurgical approach. The improvement in PD, RAL, LBG, and %BF observed in PRF treated sites of present investigation are along the expected lines and in accordance with a recent systematic review.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Hence, the results of this trial add to the current evidence regarding the use of PRF with grafting material. The main limitations of our study are less sample size and inability to perform histological analysis due to ethical reason.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Within the limits of this study, it is concluded that treatment of intrabony defect with PRF appears to be associated with improvement in clinical and radiological parameters with uneventful healing. Addition of DBM enhances the clinical effects of PRF, with particular benefits, in terms of %BF in intrabony defects. Considering the autologous nature, minimal cost and time, PRF can be incorporated as a regenerative material in intrabony defects. Further, long-term multicenter randomized, clinical trials with large sample size and histological evaluation of new bone formation are needed to confirm the results of this study.</p><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Reynolds</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>Kao</surname><given-names>RT</given-names></name><name><surname>Camargo</surname><given-names>PM</given-names></name><name><surname>Caton</surname><given-names>JG</given-names></name><name><surname>Clem</surname><given-names>DS</given-names></name><name><surname>Fiorellini</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Periodontal regeneration &#x02013;
