More than 20% of hospital inpatient days can be attributed to patients with diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Multiple studies have highlighted associations between hyperglycemia and adverse outcomes in hospitalized patients with diabetes and have focused attention on approaches to improve inpatient glycemic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Current guidelines recommend avoiding oral antidiabetic agents in this setting and using scheduled subcutaneous insulin for basal, nutritional, and correctional components in noncritically ill patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Current glycemic targets for patients on general medical and surgical units are premeal blood glucose (BG) levels &#x0003c;140 mg/dL and random BG levels &#x0003c;180 mg/dL. The challenge in this patient setting is to achieve these goals while avoiding hypoglycemia as much as possible.</p><p>Hypoglycemia is a common problem in hospitalized patients being treated for diabetes and is correlated with increased morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Excessive insulin dosing is a common risk factor for hypoglycemia in the inpatient setting where nutritional intake may be erratic. Renal insufficiency is commonly encountered in hospitalized patients with diabetes. Hypoglycemia is more common in patients with renal insufficiency than in those without for many reasons, including decreased insulin clearance, insulin resistance, reduced gluconeogenesis, and decreased food intake due to attendant anorexia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). In addition, hypoglycemic unawareness and gastroparesis may accompany diabetes and renal failure and may increase the risk for hypoglycemia if standard insulin protocols based on body weight and insulin sensitivity are applied. Decreased insulin requirements have been demonstrated for insulin-treated type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients with renal insufficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Thus, an insulin-dosing algorithm that accounts for decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) could be an important tool to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia in this patient setting.</p><p>No prior literature has addressed this question. Many patients with type 2 diabetes and renal insufficiency are treated with oral antidiabetic agents before hospital admission, and current guidelines recommend switching to insulin for their hospital stay. In addition, inpatient measurement of HBA<sub>1c</sub> will reveal many with poor control who may benefit in the long run if they are converted to insulin therapy before discharge. The aim of this study was to compare two weight-based insulin doses for inpatients with type 2 diabetes and renal insufficiency. Insulin glargine and glulisine were used in a basal-bolus approach to try to maintain good glycemic control while determining the relative frequency of hypoglycemia with each of the two dosing regimens.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>This prospective randomized trial was carried out at Loyola University Medical Center, Rush University Medical Center, and Northwestern University Medical Center between June 2009 and June 2011. Study staff screened electronic medical records for patients admitted to general medical or surgical units for possible eligibility.</p><p>Patients with type 2 diabetes of &#x0003e;1 year duration and age &#x0003e;18 years with a GFR &#x02264;45 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> were eligible to participate. The three hospital laboratories automatically calculated an estimated GFR with the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula, which uses age, sex, African American versus non-African American, and serum creatinine. Every effort was made to exclude any patients whose serum creatinine level might have been acutely elevated. GFR on the day of enrollment was always used. Patients were required to have at least one hospital blood glucose (BG) &#x0003e;180 mg/dL and, if on insulin, the outpatient insulin dose needed to be &#x02265;0.5 units/kg/day. Exclusion criteria included type 1 diabetes, pregnancy, chronic dialysis, solid-organ transplant within the past 12 months, steroid therapy &#x0003e;7.5 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent, known hypopituitarism or adrenal insufficiency, known hypoglycemia unawareness, length of stay &#x0003c;48 h, and severe liver disease.</p><p>Eligible patients gave informed consent and were randomized 1:1 into two protocol groups by a research pharmacist. The standard-dose group received a total daily insulin dose of 0.5 units/kg and the reduced-dose group received a total daily insulin dose of 0.25 units/kg. Half of the total insulin dose was given as glargine once daily, either in the <sc>am</sc> or in the <sc>pm,</sc> depending on when the patient was enrolled. The other half of the total daily insulin dose was given as glulisine; doses were divided equally between breakfast, lunch, and dinner. An additional correctional dose of glulisine was given for any BG &#x0003e;180 mg/dL. If subjects were not eating, they received glargine once daily and could also receive correctional doses of glulisine. Correctional glulisine could be given four times daily with meals or at bedtime.</p><p>Correctional dosing of glulisine was based on total daily insulin requirements. Subjects receiving &#x0003c;40 units of insulin daily could receive 2 additional units of glulisine for BG 181&#x02013;220, 3 units for BG 221&#x02013;270, 4 units for BG 271&#x02013;320, and 5 units for BG &#x0003e;320 mg/dL. Subjects receiving 40&#x02013;80 units of insulin daily could receive 3 additional units of glulisine for BG 181&#x02013;220, 5 units for BG 221&#x02013;270, 7 units for BG 271&#x02013;320, and 9 units for BG &#x0003e; 320 mg/dL. Subjects receiving &#x0003e; 80 units of insulin daily could receive 5 additional units of glulisine for BG 181&#x02013;220, 7 units for BG 221&#x02013;270, 9 units for BG 271&#x02013;320, and 11 units for BG &#x0003e;320. If the BG was &#x0003e;180 mg/dL at bedtime, a correctional dose of glulisine was given that was 50% of the above doses.

Subjects who were discharged from the hospital &#x0003c;48 h after enrollment were not included in the analysis. All oral antidiabetic agents were stopped on hospital admission. BG was measured using point-of-care meters before meals, at bedtime, and whenever necessary for signs or symptoms of hypoglycemia. Insulin doses were adjusted daily to maintain BG in the range of 100 to 180 mg/dL. If fasting BG was &#x0003c;100 mg/dL, the glargine dose was decreased by 20%, if fasting BG was 100 to 140 mg/dL, the glargine dose was not changed, if fasting BG was 140 to 180 mg/dL, the glargine dose was increased by 10%, and if fasting BG was &#x0003e;180 mg/dL, the glargine dose was increased by 20%. If the daily dose of glargine changed, the mealtime dose of glulisine would move proportionately in the same direction.</p><p>The primary end points were the percentage of BG levels within the range of 100 to 180 mg/dL, and the percentage of subjects experiencing a hypoglycemic event defined as a BG &#x0003c;70 mg/dL.

Patients with diabetes and renal insufficiency present a greater challenge because of their increased risk for hypoglycemia, especially when the GFR is &#x0003c;60 mL/min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Insulin-treated patients with renal failure are more susceptible to hypoglycemia because of diminished insulin clearance. After the liver, the kidney is the most important site for insulin elimination. In the normal kidney, insulin is freely filtered at the glomerulus and subsequently reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. However, insulin clearance decreases as renal failure progresses, resulting in a prolonged pharmacokinetic profile. Rave et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) found a 30&#x02013;40% reduction in the clearance of regular and lispro insulin in patients with a mean GFR of 54 mL/min. The phenomenon is more striking when GFR falls &#x0003c;40 mL/min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Biesenbach et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) found that the insulin requirements were reduced by 51% in type 2 diabetes as GFR deteriorated from 80 to 10 mL/min.</p><p>Current guidelines for insulin dosing in hospitalized patients do not suggest specific modifications depending on the level of GFR. Our study is the first to provide direct evidence for the benefit of a dose reduction for such patients. We find that patients with type 2 diabetes and renal insufficiency can achieve equivalent control of hyperglycemia by starting with 0.25 or 0.5 units/kg/day of glargine and glulisine insulin. However, twice as many subjects who received 0.5 units/kg/day experienced hypoglycemia compared with those who received 0.25 units/kg/day. The equivalent control of hyperglycemia between the two groups was unexpected. We speculate that it may reflect increased insulin resistance during the acute illness of hospitalization. On the last study day of each subject, only 46&#x02013;56% of BG readings were in the target range of 100 to 180 mg/dL. This result is likely due to our protocol that only allows 10&#x02013;20% titrations in insulin dose per day and also reflects the difficulty in achieving control of hyperglycemia while striving to avoid hypoglycemia in the short time span of the usual hospital stay. To achieve these results, it is important to avoid giving mealtime short-acting insulin when the patient does not receive the meal and to adjust doses of both basal and mealtime insulin every day based on individual BG trends. The general medical subjects were somewhat more likely to experience hypoglycemia than the general surgical subjects; however, the absolute number of subjects and hypoglycemic episodes was too small to allow any firm conclusions. The daily mean BG levels and the frequency of hypoglycemia in the current study are similar to previous inpatient diabetes trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, although it was a multicenter study, a relatively small number of subjects were enrolled. Second, although the reduction in the frequency of hypoglycemia seen with 0.25 units/kg/day seems highly clinically relevant, it did not reach statistical significance in our study, perhaps because of the small size of the study groups. Third, although house-staff teams cared for all subjects in our study, clinicians experienced in the art of inpatient insulin management supervised all insulin dose titrations. Thus, our results may be difficult to replicate in hospital settings that do not have a dedicated glucose management team.</p><p>In summary, control of hyperglycemia in noncritical hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes and renal insufficiency was equivalent with 0.5 compared with 0.25 units/kg/day using a glargine and glulisine insulin regimen. However, the patients who received the reduced doses of insulin experienced only half as much hypoglycemia. We conclude that this optimized approach for this patient population is a significant improvement over current inpatient protocols that suggest initial insulin doses based solely on weight.</p></sec>
