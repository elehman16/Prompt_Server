The LC group took until 10-day follow-up to show increase in perceived susceptibility (B=0.47, standard error (SE) 0.16, <italic>P</italic>=.005). The HC group showed an immediate increase in perceived susceptibility at posttest (B=0.43, SE 0.14, <italic>P</italic>=.002). The LC group exhibited no changes in perceived severity (B=0.40, SE 0.33, <italic>P</italic>=.24).

Further analyses indicated that perceived threat from virtual cancer cells in the game is related to the increase in perceived severity (B=0.1, SE 0.03, <italic>P</italic>=.001), and perceived susceptibility is related to changes in ISB at 10-day follow-up (B=0.21, SE 0.08, <italic>P</italic>=.008).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The feature of challenge with cancer cells in a virtual environment has the potential to increase cancer risk perception and ISB.

Despite the importance of information seeking, the Health Information National Trends Survey has reported that less than half of Americans look for cancer information [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. By promoting ISB [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], young adults may become aware of cancer risks and potential preventive measures. In particular, their active search for information about cancer may increase their cancer knowledge and equip them with ways to get protected from cancer [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>One way to encourage ISB is by helping young adults perceive cancer risk [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Cancer risk perception is mainly characterized by two dimensions. First, perceived susceptibility to cancer explains one's beliefs about the likelihood of being diagnosed with cancer. The second dimension is perceived severity of cancer, which explains one's perception of the seriousness of cancer diagnosis. Previous research has found that young adults' perceived susceptibility to and severity of cancer may moderate engagement in healthy behaviors such as breast self-examination [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], mammography [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], skin protection [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and smoking cessation [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Ultimately, the lack of ISB and cancer risk perception may delay cancer prevention and control at long term. As a result, the World Health Organization has emphasized the need to design interventions that successfully raise awareness about cancer risks and ISB [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. While previous research has well examined processes by which individuals engage in health-related information seeking [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], little is known about the role of game play features in driving ISB. Responding to this need, video games have been designed as innovative tools for health promotion and disease prevention. The current study seeks to evaluate the impact of a video game called <italic>&#x0201c;Re-Mission&#x0201d;</italic> [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] on young adult college students' tendency to perceive the severity of cancer, feel susceptible to cancer, and seek cancer-related information.</p><p><italic>Re-Mission</italic> is a fully automated game in which players control a virtual nanorobot that goes inside virtual cancer patients' bodies to fight cancer cells [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The <italic>Re-Mission</italic> intervention was designed primarily to encourage pediatric cancer patients to adhere to their medication [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, recent exploratory research has shown that <italic>Re-Mission</italic> may have an impact on healthy young adults&#x02019; risk perception [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. As a result, the evaluation of <italic>Re-Mission</italic> in the context of risk communication deserves attention. We conducted the current experimental evaluation [ISRCTN15789289] to verify whether and how <italic>Re-Mission</italic> might modify risk perception in healthy young adults. This would indicate whether there is a potential to design a digital game for the promotion of cancer preventing behaviors among young adults.</p><p>One theory supporting an association between game-play and cancer preventing behaviors is the protection motivation theory (PMT) [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. According to PMT, threatening health messages can stimulate risk perception and encourage protective behavior. By experiencing threat, individuals may become motivated to take actions that can protect them, such as seeking information about the health topic [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>-<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesized that young adults who play <italic>Re-Mission</italic> at &#x02018;high challenge&#x02019; (HC) are more likely to increase perceived severity of cancer, perceived susceptibility to cancer, and cancer-related ISB, compared with young adults who play <italic>Re-Mission</italic> at &#x02018;low challenge&#x02019; (LC) or do not play <italic>Re-Mission</italic>. We also hypothesized that (1) perceived threat in the gaming intervention is related to perceived susceptibility and perceived severity, and (2) such secondary outcomes are related to ISB.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Game Intervention Format and Key Features</title><p>The story in <italic>Re-Mission</italic> revolves around Roxxi, a nanorobot designed by a doctor and injected into the body of virtual cancer patients to help them fight cancer cells. Players are first presented with the narrative, the characters, and main game objective. Then, they are asked to choose a virtual cancer patient that needs assistance. The game gives the players control over the movement of Roxxi, who undertakes missions to fight cancer cells in a three-dimensional environment, within the bodies of cancer patients (See <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Multimedia Appendix 1</xref>).</p><p>Beyond mere exposure to information, <italic>Re-Mission</italic> involves a first-hand experience of cancer threat that ultimately allows players to perceive cancer risk. In <italic>Re-Mission</italic>, players are able to witness cancer cell behavior, from cell division to invasion, and ultimately find themselves in conflict with cancer cells. Conflict with cancer is a key feature of challenge in <italic>Re-Mission</italic>. A highly challenging environment with cancer cells (ie, presence of obstacles at high difficulty when fighting cancer cells) may facilitate perceived severity of cancer and intentions to seek cancer-related information [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>The components of this controlled trial adhere to the CONSORT and CONSORT-EHEALTH guidelines [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] on information to include when reporting trials in general and eHealth in particular. This efficacy trial used a three-arm, single-blinded randomized controlled (Time &#x000d7; Condition) design with assessments at baseline, immediate posttest, 10-day, and 20-day follow-ups. The trial was registered at the Current Controlled Trials [ISRCTN15789289].</p></sec><sec><title>Sample</title><p>We assessed the eligibility of all interested undergraduate students through a screening conducted before participation. Inclusionary criteria were being aged 18 to 35 years, attending college, consenting to play video games, and speaking English, Spanish, or French (the game was available in all three languages). Exclusionary criteria involved having a medical or mental condition that hindered the ability to play games or complete questionnaires. All participants were informed about the aim of the study and their consent for participation was recorded. The institutional review board at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and the University at Buffalo, the State University of New York approved this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention Groups and Control Group</title><p>Young adults were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: an intervention group playing <italic>Re-Mission</italic> at HC (<italic>n</italic>=85), an intervention group playing <italic>Re-Mission</italic> at LC (n=81), and a control group with no challenge (NC; presented with illustrated pictures of <italic>Re-Mission</italic>; n=50).</p><p>Manipulation of challenge was conducted as suggested by previous research on conflict manipulation in <italic>Re-Mission</italic> [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. HC was conceptualized as a condition that arises from a set of obstacles (eg, invasion by and multiplication of cancer cells) that prevent the players from attaining their goals in the game (eg, killing cancer cells and helping the patient recover from cancer) [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Three characteristics of challenge were manipulated in the game-mechanics to form an HC environment: (1) difficulty level (ie, amount of ammunition needed to destroy a cancer cell), (2) vulnerability to cancer cells (ie, cancer cells can put the nanorobot to sleep), and (3) limited ammunition (limited virtual medication to kill cancer cells). See <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2">Multimedia Appendix 2</xref> for a pictorial depiction of manipulation.</p><p>The NC condition involved the presentation of several illustrations from the video game with a description of the conflict occurring between the nanorobot and the cancer cells. In particular, they were presented with illustrations of <italic>Re-Mission</italic> that represent steps of a conflict event with cancer cells (ie, exposure to cancer cells, cancer cells multiplying, Roxxi approaching cancer cells, cancer cells attacking Roxxi, and Roxxi fighting cancer cells; see examples in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app3">Multimedia Appendix 3</xref>). Each illustration included a textual description of the event and the context of the game. As a result, this condition lacked a first-hand experience of challenge, while keeping a presentation of the game available to participants. Instead of using a noneducational video game, the control condition of this study preserved the context of cancer prevention in order to highlight the role of conflict experience as a driver of health outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Implementation</title><p>A verbal announcement was made in 3 undergraduate classes at a northeastern university. Each class included approximately 500 young adults. A Web-based announcement was also posted through the course material announcement page, and interested students were able to contact the research team for participation. Recruitment continued for a period of 2 months, or until reaching the target sample size. All interested students provided verbal and written informed consent and were invited for baseline assessment.</p><p>One week after completing a baseline survey, participants arrived at the intervention site and were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: LC, HC, or NC. The principal investigator generated the random allocation sequence. The research assistant enrolled participants and assigned them to groups. Concealed envelopes were used to implement the random allocation while concealing the sequence until intervention assignment. Participants were not told which intervention was the intervention of interest. Intervention implementation occurred in a noise-protected room at the university campus. Before playing <italic>Re-Mission</italic>, participants in the LC and HC conditions were seated in front of computers of the same brand and size, and they completed a tutorial that allowed them to practice using the controls in the game when attempting to move the avatar Roxxi (approximately 7 minutes). After the tutorial, all participants were seated in front of computers of the same brand and size, and were provided with headphones for privacy and maximum immersion. Then, participants were invited to start the first mission of the game and played for 35 minutes. Every time the players completed the mission and every time they lost in the game, they were asked to play it again, until the session was over. This method of intervention implementation with game interventions has been previously applied and validated with <italic>Re-Mission</italic> [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Participants in the NC group were also seated in front of computers, but they were presented with the NC condition of <italic>Re-Mission</italic>. For all conditions, the research assistant monitored progress from a different room.</p><p>Participants in all 3 conditions were invited to complete a survey immediately after implementation, 10 days later, and 20 days later. As an ethical consideration, after the 20-day follow-up, the NC group received information about <italic>Re-Mission</italic> and ways to access the game, if interested.</p></sec><sec><title>Compensation</title><p>Participants were offered credits for their respective classes from their professors. Credits were provided for each assessment, and as a result of intervention participation (ie, 0.5 credit points for baseline survey, 1 credit point for intervention participation, 0.5 credit points for immediate post-test survey, and 1 credit point for each of the follow-up surveys).</p></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><p>Outcome measures were assessed through Web-based closed surveys. The surveys were pretested for validity, reliability, usability, and technical functionality during the pilot study [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Adherence to the checklist for reporting results of Internet e-surveys [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] is provided as <xref ref-type="app" rid="app4">Multimedia Appendix 4</xref>. The post-test survey is the only survey that occurred in the presence of a research assistant, who was only available for technical assistance. The primary outcome ISB was assessed at baseline, 10-day, and 20-day follow-ups. The secondary outcomes, perceived severity of cancer and perceived susceptibility to cancer, were assessed at baseline, immediate posttest, 10-day, and 20-day follow-ups. In addition to the endpoints, other variables that might affect play behavior in a challenging virtual environment were measured (eg, frequency of weekly game play, perceived skills with video games, and perceived control over stress during game play). Perceived control over <italic>Re-Mission</italic> was measured to tap on players&#x02019; control over gaming events, including cancer cells during the challenge. Perceived threat from virtual cancer cells was measured at immediate posttest.

First, a series of chi-squared analyses were conducted to check for any sociodemographic differences between the groups. Then, manipulation checks were conducted in order to check if the manipulation appropriately reflects levels of challenge. This involved a series of one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs), checking for group differences with respect to prior gaming experience (ie, skills in digital game play, general reaction to threat during game play, control over stress, or prior history of game play in hours per week). The ANOVAs also checked for any group difference in attitude toward <italic>Re-Mission</italic>, perceived control over game play, and experience of positive challenge during game play. When warranted, Bonferroni adjustment was performed, correcting for alpha over repeated comparisons and guarding against Type 1 error [<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>Repeated-measures, mixed-effect linear models were used, testing differences between the three treatment groups at three time-points in a 3 (treatment) &#x000d7; 3 (time; baseline, 10-day and 20-day follow-up) factorial design for ISB, and at four time-points in a 3 (treatment) &#x000d7; 4 (time; baseline, post-test, 10-day, and 20-day follow-up) factorial design for perceived cancer severity and susceptibility. ISB was not measured at immediate posttest because participants did not yet have the chance to seek cancer information.

The findings also indicated that the perception of threat during the intervention increased perceived severity of cancer.</p><p>This trial is the first to present the potential use of <italic>Re-Mission</italic> for cancer risk communication among healthy young adults. Gaming features in <italic>Re-Mission</italic> increased young adults&#x02019; cancer risk perception and led to the seeking of cancer-related information. The critical gaming feature manipulated in this study is challenge, which in <italic>Re-Mission</italic> is represented as the conflict between young-adult players and cancer cells. This conflict is characterized by the proliferation of cancer cells and their continuous attack of the player avatar, Roxxi [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>The results indicate that a high level of challenge in the intervention led to a quick (posttest) change in perceived susceptibility, whereas a low level of challenge was associated with a slower change (10-day follow-up), which marginally increased in the longer term (20-day follow-up). This indicates that the level of challenge may not need to be high to promote enduring change in perceived susceptibility.</p><p>Further, the results suggest that a high level of challenge may be needed to change perceived severity of cancer and to maintain that change in the longer term. The HC group exhibited an increase from baseline to posttest, which then plateaued from posttest until 20-day follow-up. On the other hand, the LC group showed no changes from baseline to posttest, 10-day or 20-day follow-up. As hypothesized previously [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], the HC condition, in comparison to the LC condition, exposes players to more aggressive behavior in cancer cells, an experience likely to lead them to perceive cancer as more severe.</p><p>The results highlight the limits of mere exposure to health information as opposed to virtual experience of challenge by cancer cells. For the NC control group, no change in perceived severity or perceived susceptibility is observed from baseline to posttest. However, from posttest to 10-day follow-up, the NC group showed a significant decrease in perceived severity. Following the presentation of information that describes cancer cell behavior, young adults did not display any increase in their perception of the severity of cancer, and even showed a decrease in the longer term. Such results are consistent with other research indicating that interactive experience is an important determinant of perceived severity of cancer [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>There was no significant difference between the HC and LC groups in ISB variation over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure2">Figure 2</xref> c). However, compared with the NC group, the HC and LC groups were more likely to demonstrate an increase in ISB from baseline to 10-day and 20-day follow-up. For this reason, the difference in ISB change between the NC group and the other groups may be driven by factors other than perceived severity.</p><p>Our relationship results also attest to this finding. Perceived threat, a direct outcome of the intervention, was related to changes in perceived severity but not susceptibility. However, it is perceived susceptibility that was found to be related to ISB. As a result, the antecedents of perceived susceptibility warrant further investigation in order to understand how ISB occurs following the gaming intervention.</p><p>Our previous investigations with <italic>Re-Mission</italic> indicated that threat perception is associated with fear when facing the cancer cells in the game [<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Effects of perceived threat can be further investigated during future research, in order to understand the role of emotions in driving health outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>In this study, young adults participated in 1 session of <italic>Re-Mission</italic> only. Typical use of <italic>Re-Mission</italic> might involve many hours of play over a period of time, and the results found in this study might not be characteristic of more extensive play. The results may also be affected by the tutorial, which can be skipped in a typical setting. However, all <italic>Re-Mission</italic> players were presented with the tutorial to control for its potential effect.</p><p>This study ended with a relatively low retention rate (101/216, 46.8%). By the time this study reached 20-day follow-up, college students were at a transition to summer break, and ultimately, several of them were not available to continue in the study. However, this did not stop 101 participants to continue in the study, and keep acceptable power for data analysis. Future work with college students may need to consider a more suitable timing for data collection.</p><p>While the results explain short-term effects on information seeking, they do not consider long-term opportunities for actual protective behaviors. Notably, though, this preclinical trial was meant only to test the potential effectiveness of challenge as a moderator of risk perception and ISB. The current study did not inspect specific types of ISB. However, our pilot study indicated relationships between general ISB and players&#x02019; intentions to obtain information from family members and from doctors during medical visits [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p><italic>Re-Mission</italic> is not designed to directly influence actual cancer preventive behaviors among healthy young adults (eg, improvement in healthy eating or prevention of tobacco smoking). However, our results indicate that conflict with cancer cells and the virtual experience of cancer cell behavior could increase young-adults&#x02019; comprehensive understanding and perception of cancer, which could well act as a driver for acquisition of preventive behaviors.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications</title><p>The results of this study can be used to inform the design of a novel, game-based intervention for cancer risk communication. Such an intervention might make use of the current findings by providing a balance between LC and HC during conflict with virtual cancer cells. With challenge manipulation, the intervention may create a state of balance between the level of challenge in the game and players&#x02019; ability to overcome the challenge. Also, the new intervention could allow young adults to discover new cancer information inside the game, and ultimately learn about new ways to protect themselves. With cancer information embedded in the intervention, it may become possible to measure ISB objectively by monitoring the player&#x02019;s accessing of information in the game. The new intervention may boost self-efficacy for self-protection by allowing young adults to enter a virtual environment that facilitates the simulation of engagement in healthy actions. While challenge with cancer cells may drive risk perception, it can also allow young adults to experience the consequences of their actions in the game. In particular, a new intervention may allow young adults to explore the risks of cancer-promoting behaviors (eg, smoking), as well as the benefits of cancer preventive behaviors (eg, healthy eating). Finally, with management options in the game, young adults can create a plan and register electronic reminders to engage in preventive behaviors. For instance, through the game, college students can make Web-based appointments for cancer screening or vaccination at the clinics of their Universities.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank all research members from the University at Buffalo, the State University of New York (Buffalo, New York) for their contributions to the success of this trial, including Helen Wang, PhD (advisor), Arun Vishwanath, PhD (provider of equipment and laboratory usage), Brian Reynolds and Amanda Damiano, PhD (facilitators of data collection), Wayne Weiai Xu, PhD (research coordinator and assistant), and HopeLab (<italic>Re-Mission</italic> creators, Redwood City, California).
