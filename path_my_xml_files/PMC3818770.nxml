wave therapy (ESWT) on the muscle weight and function of the hind limb in sciatic nerve
injury. [Subjects] Forty rats with sciatic nerve crushing injury were randomly divided
into two groups: an ESWT group (n=20), and a control group (n=20). [Methods] The ESWT
group received extracorporeal shock wave treatment, and the control group did not receive
any treatment after injury. Experimental animals were measured for muscle weight on an
electronic scale and were tested for function on a sciatic functional index (SFI).
[Results] All groups showed significant increases in the weights of the left soleus and
gastrocnemius muscles, and decreases in the weights of the right soleus and gastrocnemius
muscles (p&#x0003c;0.05). Comparison of SFI scores and muscle weights between the groups showed
significant differences in SFI scores, and the right soleus and gastrocnemius muscles
(p&#x0003c;0.05) [Conclusion] Exercise programs that use ESWT can be said to be effective at
improving the function of the sciatic nerve and preventing the denervation atrophy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>ESWT</kwd><kwd>Sciatic nerve</kwd><kwd>Peripheral nerve</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Neurological damage from external injury or trauma occurs more often in the peripheral
nervous system than in the central nervous system. Neurological damage to the peripheral
nervous system may result in severe physiological, morphological, cytological, or functional
impairments, such as loss of motor function of the muscles that are controlled by the
damaged neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Similarly, a decrease in protein synthesis may cause denervation atrophy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, and inhibition of sensory neurons may cause
dysesthetic sensation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Damage to the
sensory and motor neurons may lead to functional disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There are two major types of treatment for peripheral nerve damage: invasive and
non-invasive. Methods of invasive treatment include injection and surgery, and non-invasive
treatments include electrical stimulation, exercise, aquatic therapy, and medication<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT), a non-invasive treatment, relieves the pain of
peripheral nerve damage and promotes local arterial remodeling and cellular regeneration. It
is also known as an effective treatment for enhancing muscle strength and decreasing muscle
tone. Murata et al. examined the pain-relieving effect of extracorporeal shock wave
treatment, and reported that ESWT activates axonal regeneration, which stimulates
reinnervation and promotes amelioration of desensitization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Bolt et al., in their study of the functional and morphological
effects of shock wave treatment on palmar digital nerve damage, reported that pain relief
caused by changes in peripheral pain perception exerted a positive effect on peripheral
nerve regeneration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, research
into the effects of ESWT on muscular atrophy and function of sciatic nerve damage is
currently inadequate. Therefore, we studied the effects of ESWT on the inhibition of
neurological muscular atrophy and functional improvement following sciatic nerve damage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>This study used 40 eight-week-old Sprague-Dawley male rats weighing between 250&#x02005;g and
300&#x02005;g. Sciatic nerve crushing injury was induced in all the animals, which were then
randomly divided into two groups: an experimental group (n=20) that received
extracorporeal shock wave treatment, and a control group (n=20) that did not receive any
treatment.</p><p>The experimental group received the first treatment immediately after the nerve crushing
damage and, starting on the next day, received three treatments per week for two weeks
(total of six treatments). All surgical procedures and experimental protocols followed
Daegu University's guidelines and were approved by the Institution of Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>For general anesthesia, Zoletil (Virbac, Korea) and Rompun (Bayer, Korea) were mixed at
1:1 ratio and injected into the abdomen of the rats at a dose of 2 ml/kg. To induce
artificial sciatic nerve damage, the region between the right thigh and knee joint was
shaved and incised (2 cm long). Following the incision, the sciatic nerve was removed from
the surrounding muscles, and the region about 7 cm away from the ankle joint, just before
the point where the tibial nerve and peroneal nerve separate, was compressed for 30
seconds under three steps of pressure with hemostatic forceps<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Extracorporeal shockwave treatment (ESWT) was applied using an ESWT machine (HAEMIL,
Soltar, Korea) with low intensity output with a PAD5 applied to the sciatic nerve damage
area. ESWT was applied at a frequency of 3&#x02005;Hz and energy flux density of
0.09&#x02005;mJ/mm<sup>2</sup>, 300 times.</p><p>All measurements were made on the first and the 14th day after the sciatic nerve damage.
To determine the changes in denervation muscular atrophy of peripheral nerves, soleus
muscles from both ends and the gastrocnemius muscle were excised and washed with saline
water, and the muscles were weighed using a microbalance (BL-320H, Shimadzu,
Switzerland).</p><p>To discover the effect of sciatic nerve damage on functional change, the sciatic
functional index (SFI) was measured. Both hind feet of the mice were painted with black
ink, and the mice were allowed to walk through a dark room (50 &#x000d7; 8 &#x000d7; 10&#x02005;cm) so that their
footprints could be tracked.</p><p>Analysis of the footprints consisted of measuring the length between the heel and third
toe (print length, PL), the length between the first and fifth toes (toe spread, TS), and
the length between the second and fourth toes (intermediary toe spread, IT). These
measurements were used to calculate SFI. The value of SFI of a normal rat is usually
around 0, whereas that of a rat with severe injury is close to &#x02212;100.</p><p>The paired t-test was used to compare the treatment effects in each group. The
independent t-test was used to compare the groups. The data were processed using SPSS for
Windows Version 20.0, and a significance level (&#x003b1;) of 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1. </label><caption><title> Comparison of SFI scores and muscle weights between pre-test and post-test for

incomplete<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Damage to peripheral
nerves locally or generally decreases motor, sensory, and voluntary control of the
denervated region, peripheral nerve damage also cause loss of motor function and diminishes
functional activity and overall quality of life<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The region that is under the control of the damaged nerves experiences dysesthetic
sensation, which, with time, may also cause collateral damage to the spinal ganglion,
anterior horn, or posterior horn of the spinal cord<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Peripheral nerve damage also affects the microvessels, impeding
nutrients from reaching the neurons, and causes malfunction in signal transduction and
muscle degeneration. Denervated muscle atrophy leads to decrease in protein synthesis and
increase in protein degradation, and it may occur as a result of peripheral nerve damage, in
which neurons lose control of the surrounding muscles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Muscle atrophy caused by post-peripheral nerve injury denervation causes greater damage
than muscle atrophy caused by casting, tenotomy, or bed rest<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Sunderland<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>,
in a study of muscle atrophy resulting from crush injury administered to rats, reported that
the weight of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles and the cross-sectional areas of muscle
fibers decreased significantly with time. Sakakima et al. found that, after two weeks of
nerve injury, the affected side showed the highest degree of muscle atrophy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, the ESWT group showed significant increases in muscle weights due to
the excessive use of the left soleus and gastrocnemius muscles (p&#x0003c;0.05). However, the
weight of the right soleus and gastrocnemius muscles showed significant decreases in weight
due to denervation atrophy (p&#x0003c;0.05). In other words, ESWT did not completely prevent
muscle atrophy. The control group also showed significant differences in the weights of all
muscles (p&#x0003c;0.05). The control group showed significant increases in muscle weights due to
excessive use of left soleus and gastrocnemius muscles (p&#x0003c;0.05). When comparing the
degree of atrophy between the groups, we found that the right soleus and the gastrocnemius
showed significant differences (p&#x0003c;0.05). This result indicates that ESWT reduced the
level of muscle atrophy by counteracting the changes that occurred from inhibition of muscle
contraction and decrease of protein synthesis.</p><p>Since peripheral nerve damage reduces the control of the motor and sensory functions of the
corresponding muscles, overall functional activity also reduces. If adequate treatment is
not provided immediately after an injury, functional disorders may occur, even after the
regeneration of peripheral nerves<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Symptoms that may follow sciatic nerve damage include reduction of joint movement, imbalance
of postural alignment, and compensation of movement<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies have found that the gait of rats show decreases
in knee joint and ankle joint movements and in stride and step lengths, resulting in an
overall decrease in functional activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Murata et al. observed the effect of extracorporeal shockwave treatment on peripheral nerve
damage, and reported that the shockwave promotes reinnervation and amelioration of
desensitization by activating axonal regeneration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In present study, the ESWT group showed a significant increase in
SFI score after the treatment and there was also a significant difference between the groups
(p&#x0003c;0.05). These results indicate that ESWT stimulates regeneration and reordering of the
nerves, which in turn activates the conjunction of muscle and neurons, and increases
functional activity. Our study was conducted in a short time with a small number of
subjects. In further studies, we hope to discover the effects of extracorporeal shockwave
treatment on peripheral nerve damage in various regions of the body.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Campbell</surname><given-names>WW</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Evaluation and management of peripheral nerve
