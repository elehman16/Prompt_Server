In addition to factors, such as age and sex, these diseases are also influenced by factors such as physical activity, obesity, and diet, which are adjustable. Noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and multiple sclerosis (MS) can be controlled through lifestyle modifications and improvement in health care.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>MS is a chronic and progressive demyelination of the central nervous system (CNS) that affects a wide range of neurological functions.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Approximately 2.5 million individuals in the world and, according to the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Iran, more than 40 thousand individuals in Iran suffer from MS.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In Isfahan (Iran), the number of patients with this disease is approximately 4250 individuals. Isfahan, in proportion to the population of the region, has the highest rate of the disease in Iran.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] MS affects patient's independence and ability to participate effectively in family and social activities. The complications of the disease incapacitate patients in self-care.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Ambivalence and failure to follow the prescribed therapeutic regimen are common problems in these patients, which can lead to disease progression, disability, increased mortality rates, and decreased health promoting behaviors in these patients. Ambivalence in the dimension of nutrition, physical activity and exercise, sleep pattern, and methods of coping with stress is common. Ambivalence is hesitation in following therapeutic behavior; this means that the patient has a combination of inclinations toward the performance and lack of performance of therapeutic behavior.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>In the past several decades, the World Health Organization (WHO) has changed the focus of health care from disease to disease prevention and health promotion.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Health promotion includes all activities that encourage individuals to perform physical, mental, and spiritual activities.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Health-promoting behaviors are a major determinant criterion, and the prevention of diseases is directly linked to these behaviors.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Individuals&#x02019; lifestyle has a direct relationship with their health; a healthy lifestyle can improve health. The goal of improving health-promoting behaviors is to empower individuals to improve their lifestyles and have more control over their health.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>In recent years, the impact of different interventions on behavioral changes in chronic diseases has been examined. One of the recent interventions in the area of chronic diseases is motivational interviewing that is effective on behavioral and lifestyle changes in these patients.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>In order to increase intrinsic motivation, motivational interviewing directly identifies and resolves patients&#x02019; ambivalence toward change. Studies have shown that motivational interviewing can cause immense changes through increasing motivation.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In the study conducted by Smith and Lanesskog, motivational interviewing improved physical activity, reduced fatigue, and increased the duration of exercise in patients with MS.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Nevertheless, it was not effective on patients&#x02019; adherence to exercise programs.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The study conducted by Bombardier also showed that telephone-based motivational interviewing can improve health-promoting behaviors in patients with MS.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The study conducted by Ghasemipour showed motivational interviewing to be ineffective in the prevention of obesity in patients with coronary artery diseases (CADs).[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In Iran, no study was found regarding the effectiveness of motivational interviewing on health-promoting behaviors of patients with MS. Statistics show the increasing prevalence of MS,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and if patients&#x02019; ambivalence is not resolved, the disease may progress and patients&#x02019; health-promoting behaviors may be reduced. Because of these problems, inconsistencies among studies, the importance of health-promoting behaviors, and the increasing use of motivational interviewing in the world, this study examined the impact of motivational interviewing on health-promoting behaviors of patients with MS. According to a previous study, Isfahan has the highest prevalence of MS in Iran.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Al-Zahra Hospital is one of the most important centers in the city and a large number of patients with MS refer to the hospital for medicine, education, and follow-up. Therefore, the Multiple Sclerosis Clinic of this hospital was selected as the research environment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This study was a clinical trial registered with the code IRCT 2015011620675n1. It had two study groups and was performed in three stages (before the intervention, 2 weeks after the intervention, and 1 month after the intervention for follow-up). The study population included 60 patients with MS who referred to the Multiple Sclerosis Clinic of Al-Zahra Hospital, affiliated with the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan. Because of the time limitation, sampling was performed via convenient sampling method. The inclusion criteria included the diagnosis of MS by a doctor, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 0&#x02013;5.5, lack of any other chronic diseases, lack of cognitive and learning disorders of axis 1 and 2 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4<sup>th</sup> Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR), and ability to read and write. The exclusion criteria included lack of willingness to participate in the study, absent from more than one session out of three sessions of the motivational interviewing, hospitalization, and death before the end of the study. Data were collected using a questionnaire that consisted of two parts. The first part consisted of the Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile (HPLP) II questionnaire. The second part consisted of a demographic questionnaire including questions on age, sex, education, marital status, employment status, duration of the disease, and presence of other diseases. The HPLP II is a modified version of the HPLP expanded by Walker and Pender. The HPLP II evaluates health-promoting behaviors by focusing on individual initiative and perception.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The study conducted by Mohammadi Zeidi assessed the validity and reliability of the Persian version of the HPLP.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] They reported the Cronbach's alpha coefficient of the tool as 0.82 and its dimensions as 0.64&#x02013;0.91, and showed that the Persian version of the questionnaire has sufficient validity and reliability. The questionnaire includes six dimensions, namely, nutrition, physical activity, stress management, interpersonal relationships, responsibility for health, and spiritual growth (52 questions). The items are scored based on a 4-point Likert scale (never, sometimes, often, and usually).[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The total score of the questionnaire ranges from a minimum of 52 to a maximum of 208. The score of each dimension is calculated separately and a higher scores mean better health.</p><p>This research was scientifically and ethically validated by the Ethics Committee of the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. The researcher obtained a referral letter from the School of Nursing and Midwifery of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. Subsequently, the researcher presented the introduction letter and explained the objectives of the study to the hospital management, and after obtaining their consent, performed sampling. Patients were randomly assigned to the intervention (<italic>n</italic> = 30) and control (<italic>n</italic> = 30) groups using Mini Pay software which distributes subjects between groups and prevents unwanted mismatch between groups.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] The intervention group was divided into 3 groups (<italic>n</italic> = 10) and the intervention was performed in these small groups. These groups participated in three sessions of motivational interviewing per week (one session every 2 days and each session lasting 1 h). The intervention was conducted through group method because Miller and Rowling believed that motivational interviewing through group method is more effective than individual method. The structure of motivational interviewing sessions was extracted from the book <italic>Motivational Interviewing, Practical Guide</italic>, written by Navidian.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>The structure and content of motivational interviewing sessions:</p><p>

Insufficient number of motivational interviewing sessions, number of subjects, and duration of study may have also been effective on this outcome.</p><p>No studies were found regarding the effectiveness of motivational interviewing on the health-promoting behaviors of patients with MS.
