However, there is evidence that promoting physical activity among older people without providing fall prevention advice may increase fall rates. This trial aims to establish the impact of a physical activity and fall prevention programme compared with a healthy eating programme on physical activity and falls among people aged 60+ years.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This cluster randomised controlled trial will involve 60 groups of community-dwelling people aged 60+ years. Participating groups will be randomised to: (1) a physical activity and fall prevention intervention (30 groups), involving written information, fall risk assessment and prevention advice, a pedometer-based physical activity tracker and telephone-based health coaching; or (2) a healthy eating intervention (30 groups) involving written information and telephone-based dietary coaching. Primary outcomes will be objectively measured physical activity at 12&#x02005;months post-randomisation and self-reported falls throughout the 12-month trial period. Secondary outcomes include: the proportion of fallers, the proportion of people meeting the Australian physical activity guidelines, body mass index, eating habits, mobility goal attainment, mobility-related confidence, quality of life, fear of falling, risk-taking behaviour, mood, well-being, self-reported physical activity, disability, and health and community service use. The between-group difference in the number of falls per person-year will be analysed using negative binomial regression models. For the continuously scored primary and secondary outcome measures, linear regression adjusted for corresponding baseline scores will assess the effect of group allocation. Analyses will be preplanned, conducted while masked to group allocation, will take into account cluster randomisation, and will use an intention-to-treat approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Protocol has been approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee at The University of Sydney, Australia (number 2015/517).

Health conditions that could be ameliorated with physical activity are particularly common in older people.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Approximately 30% of people aged 65&#x02005;years and over fall at least once each year.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In Australia, this currently equates to 1 million people.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Both these problems need to be urgently addressed, as the proportion of older people in the population is rapidly rising&#x02014;by 2050 up to 25% of the Australian population (10.5 million people) will be aged 65&#x02005;years and over.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Good nutrition is also an essential element for maximising health in older age.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Undernutrition plays a significant role in age-related functional decline, frailty and disability.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Despite this, there is a lack of well conducted research to investigate the effect of nutrition-based interventions on disability, quality of life and other markers of health in older people.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> A large proportion of Australian adults are also not meeting the recommendations of the Australian Dietary Guidelines in relation to healthy eating.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Exercise that challenges balance is most effective in preventing falls,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> but exercise interventions found to be effective for fall prevention have not generally been of a high enough dose to ensure participants also meet physical activity recommendations and obtain broader health benefits.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Furthermore, two previous randomised controlled trials of physical activity interventions that successfully increased physical activity levels actually also increased falls.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> These interventions included face-to-face physical activity counselling, a written exercise prescription and telephone-based follow-up among women aged 40&#x02013;75&#x02005;years,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and a nurse-prescribed brisk walking programme among postmenopausal women with a history of recent upper limb fracture.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Cohort studies provide conflicting information about the relationship between falls and physical activity with some finding protective effects<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and others finding higher falls rates in more active people<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> particularly those with mobility limitations.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Taken together, these results suggest that physical activity programmes for older adults should include fall prevention components to maximise health benefits.</p><p>Health coaching is an effective method to support behaviour change. There is sound evidence that structured telephone-based coaching services can lead to positive changes in health behaviours. This has included increased physical activity<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> as well as improved nutrition,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> smoking cessation<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and better management of chronic conditions.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Coaching services have a strong, evidence-based foundation in behaviour-change theories, such as Social Influence Theory, Social Cognitive Theory and the Transtheoretical Model,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and can be effectively delivered to large populations as part of preventive health services.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>Pedometer-based interventions can increase physical activity in older people. Pedometers are simple devices which record the number of steps an individual takes each day. Pedometers have demonstrated greater effects on physical activity than other intervention strategies including informational, behavioural and social approaches.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> A key feature of pedometers is that they record incidental physical activity (eg, walking and stepping while completing household chores) in addition to more structured exercise participation (eg, going for a walk, undertaking a group exercise class). Several trials that have successfully increased physical activity in older people have used pedometers.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> New technologies have enhanced pedometers with web and mobile phone feedback. New wearable activity monitors (such as the Fitbit) use sensor technology, are accurate<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and provide accurate feedback on steps taken and distance travelled using personalised data tracking on websites, text messages and social media, yet are relatively affordable. These devices have the potential to be even more effective than traditional pedometers for increasing physical activity but have yet to be formally evaluated. Over 40% of older Australians are now regular internet users, so a web-linked approach is feasible in this population.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>We have developed a goal-based tailored physical activity and fall prevention intervention that uses health coaching, pedometer-based feedback and social interaction. We have pilot-tested this approach in people aged 60&#x02005;years and older,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and preliminary results show that the intervention is well received and adhered to by older community dwellers.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Our intervention package is designed to increase physical activity and also prevent falls. We will implement this intervention with established groups of older people. This approach will encourage group members to support each other to become more active and use strategies to reduce their risk of falling as well as undertake physical activity together if they wish. This approach has been successfully used to promote participation in fall prevention exercise classes among seniors.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>The primary aim of this trial is to evaluate the effect of the combined physical activity promotion and fall prevention programme on objectively measured physical activity and self-reported falls compared with a healthy eating programme, among established groups of community-dwelling people aged 60&#x02005;years and over. The secondary aims are to establish the impact of the interventions on the proportion of fallers, the proportion of people meeting the physical activity guidelines, body mass index, eating habits, mobility goal attainment, mobility-related confidence, quality of life, fear of falling, risk-taking behaviour, mood, well-being, self-reported physical activity and disability. We also aim to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and cost utility of these intervention approaches from the perspective of the health and community care funder.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Trial design</title><p>We will conduct a parallel group cluster randomised controlled trial.

Randomisation and allocation of a participating group to intervention condition will take place after all participants within the group have provided individual consent, and completed the baseline questionnaires, the assessment of current physical activity participation, and the setting of mobility-related goals. To ensure allocation concealment, group allocation will be determined after baseline data collection using an automatic phone-based randomisation service (NHMRC Clinical Trials Centre). The randomisation sequence will be computer generated using a minimisation algorithm on the basis of the following stratification variables: rural/ urban group location and socioeconomic status of the groups, and whether the group gathering purpose involves physical activity or not.

Activity counts per second will be collected at a sampling frequency of 30&#x02005;Hz and reintegrated to 60&#x02005;s epochs for data analysis. The mean counts/min/day ActiGraph (Axis 1) measure will be computed as the total counts accumulated in a valid day divided by the wear time of that day. To be considered as a valid day for analysis, ActiGraph wear time must include 10&#x02005;h or more. Periods of 90&#x02005;min or more of consecutive zeros (indicating non-use) will be considered as non-wear time. Accelerometer data will be manually checked against participant diaries/calendars to verify wear time, and erroneous data will be excluded prior to analysis. Physical activity participation will be assessed at 12&#x02005;months after participant randomisation, and ActiGraph data will be extracted by a research assistant who is unaware of group assignment (ie, blinded outcome assessment).</p><p>Falls will be measured on a monthly basis for a 12-month period after randomisation. The internationally recognised fall definition will be used: &#x02018;an unexpected event in which the participant comes to rest on the ground, floor, or lower level, as a result of a loss of balance&#x02019;.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Participants will complete 13 monthly fall calendars (to account for study starting part-way through the month), which will be mailed to the research centre in reply-paid, preaddressed envelopes. If calendars are not returned, participants will be telephoned to ask about their fall history for that month. Any fall reported on the calendars will be followed up with a phone call to obtain further information about the details and consequences of the fall. This method for collection of fall data is recommended as best practice by the Prevention of Falls Network Europe.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2f2"><title>Secondary outcome measures</title><p>The secondary outcomes will be: the proportion of fallers; the proportion of ActiGraph wear time in sedentary, light, moderate and vigorous physical activity; body mass index, measured with self-reported height and weight; eating habits, assessed with questions from the Australian Health Survey;<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> mobility-related goal attainment, assessed using the Goal Attainment Scale;<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> quality of life, assessed with the EQ-5D-5L;<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> fear of falling, assessed using the short-form Falls Efficacy Scale International;<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> mood, assessed with the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule;<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> risk-taking behaviour, assessed with a 5-item self-report tool;<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> well-being, assessed with a 26-item composite scale of wellbeing (the COMPAS-W scale);<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> mobility-related confidence, assessed with the Modified Gait Efficacy Scale;<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> self-reported physical activity, assessed with the IPEQ;<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> disability, assessed with the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule II;<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> and health and community service use, assessed using monthly calendars as described above.

Acceptable wear time will be defined as 4&#x02005;days or more of 10&#x02005;h or more per day. To account for correlation among individuals within clusters, all statistical models will use a generalised estimating equations approach with an exchangeable correlation structure. The number of falls per person-year will be analysed using negative binomial regression models to estimate the difference in rates between intervention conditions after 1&#x02005;year (primary outcome). For the continuously scored primary and secondary outcome measures, linear regression will be used to assess the effect of group allocation, with their corresponding baseline scores as a covariate. Log-binomial regression, or a robust Poisson regression in case of convergence issues will be used to compare groups on dichotomous outcome measures (proportion of fallers, proportion meeting physical activity cut points). Planned subgroup analyses will assess differential effects of the intervention by baseline physical activity levels and history of falls. Secondary analyses using causal modelling will be conducted to establish intervention effects in people with greater adherence.</p><p>The economic evaluation will take the perspective of the health and community care funder, and will include benefits measured in terms of falls prevented, extra people with increased physical activity and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY) gained. As well as the healthcare costs outlined above, data will be collected on the cost to deliver the interventions (staff, training, capital costs and consumables). Using the mean costs and the mean health outcomes in each trial arm, the incremental cost per (1) fall prevented, (2) additional person with increased activity, (3) additional person with improved eating habits and (4) QALY gain calculated from the SF-6D will be compared between intervention conditions; results will be plotted on a cost-effectiveness plane. Bootstrapping will be used to estimate a distribution around costs and health outcomes, and to calculate the CIs around the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. One-way sensitivity analysis will be conducted around key variables and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis to estimate the joint uncertainty in all parameters. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve will be plotted to provide information about the probability that the intervention is cost-effective, given willingness to pay for each additional QALY gained.</p><p>Analyses will be conducted using the Stata V.13 software package. All analyses will be preplanned, conducted while masked to group allocation and will use an intention-to-treat approach.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Sample size justification</title><p>A total of 30 clusters per intervention condition with an average of 10 individuals in each cluster (ie, 600 participants) will provide 90% power to detect a 10% between-group difference in the primary physical activity outcome at the 5% two-sided significance level. This calculation was undertaken in Stata V.13 using the cluster sampsi command, and assumed a between-group difference of 23 mean counts/min during wear time, SD of 120, dropout rate of 20%, 0.6 correlation between baseline and final measures and an intracluster correlation (ICC) of 0.01. The estimates of mean accelerometer counts per minute were taken from a large sample of accelerometer data.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> The 60 clusters will provide 80% power to detect as significant, at the 5% two-sided significance level, a 30% lower rate of falls in intervention group participants than control participants (IRR=0.67), that is, the primary falls outcome. For this calculation, we used PASS V.14 (Power Analysis and Sample Size) Software (2015, NCSS, LLC, Kaysville, Utah, USA) and coefficients from previous studies: overdispersion in the negative binomial regression model was assumed to be 0.65 based on a previous trial. We assumed: a control group rate of falls of 0.06 per person-month over the follow-up period, as this was the rate in a study of a similar population; a design effect of 1.09 with an ICC of 0.01; and withdrawal of six clusters. An average follow-up period of 11&#x02005;months was used to account for loss to follow-up. This sample size is also expected to be sufficient to detect between-condition differences in the order of 10&#x02013;15% for the secondary outcome measures.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Data management</title><p>Participant data will be collected by written survey questionnaires posted to participants, and by face-to-face physical assessments for those participants allocated to the physical activity/fall prevention intervention. To ensure confidentiality, the final dataset will contain reidentifiable information only. Demographic information linking the participant to the data will be stored on a separate file. All data will be entered onto a password protected database and maintained on a firewall protected local network server at The George Institute for Global Health. Paper files will be stored in a locked filing cabinet in the Chief Investigators office. Access to all data will be limited to authorised study staff.

It will provide rigorous direct evidence about the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a healthy ageing programme targeting falls and inactivity among older people. It will also provide evidence of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a programme involving nutrition information and health coaching for improving eating habits among older people. This trial addresses key knowledge gaps and will enable healthcare funders to decide whether the benefits of these preventive programmes outweigh their costs.</p><p>The results of this trial are likely to translate into tangible benefits for the community in terms of reduced fall-related injuries and the multitude of health problems associated with physical inactivity and poor nutrition, and thus, reduced demand for health and community services. If proven effective, this trial will provide a model for two healthy ageing strategies which could be directly implemented within health services.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Twitter:</bold> Follow Anne Tiedemann at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/AnneTiedemann1">@AnneTiedemann1</ext-link></p></fn><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> AT and CS conceived of the study.
