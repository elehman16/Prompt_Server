The Portuguese intervention was based on early-supported discharge services,<sup><xref rid="bibr7-0269215515627282" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> but had to be adapted to cope with the structural and legal aspects, and the complex and fragmented system of postdischarge rehabilitation in Portugal.</p><p>By the time we started the HOMECARE study, usual care rehabilitation was being provided in convalescence units (rehabilitation units with protocols with the National Network of Long-Term Integrated Care) or outpatient services, which could be operated by public or private organisations.</p><p>In the context of this study the &#x02018;early home-supported discharge (EHSD)&#x02019; service fulfilled most of the features of the consensus description of early-supported discharge services.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-0269215515627282" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> In Portugal, a community-based team of therapists would meet the patient, their informal caregivers and family and the healthcare professionals involved in their rehabilitation at the stroke unit and/or the rehabilitation setting, and collaborate in the development of a home rehabilitation plan for the patient and support the transition to the patient&#x02019;s home. By the time we designed the HOMECARE study, this arrangement was part of the planned allocation of responsibilities and activities for the recently launched National Network of Long-Term Integrated Care, therefore we adapted to what was expected to be the future practice in the country.</p><p>The intervention started in the stroke unit, where the team coordinator at the hospital identified potential patients for the study according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, verified treatment diagnosis and other significant diseases. They also completed the Functional Independence Measure.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-0269215515627282" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Final consensus scoring took place by the third day. They would then inform the patient, and if possible their family, about the study, present the informed consent form and invite their participation. At the same time, they would contact the case manager informing them about a possible admission to the trial and between them they would schedule a visit to the patient, should they finally agree on participating to the study. After obtaining the informed consent, the patient would be randomised.</p><p>Early rehabilitation was provided to all patients as part of the standard care provided by the stroke unit. The EHSD intervention started during their stay at the stroke unit, where the patient and informal caregiver were first met by their assigned EHSD case manager. The EHSD team of therapists included two physiotherapists, two occupational therapists and a psychologist, whose input was selected according to the needs of a particular patient. All received training in the EHSD procedures and all of them filled in forms describing, in detail, the context and the content of each session with patient. The assigned case manager was one of two gerontologists who were included in the study, mainly to help negotiate the fragmented nature of the Portuguese health and social care systems. The case manager met the patient in the stroke unit and scheduled a meeting with the main carer. The case manager was also responsible for the administration of the EHSD team, providing back office help for the therapists and the patients. For patients discharged to their homes, the intervention continued directly after discharge in order to provide a seamless transfer from the hospital to home. This included an individual rehabilitation plan with provision of aids and modifications at home, where economically feasible. For patients discharged to an inpatient rehabilitation setting for further inpatient rehabilitation, contact with the EHSD team was reinitiated when discharge home was planned. Each EHSD team intervention was planned taking into consideration the particular patient&#x02019;s needs and expectations. The EHSD team worked with patients to provide approximately eight home-based training sessions for a maximum of one month (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215515627282">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1-0269215515627282" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Patients&#x02019; pathways to rehabilitation in the HOMECARE and the control groups.</p><p>RNCCI: Rede Nacional de Cuidados Continuados Integrados (National Network of Long-Term Integrated Care); SU: Stroke Unit; CU: Convalescence Unit.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0269215515627282-fig1"/></fig><p>In the EHSD group, patients and carers received education on healthy behaviours and information about stroke, its consequences, how to best participate in rehabilitation and how to find help within their communities. The team provided information and training tailored to the patient&#x02019;s needs; the mix of physiotherapy, occupational therapy and psychology sessions was also adapted to the specific condition of each patient. Rehabilitation was focused on daily activities valued by the patient in their usual context. This was done in order to improve adherence, transfer of effort and adaptation to daily life. The content could include personally meaningful activities (e.g. &#x02018;to paint my nails again&#x02019;, &#x02018;to ride my bike again&#x02019;), personal care, outdoor walking, shopping or leisure activities. Caregivers were trained and made aware of the competencies and ability of the patient and were encouraged to follow their progress.</p><p>Patients in the usual care group were contacted in the stroke unit, introduced to the study and assigned a case manager to ensure they could be tracked after being discharged. They received information from the case manager about services available in the community, but no further specific input was provided. They began their rehabilitation as part of standard care in the stroke unit and then accessed the standard rehabilitation available in the region following discharge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215515627282">Figure 1</xref>). The usual care rehabilitation frequently focused on components of training of impairments, such as ambulatory rehabilitation, with less emphasis on understanding how skills would be transferred into normal living. Access to healthcare professionals was less easy for the usual care group and it was to address questions arising during rehabilitation.</p><p>In the stroke unit, readiness for discharge was assessed by the team of specialists. Frequently a social worker was involved, especially in the case of those discharged directly home. When discharged directly home, most patients would be referred for intensive ambulatory rehabilitation, which would be performed in public units or private clinics. In those cases, predefined packages of sessions were being prescribed and paid by the NHS.</p><p>Those usual care patients who were transferred to a convalescence unit for intensive inpatient rehabilitation would be automatically prescribed a first package of 30&#x02009;days in a unit of the National Network of Long-Term Integrated Care paid by the NHS. There was no incentive for these units to discharge patients earlier. In the convalescence units, readiness for discharge was also assessed by a team of specialists. Informal caregiver and/or family members of the patient would be involved and a meeting held with care professionals. The patient could be discharged either home with or without prescription of further ambulatory rehabilitation, prescribed more inpatient rehabilitation in the convalescence unit or discharged to long-term care unit, where care would be mostly of a social nature.</p><p>The aim of the study in Portugal was not so much to help discharge the patients in the study group earlier from the convalesce units, but try to avoid prolonged admission in convalescent units or packages of NHS-supported ambulatory rehabilitation while guaranteeing rehabilitation and re-adaptation to home conditions and social activities and life.</p></sec><sec id="section15-0269215515627282"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome of the study was independence in physical and cognitive activities as assessed by FIM,<sup><xref rid="bibr17-0269215515627282" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> which was recorded at admission and discharge from the stroke unit and at two and six months after randomisation.</p><p>No standard recommendation is available about the level required for inpatient rehabilitation.

the convalescence units, the mean total FIM at baseline and discharge from the SU of patients lost to follow-up, and the total FIM and FAI (score), by group. All values are very similar between the two groups.

There were no statistically significant differences between the EHSD and the usual care groups in the average FIM scores measured at the four assessment points, nor in the average FAI scores at the baseline and six months. This result is in line with some other studies.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-0269215515627282" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> However, the number of individuals with a low FIM score (equal or lower than 60 points) at follow-up tended to be higher in the control group, which may support the efficacy of the EHSD intervention. We should acknowledge that the loss of patients to follow-up could have influenced this result. However, this result was also in line with the perceptions of the case managers that followed all the participants from their admission to the stroke unit.</p><p>The intervention of the EHSD team professionals could plausibly have produced improved results. First, after discharge, they sought to help patients to adapt to daily living routines at home, outside activities and local condition. This included finding help in the community, dealing with bouts of depression and lack of motivation to adhere to a rehabilitation routine, and providing information to informal carers and family members. Second, for those patients discharged home from the stroke unit for a few days while awaiting a place in an inpatient rehabilitation unit, the EHSD team could have played a role in their recovering and future functionality, providing therapy at home during those critical days and helping preserving their rehabilitation capacities.</p><p>The weaknesses of our study are that we lost patients to follow-up with some loss of power but also a disruption of the planned intention-to-treat analysis. We have tried to account for this as much as possible in the analysis. Also the quality of data collected regarding ambulatory rehabilitation was variable, what undermined its usefulness.</p><p>The strengths of our trial are that we recruited a substantial number of patients and used a secure randomisation system to allocate treatment. We have also applied the intervention in a flexible manner to reflect the realities of healthcare in Portugal.</p><p>The HOMECARE trial can be considered a complex intervention and in such cases the use of a single outcome measure might be problematic.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-0269215515627282" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> The use of death as poor outcome as in other studies would also be questionable. In fact, all deaths in this trial were owing to unfortunate developments of comorbidities already present by the time of the randomisation. Using the FAI raised some challenges. The scale complements the FIM well in many aspects, but a number of problems arose with items that were sensitive to gender or culture, in particular those assessing ability to carry out home tasks. For example, it was common for males still active in the labour market by the time they suffered stroke to report they performed a number of home tasks after discharge they had not performed before stroke. We found that this was simply because they were at home alone while their partners/family were at work, not owing to a change in their condition. Therefore, we have analysed FIM distributions at the several assessment points in detail and computed the number of patients with FIM below a threshold of 60 points. However, the threshold was not defined a priori and should be considered exploratory.</p><p>More research work is needed in Southern European countries, whenever possible with a larger number of participants. Such studies will have to deal with the complex healthcare pathways in different countries and the lack of integrated information systems. This situation represents an enormous challenge to those researching conditions that cross the boundaries of several organisations, public and private, belonging to health and social care systems.</p><p>Despite the identified pitfalls and challenges faced during the four years of this study, including preparation of the trial, its implementation in the field and respective data handling and analysis, a number of positive outcomes were achieved. The HOMECARE trial represents the first controlled trial of stroke services in Portugal. The study was adapted to local health and social care services. For the first time, we report the experience of using case managers in Portugal, allowing a comprehensive understanding of all aspects related to an episode of stroke. This also helped to coordinate the work of community-based homecare therapists, to support patients in aspects not covered by traditional healthcare providers and to integrate information from providers in different sectors, such as health and social care, informal caregivers and patient transportation services.</p><p>Results from the HOMECARE study cannot be generalised easily across countries, but all above aspects represent valuable knowledge that might be used, not only in similar studies, but when designing policies, guidelines and working procedures, especially those involving multiple service providers and complex pathways, crossing over a number of sectors.</p><p>The research study also shows that it is possible and probably desirable to implement EHSD procedures in very complex realities, calling for more of such studies in settings outside the UK and Scandinavia.</p><boxed-text id="boxed-text1-0269215515627282" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Clinical messages</title></caption><list list-type="bullet" id="list1-0269215515627282"><list-item><p>Implementing an early home-supported discharge (EHSD) service was feasible in Portugal.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Mean disability scores did not differ significantly at six month follow-up.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Mean length of stay did not differ, but fewer EHSD patients received inpatient rehabilitation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The use of case managers allowed a more complete understanding of the patient pathway.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text></sec></body><back><ack><p>We acknowledge the contributions of other members of the project group for their efforts in design, randomisation, training the patients at home and data collection.</p><p>
