Anesthetic technique and drug choice can interact with the cellular immune system and affect long-term outcome.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Nearly 40% of postoperative breast surgery patients experience significant acute postoperative pain, with a pain score above 5, using numeric rating scale (NRS) reflecting the inadequacy of conventional pain management.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Opioid analgesics continue to play an important role in the acute treatment of moderate to severe pain in the early postoperative period. However, newer nonopioid drugs such as dexmedetomidine are increasingly being used as adjuvant during perioperative period to facilitate the recovery process after surgery because of their anesthetic and analgesic-sparing effects, their ability to reduce postoperative dynamic pain and having no opioid-related side-effects (gastrointestinal and bladder dysfunction, respiratory depression).[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Recent studies have evaluated that opioid administration both perioperative and chronic, has been shown to suppress cell mediated and humoral immunity.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Opioids use can cause an overall increase in proliferation and migration of cell lines of adenocarcinoma of breast but yet no such association has been seen with dexmedetomidine.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Hence, these days narcotic less anesthetic techniques are being advocated for breast cancer surgeries.</p><p>Comparison of dexmedetomidine and fentanyl has been successfully used in various surgical settings, but a comprehensive comparison of intraoperative use of dexmedetomidine and fentanyl anesthesia in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery has not been done yet. The study was conducted with the aim to assess the efficacy of dexmedetomidine as a suitable alternative to opioids (fentanyl) in breast cancer surgery patients in regard to its, hemodynamic stability, inhalational agent requirements, postoperative analgesic requirements, and recovery profile. We hypothesized that use of intravenous (IV) dexmedtomidine can replace fentanyl (opioids) in breast cancer surgeries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>After obtaining approval from the Institutional Ethical Committee and informed consent, a total of sixty female patients of physical status American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Class I and II with age group between 18 and 75 years scheduled for breast cancer surgeries (breast conservative surgeries, mastectomies without flap reconstruction, modified radical mastectomies with or without axillary dissection) were enrolled in the study. Patients with any known allergy to study drugs, on chronic analgesic medication, opioids or substance abuse, ASA Class III or IV, obesity (body mass index [BMI] &#x0003e;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), neurological or psychiatric disease, cardiorespiratory disease, renal disease, hepatic disease, and refusal were excluded from the study.</p><p>The study was designed as a prospective, randomized, and double-blind controlled trial. The patients, investigators as well as attending anesthesiologist were blinded to randomization schedule. The drug was prepared by the anesthetist who was not part of the study. Total volume of both the drugs prepared was 50 ml each. Drugs were prepared such that concentration of fentanyl was 8 &#x003bc;g/ml and dexmedetomidine was 4 &#x003bc;g/ml.</p><p>On the day of surgery in operation-theater after confirming preanesthetic checkup with fasting status and explaining NRS, routine monitors such as an electrocardiogram (ECG), pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>), and noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) were attached. The Bispectral Index (BIS) electrodes were also attached for BIS monitoring during study. An 18-gauge IV cannula was secured and IV fluid was started. The patients were randomly allocated using random table assignment to one of the following groups:</p><p>

</p><p>During the period of loading dose of the study drug, hemodynamic parameters at 0, 5, and 10 min (from the start of infusion) were noted. Supplemental oxygen through nasal prong was supplied during the loading dose period.</p><p>After loading dose of study drugs, induction of anesthesia was carried out with injection propofol 2 mg/kg in both the groups. Time taken to reach BIS of 50 was noted. Tracheal intubation was carried out using appropriate size of cuffed endotracheal tube with neuromuscular blockade using injection atracurium in doses of 0.5 mg/kg. Hemodynamic parameters such as heart rate (HR), SpO<sub>2,</sub> and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were noted during induction and intubation and thereafter every 5 min till extubation. The maintenance of anesthesia was done with nitrous oxide 60% and oxygen 40% with desflurane maintaining BIS of 45&#x02013;55. End-tidal desflurane concentration (EtDes) and minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of desflurane were monitored and recorded every 5 min. Additional doses of injection atracurium 0.1 mg/kg boluses were given as per requirement. IV diclofenac 1 mg/kg was given to all patients intraoperatively. IV paracetamol 1 g was given at the time of skin suturing.</p><p>After completion of surgery, the infusion of fentanyl/dexmedetomidine was stopped along with desflurane and nitrous oxide. Patient was reversed using mixture of neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and glycopyrolate 0.01 mg/kg and trachea was extubated once the extubation criteria were met.</p><p>Following time points (starting from the time of initiation of reversal and discontinuation of desflurane) were noted (1) time to respond to verbal commands, (2) time to extubation, and (3) time for orientation (to time, place, and person).</p><p>After extubation, all the patients were shifted to postanesthesia care unit (PACU). NIBP, ECG, and SpO<sub>2</sub> monitoring were continued. In PACU pain was assessed using NRS immediately after orientation, at 1, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h. If score was &#x0003e;3/10, rescue analgesia in the form of tramadol 1 mg/kg IV was instituted and injection pethidine 10 mg IV bolus up to 50 mg was given as the second rescue analgesia. Requirements of tramadol and pethidine (if any) were also noted in the postoperative period.</p><p>Patients were assessed in the PACU with Modified Aldorete Postanesthesia Recovery Scoring System and were discharged from PACU when score of 10 was achieved.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Time to discharge from PACU was noted.

General anesthesia, almost always combining IV and inhalational agents, is the technique commonly used for breast cancer surgeries. Other controversial effects of general anesthesia in oncologic patients are related with depression of the immune system.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>After reviewing the literature, we found that no satisfactory studies have reported any equipotent doses of fentanyl and dexmedetomidine. Fentanyl in a loading dose of 2&#x02013;6 &#x003bc;g/kg along with any sedative-hypnotic and a muscle relaxant has been advised for induction of anesthesia followed by continuous infusion of 0.5&#x02013;5 &#x003bc;g/kg/h for the maintenance of anesthesia and analgesia. IV infusion of dexmedetomidine is commonly initiated with a 1 &#x003bc;g/kg loading dose, administered over 10 min, followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.2&#x02013;0.7 &#x003bc;g/kg/h.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Hence, we employed the minimum doses of fentanyl (2 &#x003bc;g/kg bolus dose followed by 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg/h) and dexmedetomidine (1 &#x003bc;g/kg bolus dose followed by 0.25 &#x003bc;g/kg/h) in this study. The rate of two infusions were kept constant during the intraoperative period and depth of anesthesia was maintained by maintaining BIS of 50, titrating the EtDes concentrations and MAC.</p><p>In this study, dexmedetomidine group showed that HR and MAP decreases after the loading dose (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and stabilized thereafter during the intraoperative period to within 20% of the baseline values. There was no significant increase in HR and MAP in response to intubation, skin incision and extubation in dexmedetomidine group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). Both these effects are presumably caused by an inhibition of central sympathetic outflow that overrides the direct effects of dexmedetomidine on the vasculature, thus attenuating the stress induced sympathoadrenal response to intubation, during skin excision, extubation and during emergence from anesthesia. The results were consistent with the study of Talke <italic>et al</italic>., where they demonstrated that dexmedetomidine attenuates increase in HR and plasma nor-epinephrine levels observed during emergence from anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In fentanyl group, there was a significant increase in HR and MAP in response to intubation and extubation (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). The findings were confirmed by various studies which concluded that dexmedetomidine is more effective in attenuating hemodynamic pressor responses to laryngoscopy, intubation, and extubation.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Mean intraoperative HR and MAP was lower in dexmedetomidine group compared to fentanyl group and dexmedetomidine was seen to provide better perioperative hemodynamics as in earlier studies.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>This study showed that after the loading dose of the drug, the time taken for BIS awake to decrease to BIS 50 on induction with propofol was significantly reduced in dexmedetomidine group compared to fentanyl group. This may be due to sedative and hypnotic properties of dexmedetomidine as shown by Turgut <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Anesthetic&#x02013;sparing effect of dexmedetomidine was also observed by decreased EtDes concentrations and decreased MAC requirements in dexmedetomidine group in our study.

Hence, we used BIS to measure the depth of anesthesia and thereby eliminating the bias of evaluation by hemodynamic parameters as in earlier studies. Patel <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated a 21.5% decrease in end tidal sevoflurane using dexmedetomidine as a sole analgesic using entropy for monitoring depth of anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Using BIS index to assess the depth of anesthesia, Magalh&#x000e3;es <italic>et al</italic>. showed decreased requirement of sevoflurane with continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine and fentanyl during general anesthesia, however, we found decrease in the desflurane requirements only in dexmetedomidine group.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Various studies have shown a significant decrease in the use of narcotics and respiratory suppression when dexmedetomidine is used for acute pain management.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The narcotic sparing effects of dexmedetomidine were evident both intraoperatively (low inhalational agent requirements) and postoperatively (lower total dose of self-administered PCA morphine). However, we did not find significant difference in quantity of rescue analgesic required in both the groups. Although, the infusions were discontinued at the end of the surgery, it is likely that analgesic sparing properties of both the drugs persisted in the recovery period as half-life of both the drugs is approximately 2&#x02013;3 h. In our study, the time to first rescue analgesic dose (minutes) and postoperative pain scores were comparable in both the groups which were consistent with the study of Manaa <italic>et al</italic>., where they demonstrated that time for the first analgesic dose was significant shorter in placebo group compared with fentanyl and dexmedetomidine group, where it was similar.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>As for emergence characteristics our study showed an advantage with dexmedetomidine over fentanyl. The time to respond to verbal commands, time to extubation and time for orientation was lower in dexmedetomidine group and it might be because of lower volatile anesthetic agent requirement. Many studies comparing dexmedetomidine with placebo have demonstrated better recovery profile and faster recovery in dexmedetomidine group.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>PACU discharge time was also similar in both the groups in our study and it was consistent with result of Turgut <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Many studies have found that intraoperative fentanyl infusion causes frequent postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) compared with dexmedetomidine.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Although, in our study PONV was seen in four patients in fentanyl group and none in dexmedetomidine group, but this difference was not statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>So, it was found that dexmedetomidine provides better hemodynamic stability, helps attenuating pressor responses during laryngoscopy, intubation and extubation in comparison to fentanyl and has anesthetic sparing effects. Use of dexmedetomidine also allows early cognitive recovery, hastening the recovery of the patient and provides similar quality of analgesia as provided by fentanyl.</p><p>To conclude, dexmedetomidine can be used as a suitable alternative to opioids (fentanyl) for breast cancer surgeries (Breast Conservation Surgery and Modified Radical Mastectomy).</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>We acknowledge that this manuscript is based on scholary basis and it is registered by National Board of Examination (NBE) under registration number 101-20120-122-105291.</p></ack><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name><name><surname>Cokkinides</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Brawley</surname><given-names>OW</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Cancer screening in the United States, 2009: A review of current American Cancer Society guidelines and issues in cancer screening</article-title><source>CA Cancer J Clin</source><year>2009</year><volume>59</volume><fpage>27</fpage><lpage>41</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19147867</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sessler</surname><given-names>DI</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Long-term consequences of anesthetic management</article-title><source>Anesthesiology</source><year>2009</year><volume>111</volume><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>4</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19512884</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Poleshuck</surname><given-names>EL</given-names></name><name><surname>Katz</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Andrus</surname><given-names>CH</given-names></name><name><surname>Hogan</surname><given-names>LA</given-names></name><name><surname>Jung</surname><given-names>BF</given-names></name><name><surname>Kulick</surname><given-names>DI</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Risk factors for chronic pain following breast cancer surgery: A prospective study</article-title><source>J Pain</source><year>2006</year><volume>7</volume><fpage>626</fpage><lpage>34</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16942948</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Grewal</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Dexmedetomidine: New avenues</article-title><source>J Anaesthesiol Clin Pharmacol</source><year>2011</year><volume>27</volume><fpage>297</fpage><lpage>302</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21897496</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sessler</surname><given-names>DI</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Does regional analgesia reduce the risk of cancer recurrence?
