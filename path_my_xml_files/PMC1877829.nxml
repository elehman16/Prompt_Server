A physiologic pacing modality should preserve a correct atrio-ventricular and interventricular synchronization. This can be obtained through biventricular pacing, left ventricular pacing, or from alternative right ventricular pacing sites.</p><p>Direct His Bundle Pacing (DHBP) was documented as reliable and effective for preventing the desynchronization and negative effects of right ventricular apical pacing.  It is, however, a complex method that requires longer average implant times, cannot be carried out on all patients and presents high pacing thresholds. On the contrary, the parahisian pacing, with simpler feasibility and reliability criteria, seems to guarantee an early invasion of the His-Purkinje conduction system, with a physiological ventricular activation, very similar to the one that can be obtained with direct His bundle pacing.</p><p>We present our experience on 68 patients who underwent a permanent right ventricular pacing in hisian/parahisian region, for advanced AV block and narrow QRS.  In the first 17 patients we performed a double-blind randomized controlled study, with two 6-months cross-over periods in parahisian and apical pacing, documenting a significant improvement of NYHA class, exercise tolerance, quality of life score, mitral and tricuspidal regurgitation degree, and interventricular mechanical delay. In the  subsequent 51 patients, in a mean follow of 21 months/patient,  the pacing threshold remained stable (0.7&#x000b1;0.5 V implant; 0.9&#x000b1;0.7 V follow-up; p=0.08). The ejection fraction maintained medium-long term stable values, confirming the fact that the parahisian pacing can prevent deterioration of the left ventricular function.</p><p>Parahisian pacing, therefore, has proven to be a reliable method, easy to apply and effective in preventing the negative effects induced by non-physiological right ventricular apical pacing.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>direct hisian pacing</kwd><kwd>parahisian pacing</kwd><kwd>resynchronization therapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="" id="s1"><title>Negative effects of right ventricular apical pacing</title><p>Right Ventricular Apical (RVA) stimulation has given clinical benefits and has resulted in a considerable improvement in the symptoms and life expectancy of millions of patients suffering from chronic or paroxysmal disorder of the cardiac electric excito-conduction (atrio-ventricular blocks and/or sinus node disease).</p><p>In any case,  similar to the negative hemodynamic and clinical effects tied to the presence of spontaneous left bundle branch block, new data has emerged that show the presence of a left bundle branch type of activation induced by RVA pacing can have negative effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>].</p><p>The negative effects of RVA pacing can be summed up as follows:
      <list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>- electric and mechanical left ventricular asynchrony;</p></list-item><list-item><p>- negative remodeling of the left ventricular chamber;</p></list-item><list-item><p>- alterations of the myocardial histopathology;</p></list-item><list-item><p>- systolic and diastolic left ventricular dysfunction;</p></list-item><list-item><p>- heart failure;</p></list-item><list-item><p>- regional myocardial and kinetic perfusion defect;</p></list-item><list-item><p>- functional mitral regurgitation;</p></list-item><list-item><p>- left atrial dilation;</p></list-item><list-item><p>- increased risk of atrial fibrillation;</p></list-item><list-item><p>- induction of spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias;</p></list-item><list-item><p>- hyperactivation of the sympathetic nervous system.</p></list-item></list></p><p>During the isovolumetric contraction phase induced by the right pacing, there is notable variability in the changes in the muscular fiber lengths, with a rapid shortening  of the fibers near the pacing site, and a marked pulling of the fibers in the more remote regions. As a consequence, the energy generated by the premature activated fibers are dissipated by the internal resistance offered by the fibers not yet activated, causing regional differences in the mechanical work carried out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. The final result is that the isovolumetric contraction lasts longer at the expense of the ventricular ejection time.  Due to these differences in the mechanical work of the left ventricular walls during RVA pacing, there is a redistribution of the cardiac mass, with a thinning of the premature paced regions and a thickening of those activated later.  Therefore, asynchronous activation can result in long term adaptations to the myocardium, defined as remodeling and consistent in ventricular dilation and asymmetric hypertrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>].</p><p>The asymmetry of the left ventricular contraction induced by RVA pacing also causes an abrupt change in the temporal sequence of activation of the papillary muscles supporting the mitralic valve apparatus, with loss of coaptation of the valvular leaflets: that determines mitralic regurgitation (MR) and can favour atrial fibrillation and cardiac failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>].</p><p>Several recent studies have showed the negative clinical consequences caused by RVA pacing:   CTOPP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], Danish Study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], DAVID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], MOST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. In all these trials, when the percentage of RVA pacing, obtained from the conventional apical site, was high (&#x0003e;40%), the incidence of atrial fibrillation increased, along with heart failure, hospitalizations and even death. Also in a sub-study of the MADIT II trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], that had shown how an implantable defibrillator could prevent sudden death in high risk patients, it was observed that the percentage of RVA pacing was an independent predictor of bad prognosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="" id="s2"><title>Alternative sites of ventricular pacing</title><p>Based on the results of various clinical studies it is therefore clear that a physiologic pacing modality should preserve a correct atrio-ventricular activation and maintain or re-establish a correct ventricular synchronization.</p><p>The most simple solution to avoid right ventricular pacing is to implant an AAI pacemaker in patients with intact atrio-ventricular and intraventricular conduction.  This solution, however, has always been scarcely applied because of the unjustified fear of a late atrio-ventricular block. An alternative solution is to implant a dual chamber device with an atrial and a ventricular lead, and to use dedicated algorithms that limit as much as possible the RVA pacing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>].</p><p>When, however, ventricular pacing is necessary in a permanent way or for long periods of time, physiologic sites of pacing should be applied in order to prevent ventricular desynchronization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>].</p><p>This can be obtained through biventricular pacing, left ventricular pacing or pacing from alternative sites of the right ventricle.</p><p>In addition to the important randomized trials regarding the evaluation of cardiac resynchronization therapy (PATH-CHF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], MUSTIC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], MIRACLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], COMPANION [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], CARE-HF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]), that showed a functional improvement and higher survival rates in patients with refractory heart failure and left bundle branch block, various studies were also carried out to compare biventricular pacing and conventional  RVA pacing. These studies showed how resynchronization therapy leads to an improvement in the hemodynamic parameters and systolic functioning, a reduction in mitralic regurgitation and diameter of the left ventricle, a reduction in the activity of the sympathetic nervous system, with respect to the RVA pacing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>].</p><p>The results of some short and medium term studies indicate how the left ventricular pacing alone can give hemodynamic and clinical benefits to patients with a reduction in systolic functions and left ventricular desynchronization.  It is still not clear what type of mechanism allows the left ventricular pacing alone to give hemodynamic benefits:  it has been hypothesized that the mechanism could be a fusion mechanism with the electric activity coming from the atrio-ventricular node [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>].</p><p>In alternative to biventricular pacing, ventricular pacing site from the Right Ventricular Outflow Tract (RVOT) has been studied by various authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. Recently, De Cock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>] conducted a metanalysis of nine prospective, but not randomized, studies: the hemodynamic effects in 217 patients undergoing RVOT pacing show a modest hemodynamic benefit with respect to RVA pacing.  In addition, even the ROVA study,  the only randomized study comparing RVOT with RVA pacing, gave disappointing results on the quality of life.</p><p>A further evolution of RVOT pacing is the contemporaneous bifocal pacing of the apex and RVOT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]; even in this case, however, the results were contrasting and still being evaluated with randomized studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="" id="s3"><title>Direct His bundle pacing and parahisian pacing</title><p>Direct His Bundle Pacing (DHBP) was described for the first time in 1967 by Scherlag [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>], with an epimyocardial approach in dogs undergoing open chest surgery, through the positioning of a catheter pacing the His bundle. A short while later, in 1968, the same author showed the possibility of DHBP in the animal model, with an endocardial approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. In 1970, Narula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>] showed how it was possible to obtain DHBP in man, using a multipolar catheter positioned on the atrio-ventricular junction, above the septal leaflet of the tricuspid. Nevertheless, the non-selective parahisian pacing of the atrium or ventricle and the instability of the catheter during cardiac contraction required additional approaches for a permanent type of implant. In 1992, Karpawich [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>], in dogs undergoing open chest surgery, described a new approach for the permanent pacing of the His bundle by positioning a screw catheter on the interatrial septum above the tricuspid valve.  In the years that followed, other authors evaluated the permanent pacing of the His bundle as alternative to apical pacing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>].</p><p>In 2000, Deshmukh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>] presented a case history of patients with permanent pacing of the His bundle, documenting the reliability and effectiveness of this type of pacing after ablation of the atrio-ventricular junction: DHBP was obtained in 12/18 patients with chronic atrial fibrillation,  left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) &#x0003c; 40% and  QRS &#x0003c; 120 ms. After a follow-up period of  23 &#x000b1; 8 months, the pacing thresholds and the QRS duration were stable; there was also an improvement in the ecocardiographic indexes and EF.  It was not clear, however, if the obtained hemodynamic benefits were referred to the site of pacing or to a more stable control of the average ventricular frequency after the ablate and pace procedure.</p><p>In 2004, the same author [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>] presented a wider study population of 54 patients, suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy with  EF 23 &#x000b1;11%, persistent atrial fibrillation and  QRS &#x0003c; 120ms, in which DHBP was obtained in 36/54 patients (66%):  after a follow-up of 42 months, 29 patients were still alive and an improvement of the ejection fraction and clinical and hemodynamic parameters of left ventricular functioning was obtained.</p><p>This paper has allowed up to better clear up the questions relative to the pacing site; the parameters that allow for the direct pacing of the His bundle were defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]:

Recently, Zanon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>] published a study showing how the DHBP can be obtained in a more reliable manner through the use of a new catheter (Select Secure 3830, Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota), applied at the pacing site from the outside through a steerable introducer (Select Site, Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota). The results obtained showed how in 24/26 patients a direct stable pacing of the His bundle was obtained. The time needed to reach the His bundle with the permanent catheter varied, however, from 2 to 60 minutes, and approximately 3.8 &#x000b1; 2.5 attempts were required.  The acute pacing threshold was  2.3 &#x000b1; 1 V (0.5 ms) and the endocardial detected potential was  2.9 &#x000b1; 2 mV.</p><p>These studies have shown how the permanent pacing of the His bundle is a reliable and effective method for preventing the desynchronization and negative effects of RVA pacing.  It remains, however, a complex method that requires longer average implant times, cannot be carried out on all patients and presents high pacing thresholds.  There is also the theoretical risk of His bundle damaging and blocking, induced by the trauma and injury caused by the catheter screw-in lead.</p><p>The parahisian pacing, with simpler feasibility and reliability criteria seems to guarantee, however, an early invasion of the His-Purkinje conduction system with a physiological ventricular activation, very similar to the one that can be obtained with direct His bundle pacing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Recently, Laske [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>] assessed the left ventricular activation in animals (pigs) during pacing from various zones of the interventricular septum.  During intrinsic activation with pacing from the right atrium, activation spreads along the septum and rapidly reaches the left apical ventricular region, continues along the lateral wall and finally reaches the postero-lateral region. Even during pacing from the parahisian region, the activation is the same as the intrinsic activation: it originates from the high septum and from the posterior region of the left ventricle, and then activates the anterior wall, the septum and the left ventricular apex.</p><p>Victor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>] has recently compared the right apical pacing and the pacing of the interventricular septum in 28 patients with permanent atrial fibrillation and post-ablation atrial-ventricular block of the AV node. Septal pacing was associated with  a shorter QRS (145 &#x000b1; 4ms vs 170 &#x000b1; 4 ms with RVA pacing; p &#x0003c; 0,01) and a normal cardiac electric axis  (40&#x000b0; &#x000b1; 10&#x000b0; vs -71&#x000b0; &#x000b1; 4&#x000b0;, p&#x0003c; 0,01). The EF worsened with RVA pacing with respect to the septal pacing only in patients with EF &#x0003c; 45%, while in patients with EF &#x0003e; 45% there were no differences in the two pacing modalities.</p><p>The correct criteria for the realization of parahisian pacing could be [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]:

A second conventional bipolar lead was placed on the tip of the right ventricle. The septal and the apical catheters were then connected respectively to the "atrial" and "ventricular" channel of a pacemaker, programmed in "DDDR" modality  with "short" atrio-ventricular delay (90 ms), so that: if the hisian/parahisian pacing ("atrial" channel) was effective, the next apical ventricular pacing ("ventricular" channel) was inhibited or in any case fell in the refractory period; on the contrary, if the hisian/parahisian pacing was ineffective, the ventricular pacing was guaranteed by the conventional back up apical pacing.</p><p>After the institutional ethics committee approval and written informed consent, these patients were subject to a double-blind randomized controlled study in two 6-month periods: a) with RVA pacing; b) with hisian/parahisian pacing.

In one patient, with a DHBP, the catheter in the hisian site was deactivated at 31 month of follow up because of an increase in the pacing threshold  (&#x0003e; 5 V, 1 ms). In one patient affected by valvular cardiopathy with EF 35%,  who had already undergone upgrading from apical pacing to parahisian pacing,  an ICD was implanted following an episode of fainting with Holter documentation of sustained ventricular tachycardia: parahisian pacing was maintained.</p><p>In the medium-long term follow-up, patients with parahisian pacing showed the same QRS duration as the value recorded at the implant. The pacing threshold in parahisian region did not have any significant variations, with values that remained with acceptable safety margins  (0.7&#x000b1;0.5 V implant; 0.9&#x000b1;0.7 V follow-up; p=0.08).</p><p>The prolonged parahisian pacing led to an improvement in the NYHA functional class and the quality of life (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>).  Exercise performances, evaluated with the 6-minute walk test, even with a trend that shows an increase in average values, did not reach values with statistically significant differences (342&#x000b1;106 m upon enrollment; 374&#x000b1;79 m in the follow-up; p = 0.12). These results are probably tied to the progression of the underlying cardiopathy and the associated pathologies that could arise during a prolonged follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>].</p><p>The EF maintained medium-long term values (51 &#x000b1; 10%) superimposable to enrollment values  (51 &#x000b1; 11%) (p=0.5), confirming the fact that the parahisian pacing can prevent deterioration of the left ventricular function, that can, on the other hand, be accelerated by the RVA pacing. Mitral regurgitation (1.6 &#x000b1; 0.8 enrollment; 1.1 &#x000b1; 0.8 follow-up; p &#x0003c; 0.05) and tricuspid regurgitation (1.4 &#x000b1; 0.9 enrollment; 1.2 &#x000b1; 0.8 follow-up; p=0.23) showed improvement after parahisian pacing, with values that reach statistic significance only for the mitral insufficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="" id="s5"><title>Discussion</title><p>The main purpose of permanent cardiac electrostimulation  is to maintain an adequate cardiac rhythm, trying to restore the physiology of the normal excito-conductive physiology of the heart as much as possible. Up until now,  importance had been given to two elements that were considered fundamental for physiological pacing: maintenance of the atrioventricular sequence and the rate-responsive function. Pacemakers, therefore, were considered "physiological".</p><p>Conventional RVA pacing induces, however, a desynchronization between right and left ventricles. The problem can clinically be of little importance in the presence of a structurally normal heart.  In case of manifest or latent left ventricular dysfunction, this anomalous contraction sequence can condition negative remodeling, worsen the left ventricular function and induce or aggravate heart failure.</p><p>Truly physiological pacing, therefore, must:
      <list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>- maintain the correct stimulation-contraction sequence between atria and ventricles;</p></list-item><list-item><p>-contraction sequence between atria and ventricles;</p></list-item><list-item><p>- favour the increase of the cardiac frequency according to the metabolic needs;</p></list-item><list-item><p>- maintain the synchrony between right and left ventricle. </p></list-item></list></p><p>In case of spontaneous electromechanical desynchronization with left bundle block, the biventricular pacing has widely shown to be effective in improving the cardiac function and the quality of life of the patients.</p><p>In presence of an atrioventricular block, but with electric intraventricular conduction preserved, pacing must be as physiological as possible. Even if the biventricular pacing guarantees these physiological characteristics, His bundle pacing can be an effective alternative, using the His-Purkinje system to maintain the intraventricular conduction activated in a preferential way.</p><p>Direct His bundle pacing is, however, a complex method, that required longer implant times: it is characterized by high pacing thresholds and presents the theoretical risk of a His bundle block, induced by the trauma and by the lesion caused by the catheter screw.</p><p>Our experience has led us to believe that parahisian pacing can be obtained in a simpler and reliable way:  in this case, the high muscular part of the intraventricular septum is activated, while at the same time the hisian conduction axis is penetrated.  As proof of this fact,  the QRS remains rather narrow (120-130 ms) and with electric axis concordant with the non-paced spontaneous QRS.</p><p>The improvement in the functional and hemodynamic parameters that can be obtained with the parahisian pacing with respect to  conventional right apical pacing in patients affected by chronic atrial fibrillation and who have undergone ablation of the AV node, has been shown by our experience.  These results seem to be modulated by the left ventricular function. When the patients were stratified according to the ejection fraction (EF &#x0003e; 52% versus EF &#x0003c; 52%), various changes in the left ventricular volumes were observed.  When the pump function was depressed, physiological parahisian pacing guaranteed the best results with a more evident reduction of left ventricular telediastolic and telesystolic volumes; when, on the other hand, left ventricular function was normal, volumetric differences obtained with the two types of pacing were less evident. In addition, the degree of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation improved significantly only with the parahisian pacing, thus suggesting that the clinical and hemodynamic improvements obtained with this pacing site are probably mediated by the improvement of the interventricular desynchronization, that was further shown by the reduction in the interventricular mechanical delay, associated with the narrowing of the QRS.</p><p>The long-term follow-up results of patients with parahisian pacing confirm a stable improvement of the functional class and quality of life with respect to the same at enrollment,  and of exercise tolerance too. These results show how functional data continues to improve, maintaining clinical stability during long-term follow-up. In spite of a natural progression of the underlying cardiopathy, these benefits are due to the maintaining of a synchronous activation sequence between the two ventricles, in addition to the correction of the underlying arrhythmia obtained by the pacing (correct atrioventricular activation sequence and regularization of the cardiac frequency). Even the ejection fraction maintains good values, and the degree of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation continues to improve.</p><p>Parahisian pacing, therefore, has proven to be a reliable method, easy to apply and effective in preventing the negative effects induced by non-physiological right ventricular apical pacing. The use of this method of physiological pacing as first choice in patients with initial left ventricular dysfunction, preserved intraventricular conduction and the need for a high percentage of ventricular pacing is, therefore, justified.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="R1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group
