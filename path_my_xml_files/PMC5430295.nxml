<bold>Background.</bold> Experimental studies suggest that mechanical cell washing to remove pro-inflammatory components that accumulate in the supernatant of stored donor red blood cells (RBCs) might reduce inflammation and organ injury in transfused patients.</p><p>
<bold>Methods.</bold> Cardiac surgery patients at increased risk of large-volume RBC transfusion were eligible. Participants were randomized to receive either mechanically washed allogenic RBCs or standard care RBCs. The primary outcome was serum interleukin-8 measured at baseline and at four postsurgery time points. A mechanism substudy evaluated the effects of washing on stored RBCs <italic>in vitro</italic> and on markers of platelet, leucocyte, and endothelial activation in trial subjects.</p><p>
<bold>Results.</bold> Sixty adult cardiac surgery patients at three UK cardiac centres were enrolled between September 2013 and March 2015. Subjects received a median of 3.5 (interquartile range 2&#x02013;5.5) RBC units, stored for a mean of 21 (<sc>sd</sc> 5.2)&#x000a0;days, within 48&#x02009;h of surgery. Mechanical washing reduced concentrations of RBC-derived microvesicles but increased cell-free haemoglobin concentrations in RBC supernatant relative to standard care RBC supernatant. There was no difference between groups with respect to perioperative serum interleukin-8 values [adjusted mean difference 0.239 (95% confidence intervals &#x02212;0.231, 0.709), <italic>P</italic>=0.318] or concentrations of plasma RBC microvesicles, platelet and leucocyte activation, plasma cell-free haemoglobin, endothelial activation, or biomarkers of heart, lung, or kidney injury.</p><p>
<bold>Conclusions.</bold> These results do not support a hypothesis that allogenic red blood cell washing has clinical benefits in cardiac surgery.</p><p>

However, we did not detect differences in measures of oxidative stress in serum, a putative mechanism by which free Hgb damages cells, as measured by protein carbonylation or lipid peroxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="aex083-F5">Fig. 5K and L</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Red blood cell-derived (CD235a-positive) microparticles accumulate progressively in RBC units from the start of storage and are effectively removed by mechanical washing. In the REDWASH trial, however, transfusion of washed RBCs did not reduce plasma concentrations of CD235a-positve microparticles or levels of platelet or leucocyte activation in recipients compared with standard RBCs. Cell-free Hgb also increases in the supernatant of RBC units during storage and is increased by washing. However, in the REDWASH trial there was no difference in plasma free Hgb concentrations or markers of haem/iron metabolism, endothelial activation, or oxidative stress between groups.</p><p>This is the first randomized trial to evaluate the risks and benefits of RBC washing in adults. We recruited a high-risk population of cardiac surgery patients that should in principle have benefited from safer RBC transfusion. Patients in both groups received significant volumes of RBCs, 1000&#x02009;ml, within 48&#x02009;h of surgery and experienced significant morbidity; 86% of patients experienced a composite clinical outcome of death, sepsis, or organ failure. Subjects in the washing group received more RBC units despite similar perioperative levels of blood loss and serial serum haemoglobin concentrations. This is consistent with previous clinical and experimental studies that report loss of 10&#x02013;25% of red cells during mechanical washing.<xref rid="aex083-B6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref><xref rid="aex083-B10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> The chief limitations of the study are the limited power of our observations and the early termination of the main trial. For these reasons, we can neither accept nor refute our primary hypotheses. Furthermore, by chance, there was a difference in baseline eGFR between the groups. These limitations notwithstanding, the randomization generated two groups that received large volumes of washed or unwashed RBCs and, after adjustment for baseline eGFR, demonstrated no difference for any measured biomarker of inflammation or organ injury. On balance, our findings argue against important clinical benefits for RBC washing. The REDWASH trial did not evaluate immunomodulation, and therefore, we are unable to comment on the effects of washing on these processes. The results of a similar trial (NCT02094118) evaluating the clinical efficacy of RBC washing will provide greater insights into these results.</p><p>Experimental work has documented both potential risks and benefits of RBC washing. We have shown that RBC-derived microparticles activate platelets and leucocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, we have shown that mechanical RBC washing in a swine model effectively removes microparticles and attenuates platelet and leucocyte sequestration in lungs and the clinical and histological correlates of transfusion-associated lung injury ( MJ Wozniak, GJ Murphy, unpublished observations). Likewise, we have shown that cell-free Hgb activates endothelial cells by a pathway previously described only in human aortic endothelial cells in the presence of minimally modified low-density lipoprotein.<xref rid="aex083-B17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> The activation is most probably mediated by lipids oxidized by increased concentrations of free Hgb<xref rid="aex083-B18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> that occurs either in the blood bags or after transfusion.<xref rid="aex083-B19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Here, an alternative pathway results in VLA5 (integrin-&#x003b1;5/&#x003b2;1) expression, retention of alternatively spliced CS-1 fibronectin on the surface of endothelial cells, and endothelial cell&#x02013;monocyte interaction.<xref rid="aex083-B20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> In swine, as in humans, RBC washing results in accelerated release of cell-free Hgb, and this results in acute endothelial injury, oxidative stress, and acute kidney injury in experimental subjects (unpublished observations). Studies in human cells have also highlighted potential sublethal damage to RBCs during mechanical washing that could potentially offset any benefits derived from reductions in RBC-derived microparticles.<xref rid="aex083-B21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref></p><p>Our experimental results were not replicated in the REDWASH trial. This could be attributable to differences between species, differences in the time period over which RBCs were transfused, or both, in porcine experiments and trial subjects. Typically, 4 units were transfused during 2&#x02009;h in swine, whereas a similar volume, on average, was transfused during 2 days in the clinical trial. The porcine experiments were also conducted without CPB. These factors might have diminished the clinical benefits of washing; neither microparticle depletion nor the release of free Hgb observed after washing was reflected by differences in plasma microparticle concentrations or cell-free Hgb in subjects or by differences in inflammation and organ injury. Moreover, the peak mean IL-8 concentration in our porcine experiments after transfusion with older stored RBCs was 10&#x02009;pg ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. In the standard care patients in the REDWASH trial, the peak IL-8 concentration was 220&#x02009;pg ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. We speculate that the effects of washing were superseded by greater platelet and leucocyte activation, free Hgb release, and endothelial injury attributable to surgery and CPB.<xref rid="aex083-B22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Alternatively, the mixed risks and benefits from RBC washing might have resulted in no overall difference between trial groups. Manual washing techniques that minimize RBC trauma are unlikely to address this limitation because these are time consuming. Indeed, the delay attendant on bedside washing contributed to protocol non-compliance in the present study. An alternative is RBC rejuvenation.<xref rid="aex083-B23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> This maximizes the benefits of washing by preventing production of microparticles after washing, minimizes risks by preventing RBC damage and free Hgb release, and attenuate transfusion-mediated organ injury in experimental studies (unpublished observations).</p><p>In conclusion, the results of the mechanism substudy of the REDWASH trial did not support our hypothesis that mechanical washing of transfused RBCs would attenuate platelet and leucocyte activation and organ injury in cardiac surgery patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>Conceived the trial and wrote the application for funding (with others): G.J.M.</p><p>Designed the trial: G.J.M., M.J.W., A.H.G.</p><p>Managed the conduct of the trial: W.D., S.K.B., N.B., T.K.</p><p>Managed the data during the trial: W.D., T.K., T.M. </p><p>Laboratory analyses: M.J.W., R.C., M.W., N.S.</p><p>Statistical analyses: T.M., M.N.</p><p>Drafted the report: M.J.W., G.J.M., A.H.G.</p><p>All authors reviewed the report for important intellectual content and approved the final version. </p><p>All authors, external and internal, had full access to all of the data (including statistical reports and tables) and can take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary material</title><p>
