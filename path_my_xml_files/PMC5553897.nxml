In a trial, we previously reported pain improvement after 6-weeks brace use. The pain reduction did not correlate with changes in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) assessed Bone Marrow Lesion volume or static synovial volume.

In a recent randomised controlled trial of brace therapy in persons with symptomatic PFJOA we showed that a flexible sleeve knee brace resulted in a significant improvement in pain after 6&#x000a0;weeks and a reduction in bone marrow lesion (BML) volume in the PFJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The two structures in the knee that are both innervated by nociceptive fibers and reported to be causally related to knee pain are bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and synovitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In the bone, the most prominently assessed abnormality correlated with pain has been bone marrow lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. While hyaline cartilage pathology is the signature feature of osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], this cartilage is not innervated, and it is not clear whether it is a source of pain. The change in pain during the trial was not correlated significantly with change in the BML volume, suggesting other mechanisms explain the pain reduction. Synovial tissue volume decrease has been linked with pain in observational studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], but synovial volume assessed in the trial using static contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) did not shrink with the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Static measures of synovial volume may be less sensitive to pain than measures of synovial perfusion, assessed using dynamic contrast enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) is a technique that utilises repeated imaging sequences of the joint whilst injecting contrast agent systemically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This allows enhancement rates of tissues to be calculated as they are perfused by contrast agent. The rate of tissue enhancement has been shown to be more closely linked to active joint inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) than changes to static tissue volume measures alone, and correlates more strongly with change in pain following intra-articular steroid therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. We have recently shown that in knee OA, intraarticular steroid treatment leads to a major reduction in perfusion of the synovium as shown by DCE-MRI and that this reduction is far better correlated with pain reduction than measures of static synovial volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Since braces may diminish contact stress across the joint, leading to less microscopic damage and perhaps less need for the synovium to clear this debris, we hypothesised that the reduction in pain observed following brace use in our recent trial might be explained by changes in synovitis as assessed using DCE-MRI parameters. We therefore undertook a secondary analysis of the trial findings to examine this question.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p id="Par22">One hundred twenty-six subjects aged 40&#x02013;70&#x000a0;years, recruited from primary and secondary care were randomly allocated to receive a patello-femoral sleeve brace immediately for 6&#x000a0;weeks or no brace. DCE-MRI was performed at both baseline (0&#x000a0;weeks) and at 6&#x000a0;weeks for all subjects. The number of subjects was chosen in advance to provide 80% power to detect an effect of the brace on knee pain (alpha&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05, two sided). Recruitment took place between August 2009 to September 2012 and the trial&#x02019;s main results have been reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The primary structural outcome of the brace trial was bone marrow lesion (BML) volume but pain improvement was not significantly correlated with change in BML volume. Our discovery after intraarticular steroid injection that dynamic changes in synovium during DCE-MRI correlated with pain change led us to ask the question as to whether these dynamic changes in synovial volume explained the pain change in the knee brace study as a secondary analysis of these trial data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Inclusion/exclusion criteria</title><p id="Par23">Subjects were included if they had knee radiographs with a Kellgren and Lawrence (KL) score of grade 2 or 3 in the PFJ. This had to be greater than the KL grade for the tibiofemoral joint. Subjects had daily pain for the previous 3&#x000a0;months which was sufficiently severe to score 40 or above on a 0&#x02013;100&#x000a0;mm for the visual analogue scale of pain on nominated aggravating activity (VAS<sub>NA</sub>), and have PF symptoms (such as pain with stairs). Other inclusion/exclusion criteria for eligibility have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. As contrast enhanced scans were used, subjects with renal dysfunction or undergoing dialysis were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Intervention</title><p id="Par24">Subjects remained on their usual OA treatment. The intervention consisted of a Bioskin Patellar Tracking Q Brace (Ossur UK, Manchester, England). This is a Lycra flexible knee support with an optional strap that can be pulled over the patella; no difference in efficacy between the strapped and unstrapped configuration has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Simple randomisation was carried out by the study statistician with allocation using opaque envelopes. There is no known minimal required use to obtain the therapeutic effect of a knee brace, and we arbitrarily chose at least 4&#x000a0;h/day, so that if randomised to brace therapy, participants were instructed to wear it for a minimum of 4&#x000a0;h daily.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Assessments</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Knee pain</title><p id="Par25">Following subject recruitment and randomisation, both groups completed questionnaires evaluating their PFJ pain and imaging with DCE-MRI. After 6&#x000a0;weeks, pain evaluation and DCE-MRI was repeated for all subjects in both groups. The primary symptom outcome measure was pain on a VAS<sub>NA</sub> (0&#x000a0;mm&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;no pain, 100&#x000a0;mm&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;worst pain) and the Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) pain scale was a secondary outcome measure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Outcome measures: Structural</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>MRI assessment</title><p id="Par26">DCE-MRI variables were collected for all subjects at baseline and after 6&#x000a0;weeks using the same magnet and scanning protocol. The enrolled knee only was scanned. Using a 1.5&#x000a0;T Philips Gyroscan ACS NT (Philips, Best Netherlands), axial proton density weighted (PDW) fat saturated (FS) repetition time approximately (TR) 5.5&#x000a0;ms, echo time approximately (TE) 1.9&#x000a0;ms, field of view (FOV) 14&#x000a0;cm&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;14&#x000a0;cm, 256&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;256 matrix, slice thickness 3&#x000a0;mm sequences were obtained in all subjects, under the guidance of a musculoskeletal radiologist. The contrast agent Dotarem (gadoteric acid) was administered intravenously.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>MRI analysis</title><p id="Par27">The synovitis was segmented on the sagittal image, performed blinded, with computer image analysis excluding cartilage within the segmented area and calculating the proportion of synovial tissue within every voxel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The segmentation was transferred onto the dynamic image using image registration techniques. Repeated MRI sequences were performed every 22&#x000a0;s, and contrast was injected following the 3rd sequence. In our analysis the primary outcome measure was change in enhancement rates of synovium between the baseline and 6-week visit. These variables act as a quantitative assessment of the change in severity of knee synovitis.</p><p id="Par28">Three DCE parameters used in this study were calculated from analysis of the synovial enhancement curve (EC) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and one was calculated from the Standard Tofts&#x02019;s equation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The relative enhancement rate (RER) is a measurement the initial slope of the EC, which is sensitive to synovial vascularity and capillary permeability which reflects inflammatory activity. The maximum relative enhancement (RE<sub>max</sub>) and late relative enhancement (RE<sub>late</sub>) were also measured from the EC. K<sup>trans</sup>, the volume transfer coefficient calculated from Tofts&#x02019;s equation, also depends on synovial vascularity and capillary permeability. It is thought as synovitis severity increases, DCE parameters will increase correspondingly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>An example of a typical enhancement curve of a voxel of synovium during and post the administration of contrast agent.

Change in pain (VAS<sub>NA</sub> and KOOS pain subscale) and the four DCE parameters were assessed by paired t-tests. Following this, unpaired t-tests were performed to identify differences in within person change between brace and control groups. Only subjects with complete data sets at each time point were included in analysis. In addition, bivariate Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficients were performed to quantify the strength of associations between change in pain and change in the DCE outcomes in the brace group. The statistical analysis was performed using Stata (V.13.1; Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Subjects</title><p id="Par30">One hundred twenty-six subjects were recruited; 63 were randomised to the intervention and 63 the control group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

However, there were no significant changes to the DCE parameters in this group (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

Change in synovitis does not explain the observed improvement in pain. Within the control group there was a small reduction in RER (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.04) and K<sup>trans</sup> (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05) variables over the study period suggesting a reduction in synovitis in this group, however, the magnitude of the changes was small and probably not clinically significant.</p><p id="Par35">The DCE technique is a more sensitive method of detecting synovitis than static contrast enhanced imaging. Axelsen et al. demonstrated in 17 RA patients that intra-operative knee synovial biopsies showed histological inflammation which was highly correlated with changes in rates of synovial enhancement on pre-surgical T1 weighted MR images, especially the RER (spearman&#x02019;s correlation coefficient&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.70, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A review by Hodgson et al. was consistent with this; the RER was shown in multiple RA studies to correlate with histological, physiological and clinical disease activity changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Synovitis assessed using DCE-MRI was more strongly associated with change in pain following steroid injection than static MRI imaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">As noted earlier, the two structures consistently linked to pain in knee OA have been bone marrow lesions and synovitis (bone attrition has also been linked to pain but would be unlikely to change in 6&#x000a0;weeks and its change is not readily measurable). The absence of any association with change in synovitis assessed using DCE-MRI suggests that the reduction in pain following brace wearing is not due to change in synovitis and that other mechanisms may be operating. What then is the mechanism for pain reduction? We did find in the trial that the patellar brace caused a reduction in BML volume in the patellofemoral compartment but that reduction was not significantly correlated with pain reduction. Although change in BML volume did not explain the pain reduction, it is possible that change in other structural features may have contributed. Ultimately, while pain improved, this was not necessarily accompanied by structural changes (although we may not have had the power to show that the reduction in BML volume was correlated with the pain reduction). The decrease in focal stress across the patellofemoral joint may have decreased nociceptive stimuli without causing a change in imaging parameters, and it is possible that our imaging approaches to pain are still too insensitive to detect the change induced.</p><p id="Par37">This study was a secondary analysis of a trial of 126 patients. The original design did not include a formal sample size calculation for the DCE-MRI analysis. Instead, we made use of all available DCE-MRI scans collected during the course of the trial. Given the observed DCE-MRI trial data, we can calculate an estimated sample size for a future trial of the same design. Using RER as the primary outcome, the observed RER values for the change in the brace (mean change&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;+0.003; SD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.014) and no-brace group (mean change&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;&#x02212;0.005; SD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.016), alpha of 0.05 and 80% power, a parallel-groups clinical trial testing for differences in the change in RER between the brace and no-brace group after 6&#x000a0;weeks would require 59 patients per group, a similar number to the trial findings presented here. A design using K<sup>trans</sup> as the primary outcome, using observed values for the brace and no-brace group, would require 137 patients per group. Based on these estimates, it is possible but unlikely that our study was null because of inadequate power. We note that we found significant effects of dynamic measures of synovitis but in the opposite direction expected and that pain reduction effects were highly statistically significant.</p><p id="Par38">The reduction in pain seen in the trial was modest but exceeded the minimum clinically important difference reported by Angst et al. (1.3 on a 10&#x000a0;cm scale) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">There are some limitations to be considered. It is possible that the six weeks trial duration may not have been long enough to identify significant physiological changes to synovium in participants who used a brace. This seems unlikely as changes are seen within 2-weeks following an intra-articular steroid injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. DCE-MRI was taken from a fixed region of interest (ROI) in the knee set on computer software. This is due to the standard Tofts&#x02019;s equation requirements and the need to select a fixed area of tissue to make each image comparable between subjects. As each participant did not have the same size knee, the ROI varied between participants. This may have led to the fixed ROI window not capturing all the synovitis in each knee. This discrepancy was not recorded; there may be a difference between the groups with the percentage of total synovitis measured. In addition, sampling was done at intervals longer than might be optimal to detect dynamic change. The low temporal resolution of the DCE-MRI sequence (22&#x000a0;s) limits the accuracy of the model, particularly for estimating K<sup>trans</sup>. The field of view (FOV) was also limited reflecting the compromise in DCE-MRI between temporal resolution, spatial resolution and FOV in the phase encode directions; these could be improved for measurement of RE<sub>late</sub> where high temporal resolution is less important. Also, movement between dynamic images may degrade reproducibility of measurements such as RER. This could be reduced by use of image registration (4).</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par40">Brace therapy in symptomatic knee PFJOA is linked in the short term with a reduction in knee pain.
