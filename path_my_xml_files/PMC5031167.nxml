30 females) were randomly assigned to yoga and control groups. However, testing was conducted on only 40 subjects, so only their data are included in this study. The assessments were: self-reported pain, state anxiety, spinal flexibility, and MRI of the lumbosacral spine, performed using a 1.5 Tesla system with a spinal surface column. The yoga group was taught light exercises, physical postures, breathing techniques, and yoga relaxation techniques for 1 hour daily for 3 months. No intervention was given to the control group except for routine medical care. A repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc analyses (which was Bonferroni-adjusted) was used.

Most back pain has no demonstrable cause on imaging studies and is usually attributed to muscle strain or ligament injuries in 65&#x02013;70% of cases [<xref rid="b2-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In 5&#x02013;15% of cases the source of LBP is degenerative joints and intervertebral disc diseases [<xref rid="b3-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Cases of disc herniation may undergo improvement in symptoms with spontaneous resolution of the LBP but 37&#x02013;50% persist for 12 or more months [<xref rid="b1-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b4-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Apart from conservative therapy, all other forms of treatment are targeted at decompression of the nerve roots. This is usually done by surgical intervention. Outcome studies of lumbar disc surgeries document a success rate of between 49&#x02013;95% [<xref rid="b5-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The same author [<xref rid="b5-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] reported recurrence of pain after surgery, ranging from 4&#x02013;15%, after which there is an approximately 15% chance of further recurrence of pain.</p><p>With this background of a varying outcome of surgical interventions, there is increasing interest in non-surgical methods to manage LBP. Some of the conventional methods include epidural steroid injections or nerve root sleeve block [<xref rid="b5-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Another approach is to use physiotherapy or complementary and alternative therapies. In a survey, LBP was the most common medical condition for which people used complementary and alternative medicine [<xref rid="b6-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Many patients with LBP have used yoga as the complementary therapy of choice [<xref rid="b7-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>There have been several studies assessing the effectiveness of yoga for chronic LBP. Those studies most relevant to the present trial are briefly reviewed here. A 1-year randomized controlled trial (RCT) demonstrated that the benefits obtained by yoga practice after 3 months were sustained [<xref rid="b9-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The study randomized 313 adults with chronic or recurrent LBP to yoga or usual care. Assessments were performed at 3, 6, and 12 months. The yoga group had better back function at 3 [&#x02212;2.4 (mean changes from baseline)], 6 [&#x02212;1.7 (mean changes from baseline)], and 12 months [&#x02212;0.7 (mean changes from baseline)] compared with the usual care group. Both groups had similar back pain and general health scores at 3, 6, and 12 months. The yoga group had higher pain self-efficacy scores, indicating better self-efficacy at 3 and 6 months. The overall conclusion was that a 12-week yoga program followed by home practice led to greater improvement in back function compared to usual care.</p><p>Twelve weeks of yoga were beneficial in 101 adults with chronic LBP [<xref rid="b10-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Participants were randomized to 3 groups: (i) yoga, (ii) conventional exercise classes, and (iii) self-care based on a book. Participants of the yoga and exercise groups practiced 75-min classes for 12 weeks. The yoga intervention was <italic>viniyoga,</italic> which included 5&#x02013;12 postures and breathing exercises, guided deep relaxation, and a question and answer session. The exercise session consisted of simple warm-ups, repetitions of a series of 7 aerobic exercises and strengthening exercises, and an educational talk. The self-care group participants were mailed a copy of a back pain self-help book. After 12 weeks, there were the following changes: the yoga group was significantly better in back-related functions compared to the self-help book and exercise groups; and at 26-week followed-up, the yoga group was more effective than the self-help group with respect to patients&#x02019; reported function [&#x02212;3.6 (mean score difference)].</p><p>Another RCT described the benefits of yoga on chronic LBP where the intervention was intensive and short-term (7 days) [<xref rid="b11-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. One of the studies was a randomized controlled single-blind study on 80 patients assigned to yoga and physical exercise groups [<xref rid="b12-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The yoga intervention consisted of specific postures, breathing exercises, meditation, counseling, and lectures on yoga philosophy. The physical exercise group had regular physical therapy exercises for back pain and comparable counseling and lectures as the yoga group. While both groups showed significant reduction in pain, depression, and spinal flexibility, state and trait anxiety were lower in the yoga alone group.</p><p>There have been other randomized controlled trials which have shown the benefits of yoga practice for specific ethnic groups [<xref rid="b13-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and specific yoga interventions [<xref rid="b14-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>In all the studies cited above, the outcome measures were pain or associated self-reported assessments such as self-efficacy [<xref rid="b9-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and quality of life [<xref rid="b13-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a single study [<xref rid="b15-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] evaluated the effects of yoga on the vertebral column. This was a matched-pairs study. Eighteen yoga instructors who had over 10 years of experience were compared with 18 asymptomatic persons who were not yoga practitioners. The cervical and lumbar discs visualized with a spinal MRI were graded using a scale previously validated. The overall disc scores for cervical plus lumbar discs indicated fewer non-significant degenerative changes compared to the control group. The study compared 2 groups of normal individuals, while those with disc abnormalities were not included. The findings were interpreted as suggestive of slowing normally occurring, disc degenerative changes with yoga practice.</p><p>This is possibly the first study to evaluate MRI changes in LBP after yoga. Hence, the present study aimed at determining whether patients with chronic LBP and MRI-based degenerative changes would show: (i) changes in self-reported pain, anxiety, and spinal flexibility; and (ii) structural changes in the vertebrae and intervertebral discs after 12 weeks of yoga practice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>Sixty-two persons with MRI-proven degenerative changes in the intervertebral discs based on a standard grading system [<xref rid="b16-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] detailed below participated in the trial. Their ages were between 20 and 45 years (group mean &#x000b1;S.D., 36.22&#x000b1;6.39 years; 30 females). The effect size and power are based on a study which reported changes in visual analog scales for pain following 4 weeks of Iyengar yoga for chronic low back pain [<xref rid="b14-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Based on this, the effect size is 0.63 (large), Cohen&#x02019;s d=1.64, and Power=0.669 [<xref rid="b17-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Participants stayed close to a residential yoga center in north India. They were recruited through advertisements in local newspapers and flyers in primary care hospitals close to the center. To be included in the trial, the criteria were: (i) pathological changes in at least 1 intervertebral disc based on a standard grading system detailed below [<xref rid="b15-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and determined from the MRI report, (ii) willingness to follow the study protocol, and (iii) age between 20 and 45 years. Participants were excluded if they had any of the following: (i) previous spinal surgery, (ii) central canal stenosis, (iii) compromised cardiovascular functions, (iv) pregnancy, or (v) inability to comply with the study protocol due to mental health disorders or any other conditions. Their participation was voluntary and no incentive was given to them. After preliminary assessments, the 62 participants were randomly assigned to 2 groups; the baseline characteristics are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-medscimonit-22-3238">Table 1</xref>. Signed informed consent of all participants was obtained after the study protocol was explained to them. The Ethics Committee of Patanjali Research Foundation had approved the study, which had been registered in the Clinical Trials Registry of India (CTRI/2012/11/003094). The trial was carried out between July and September 2011.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>Participants were randomly assigned to yoga and waitlist control groups using a computer-generated random number sequence [<xref rid="b18-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Randomization was carried out as follows. (i) Participants were given numbers from 1 to 62 which were not dependent on their names, the order in which they were enrolled, or any other factor. (ii) Sixty-two random numbers were generated using specific software [<xref rid="b18-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. (iii) In a separate column adjacent to the serial numbers of the participants, all the random numbers were written. (iv) Identical-sized pieces of paper were used to write the random numbers. They were folded identically and mixed. (v) The slips of paper were placed alternately in 2 boxes (labeled as Box &#x02018;A&#x02019; and Box &#x02018;B&#x02019;) by a person who was unaware of the trial. (vi) Individuals allotted to Group &#x02018;A&#x02019; were given the yoga intervention while individuals in group &#x02018;B&#x02019; were assigned to the waitlist control group. In 22 of the 62 participants we were unable to collect data on (i) visual analog scales for pain, (ii) sit and reach for spinal flexibility, and (iii) STAI-S because after the MRI scan they returned to their homes. Their next visit was for the yoga intervention (yoga group) or health education (control group). Hence, the data of 40 participants randomized to yoga and control groups is presented. Accordingly, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-medscimonit-22-3238">Table 2</xref> (MRI data) presents data on these 40 patients. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-medscimonit-22-3238">Figure 1</xref> is the Trial Profile, which mentions the number of participants in yoga and control groups at different stages. Hence, both groups were allocated 20 participants each and in this way the study design is a parallel group design with an allocation ratio of 1:1. Recruitment of the participants was done in June 2011 and post-intervention assessments were completed in October 2011.</p><p>A record was kept of participant medication intake. Participants took NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) or analgesics when they felt the need. This was recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments</title><p>Assessments such as (i) self-rated pain, (ii) state anxiety, (iii) spinal flexibility, and (iv) MRI of the lumbosacral spine were done before and after the intervention program for all participants.</p><p>The primary outcome measure was pain. Secondary outcome measures were: (i) state anxiety, (ii) spinal flexibility, and (iii) MRI scans. MRI scans were taken on 1 day and the other 3 assessments were performed on the subsequent day in the following order: pain, state anxiety, and spinal flexibility.</p><sec><title>Self rated pain</title><p>A 10-cm linear visual analogue scale was used to assess each participant&#x02019;s rating of their level of pain [<xref rid="b19-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The visual analogue scale is a double-anchored horizontal line where each end represents opposite ends of a continuum that extends from &#x0201c;not at all&#x0201d; (score=0) at the left end of the scale to &#x0201c;the worst possible&#x0201d; (score=10) at the right end of the line.

Conventional care had no significant benefits.</p><p>There have been speculations about the mechanisms by which yoga practice might relieve back pain. Yoga practice places as much emphasis on mental focus as on physical movement [<xref rid="b23-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. During the practice of yoga, the breath is regulated and mental focus is directed to it, resulting in physical and psychological benefits [<xref rid="b24-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. From a physical point of view, it is considered that yoga increases flexibility and strength, tones the muscles, and reduces muscular tension [<xref rid="b25-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b27-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Yoga practice also increases proprioceptive ability and hence may help in adopting the correct posture to relax muscular tension and to relieve mental stress [<xref rid="b28-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It is possible that the perceived decrease in pain may have been due to reduced tension in para-vertebral muscles.</p><p>The absence of a change in flexibility in the present study compared to other studies [<xref rid="b11-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] could be due to differences in the yoga regimen. The present yoga protocol was developed by an orthopedic surgeon and has been shown to reduce back-related dysfunction using the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire; the yoga group score was 3.29 points lower than in the control group (0.98, 5.61; <italic>p</italic>=0.006) [<xref rid="b29-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The yoga protocol used in the cited study [<xref rid="b29-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and the present study are the same. This protocol does not include certain lumbar stretches are considered useful to increase flexibility. These include bridge pose lumbar stretch (<italic>Sethubandhasana</italic> breathing), folded leg lumbar stretch (<italic>Supta Udarakarshanasana</italic>), and crossed leg lumbar stretch (<italic>Shavaudrakarshanasana</italic>) [<xref rid="b30-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These particular practices were included in the studies [<xref rid="b11-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] that reported an increase in flexibility. The protocol used in the present study was developed by an orthopedic surgeon and was more conservative.</p><p>There was a 26.4% reduction in pain after 12 weeks of yoga in the present study. In earlier studies the reduction was greater &#x02212; 49.0% in the yoga group after a 7-day residential yoga program [<xref rid="b12-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and 72.8% in the yoga group at 6-month follow-up after Iyengar yoga [<xref rid="b14-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Differences in the yoga program could explain why the reduction was less in this study. Yoga programs mentioned in earlier studies [<xref rid="b12-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b14-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] were more intensive in terms of: (i) time (8 hours per day [<xref rid="b12-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] versus 1 hour per day in the present trial) or (ii) number of yoga postures (29 postures [<xref rid="b14-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] versus 10 postures in the present trial).</p><p>The MRI scans were examined for changes in: (i) the intervertebral disc, (ii) nerve compression, (iii) end-plate changes, and (iv) facet joints changes. There were some changes in the intervertebral disc grades, nerve compression, and end-plate changes in both groups at post-intervention assessment. However, the numbers were too small to indicate trends of improvement or worsening.</p><p>The changes in pain and state anxiety could not be related to differences in the severity of structural damage or nerve compression at baseline. The absence of change in the intervertebral discs, the vertebrae, and nerve compression could possibly be related to the relatively short duration (12 weeks) of the yoga intervention. However, there is no basis to suggest that a structurally altered vertebra and intervertebral disc would change with yoga. In specific cases pain is associated with changes in the skeletal muscle [<xref rid="b31-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], but that was not the case here. The only study which documented MRI changes in the spine was a matched controlled study carried out on asymptomatic normal individuals who did not have LBP. Hence, after 12 weeks of yoga practice no changes were demonstrable in the spine, although patients with LBP experienced less pain and lower state anxiety.</p><p>The findings of the present study are limited by the following factors. (i) The number of patients was small and (ii) the duration of follow-up was short. Every attempt was made to contact participants of both groups at 6 months but the number of participants in both groups available for follow up assessment was less than 5%. (iii) The high dropout rate (15&#x02013;50% for different assessments) compared to other studies (none [<xref rid="b12-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and 10% [<xref rid="b14-medscimonit-22-3238" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]). It is difficult to understand why the dropout rate was so high. A possible reason is that during the period of the study (July to September, 2011), heavy monsoon rains make commuting or traveling to the place of assessment and to the yoga class difficult.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Despite its limitations, the present study has shown that within 12 weeks, yoga practice reduces pain and state anxiety but does not alter MRI-proven changes in the intervertebral discs and vertebrae.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge the help of Dr. (Col.)
