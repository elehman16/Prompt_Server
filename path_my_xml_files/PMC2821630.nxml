The 24-week extension phase included 77 participants in both the intent-to-treat and safety extension populations (52 dalcetrapib and 25 placebo) and was limited to US sites as the extension protocol lacked approval from the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (Bundesinstitut f&#x000fc;r Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte) based on available data.

The incidence of SAEs in the two treatment groups was comparable between the groups (11% dalcetrapib; 9% placebo); absolute numbers (<italic>n</italic> = 10 dalcetrapib; <italic>n</italic> = 4 placebo) and numbers of participants (<italic>n</italic> = 89 dalcetrapib; <italic>n</italic> = 45 placebo) were greater in the dalcetrapib group mainly due to a 2:1 randomization. The inclusion of only participants with CHD or risk equivalents would also be expected to result in some cardiovascular SAEs. Although cardiovascular SAEs were slightly more common in the dalcetrapib group, this may reflect the greater pre-ponderance of CHD risk factors in the dalcetrapib group at baseline. The slightly higher incidence of reported hypertension in the dalcetrapib group compared with the placebo group may indeed have been due to baseline differences. None of the three carcinoma-associated events in the dalcetrapib group were treatment-related&#x02014;in two cases these were thought likely to be pre-existing disease (the presence of skin lesions was not an exclusion criteria in the case of the metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, and diagnosis of a case of rectal cancer early in the trial suggested it was present at baseline); glioma was diagnosed in another patient (Day 334) following an episode of dementia.

While a pre-clinical lymph node signal observed in some but not all species was considered unlikely to be clinically significant, this study confirmed that dalcetrapib has no effect on lymph nodes in humans. In addition, the dose of dalcetrapib studied (900 mg) was higher than the 600 mg dose chosen for further development and the placebo-controlled phase III <bold>dal</bold>-OUTCOMES trial, in which dalcetrapib is being evaluated in clinically stable patients with recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (<italic>n</italic> = 15 600) in combination with a background of standard ACS medication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP601C23">23</xref></sup> The lack of substantial AEs at a 900 mg dose provides support for the safety of dalcetrapib in phase III trials.</p><p>The safety data reported here corroborate the results of a safety analysis of five shorter phase II trials examining dalcetrapib at doses of 300, 600, and 900 mg compared with placebo: a 4-week trial of dalcetrapib alone (<italic>n</italic> = 193), three 4-week studies of dalcetrapib in combination with statins (<italic>n</italic> = 353), and a 12-week trial of dalcetrapib in combination with pravastatin (<italic>n</italic> = 292).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP601C20">20</xref></sup> The analysis showed a similar low incidence of cardiovascular AEs (&#x02264;5%) in the different treatment groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP601C20">20</xref></sup> In the pooled 4-week trials, the incidence of patients with AEs with the 600 mg dose of dalcetrapib was the same as with placebo, but it was higher with dalcetrapib 900 mg (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 vs. placebo and vs. dalcetrapib 600 mg).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP601C20">20</xref></sup> The incidence of SAEs was low (1% in each treatment group including placebo).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP601C20">20</xref></sup></p><p>The efficacy of dalcetrapib at raising HDL-C is not expected to be substantially reduced with the phase III 600 mg dose compared with the 900 mg dose investigated here. Although there was some degree of dose dependence in the effect of dalcetrapib on HDL-C in other phase II trials,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP601C18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP601C20">20</xref></sup> the increase in HDL-C observed with dalcetrapib 600 mg in combination with a statin (pravastatin) was as high as 31.4% at 12 weeks of treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP601C20">20</xref></sup> This is only slightly below the increases observed in the current study with dalcetrapib 900 mg (33.4% at Week 24; 33.8% at Week 48). Significant increases in apolipoprotein A-I for dalcetrapib vs. placebo were also observed in this study. Although hs-C-reactive protein was not significantly increased from baseline after 24 or 48 weeks of dalcetrapib therapy, the placebo group experienced a slight decrease, which at 24 weeks resulted in a statistical difference between the groups which was not present at 48 weeks. The clinical significance of these findings is uncertain.</p><p>Notably, the number of participants studied to date having taken dalcetrapib is limited and follow-up is relatively short. Accordingly, the possibility of Type II error cannot be ruled out. Additional, larger studies are needed to definitively determine whether there may be important adverse effects associated with the use of dalcetrapib.</p><p>In conclusion, this 48-week safety trial, the longest to date, provides additional support that dalcetrapib appears to be a safe and effective HDL-C-raising treatment. An exploratory analysis is planned to analyse a surrogate CHD endpoint, changes in aortic plaque morphology, from the MRI scans obtained in this study. Further study is also underway to determine whether the increases observed in HDL-C with dalcetrapib will lead to improved morbidity and mortality outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP601C23">23</xref></sup> (ClinicalTrial.gov identifier: NCT00658515).</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supplementary material</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ehp601/DC1">Supplementary material is available at <italic>European Heart Journal</italic> online</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by a clinical trial grant from <funding-source>F.
