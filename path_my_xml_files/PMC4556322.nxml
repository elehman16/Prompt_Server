This study aimed to compare the effect of MI, in contrast to traditional dental health education (DHE), on oral health knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and behaviours among parents and caregivers of preschool children in Trinidad.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>The design of this exploratory study included a cluster randomised controlled trial and semi-structured focus groups. Six preschools (79 parents and caregivers) in Eastern Trinidad were randomly assigned to a test or control group (3 preschools in each group). Parents and caregivers in the test-group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;25) received a talk on dental health using an MI approach and the control-group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;54) received a talk using traditional DHE. Both groups received additional, written dental health information. The MI group also received two telephone call follow-ups as part of the MI protocol. Both groups were given questionnaires before the talks and four months later. Question items included oral health knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, brushing behaviour, oral health self-efficacy, oral health fatalism and a specific instrument to asses &#x02018;readiness for change&#x02019;, the Readiness Assessment of Parents Concerning Infant Dental Decay (RAPIDD). Participants in the test-group were also invited to take part in a focus group to share their views on the dental health talk.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At four month follow-up, knowledge items on fluoride use, tooth brushing, dietary practice and dental attendance increased in both the test (DHE&#x02009;+&#x02009;MI) and control (DHE) groups ((<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05, Chi Square test). In the test-group there were increases in mean child tooth brushing frequency and reduction in oral health fatalism (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05&#x02009;<italic>t</italic>-test). Findings from a thematic analysis of the focus group suggested that the MI talk and telephone follow-up were well accepted and helpful in supporting parent and caregiver efforts to improve oral health practices for their preschool children.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this exploratory controlled study there was some evidence that using an MI approach when delivering oral health information had a positive effect on parent/ caregiver oral health knowledge, attitudes and behaviours compared to traditional DHE.

For instance, traditional generic recommendations such as &#x02018;brush your child&#x02019;s teeth twice a day and reduce consumption of sweet snacks and drinks&#x02019; have had limited success in changing oral health practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Behaviour change techniques (BCT), including face-to-face counselling, have been effective across primary healthcare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. BCTs have been described as an &#x02018;observable, replicable and irreducible component of an intervention designed to alter or redirect causal processed that regulate behaviour&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. One such BCT is Motivational Interviewing (MI), defined as &#x0201c;<italic>a person-centred counselling style for addressing the common problem of ambivalence about change</italic>&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. MI differs radically from traditional health education approaches in which it is assumed from the outset that a person is prepared to act upon information imparted to them by an expert (health professional/ educator). Rather than the health professional assuming the role of &#x02018;expert&#x02019;, MI places the client/ patient in that role, letting them decide how to interpret and integrate information in the context of their lives own and social circumstances and whether it is relevant for them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>During MI the health professional/educator attempts to resolve ambivalence toward change in the client/patient and &#x02018;evoke&#x02019; motivation that is already there by the eliciting &#x02018;change-talk&#x02019; and using &#x02018;reflective listening&#x02019;. This means asking questions like: <italic>What do you want to change? How might you go about it? What are the best reasons for doing it and how important is it you?</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. MI therefore sees behaviour change as a partnership between the client / patient and counsellor / health educator that respects autonomy, enabling the client / patient to feel engaged, understood and empowered.</p><p>Though not strictly a theory of behaviour change, MI does share some elements of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) as proposed by Prochaska et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Through work with people with addictive behaviour, the TTM was developed to understand self-initiated and professionally assisted changes in health behaviour. The TTM presents a series of key stages though which an individual must pass before adopting a new behaviour. These stages are (a) <italic>Precontemplative,</italic> (individual has no awareness of the problem or intention to change behaviour) (b) <italic>Contemplative</italic> (Individual aware of problem and thinking about change) (c) <italic>Preparation</italic> (Individual has intention to change but not yet ready)<italic>,</italic> (d) <italic>Action</italic> (Individual attempts behaviour change<italic>),</italic> and (e) <italic>Maintenance</italic> (individual consolidates change to prevent relapse) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. As in MI, the concept of increasing self-efficacy and personal empowerment are believed to be key elements in the process of change, these also being fundamental aims of health promotion.</p><p>Despite a sizable body of evidence from medical research, the potential of MI in dental health care is less well understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A recent systematic review on the effectiveness of MI compared to conventional health education (CE) suggested that MI outperformed CE in improving oral health behaviours in infants and preschool children, mainly in relation to oral hygiene, but not in dietary habits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This evidence is largely based on studies by Weinstein et al. and Harrison et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These studies reported findings of a two-year randomized controlled trial of MI involving 240 infants aged 6&#x02013;18 months from Punjabi Sikh immigrant families living in British Columbia, Canada. In this blinded, randomized control trial, the experimental group received a dental health pamphlet and video, along with MI delivered by trained Indo-Canadian women lay counsellors (who were not health professionals), using a specifically developed protocol. Mothers in the control group received only the initial pamphlet and video and no telephone follow-up. After two years, a 46&#x000a0;% lower prevalence of decayed tooth surfaces was reported in children whose mother had received MI compared to those whose mothers received only pamphlets and videos. It should be stated that in these studies the oral health behaviour that most likely related to the reduction in ECC, was that families in the MI group attended more routinely for fluoride varnish application than the control families. This could also suggest that mothers in the MI group felt more positive about oral health care for their children and motivated to access preventive dental services.</p><p>Less promising results were reported in a randomized study of over 1000 low-income African-American families with children (0&#x02013;5 years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The test-group involved MI for caregivers, a 40-min discussion about what changes they could make to achieve oral health goals for their child delivered by trained interviewers and a 15-min health education DVD. The control-group received the health educational DVD only. At two-year follow-up, apart from &#x02018;checking the child&#x02019;s mouth for pre-cavities&#x02019;, there were no statistically significant differences in oral health behaviour of caregivers between test and control groups and no statistically significant difference in the development of untreated caries in the children.</p><p>The potential of MI in improving oral health care may therefore still be considered controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Nevertheless, a recent evidence-based national clinical guidelines for caries prevention from the UK states &#x0201c;oral health promotion interventions should be based on recognised health theory behaviour and models such as MI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Previous research as shown the prevalence and severity of ECC in Trinidad (an island nation in the West Indies) to be related to parental oral health behaviours and access to dental care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] as well as families with preschool children being in need of practical support to overcome barriers to achieving effective preventive care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, no research has been conducted in the English-speaking Caribbean, assessing the effectiveness and appropriateness of community-based oral health promotion that includes the use of brief-counselling approaches such as MI for families with preschool children.</p><p>The aim of this study was to assess the effect of an MI approach delivered in a group-setting, on parent /caregiver oral health knowledge, beliefs, attitudes and behaviour toward the oral healthcare of their preschool children, by contrast with traditional dental health education (DHE), in an exploratory community-based study.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>To assess the effect of MI on participants&#x02019; oral health knowledge, beliefs and attitudes, tooth brushing behaviour, oral health self-efficacy and oral health fatalism compared to DHE.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To assess the effect of MI on participants&#x02019; &#x02018;readiness for change&#x02019;, compared to DHE.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To assess the effectiveness of MI delivered in a group-setting.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To explore participants&#x02019; views and opinions of the MI intervention.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>To achieve the objectives of this exploratory study two study designs were employed, a cluster randomised controlled trial and semi-structured focus groups.

This Health Centre also housed the local dental clinic, staffed by Dental Nurses (the equivalent of dental therapists in the UK), who would be assisting in the research.</p><p>The sampling frame consisted of 12 preschools on a contact list for community dental outreach activity by Dental Nurses working at the Arima District Health Facility. To enable involvement of the two Dental Nurses in this research concurrent to their clinical commitments in the District Health Facility, it was decided that a maximum of six preschool would be manageable within the time-frame of this pilot study. The 6 preschools (clusters) were drawn randomly from the contact list and subsequently assigned to the test group (DHE&#x02009;+&#x02009;MI) or the control group (DHE), with 3 preschool clusters in each group. The placement of preschools in a particular study group was based on simple randomization (preschools numbered 1&#x02013;6 and these numbers randomly assigned to test or control group).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Approval and consent</title><p>Ethical approval was obtained from the Faculty of Medical Sciences Research Ethics Committee (The University of the West Indies). For the selected preschools, letters of request to be included in the study were sent to the head teacher / preschool administrator, for each preschool.

These packages contained information about the study and a consent form requesting parent/caregiver participation and the study questionnaire.

Again, for use in the present study, the instrument was assessed for face validity and modified for use with a slightly older age-group (3 to 5&#x000a0;years) by the authors (RN, JN). This included rewording of questions relating to bottle-use. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> shows the four RAPIDD constructs and corresponding construct items. It should be noted that, within the questionnaire, these items are not themed by construct but listed as statements for which the participant is asked to agree with on a 5-point Likert scale (5&#x02009;=&#x02009;Strongly Agree, 4&#x02009;=&#x02009;Agree, 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;Neither agree or disagree, 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;Disagree, 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;Strongly Disagree).

Focus groups are one of several methods for acquiring qualitative data. They can be considered as an semi-structured interview with a group of people who are encouraged to interact with each other and the facilitator, using group dynamics to stimulate discussion, gain insights and generate ideas to explore a chosen topic in depth.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Focus group sample selection</title><p>In liaison with the preschool head teachers / administrators, a focus group discussion was arranged for parents/caregivers from one of the three preschool (clusters) that had received the MI intervention. This took place 6&#x000a0;months after the end of MI intervention (i.e. last telephone follow-up). Due to the busy schedule of events in the other two preschools their head-teachers /administrators indicated that they were unavailable for inclusion in this phase of the study. All parents /caregivers from the preschool who had attended the group-talk and engaged in the follow-up were invited to participate, through the head-teacher/ administrator. The venue for the focus group discussion was the preschool main classroom, after working hours, during the middle of a school week.</p><p>The focus group was run by a facilitator / moderator (RN), previously trained in qualitative methodology (26&#x000a0;h, didactic and practical,) and a dental nurse, who served as the assistant moderator.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conduct of the focus group</title><p>The facilitator/ moderator, welcomed the parent&#x02019;s and caregivers to the event. To obtain informed consent for participation in the focus group, the purpose and conduct of the event (focus group) was explained i.e. an open discussion (not an interview) around the theme of preschool children&#x02019;s dental healthcare based on the dental health group-talk and telephone calls given some months previously. It was explained that an audio recording of the discussion would be made but that all comments and opinions offered would remain anonymous and individuals would not be identified by name during transcription and reporting of the findings. It was also emphasized that all comments (positive or negative) would be considered of value. All the parents and caregivers present gave verbal consent to participate in the focus group discussion. Participants were also invited to complete a short form to record socio-demographic information.</p><p>To initiate and facilitate the discussion the moderator used a <italic>focus group topic guide</italic> (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). This topic guide was designed to help explore how participants felt about receiving the MI intervention (group talk, dental health menu and telephone follow-up), along with specific issues related to making changes to oral healthcare practices and routines following the intervention. Questions in the topic guide were open-ended and not asked in a specific order but rather in response to the flow of the discussion.<table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Focus group topic guide</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>&#x02022; After the group talk how confident were you in making any changes?</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02022; Did any of the things we talked about help you to make a change?

At the end of the session, participants were thanked and given dental products as tokens of appreciation (toothpaste / floss samples). Light refreshments were provided before and during the discussion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Qualitative data analysis</title><p>A thematic content analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data collected in the focus group session. As a first step, the focus group audio recording was transcribed into a Word document. The verbatim transcript was then numbered line-by-line for identification. After several readings of the transcript, field notes and listening to the audio recording, the data underwent a process of initial labelling of sections of the transcript by placing codes in the text margin. Similarly coded pieces of the transcript were re-assembled near to each other by cutting and pasting text sections into a new Word document. These initial codes (which could overlap) were then further developed to identify emerging early &#x02018;themes&#x02019; (proto-themes) which were themselves further refined into the final themes These themes were reported in the results with supporting verbatim quotes from the transcript.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Data trustworthiness and reflexivity</title><p>To determine data credibility (member checking), at the end of the session participants were invited to give their opinion (off-record) as to whether the discussion had accurately documented their own experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. All focus group participants agreed that the points discussed and views presented had been a good representation of their collective and individual experiences with the MI intervention. Reflexivity in qualitative research recognises that the researcher is part of the process of producing the data and interpreting their meaning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Furthermore, consideration was given to the facilitator /moderator having also been an active part of the MI intervention.

Six participants from the 20 parents and caregivers who had remained in the MI intervention study at the four-month follow-up, accepted an invitation to take part in the focus group discussion. All participants were female, ranging in age from 25&#x02013;34, with two thirds (4) of Indian ethnicity. Four participants stated secondary school was their highest level of education the remainder educated to tertiary level. Three participants were in professional / managerial occupation, the others being in manual occupation and housewives. Two participants cared for more than one child.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Views on the MI group-talk</title><p>During the discussion it became apparent that participants had not had any kind of dental health education (DHE) delivered to them prior to the MI group talk, therefore they could not compare it to other types of DHE delivery. However, they all appeared to feel comfortable with the MI approach in particular, the open discussion of oral health goals and barriers along with sharing of experiences with other parents / caregivers. Opinions offered on the telephone follow-up element of the MI protocol suggested that it did not feel intrusive and was helpful; no participants indicated discomfort with that aspect of the MI.<disp-quote><p><italic>I think it</italic> (MI group talk) <italic>was better because sometime you might even forget about something to mention and another parent might bring it up and you know you would benefit from it.</italic></p><p><italic>Yes, it was really good</italic> (MI group talk)<italic>, because I never knew about the fluoride varnish before and I did enquire from my dentist</italic></p><p><italic>That helped me amm&#x02026; a lot</italic> (telephone follow-up)<italic>..and making sure that she brushes her teeth twice-a-day&#x02026; because sometimes you know, they small so you&#x02019;ll say well if they fall asleep, so we now try to kind of wake her up and brush it&#x02026;</italic></p></disp-quote></p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Mode of delivery of oral health information</title><p>Mixed opinions were expressed about the value of giving written material but most found written information helpful as a reinforcement / reminder of issues presented in the MI group talk. It was unclear at times if participants were referring to the value of the dental health information leaflet or the dental health menu used as part of the MI, as to some participants they may have seemed similar in content.<disp-quote><p><italic>I don&#x02019;t think it would matter to me to much because I mean at the end of the day we could verify the information</italic> (information leaflet) <italic>on the internet &#x02018;cause everything is there on the internet.</italic></p><p><italic>I find the talk does be better because sometimes you get the hand-out</italic> (Information leaflet) <italic>and you misplace it</italic></p><p><italic>You should give both</italic> (MI group talk and written information)</p></disp-quote></p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Changing oral health practices</title><p>As a result of the MI intervention most participants had tried to implement some changes to oral health practices for their child such as twice daily tooth brushing, change of brushing position, use of fluoride toothpaste etc. In particular, after the MI intervention some participants appeared to have made concerted effort to overcome practical difficulties such as their child falling asleep before night-time brushing. Following the intervention there also appeared to be greater understanding of the importance of using fluoride toothpaste and supervision of tooth brushing. Despite it being a little challenging, after the intervention, participants seemed to feel more confident in adopting the brushing from behind method. For some participants the follow-up phase of the intervention was particularly helpful to support changes that had been made.<disp-quote><p><italic>I did learn from the talk because the amount of toothpaste.. so I changed that&#x02026;</italic></p><p><italic>she kind of like wants to brush her teeth on her own now but I still make sure and do with her it at least once-a-day especially by bedtime to make sure and do it properly.</italic></p><p><italic>How I position the child, &#x02018;cause I used to do it from in front and now I know how to do it from behind so I learnt about that.

Though they expressed difficulty changing this behaviour in the past, following the MI intervention new efforts were made to discontinue this practice.<disp-quote><p><italic>She still begs for the bottle. Well I threw away the nipple (feeding bottle) recently because it was like really bad but only like in the night.., like if she get up around three o&#x02019;clock in the morning but we cut it down like real plenty.</italic></p><p><italic>&#x02026; but you know when she sleeping and start crying for this bottle, it real hard to go back to sleep.

Overall, participants&#x02019; awareness of dental service availability for young children appeared to have improved with more considering the dental hospital along with private practice. There was a persisting view that dental attendance was only for problems and, in one instance, an inquiry about fluoride varnish at a private dental practice was met with the general dental practitioner (GDP) not being aware of this as a preventive option for primary teeth.<disp-quote><p><italic>Well we brought her to a private dentist and sometimes you have a waiting period, like if it&#x02019;s a emergency probably have to wait for an appointment.</italic></p><p><italic>&#x02026;sometimes you might have to get like four Saturdays after, or something like that&#x02026;.even if the child in pain.</italic></p></disp-quote></p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Barriers to change</title><p>For some participants, the main barrier to changing oral healthcare practices was the child&#x02019;s non-acceptance of new brushing regimes, toothpaste use and change from feeding bottle to cup. Participants recounted concerted attempts to implement new oral health practices. Sometimes these efforts were further hampered by other family member involvement, in particular grandparents.<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02026;she not even giving up the comforter right now, she want that to sleep whole night, if that out the mouth, she not sleeping, she will be searching for it on the bed.</italic></p><p><italic>She just cried and cried&#x02026;I hide the bottle and give her the cup.., she says &#x0201c;No Mummy I don&#x02019;t want it&#x0201d;.</italic></p><p><italic>&#x02026;she likes to lie down and drink her tea&#x02026;not sit down.

Importantly knowledge of the importance of fluoride varnish application also has practical implications for preventive strategies as this clinical intervention is effective in reducing ECC separately and in combination with fluoride toothpaste [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The reduction in prevalence of early childhood caries (ECC) following an MI intervention reported in Asian families in Canada, was largely attributed to a greater uptake of fluoride varnish by those families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] possibly due to the parents attaching greater value to professional preventive care.</p><p>On the issue of tooth brushing practices, understanding these parents and caregivers&#x02019; perspective was vital and this aspect formed part of the MI conversation that uses &#x02018;reflective listening&#x02019;, where, over the course of the session, the educator / counsellor seeks to increase the clients strength for expressed motivation in order to target a behaviour change. Establishing good tooth brushing habits and routines in preschool children can be a challenge for families particularly where it involved changes to established daily routines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>Regular (at least twice daily) brushing with fluoride toothpaste is a core aspect of caries prevention in preschool children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Importantly, in this present study, the MI intervention had a significant effect on this preventive oral health behaviour, with the test-group claiming an increased frequency of weekly brushing. Brushing with fluoride toothpaste before the child&#x02019;s evening bedtime gives further protection, as during this time the teeth are more vulnerable to the effects of plaque bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Also, from the views expressed in the focus group it could be inferred that after the intervention, participants felt more confident in their ability to use the oral health information that was provided. Exploring practical ways to overcome barriers to oral healthcare for their child/children may also have helped participants to persist with introducing new oral healthcare regimes about which they had learned. However, getting the child to brush at night-time was one of the more difficult behaviours for parents and caregiver to change, often because the child refused or fell asleep. This is consistent with findings from the UK, where parents of preschool children found more difficulty in establishing a routine of tooth brushing at that time of day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Again, based on findings from the focus group, it appeared that some participants in the test-group had experienced success with efforts to stop use of the night-time feeding bottle. This was encouraging as this routine may also have been a particularly difficult one to change as bottle-use has been associated with issues of closeness and comforting by the mother, as well as &#x02018;buying time&#x02019; time away from their crying child [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>Miller and Rollnick state that &#x0201c;for a person to change they must feel both confident in their ability to change and believe the change is important to them&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Brushing behaviour has been reported to be positively related to maternal self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], therefore, increasing parental involvement in tooth brushing for preschool children would requires them knowing it is important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In the present study, differences in self-efficacy did not reach statistical significance at the four-month follow-up. However, an MI approach significantly reduced parent/caregiver OHF which in turn, may lead to a more positive attitudes toward oral health and increased motivation to adopt preventive practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Therefore, how BCTs are delivered may have as much impact on outcomes as the technique itself, suggesting the need for development of a BCT Taxonomy (i.e. a method of specifying, evaluating and implementing behaviour change interventions) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>The concept of &#x02018;readiness for change&#x02019;, in this study was explored using the RAPIDD instrument. &#x02018;Readiness for change&#x02019; has been defined as &#x02018;a person&#x02019;s current thoughts, feelings and attitudes regarding their intention to institute a change in their habits&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The analyses did not demonstrate a statistically significant effect of MI on the RAPIDD construct scores. The present findings are also similar to those of Freudenthal who reported an effect of improvement in brushing frequency in mothers who received MI but, apart from &#x02018;valuing dental health&#x02019;, reported no significant changes in the RAPIDD scores between test and control-groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>A systematic review, of parental influences on ECC, highlighted the importance of socio-cultural factors that are likely to affect mediating variables such as attitudes and oral health beliefs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and it has also been suggested that the MI approach enables oral health professionals to focus more on underlying social determinants of disease, by tailoring interventions to suit social circumstances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] while attempting to develop their &#x02018;readiness for change&#x02019;.</p><p>From another perspective, it has been suggested that MI provides an opportunity to address &#x02018;felt needs&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], which supports a view that primary healthcare professionals should address the needs of families in the context of their environment and experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. It has also been suggested that health practitioners are likely to gain a greater sense of achievement from recognising progress in an individual&#x02019;s &#x02018;readiness for change&#x02019; as an important outcome rather than using behaviour change as the only goal since this may not be measurable in the short term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p>The MI intervention led to a much higher retention rate of participants in the study, compared to the control-group. This may be a benefit of the MI approach. Importantly, comments from the focus group indicated participants in the test-group were comfortable with the telephone contacts made by the Dental Nurses suggesting that this element of the protocol may have helped to maintain motivation and commitment from participants. This is consistent with the findings of Weinstein, who believed that longer telephone or in-person follow-up could add even more value to the process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Also the challenges the participants in the present study encountered, in trying to alter dietary and dental attendance behaviour, indicates the value of on-going support to achieve these goals.</p><sec id="Sec29"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>Some limitations of the present study must be considered when interpreting the findings.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Sample sizes and subsequent group allocations were relatively small due to difficulty in subject recruitment and retention, which has implications for potential coverage of this type of community intervention. The low response rate may have also have resulted in a more motivated group of participants at baseline compared to the target population, masking effects of the intervention. Furthermore, the sample size in this study resulted in a low study power increasing the probability of type II errors.</p></list-item><list-item><p>In the present study lack of a clear effect of MI on participants on oral health attitudes and behaviours may also have been due to the extent the actual MI delivered matched the principles of MI i.e. fidelity . Fidelity refers to assessment and monitoring of an intervention as it is actually delivered to clients and its assessment is key to the validity of behavioural change interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Interestingly, one of the reasons suggested for lack of effectiveness in improving oral health in one study of preschool children was lack of fidelity to the MI process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. With regards to this, Moyers et al. have developed an instrument to help clinicians improve in their use of MI by providing feedback by use of the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) code [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. For the MITI, recordings of the MI session are reviewed by trained coders who assign a global score based on a 5-point scale for an overall impression and for each of five specific dimensions: Evocation, Collaboration, Autonomy/ Support, Direction and Empathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>Differences in characteristics between the test and control-group at baseline (education level, occupation, experiences of accessing dental care) may have influenced the effect of the intervention. Although the groups were randomly allocated, these socio-demographics imbalances may have been due to some preschools having significantly more parents from a particular ethnic or socioeconomic group. This also prevents more sophisticated analyses.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The duration of the study was short (4&#x000a0;months). This was to avoid further drop-out and loss of contact with participants as their children moved on to primary school / families leave the area.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Self-reported questionnaires can be affected by participant recall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Furthermore, some response bias may have resulted from &#x02018;social desirability&#x02019; i.e. bias due to clients who misrepresent self-reported behaviours by over-reporting behaviours considered socially desirable, and under-reporting undesirable ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>As only one individual was trained to provide the MI talk, the MI method may not be representative of other MI providers, which limits the ability to generalize conclusions about its utility.</p></list-item><list-item><p>More extensive training in MI for the dental nurses who undertook the telephone follow-up may have helped increase fidelity to the MI protocol.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Delivery of MI in group settings has not been as extensively evaluated as one-to-one counselling, therefore MI delivered in a group setting has less predictable outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Specific limitations being: (a) each group member has less time to engage in the process of evoking and change-talk (b) Group dynamics can alter the probability of change-talk and (c) people within the group may reinforce ambivalence in others.</p></list-item><list-item><p>It was not possible to include all parents and caregivers who received the MI in the focus group discussion as most were unavailable. This limited the sample size and group size of the focus group. However, minimum sample size for focus group has been stated as six [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] and, where there is a high degree of homogeneity for qualitative studies, samples of less than ten can still achieve data saturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Also, as a focus group was not conducted with the control-group it cannot be concluded whether participants' experiences of MI were more positive in comparison to traditional DHE.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The impact of the MI intervention compared to the control group may have been exaggerated as DHE is known to be ineffective for changing oral health behaviour.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec30" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although the findings should be considered as exploratory, in this controlled study there was some evidence that using an MI approach when delivering oral health information had a positive effect on parent/ caregiver oral health knowledge, tooth brushing behaviour and oral health fatalism compared to traditional DHE. The acceptability of the MI protocol, which included follow-up telephone contact was also good, as indicated by discussions with the recipients both during and after the delivery of the programme. These findings suggest that further development of this person-centred counselling approach could be of benefit for improving oral health of preschool children in Trinidad and could form part of oral health promotion strategies for this population group.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BCT</term><def><p>Behaviour change technique</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DHE</term><def><p>Dental health education</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ECC</term><def><p>Early childhood caries</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GDP</term><def><p>General dental practitioner</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MI</term><def><p>Motivational interviewing</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OHF</term><def><p>Oral health fatalism</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OHSE</term><def><p>Oral health self-efficacy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RAPIDD</term><def><p>Readiness assessment of parents concerning infant dental decay</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TTM</term><def><p>Transtheoretical model.</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>RN conducted the fieldwork and data collection.
