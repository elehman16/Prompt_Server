Many syncopal events occur secondary to excessive venous pooling and capillary filtration in the lower limbs when upright. As such, a common approach to the management of syncope is the use of compression stockings. However, research confirming their efficacy is lacking. We aimed to investigate the effect of graded calf compression stockings on orthostatic tolerance.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We evaluated orthostatic tolerance (OT) and haemodynamic control in 15 healthy volunteers wearing graded calf compression stockings compared to two placebo stockings in a randomized, cross-over, double-blind fashion. OT (time to presyncope, min) was determined using combined head-upright tilting and lower body negative pressure applied until presyncope. Throughout testing we continuously monitored beat-to-beat blood pressures, heart rate, stroke volume and cardiac output (finger plethysmography), cerebral and forearm blood flow velocities (Doppler ultrasound) and breath-by-breath end tidal gases. There were no significant differences in OT between compression stocking (26.0&#x000b1;2.3 min) and calf (29.3&#x000b1;2.4 min) or ankle (27.6&#x000b1;3.1 min) placebo conditions. Cardiovascular, cerebral and respiratory responses were similar in all conditions. The efficacy of compression stockings was related to anthropometric parameters, and could be predicted by a model based on the subject's calf circumference and shoe size (r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.780, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.004).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>These data question the use of calf compression stockings for orthostatic intolerance and highlight the need for individualised therapy accounting for anthropometric variables when considering treatment with compression stockings.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Syncope, or fainting, is described as a transient loss of consciousness and postural tone, with spontaneous recovery <xref rid="pone.0028193-Hainsworth1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. It typically occurs when upright and is associated with reduced cerebral blood flow, often attributed to sudden onset hypotension and bradycardia, associated with the &#x0201c;vasovagal&#x0201d; response <xref rid="pone.0028193-Lewis1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Many syncopal events are triggered by orthostatic stress, likely due to concomitant venous pooling and enhanced capillary filtration when upright <xref rid="pone.0028193-Hainsworth1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. This reduces venous return and, if not adequately compensated, leads to profound reductions in blood pressure and cerebral blood flow <xref rid="pone.0028193-Hainsworth1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>The prevalence of syncope is high, with presyncope and orthostatic dizziness reported in 12.5&#x00025; of individuals <xref rid="pone.0028193-Radtke1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, and 0.9&#x02013;5&#x00025; of emergency visits and 1&#x00025; of hospital admissions due to syncopal episodes <xref rid="pone.0028193-OldeNordkamp1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0028193-Kapoor1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Furthermore, syncope and presyncope have a marked negative impact on quality of life, with many individuals reporting injury secondary to an associated fall or accident during the event; recurrent episodes are particularly debilitating <xref rid="pone.0028193-Radtke1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028193-Rose1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0028193-Romme1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>The treatment of orthostatic syncope can be particularly challenging. Usually the initial approach is patient counselling <xref rid="pone.0028193-Sutton1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028193-Romme1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> incorporating avoidance of known triggers, encouraging adequate hydration (often with salt supplementation) <xref rid="pone.0028193-Claydon1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028193-ElSayed1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, and physical countermanouvres <xref rid="pone.0028193-Krediet1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. While these strategies aid in the management of occasional syncope, they are not usually sufficient for the treatment of frequent or severe episodes <xref rid="pone.0028193-Romme1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Additional treatment strategies include cardiac pacemakers for syncope with cardioinhibition, and pharmacologic therapy, although their utility and efficacy has been questioned <xref rid="pone.0028193-ElBedawi1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028193-Maggi1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>The use of compression hosiery is commonly recommended for those affected by recurrent orthostatic intolerance, based on the rationale that external counter-pressure of the lower limbs or abdomen will reduce venous pooling and capillary filtration, thereby increasing venous return and preventing or delaying the onset of syncope <xref rid="pone.0028193-Avril1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0028193-Downie1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Certainly, pooling and filtration in the legs can be extensive, with 500 ml of blood lost into the legs within just 10 minutes of 60&#x000b0; head-upright tilting <xref rid="pone.0028193-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>; therefore, the potential to ameliorate this effect using leg compression garments might be expected to have a profound impact on orthostatic tolerance. Graduated compression garments are thought to be most effective for the treatment of orthostatic syncope, because the movement of body fluid when upright redistributes hydrostatic pressures throughout the body, with the highest pressures found at the ankles <xref rid="pone.0028193-Hainsworth2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Thus, garments designed to apply greater counter-pressures at the extremities might be expected to be more efficacious. However, despite the common recommendation for patients with orthostatic intolerance to utilise compression stockings <xref rid="pone.0028193-Sutton1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028193-Maggi1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, there is little research proving their efficacy.</p><p>Short term improvements in orthostatic blood pressures with garments applying counter-pressure to the whole leg and/or abdominal segments have been reported <xref rid="pone.0028193-Stenger1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0028193-Denq1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, although compression of the thighs may promote venous pooling when sitting, due to a reversal of the pressure gradient <xref rid="pone.0028193-Walker1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, with an expected deleterious effect on orthostatic tolerance (OT). Generally, garments that compress the abdomen show greater promise for the prevention of orthostatic intolerance <xref rid="pone.0028193-Podoleanu1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0028193-Denq1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.

Prior to testing subjects completed a brief medical history; all volunteers were healthy and free of cardiovascular and neurological disease. None of the volunteers was taking any medication, except for three females who were using oral contraceptives. Each subject completed testing on three separate days within a week, or at monthly intervals, wearing each of three different types of stocking: calf-length graded compression stocking (Knee-high Graded Support Therapy Socks, Sigvaris Inc, Peachtree City, USA); standard calf-length socks not designed to provide compression, but visually similar to the compression stocking (calf placebo); and ankle-length socks that did not compress the calf (ankle placebo). Testing was conducted in a randomised double-blind fashion, at the same time of day (in the morning). Female subjects were tested in the same phase of their menstrual cycle, achieved by testing on either consecutive days, or at monthly intervals. Subjects were asked to refrain from strenuous exercise twelve hours prior to each test, eat a light breakfast, and avoid caffeine on the morning of each test.</p><p>Prior to testing, anthropometric measures were taken. Circumference and skinfold thickness of the calf were determined using a standard tape measure and skinfold callipers (Slim Guide&#x000ae;, Creative Health Products, Plymouth, USA) at the widest level of the calf. Measures were taken in triplicate on the right leg, and the average used for analysis.

After twenty minutes of supine rest, they were tilted to 60&#x000b0;, for twenty minutes. This was followed by incremental increases in LBNP at &#x02212;20 mmHg, &#x02212;40 mmHg and &#x02212;60 mmHg for ten minutes each. The test was terminated if either: their systolic blood pressure fell below 80 mmHg; their heart rate (HR) was less than 50 bpm or greater than 180 bpm; they experienced presyncopal symptoms such as light-headedness, nausea, perspiration and warmth; or the entire protocol was completed. At test termination, the tilt table was rapidly returned to the supine position. OT was taken as the time to presyncope in minutes, from the start of tilting until the test was terminated.</p><p>Throughout testing we continuously recorded non-invasive beat-to-beat finger arterial pressures (Finometer, Finapres Medical Systems, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). This device also calculates beat-to-beat cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV), and total peripheral resistance (TPR), using the Modelflow technique <xref rid="pone.0028193-Harms1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0028193-Wesseling1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. HR and rhythm were monitored using a lead II electrocardiogram (ECG; Finapres ECG Module, Finapres Medical Systems, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). We also monitored the partial pressures of end tidal oxygen (P<sub>ET</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and carbon dioxide (P<sub>ET</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>) on a breath-by-breath basis (O<sub>2</sub>Cap Oxygen Analyser, Oxigraph Inc, California, USA). Mean cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) in the middle cerebral artery was measured using a 2 MHz ultrasound probe located at the right temporal window and secured in position using a headband; similarly, brachial artery blood flow velocity was measured with an 8 MHz ultrasound probe held in place over the brachial artery by an adjustable clamp, with the arm supported at heart level (Doppler Box, Compumedics Germany GmbH, The DWL Doppler Company, Singen, Germany). Data acquisition was performed with a sampling frequency of 1 KHz using an analog-to-digital converter (Powerlab 16/30, AD Instruments, Colorado Springs, CO).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was calculated as diastolic arterial pressure &#x0002b;1/3 pulse pressure. Forearm vascular resistance (FVR) was calculated as MAP divided by brachial blood flow velocity. Cerebral mean arterial pressure (CMAP) was calculated from MAP at heart level, corrected for the measured height difference between the temporal window and heart when upright <xref rid="pone.0028193-Claydon2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Cerebrovascular resistance (CVR) was taken as CMAP/CBFV. The efficacy of cerebral autoregulation was quantified from the correlation coefficient and gradient describing the relationship between CMAP and CBFV, as described previously <xref rid="pone.0028193-Claydon2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Data are presented as 30 second averages, every two minutes throughout testing. Data at presyncope represent the final value for each variable prior to the return to the supine position. Note that because of variable times at which presyncope was initiated and the tests stopped, the number of subjects included for each data point decreased as the test progressed. Thus, cardiovascular responses are presented only for the first 30 minutes of orthostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Measures of calf compression</title><p>Stocking compression data were obtained at three sites (at the level of the malleoli [ankle], the widest point of the calf [mid-calf], and one inch below the top of the stocking [knee]).

A custom-made rig was used to measure compressive pressure in representative slices through a modeled calf at three locations, consisting of a load cell (Futek Advanced Sensor Technologies, Inc, Irvine, CA, USA, model LLB350) mounted between two semi-cylindrical plastic parts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028193-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

The compression stocking applied graded compression at all distending circumferences, with the highest levels at the ankle, and lowest levels at the knee (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028193-g008">Figure 8B</xref>).

Despite the lack of improvement in OT with compression stockings in the group as a whole, some individuals exhibited modest improvements in OT with compression stockings whereas others did not. From our anthropometric analysis we found that the calf circumference was a key determinant of the efficacy of the compression stocking. This has implications for their clinical use for the treatment of orthostatic intolerance, and underscores the need for individualised therapy when considering compression stockings as a treatment paradigm.</p><p>We selected a test that has a clearly defined end-point in all subjects, and has been shown previously to be highly reproducible, sensitive and specific <xref rid="pone.0028193-Hainsworth3" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028193-ElBedawi2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028193-AlShamma1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. As such, we are confident that had there been a significant effect of the compression stocking on OT we would have been able to detect it. We are also confident that the test end point (presyncope), and therefore the OT, was reliably determined because the terminating blood pressures and HR (as well as the other cardiovascular variables) were similar in all conditions. Furthermore, the investigator responsible for terminating the test was blinded to the test condition, to ensure this could not have influenced the result.</p><p>We tested a compression stocking reported to generate 20 mmHg compression at the ankle, graduated to 15 mmHg at the knee (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sigvarisusa.com">www.sigvarisusa.com</ext-link>). At the mean leg circumferences of our group we measured compression of 35 mmHg at the ankle, graduated to 29 mmHg at the knee for this stocking, higher than quoted by the manufacturer. We found that the calf placebo may not have been a true placebo because although it applied minimal compression at the ankle and mid-calf (&#x0003c;15 mmHg) it did apply high compression just under the knee. However, we also included the ankle placebo, which could not have applied calf compression. Given that the responses were similar in all conditions, we are confident in our assertion of the lack of efficacy of the compression stocking tested. Finally, although this study was randomised, we also examined the possibility that there could be an effect or interaction between the order in which the stockings were tested and the orthostatic tolerance. This was not the case.</p><p>Our findings are compatible with earlier observations that compression of the abdomen is more effective than the calf for the improvement of OT <xref rid="pone.0028193-Podoleanu1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0028193-Denq1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. However, some subjects had modest improvements in OT from calf compression stockings, and this could be predicted from simple anthropometric variables. The question as to why the anthropometric data influence the efficacy of the stockings remains. It could be that the compression stockings were over-stretched in those with large calf circumferences relative to their shoe size, applying higher pressures than intended. If sufficient to impede venous return, this could exacerbate venous pooling and so reduce OT. In contrast, in those with a smaller calf circumference relative to their shoe size, the compression may be just sufficient to enhance venous return, and delay the onset of syncope. Further studies are required to examine these possibilities. The fact that the efficacy of the compression stockings was related to the calf circumference, and not the proportion of muscle, suggests that this effect is not mediated via alterations in the mechanics of the skeletal muscle pump with compression stockings. However, we acknowledge that with tilt testing the skeletal muscle pumps are largely inactivated, so their potential role in the efficacy of compression stockings during active standing is unclear.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Cardiovascular responses</title><p>Despite testing in healthy adults, six subjects exhibited poor OT during each test, compared to previously published &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; values <xref rid="pone.0028193-ElBedawi2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. We and others occasionally observe poor OT in apparently healthy controls <xref rid="pone.0028193-Claydon3" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028193-Petersen1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, and this false positive response during tilt testing appears to reflect impaired reflex control of the circulation that is compensated by greater activation of the skeletal muscle pump during active standing <xref rid="pone.0028193-Claydon3" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028193-Claydon4" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The fact that our control population included some individuals with poor OT does not negate our finding that compression stockings were ineffective at improving OT. In fact, it strengthens this argument, because the potential ceiling effect of testing only individuals with high OT is lessened. Furthermore, sub-analyses revealed that the influence of compression stockings was not related to the baseline OT.</p><p>Cardiovascular responses to the test were similar in all conditions at all time points. This observation underscores both the repeatability of the test, and the lack of efficacy of the compression stockings.</p><p>As expected in healthy controls, systolic and diastolic arterial pressures were maintained throughout testing, until the point of presyncope, reflecting appropriate arterial baroreflex responses to the gravitational fluid shifts imposed. At presyncope there was a sudden fall in arterial pressures, consistent with the onset of a vasovagal response <xref rid="pone.0028193-Lewis1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028193-Hainsworth2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In all subjects each test was terminated with a systolic pressure below 80 mmHg, associated with symptoms of presyncope.</p><p>We observed baroreflex-mediated tachycardia that increased in a stepwise fashion at the beginning of each test phase <xref rid="pone.0028193-Hainsworth2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The magnitude of this response was similar for all conditions. We did not observe significant bradycardia at presyncope in all subjects, likely due to either prompt termination of the test (prior to the bradycardia that typically accompanies a vasovagal response), or reflecting that this cardioinhibitory component of the reflex is not always present <xref rid="pone.0028193-Sutton2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.</p><p>SV also decreased in a stepwise fashion during the orthostatic stress, decreasing by approximately 67&#x00025; in all conditions at presyncope. This is compatible with reduced venous return when upright, secondary to venous pooling and plasma filtration <xref rid="pone.0028193-Hainsworth2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>CO was maintained throughout each test, until presyncope, when it decreased precipitously. The maintenance of CO prior to presyncope likely reflects the intact baroreflex response in these healthy control volunteers, whereby reductions in SV were accompanied by compensatory increases in HR. Indeed, the increase in HR in all conditions was approximately 73&#x00025;, closely matching the fall in SV.</p><p>We observed baroreflex-mediated increases in FVR and TPR during orthostatic stress in each condition. This response was smaller in magnitude than has previously been observed in healthy control volunteers, presumably reflecting that some volunteers in this study had poor OT, and impaired vascular responses <xref rid="pone.0028193-Hainsworth2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028193-Bush1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028193-Brown2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.</p><p>In each condition, due to the hydrostatic gradient imposed when upright, CMAP decreased similarly with the initial postural change, but was then maintained until presyncope.

Indeed, when we quantified autoregulation from the correlation coefficient and gradient describing the relationship between CMAP and CBFV (whereby a steep gradient and high correlation coefficient indicate impaired autoregulation) <xref rid="pone.0028193-Claydon2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> we confirmed similar autoregulatory control in each test condition. Accordingly, CVR responses were also similar between conditions. Again, this is compatible with minimal haemodynamic effect of the compression stockings. We also determined P<sub>ET</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> and P<sub>ET</sub>O<sub>2</sub> throughout testing, because of their known effect on CBFV <xref rid="pone.0028193-NorcliffeKaufmann1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.

However, when questioned after completion of all three conditions, volunteers could not consistently identify the compression stocking.</p><p>Thirdly, we chose to conduct testing in healthy volunteers, and it is not known whether the results would extend similarly to patient populations. However, we expect this would be the case, because a number of our control volunteers actually had poor OT, similar to that of patients with syncopal episodes.
