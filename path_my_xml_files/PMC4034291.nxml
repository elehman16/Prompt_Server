beneficial effect of probiotic and prebiotic fermented milk on the skin of healthy adult
women. Forty healthy Japanese adult female volunteers with healthy skin randomly received
either a bottle of probiotic and prebiotic fermented milk containing
<italic>Bifidobacterium breve</italic> strain Yakult and galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS)
(active group) or a non-fermented placebo milk containing neither probiotics nor GOS
(placebo group) daily for 4 weeks. Before and after intake, hydration levels and cathepsin
L-like activity in the stratum corneum and phenol levels in the serum and urine were
determined. After intake, the hydration level of the stratum corneum decreased
significantly in only the placebo group and was significantly lower than in the active
group (p=0.031). Cathepsin L-like activity, an indicator of keratinocyte differentiation,
was significantly increased in the active group (p=0.027). Serum and urine phenol levels
decreased significantly in the active group (p=0.014, p=0.002, respectively), and serum
phenol levels were significantly lower in the active group compared with the placebo group
(p=0.006). The consecutive intake of probiotic and prebiotic fermented milk can benefit
skin condition without dryness and decrease the levels of phenol production by gut
bacteria in healthy adult women.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>phenol</kwd><kwd>prebiotics</kwd><kwd>probiotics</kwd><kwd>skin condition</kwd><kwd><italic>Bifidobacterium</italic></kwd><kwd>galacto oligosaccharides</kwd><kwd>skin hydration</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Probiotics are live microorganisms such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria that confer
health benefits when administered in adequate amounts [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. On the other hand, prebiotics are
selectively fermented ingredients that alter the composition of intestinal microflora to
bring about health benefits [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Many studies have investigated the
effects of probiotic or prebiotic consumption or a combination of the two on intestinal
microbial imbalance, suppression of pathogens, prevention and treatment of intestinal and
other disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, diarrhea, infection, colon cancer, constipation
and atopic diseases [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>A survey of 600 Japanese women conducted in 2007 suggested that women who suffer from
abnormal bowel movements also experience subjective skin problems such as dryness and
dullness (our unpublished data). Indeed, intestinal conditions and/or the environment are
thought to be closely associated with skin conditions, although there is limited scientific
evidence to support this assumption. However, a small number of non-placebo-controlled
studies have shown that the intake of probiotics or yogurt improves skin conditions or
constipation in women [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>We previously showed that phenols (phenol and <italic>p</italic>-cresol) adversely affected
<italic>in vitro</italic> keratinocyte differentiation and accumulated in murine skin and
that intake of prebiotic beverages not only reduced serum phenol levels but also improved
skin conditions of female volunteers in an open clinical study [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In order to further
clarify the relationship between skin condition and the intestinal environment, we conducted
a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial to verify whether consecutive intake of
fermented milk containing a probiotic bifidobacteria and a prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharide
(GOS) affects skin condition as a primary endpoint and serum and urinary levels of phenols
as secondary endpoints in healthy adult female volunteers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Forty healthy adult female volunteers participated in the trial. Their ages ranged from

known to affect bowel function or skin condition and those who experienced severe bowel
movement problems or persistent skin conditions for one month before and during the trial.
The purpose and contents of the trial were fully explained to all subjects, whose signed

<italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> YIT 2027 and <italic>Streptococcus
thermophilus</italic> YIT 2021. These bacteria were obtained from the Culture Collection
Research Laboratory of Yakult Central Institute for Microbiological Research, Kunitachi,
Tokyo, Japan. Placebo milk was prepared with the same ingredients as active milk and with
a similar nutritional content, color, flavor and taste, although it contained lactic acid,
acetic acid and dextrin instead of <italic>B. breve</italic>, <italic>L. lactis</italic>,
<italic>S. thermophilus</italic>, GOS and polydextrose. Nutritional data of the two
milks are shown in <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. During the trial,
there were 6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>10</sup> and 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>10</sup> colony-forming units (cfu) per
100&#x02005;mL or more of <italic>B. breve</italic> and other lactic acid bacteria in the active
milk, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Design</title><p>The double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comprised a 4-week administration period that
followed a 4-week pre-administration period, during which time any probiotics that had
been previously consumed were allowed to pass through the body. The lengths of the
pre-administration and administration periods were determined from the physiology cycle
and epidermal cell turnover rate. During the pre-administration period, the subjects
refrained from consuming pro- or prebiotics before being randomly assigned to one of two
groups. During the administration period, the subjects ingested 100&#x02005;mL of active milk or
placebo milk after lunch each day.</p><p>Hydration level measurements in the stratum corneum and collection of corneocytes, urine
and blood (see below) were performed daily after each session. Throughout the trial, the
subjects complied with several rules to avoid the intake of other fermented milks, lactic
acid bacteria beverages, probiotic and prebiotic products and to not change the use of
cosmetic products or alter other lifestyle routines such as diet and exercise habits.
Cheese, pickles and pasteurized foods were allowed. The trial was carried out in Tokyo,
Japan, between October and December 2009, which is a season of particularly low
humidity.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of Hydration Level</title><p>Makeup was removed with a designated cleansing cream, and the subject&#x02019;s skin was
acclimatized for 30&#x02005;min under standardized conditions (23 &#x000b1; 1&#x000b0;C, humidity 45 &#x000b1; 5%). The
hydration level of the stratum corneum on the cheek was then measured by high-frequency
surface electrical conductance using a Skicon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 200 (IBS Co., Ltd., Shizuoka,
Japan) equipped with a probe having a diameter of 2&#x02005;mm [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Measurements were repeated five times on the same site, and the averaged
value was used for further analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Collection of Corneocytes and Assay of Cathepsin L-like Protease Activity</title><p>As previously reported [<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], third-layer
corneocytes of the stratum corneum on the inner forearm were gathered by tape stripping
(Protect Label typeA; AS ONE, Osaka, Japan). Cathepsin L-like protease activity was then
assayed according to previously reported methods [<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Briefly, tape-attached corneocytes were incubated in a reaction mixture,
which comprised 0.2&#x02005;M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.8), 0.5&#x02005;mM Z-Val-Val-Arg-MCA (synthetic
substrate for cathepsin S/L; Peptide Institute, Inc., Osaka, Japan), 2% (v/v)
N,N-dimethylformamide and 0.05% (w/v) Triton-X100 (both from Wako Pure Chemical
Industries, Osaka, Japan) for 2 hr at 37&#x000b0;C. Fluorescence intensity (excitation wavelength,
380&#x02005;nm; emission wavelength, 445&#x02005;nm) of the reaction mixture was measured with a
SpectraMax Gemini EM Fluorescence Reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), while
the amount of tape-attached protein was quantified using a BCA<sup>TM</sup> Protein Assay
Reagent (Thermo Scientific, Chicago, IL, USA) for 30&#x02005;min at room temperature; the
absorbance at 492&#x02005;nm was read with a Bio Kinetics Reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA) using
a BSA standard curve. The relative activity of cathepsin L-like protease was expressed as
fluorescence intensity per&#x02005;mg protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Collection of Urine and Blood</title><p>Early-morning urine was collected using URO CATCH II<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (ATLETA Inc, Osaka,
Japan) containing 0.5&#x02005;mg neomycin trisulfate salt hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA). Blood was collected from an arm vein and centrifuged at 2,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic>

analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of Phenols</title><p>Levels of phenols (phenol and <italic>p</italic>-cresol) in serum and urine were analyzed
by high-performance lipid chromatography (HPLC) [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] with some modifications. A total of
25&#x02005;&#x000b5;L serum, 475&#x02005;&#x000b5;L Milli-Q water, 200&#x02005;&#x000b5;L concentrated HCl and 10&#x02005;&#x000b5;L internal standard
(1&#x02005;mg 4-chlorophenol in 300&#x02005;&#x000b5;L Milli-Q water) were mixed and heated at 100&#x000b0;C for 60&#x02005;min to
hydrolyze the phenol conjugates. After cooling on ice, 2&#x02005;mL ether was added to the mixture
and agitated. Then, 1&#x02005;mL of ether layer was taken and neutralized with 1&#x02005;mL 0.05 N NaOH /
MeOH. After drying with a N<sub>2</sub> purge, the residue was dissolved in 200&#x02005;&#x000b5;L ethyl
acetate and filtered through an 0.45-&#x003bc;m Ultrafree-MC filter unit (Millipore, Billerica,
MA, USA) to prepare the HPLC sample.</p><p>An HPLC system consisting of an Alliance<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 2695 chromatographic system equipped

1-&#x003bc;L HPLC sample was automatically injected and eluted with 1% aqueous phosphoric acid
solution:acetonitrile (80:20 v/v) at a flow rate of 1&#x02005;mL/min at 40&#x000b0;C to monitor
fluorescence intensity (excitation at 260&#x02005;nm and emission at 305&#x02005;nm). Phenol levels were
calculated using the standard curve of the peak height ratio between phenol (Wako Pure
Chemical Industries) or <italic>p</italic>-cresol (Tokyo Chemical Industry, Tokyo, Japan)
and the internal standard (4-chlorophenol, Tokyo Chemical Industry). Urine creatinine
levels were determined with the Creatinine-test Wako (Wako Pure Chemical Industries).
Urine phenol levels were corrected according to urine creatinine levels, and the changes
were expressed as&#x02005;&#x000b5;M phenols per&#x02005;mM creatinine.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Data were expressed as means &#x000b1; SD. The paired t-test was used to analyze changes in
hydration level, differences in cathepsin L-like activity and levels of phenols before and
after the administration period in each group. Hydration level, cathepsin L-like activity
and levels of phenols after the administration period were compared between groups using
analysis of covariance adjusted for each baseline level. The SAS Preclinical Package

and cathepsin L-like protease activity in the stratum corneum of healthy adult women [<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Phenols can serve as reliable biomarkers of the gut environment because levels of phenolic
metabolites are influenced by the frequency and condition of bowel movements. The production
of phenols is inhibited at low pH [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, an increase in intestinal organic acid
level leads to a reduction in phenol-producing bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae,
<italic>Clostridium</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The present double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial demonstrated that intake of
a fermented milk containing <italic>B. breve</italic> strain Yakult and GOS prevented
hydration level decreases in the stratum corneum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig.
1</xref>), increased cathepsin L-like protease activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref>) and reduced phenol levels in serum and urine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3</xref>) in healthy adult female volunteers. <italic>B.
breve</italic> strain Yakult and GOS, a typical probiotic and prebiotic, respectively,
have previously been reported to exhibit beneficial effects (increase in indigenous
bifidobacteria, regulation of the functions of the intestines, improvement of intestinal
flora and so on) [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], so their intestinal regulation is believed to have contributed to the current
reduction in serum and urine phenol levels.</p><p>The fermented milk (active milk) contained <italic>L. lactis</italic> YIT 2027 and
<italic>S. thermophilus</italic> YIT 2021 at about same cfu level as <italic>B.
breve</italic> strain Yakult, suggesting that these bacteria could have possibly
participated in the effect. However, the tolerance of these bacteria to artificial gastric
and bile acids was shown to be lower than that of <italic>B. breve</italic> strain Yakult
(unpublished data). Therefore, it is speculated that a less viable number of these bacteria
reaches the intestine and that the effect on intestinal environments is less than that of
<italic>B. breve</italic> strain Yakult, although we have not yet examined whether they
affect intestinal environments.</p><p>The measured serum phenol levels in this study were higher than those reported previously
[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], which may reflect the different ratio of
deconjugation due to different methods of sample preparation (especially hydrolyzed
conditions).</p><p>The present findings show that the hydration level of the stratum corneum was maintained at
a constant level in the active group but decreased in the placebo group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref>). As the trial was carried out during the fall
and winter months, outdoor temperature and humidity were gradually decreasing, which has
previously been demonstrated to be associated with a decrease in hydration level of the
stratum corneum and deterioration of skin condition in Tokyo residents [<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Clarys et al. [<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] reported that the hydration levels of dry skin range from 40&#x02013;50 &#x003bc;S and that
those of hydrated skin were about 200 &#x003bc;S as measured by a Skicon&#x000ae;. It therefore appears that
the decreased hydration level observed in the placebo group represents dry skin based on
seasonal environment changes. On the other hand, the skin of subjects in the active group
maintained a higher hydration level, indicating that the skin moisturizing effect was
retained.</p><p>Cathepsin L activity can be viewed as a good indicator of keratinocyte differentiation
conditions, as it is known that proteolysis by cathepsin L activates transglutaminase 3, a
key enzyme in the production of stratum corneum [<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].
Normal keratinocyte differentiation has been reported to be of great importance in
maintaining homeostasis of the epidermal architecture [<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], so differentiation disturbances could conceivably reduce the hydration level
of the stratum corneum as a result of skin barrier dysfunction. In the present study,
reduction of phenol levels is believed to have induced keratinocyte differentiation
improvement, leading to increased cathepsin L-like protease activity and the prevention of
dryness. However, the results of this study are insufficient to prove a cause-effect
relationship between the reduction in phenol level and the effect on the skin hydration
level. Further validation is therefore required to fully understand the cause-effect
relationship.</p><p>Isawa et al. reported in an open study that intake of yogurt is beneficial for skin
conditions in adult female volunteers with chronic constipation and dry skin [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, their study was not placebo controlled, and
there were no positive data for serum markers associated with skin conditions. Therefore,
the present trial is the first double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study to verify
that the intake of probiotics and prebiotics is beneficial for maintaining healthy skin in
healthy adult women. These findings suggest that human skin condition is improved because of
the suppression of phenol production by gut bacteria due to the maintenance of a favorable
intestinal environment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>It is generally accepted that several factors such as lifestyle, dietary habits,
ultraviolet radiation and the enteral environment are associated with the condition of human
skin. In this study, we focused on phenols produced by gut bacteria.</p><p>It appears that consecutive intake of fermented milk containing <italic>B. breve</italic>
strain Yakult and GOS maintains and promotes a healthy stratum corneum and reduces the
intestinal production of phenols that are potentially harmful to the skin in healthy adult
women; this may be involved in the promotion not only of intestinal but also skin health.
However, further study is required to clarify the detailed mechanism of the effects of
fermented milk on skin health and the relationship between the intestinal environment and
skin condition.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Mrs. Harue Shibahara-Sone, Mrs. Naomi Harima-Mizusawa, Mr. Atsushi Gomi and Dr.
