The questionnaire was reviewed by the supervising consultant cardiologist. The study was carried out in a total of three visits: V1 (Day 1), V2 (Day 29), and V3 (Day 57). On V1, patients eligible for the study were interviewed and the blood pressure was measured after obtaining signed informed consent from them. The three readings of blood pressure and pulse rate were measured using a digital sphygmomanometer during each visit and the mean of these readings was considered for each visit. A total of 60 patients were divided into six groups consisting of ten patients. Patients in groups I, II, and III were given nebivolol in doses of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg, respectively and those in groups IV, V, and VI were given sustained released metoprolol succinate in doses of 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg, respectively.</p><p>The patients were called for follow-up visits, V2 and V3, after 28 days and 56 days, respectively.

The result of this analysis was used to provide the final comparison of data to finalize the study results. Parameters like the Level of Significance were calculated based on the data related to drug efficacy using paired and unpaired T-test.

In the added presence of CVD or target organ damage, only nine patients would require such BP reduction to prevent one death.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Numerous classes of antihypertensive agents are available, and B-blockers were among those previously recommended as a first-line treatment option in patients with uncomplicated, mild to moderate essential hypertension.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Metoprolol is the cardioselective beta-1-adrenoreceptor blocker conventionally used to treat hypertensive patients particularly in developing countries such as India. Nebivolol is a potent, highly cardioselective beta-blocker with a unique hemodynamic profile compared with other cardioselective beta-blockers, such as metoprolol. The blood pressure lowering effects of nebivolol could be attributed to b1 adrenoceptor antagonism, modulation of the endothelial Nitric Oxide (NO) system, increasing the liberation of NO, resulting in coronary and systemic vasodilation and, thereby, a reduction in peripheral resistance and counteraction of endothelial dysfunction and additionally, an increase in stroke volume, associated with a reduction in vascular resistance, resulting in a maintained cardiac output despite reduced heart rate.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Christine Espinola-Klein <italic>et al</italic>. carried out a study to evaluate the effects and tolerability of nebivolol in comparison with metoprolol in these patients. In conclusion, &#x003b2;-blocker therapy was well-tolerated in patients with intermittent claudication and arterial hypertension during a treatment period of &#x02248; 1 year. In the direct comparison, there was no significant difference between nebivolol and metoprolol.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Furthermore, Van Bortel LM <italic>et al</italic>. performed a meta-analysis of efficacy and tolerability of nebivolol compared with other anti- hypertensive drugs. Twelve randomized controlled studies were included in which nebivolol 5 mg once daily was compared with the recommended clinical doses of other antihypertensive drugs (<italic>n</italic> = 9), placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 2), and both (<italic>n</italic> = 1). Although not definitive, this meta-analysis suggests that nebivolol 5 mg is likely to have advantages over existing antihypertensives and may have a role in the treatment of hypertension.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In another study, 16 of 82 (20%) and 25 of 73 (34%) patients reported adverse events while receiving nebivolol 5 mg once daily or metoprolol 100 mg twice daily, respectively.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] However, the cost of nebivolol per tablet is higher than that of metoprolol per tablet, a factor that discourages the preference of the former over the latter.</p><p>This pharmacoeconomic study was carried out for a comparative evaluation of the cost effectiveness of nebivolol and sustained released metoprolol succinate in hypertensive patients. There was a statistical as well as clinically significant difference in the efficacy of both the molecules. As per this comparative analysis, it was found that nebivolol has better efficacy than metoprolol in terms of reducing both systolic as well as diastolic blood pressure. In this study, it was evident that nebivolol produces less adverse effects and ensures a better quality of life than metoprolol.</p><p>The study results showed significant differences in the cost of both the molecules. The cost per reduction in systolic blood pressure in mm of Hg per day was found to be 0.60, 0.70, and 1.06 INR by nebivolol at different doses respectively the same being 0.93, 1.18, 1.25 INR by sustained released metoprolol succinate at different equivalent doses respectively. The cost per reduction in diastolic blood pressure in mmHg per day was found to be 0.83, 1.04, and 1.37 INR for nebivolol at different doses respectively the same being 1.15, 1.40, 1.44 INR for different equivalent doses of sustained released metoprolol succinate, respectively.</p><p>This analysis shows that nebivolol is more cost-effective than extended release metoprolol succinate in the treatment of hypertensive also offering a favorable adverse effect profile and quality of life in comparison to the latter. Hypertension, given its chronicity and associated morbidity and mortality, constitutes a significant disease burden to the society, both in terms of the health-related repercussions as well as financial costs incurred due to morbidity and the cumulative cost of drug therapy. As neither the symptoms of hypertension nor the beneficial effects of lowering blood pressure are readily apparent to patients, it is important to administer drugs that are cost-effective and have minimal adverse effects. This is particularly important in a developing country like India, where, the accretive cost of long-term therapy is often a significant deterrent to patient compliance. The results of this study contribute towards decision making involved in formulary management and by clinicians treating patients with hypertension.</p><p>The limitations of the study include the small sample size and recall bias commonly associated with survey-based studies. Similar studies on a larger scale would help eliminate this error and help make a categorical conclusion about the superiority of nebivolol over metoprolol.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>We would like to express our gratitude to everyone who was instrumental in the formulation of this study.
