Stroke is commonly associated with insomnia; both insomnia and stroke have been effectively treated with acupuncture for a long time. The aim of this proposed trial is to assess the therapeutic effect of acupuncture on insomnia following stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This proposed study is a single-center, single-blinded (patient-assessor-blinded), parallel-group randomized controlled trial. We will randomly assign 60 participants with insomnia following stroke into two groups in a 1:1 ratio. The intervention group will undergo traditional acupuncture that achieves the <italic>De-qi</italic> sensation, and the control group will receive sham acupuncture without needle insertion. The same acupoints (DU20, DU24, EX-HN3, EX-HN22, HT7, and SP6) will be used in both groups. Treatments will be given to all participants three times a week for the subsequent 4&#x000a0;weeks. The primary outcome will be the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The secondary outcomes will be: the Insomnia Severity Index; sleep efficacy, sleep awakenings, and total sleep time recorded via actigraphy; the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; the Stroke-Specific Quality of Life score; the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The use of estazolam will be permitted and regulated under certain conditions. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 2&#x000a0;weeks after treatment commencement, 4&#x000a0;weeks after treatment commencement, and at the 8-week follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This proposed study will contribute to expanding knowledge about acupuncture treatment for insomnia following stroke. This will be a high-quality randomized controlled trial with strict methodology and few design deficits. It will investigate the effectiveness of acupuncture as an alternative treatment for insomnia following stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Chinese Clinical Trial Registry identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chictr.org.cn/index.aspx">ChiCTR-IIC-16008382</ext-link>.

Cerebrovascular disease is a major chronic disease in China, ranked third among the most common causes of death for urban residents and first for rural residents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Stroke morbidity in China is 89.6&#x02013;314 out of every 100,000 in men and 76.7&#x02013;212.2 out of every 100,000 in women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Stroke can be divided into two major types based on the type of pathological process: hemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke. The incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in China declined by 1.7% over a recent 21-year period, but that of ischemic stroke increased by 8.7% annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Common post-stroke complications include sleep disorders (SD), such as insomnia, sleep apnea, and daytime sleepiness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and SD continues to be the most unrecognized modifiable risk factor for stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Untreated SD causes cognitive dysfunction, altered mood, sleepiness, and fatigue, and may impede stroke rehabilitation, lengthen hospital stay, influence stroke outcomes, and increase the possibility of stroke recurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>One of the most common SD associated with stroke is insomnia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Insomnia is characterized by difficulty in falling asleep and staying asleep, early morning awakening, and nonrestorative sleep. The primary pharmacological treatments for insomnia are benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepine sedatives, and melatonin agonists. Although effective pharmacologic treatments for insomnia are available, these medications often cause side effects such as residual daytime sedation, drowsiness, dizziness, lightheadedness, cognitive impairment, motor incoordination, and dependence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The mainstay of nonpharmacologic intervention for insomnia is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). However, CBT often causes an acute reduction in total sleep time (TST) during the first few weeks of treatment, which means that SD improvements with CBT require long-term implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Faced with the limitations of currently available insomnia treatments, more people are seeking complementary and alternative medicine options. According to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture provides overall coordination to help the body achieve a state of relative equilibrium of yin and yang, restoring its physiological function and regulating the sleep-awake cycle. Recently, the frequency of visits to acupuncturists has markedly increased in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]; however, there has been little focus on research into acupuncture for insomnia following stroke. Two recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) had shown that insomnia following stroke was positively affected by intradermal acupuncture and low-frequency electric stimulation at acupoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, these RCTs had methodological deficits, including problems with randomization, lack of sample size estimation, blinding issues, no mention of acupuncturist certification, and no use of the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These design deficits make their findings far from conclusive. More high-quality clinical RCTs are required to investigate the effectiveness of acupuncture treatment for insomnia following stroke. In this proposed RCT, we aim to investigate the effectiveness of acupuncture for insomnia following stroke.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Hypotheses</title><p>

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size calculation for our RCT is based on the change in the PSQI score. According to previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], a sample size of 24 participants should be recruited in each group. Assuming about a 20% dropout rate, we estimate that a total of 60 participants should be recruited for this RCT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Randomization</title><p>We plan to use the random block method. An independent researcher, who has no contact with any participant, will use SPSS version 23.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) to generate a random number table to divide the eligible participants in a 1:1 ratio into the intervention group and the control group. The random allocation sequence will be generated in a block of 3. The researcher will then make random allocation cards and seal each card in an opaque envelope whose number is the same as the number on the card. According to the time order in which patients are asked to go to the hospital, another researcher will arrange the patients into different groups and inform the acupuncturists of the group assignment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Blinding method</title><p>This is a single-blinded (patient-assessor-blinded) study. Participants will be asked to wear an eye-patch in a separate quiet space before treatment, and will remain blinded during the whole treatment. Except for the acupuncturists, all other researchers (including the statisticians, outcome assessors, and data analysts) will be blinded to the group assignment. We will attempt to validate the successful implementation of the blinding method. At first treatment, all patients will be told that the needling sensation that they are experiencing is the real sensation of acupuncture. In addition, all researchers will undergo training on the specifications of this RCT before commencement, and will strictly adhere to the separation principle of each department. The primary blinding method was successfully implemented by Lao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] in a trial to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture treatment for postoperative oral surgery pain. We used this report as a reference to improve the design of our RCT and to ensure successful completion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Safety assessment</title><p>Participants will be asked to report any adverse event or related information after acupuncture treatment. The detail of every adverse event will be measured by Dr. Francisca Soto-Aguilar and reported in the Case Report Form. Adverse events include any unfavorable or unintended signs, symptoms, or diseases occurring during the whole RCT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data will be analyzed according to the ITT principle to reduce deviation. The Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test will be used to compare differences in measurement data. The rank sum test will be used to deal with ranked data, and the chi-squared test will be used to analyze categorical data. Analyses will be performed with SPSS version 23.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Monitoring</title><p>To guarantee the quality of this RCT, it will be carried out by Shanghai Municipal Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine. We will promptly input data from this RCT on the ResMan website at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chictr.org.cn/index.aspx">http://www.chictr.org.cn/index.aspx</ext-link>. As the Data Monitoring Team to identify problems in the project, examine collected data, and control bias, The Clinical Research Center of Drugs of the Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine will have access to these interim results and make the final decision to terminate the trial. A qualified clinical trial expert will be invited to monitor this RCT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Clinical trial registration</title><p>We applied for registration of this RCT in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry. This will reduce all kinds of bias in clinical research, increase the transparency of trials, ensure the high quality of clinical trials and test processes, and the credibility of results.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Discussion</title><p>Acupuncture treatment has been widely used to reduce the symptoms of insomnia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. There is minimal theoretical research or clinical RCTs on acupuncture for insomnia following stroke. This RCT will investigate the effectiveness of acupuncture in reducing insomnia following stroke. We are attempting to conduct a clinical RCT with adequate design and few deficits. We designed the sham acupuncture method without needle insertion to assess the specific effects of acupuncture rather than its placebo effect for treating insomnia following stroke. Furthermore, in contrast to the subjective assessments made in most trials, we will use actigraphy in our RCT to objectively assess the physiological changes in patients with insomnia. We will use the ITT principle to handle statistical data to reduce deviation of the RCT.</p><p>There are some inevitable limitations in this RCT. For example, it is hard to make the RCT double-blinded. The participants, the assessor, and the statistical expert will be blinded to the group assignment in this RCT; however, it will be impossible to blind the acupuncturist. This RCT is also restricted to a single-center hospital. Furthermore, although actigraphy is suitable for measuring nocturnal restlessness, it cannot differentiate between sleep stages or score rapid eye movement sleep, which may have helped to explain the mechanism of acupuncture for treating insomnia following stroke. In further studies, we may consider a multicenter clinical trial, using polysomnography as an assessment method.</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>Trial status</title><p>We started recruiting participants in July 2016.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CBT</term><def><p>Cognitive behavioral therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HADS</term><def><p>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ISI</term><def><p>Insomnia Severity Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p>Intention-to-treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NIHSS</term><def><p>National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PSQI</term><def><p>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p>Sleep disorders</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SE</term><def><p>Sleep efficacy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SS-QOL</term><def><p>Stroke-Specific Quality of Life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TST</term><def><p>Total sleep time</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Shifen Xu provided general support as the head of the Acupuncture Department in Shanghai Municipal Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and was responsible for the design of this RCT.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>This RCT is funded by the Shanghai Committee of Science and Technology, China (Grant No. 14401930900), the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Grant No. JDZX2015024), and the Shanghai Municipal Commission of Health and Family Planning (Grant No. 20154Y0107).</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of supporting data</title><p>All data are fully available without restriction.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>The trial design was developed by LXL, SFX, and WTL.
