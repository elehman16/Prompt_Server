Many surgical repair techniques have been practiced by many surgeons for correction of hypospadias anomaly. There are two methods that have been widely used, perimeatal-based flap (Mathieu) and tubularised incised-plate (TIP) urethroplasty <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The major disadvantage of Mathieu technique is that the horizontal, rounded meatus is less acceptable than the slit-like meatus of the TIP technique. In the last two decades the Mathieu procedure has become less popular than TIP and this may be due to the simplicity and the good cosmetic slit-like final appearance of the meatus of the TIP technique <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The drawbacks of TIP urethroplasty are the relatively high incidence of urethrocutaneous fistula (0&#x02013;33%) and also meatal stenosis that necessitate regular dilatation; these complications are more challenging with narrow urethral plates and flat shallow glans <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.

In all, 77 patients with distal hypospadias (coronal, sub-coronal, distal penile) presented to the outpatient clinic and were eligible to be enrolled. We excluded nine patients for the following reasons: presence of severe chordee in three, previous hypospadias surgery in five, and a poorly developed urethral plate in one. The remaining 68 patients were randomly divided using the sealed-envelope method into two groups. Group 1, included 34 patients who were managed by the Mathieu procedure plus incision of the urethral plate (Mathieu-IP); and Group 2, included 34 patients who underwent TIP urethroplasty (Snodgrass procedure).

The distance between the tip of the glans and the site of the hypospadias opening was measured. A suitable 6-F nelaton catheter was used as a tourniquet when needed. A &#x02018;U&#x02019;-shaped incision was created according to the distance measured beforehand. The width of the base end of the flap should be wider than the tip. Two lateral incisions were made parallel to the original urethral plate and deepened in the glanular part to form the glanular wings. A midline incision of the urethral plate was made extending from within the native meatus to the tip of the glans just beyond the pre-planned meatus site. Urethroplasty was completed by suturing the perimeatal-based skin flap with the edges of the urethral plate over a suitable urethral catheter using 6-0 polyglactin 910 suture in a running subcuticular manner until the tip of the glans. A dartos flap was harvested to cover the two suture lines. Then the glanular wings were closed symmetrically over the neourethra using transverse mattress 6-0 polyglactin 910 sutures in two layers. The penile shaft was covered by the available penile skin. A compression dressing with local gentamycin ointment was applied to the surgical area, and all patients received third-generation cephalosporin injection therapy for 1&#x000a0;week.

The urethral plate was tubularised, beginning proximally, and closed in two layers using 6/0 polyglactin 910 suture. The neomeatus was formed on a catheter 2 F larger than the urethral stent. A flap was harvested from the prepuce to cover the neourethra and finally glanuloplasty.

In the present study, we compared two techniques for repairing distal hypospadias; the original TIP urethroplasty and the Mathieu technique with an incision in the urethral plate modification (Mathieu-IP), with particular reference to the rate of meatal stenosis and fistula formation.</p><p>Mathieu first described his procedure for repair of distal hypospadias using a perimeatal-based flap in 1932. Since then the technique gained in popularity, as the complication rate is &#x0003c;4% in most series; however, this procedure is only used for distal hypospadias, as non-hair-bearing penile skin should be used and it is rarely used for mid-shaft hypospadias <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>In 1994, Snodgrass described TIP urethroplasty, and since then it has gained wide acceptance and become more popular with most urologists for distal and proximal hypospadias. The TIP technique is simple and gives good cosmetic results with a slit-like appearance of the final meatus. However, TIP urethroplasty has the drawbacks of the occurrence of urethrocutaneous fistula and meatal stenosis and thus the need for regular urethral dilatation, and these complications occur especially in cases with flat and narrow urethral plates <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>The cause of meatal complications in TIP is a matter of debate. Nguyen et al. <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> correlated the stenosis of the meatus with the technique used by the surgeon to tubularise the urethral plate to the tip of the glans, whereas Holland and Smith <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> stated that the urethral plate characteristics were the most significant factor in the complications of TIP, with a narrow and flat urethral plate more liable to urethral complications (stenosis and fistula) regardless of the deep incision and tubularisation of the plate.</p><p>Sarhan et al. <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> reported that a urethral plate of &#x02265;8&#x000a0;mm is crucial for the success of the TIP procedure. Also the size of the glans plays a significant role in the rate of complications after TIP rather than the type and shape of the glans (cleft or flat glans) <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Conversely, in the Mathieu procedure the creation of the neourethra is not dependent on urethral plate characteristics or the size of the glans <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>In Mathieu technique the main disadvantage is the rounded meatus that is cosmetically less acceptable than the normal slit-like meatus <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>In the present study, we compared the results of a combined Mathieu technique plus urethral plate incision (Mathieu-IP) vs standard TIP and found significant differences between the two groups for meatal stenosis and urethrocutaneous fistula rates that occurred in 21.8% of the TIP group compared with 2.9% (one case) only in Mathieu-IP group. These results agree with Aminsharifi et al. <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> who also compared the same two urethroplasty techniques and stated that the Mathieu&#x02013;IP technique had reduced rates of meatal stenosis and fistula formation and gave good acceptable cosmetic results. They found a 25% complication rate in the TIP group (three meatal stenosis and two urethrocutaneous fistulae) and no complications in the Mathieu-IP group.</p><p>Our present results are less successful than those of Aminsharifi et al. <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, as we had one case of urethrocutaneous fistula (2.9%) in the Mathieu-IP group, and this may have been due to the different inclusion criteria, as Aminsharifi et al. had no cases of chordee nor distal penile hypospadias and in ours, cases with minimal chordee (two cases, 5.9%) and distal penile hypospadias (six cases, 17.6%) were included.</p><p>Our present results also conform to those of Kiss et al. <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> who performed the Mathieu&#x02013;IP technique and reported good cosmesis and fewer complications, only one case (5.3%) of 19 cases had a urethrocutaneous fistula.</p><p>In our present study, the augmentation of the flap with a vascular dartos intermediate flap, improved the results (no cases of meatal stenosis and only one case of fistula) and this agrees with Retik et al. <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> who used an intermediate vascular layer on top of a perimeatal-based flap in 204 patients and reported a 100% success rate.</p><p>The main limitation of the present study is the relatively few patients and the lack of more functional evaluations of the toilet trained children, and this is recommended for future studies, especially when the bulk of the study cohort are toilet trained children.</p></sec><sec id="s0040"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The combined Mathieu with incision of the urethral plate technique improves the cosmetic results by producing a slit-like meatus with a lower incidence of
