The chronic character of osteoarthritis requires a long-term therapeutic treatment. In this regard life-style interventions such as physical exercises that can be carried out by the patient himself are recommended as first line treatment. There is evidence for the short-term benefit of exercise therapy in terms of pain reduction and physical functioning. Nonetheless research agendas highlight the need for multifaceted interventions that incorporate exercise strategies into patient care. Studies should be conducted with appropriate sample sizes and should allow statements on long-term effects as well as cost-utility and safety. These open questions are under the scope of this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is a controlled study in the context of health services research. The study population consists of <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1400 subjects with hip or knee osteoarthritis. The intervention group will be recruited from participants of a country-wide health insurance offer for people with hip or knee osteoarthritis. Potential participants for the control group (ratio 10:1 (control vs. intervention) will be filtered out from the insurance data base according to pre-defined matching criteria and asked by letter for their participation. The final statistical twins from the responders (1:1) will be determined via propensity score matching. The progressive training intervention comprises 8 supervised group sessions, supplemented by home exercises (2/week over 11&#x000a0;weeks). Exercises include mobilization, strengthening and training of postural control. Primary outcomes are pain and function measured with the WOMAC Index immediately after the intervention period. Among other things, health related quality of life, self-efficacy, cost utility and safety will be evaluated as secondary outcomes. Participants will be followed up 6, 12 and 24&#x000a0;month after baseline.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Results of this trial will document the effects of clinical as well as economic outcomes in a regular health care setting on the basis of a large sample size. As such, results of this trial might have great impact on future implementations of group- and home-based exercises in hip or knee osteoarthritis.</p></sec><sec><title>Trail registration</title><p>German Clinical Trial Register <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://drks-neu.uniklinik-freiburg.de/drks_web/setLocale_EN.do">DRKS00009251</ext-link>.

OA is further associated with joint stiffness, crepitus, occasional effusion, variable degrees of inflammation, functional impairment, worsening of the general health status and a decrease in health related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Several intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors are related to OA such as age (older), overweight, gender (women), genetic factors, occupational joint loads etc. In the German health reporting system 2010, approximately 27&#x000a0;% of the women and 18&#x000a0;% of the men reported a previous OA diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The true value may even be higher as not every person suffering from typical OA symptoms will consult a doctor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The knee and hip joints are the most commonly affected weight bearing joints. According to disease related symptoms and its prevalence, OA has a relevant impact on the individual person and the need for health services and consequently increases direct and indirect health care costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Cumulative cost of absence from work, medical costs and community and social services in Europe is currently estimated at 0.5&#x000a0;% of gross national product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These costs will further increase in due consideration of the demographic change with a growing number of older adults and the increasing incidence of obesity as a relevant risk factor for knee OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Research priorities should therefore be placed on the development and evaluation of effective and cost-efficient treatment strategies to counteract the aforementioned increase of personal as well as economic burden of OA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Treatment of lower limb osteoarthritis</title><p>To date joint replacement may be the only option for severe symptoms in hip or knee OA. In earlier stages, conservative therapeutic interventions are important to reduce pain and increase function and health-related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Pharmacological therapies have significant toxicities limiting their permanent use in chronic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Non-pharmaceutical interventions such as physical exercise programs are therefore important therapeutic options. Treatment effects of these programs are similar to simple analgesics and oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However reports on known side-effects such as pain increase or falls are rare, thus exercise appears to be a safe intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It is therefore hardly surprising that various international guidelines, expert committees and health institutions recommend a regular exercise regimen as a first line treatment for OA. Regimes should account for strengthening and/or low impact aerobic exercises. Further recommendations include aquatic exercises, Tai Chi, range of motion exercises and neuromuscular education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Evidence is given for the short-term efficacy of joint specific exercise programs with respect to pain reduction and increase of function in subjects with knee and hip OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>While the evidence suggests that exercise is an effective intervention further studies are needed:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>to test multi-faceted interventions that incorporate the exercise strategies into patient care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>to assess effectiveness and safety of non-pharmacological management strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>to assess the long-term effectiveness in terms of symptom relief, disease progression and exercise adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>to assess efficiency of the intervention from an economic perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>to assess which professional can best deliver the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>to conduct studies with appropriate sample sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p></list-item></list></p><p>The above mentioned research topics will be addressed in this study on exercise intervention in subjects with hip and/or knee OA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study purpose</title><p>This study will be conducted in the context of health services research.

The number of participants per exercise course is restricted to twelve persons. The recruitment period covers two course terms. Assuming twelve participants in each course, the intervention can be provided to approximately 2000 insurants. Eligible patients can participate on condition that their physicians prescribe the health care offer. Interested patients register for the intervention program at the location nearby and will be informed about the accompanying scientific evaluation of the exercise program. In this context, exclusion criteria are requested and only eligible patients will finally be allowed for the exercise intervention. Further details including the study information sheet for potential study participants, the informed consent and a check-list for all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be delivered by mail.

In the context of all aforementioned stages it will be pointed out that study participation is not a presupposition for exercise participation. Eligibility of the patients to enter the exercise program and to participate in the study will finally be determined by checking the inclusion- and exclusion criteria for the exercise intervention 1st in the context of the first visit and 2nd by information recorded via the self-administered questionnaire at t0 (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

The HKT was modified to allow its application for knee patients and reduced to 11&#x000a0;weeks with 8 supervised training sessions.</p><p>The HKT contains 8&#x000a0;weeks of group (1&#x000d7; / week, 60&#x02013;90&#x000a0;min) and home based exercises (2&#x000d7; / week, 30&#x02013;40&#x000a0;min) followed by 3&#x000a0;weeks of home-based exercises only (2&#x000d7; / week, 30&#x02013;40&#x000a0;min). The 8-week group sessions include theoretical education and practical contents and enhance social contacts. The educational part improves the accomplishment of exercises. In this regard, participants are introduced into anatomical basics. They learn how to find and feel anatomical landmarks such as the spina iliaca anterior superior or the junction from the pelvis to the lower spine. Anatomical landmarks are important reference points to control a proper exercise execution. Participants are further introduced into training principles. They learn how to rate their subjective physical strain, how to deal with pain and how to report their home training sessions and potential adverse events in the training log. The theoretical contents are imparted in the supervised training sessions and can also be read up in the exercise manual that every participant receives. The supervised sessions enhance social contacts by having group-based introductions and feedback before and after the exercises, and by employing partner and group exercises.

However, aside from statistical power, a sufficiently large sample is necessary to obtain representative results for the general population and to allow sustainable statements on the effectiveness and efficiency of the intervention for secondary clinical as well as economic outcomes. We therefore plan to include all eligible patients willing to participate in the study and finally assume a number of n&#x02009;=&#x02009;700 in each group. This number takes into consideration the degree of capacity utilization of hip and knee training courses as well as the number of subjects non eligible due to inclusion- and exclusion criteria as well as subjects refusing consent to participate in the study (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><p>The empirical basis of the sample size estimation for primary outcomes was retrieved from the paper by Krauss et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In this randomized controlled trial (RCT), intra-individual differences of WOMAC subscale pain and WOMAC subscale physical function identically showed an effect size of about 0.5 between the intervention and the control group (pain, intervention: &#x02212;8.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;13.9, control: &#x02212;1.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;15.3, physical function, intervention: &#x02212;8.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;13.4, control: &#x02212;2.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;12.9).</p><p>Based on the previous results of the RCT and the so-called efficacy-effectiveness gap between RCTs and studies under real life conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] we finally assume an effect size of ES&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.3.</p><p>Due to the fact that we want to test the two endpoints (pain and physical function) simultaneously and without hierarchical order, we choose a level of significance of 0.025 (two-sided, Bonferroni correction) and a power of 0.90. This leads to a sample size of 278 subjects per group in the parallel group design without cluster effects (nquery release 7.0). The drop-out rate in the intervention group of the above mentioned RCT was 8&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. As this value is quite low, we assume a somewhat higher number of non-finishers and estimate the rate to be 20&#x000a0;%. Thus 350 subjects should be allocated to each treatment arm.</p><p>However, in our study, cluster effects may appear for subjects within identical training groups: We expect 700 included subjects participating in 170 different training courses. Thus four participants of each training group will averagely be subjects of the study (whereas the rest of the group participants are no study subjects). With a rather high intra class correlation of 0.33 we obtain a variance inflation factor of 2 for the intervention. Therefore, with 700 subjects per study arm the aimed power should be reached.</p><p>We refrain from analyzing our data using a matched-pair design as propensity score matching does not guarantee that individual pairs will be well-matched on the full set of covariates, only that groups of individuals with similar propensity scores will have similar covariate distributions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Despite this fact, propensity score matching including among other variables baseline WOMAC scores as matching factors may reduce variance of outcome measures and therefore probably increase the power of the study further if the propensity score is included as covariate in the statistical evaluation model.

If a dominant strategy doesn&#x02019;t exist (i.e.: lower costs and higher health related effects in the intervention group), the costs will be related to the effects. The costs (including the supplementary costs of the pilot offer for participants) will be related to the differences between the groups (Double-Difference Method, two years pre and two years post intervention) in Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs, equation 1) and health related effects (WOMAC Index: equation 2). The costs of the intervention will further be related to the differences in costs (Double-Difference Method of the health care costs (unspecific health care costs (overall costs), specific health care costs and the costs for days of disability (human capital approach): equation 3). The time to surgery will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. For the economic evaluation all participants have to be members of the insurance the period from 24&#x000a0;months before baseline (tm24) up to 24&#x000a0;month after baseline (t24).</p><p>Equation 1: Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA)&#x02009;=&#x02009;Incremental Cost Utility Ratio (ICUR)<disp-formula id="Equa"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

All participants are expected to have completed the intervention period in July 2016. All participants are expected to have completed the study by February 2018 (last patient out).</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Expert report</title><p>The study will be assessed by an independent organization (XCENDA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.xcenda.de/index.php/willkommen.html">http://www.xcenda.de/index.php/willkommen.html</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Discussion</title><p>Despite the strong evidence for the short-term effects of physical exercises on symptoms in knee and hip OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], many open questions remain with respect to (I) the incorporation of interventions into patient care in a regular health care setting, (II) long-term effects of the intervention as well as its impact on disease progression, (III) dose&#x02013;response-relationship according to FITT principles (frequency, intensity, type and time of training) and (IV) knowledge on variables that act as confounders for treatment response. Open questions are also related to (V) the economic efficiency of exercise interventions in the treatment of hip and knee OA and to (VI) safety aspects of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>This study proceeds in a real health care setting and has the potential to answer questions in the aforementioned research areas.</p><p>(I) This study allows us to determine whether the efficacy of an exercise intervention proofed in a randomized controlled trial can be transferred into effectiveness into a real life situation with less standardized and controlled conditions. The intervention described in this study protocol has been derived from a previously tested exercise intervention in patients with hip OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Yet some adaptations to the intervention had to be made to give consideration to the needs and organizational framework of the health care provider: the formerly 12-week intervention with one supervised session/week and two additional home-exercise sessions/week was reduced to 8 supervised sessions. Patients are instructed to perform the accompanying home-exercise sessions for at least 11&#x000a0;weeks according to the exercise manual every participant receives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Aside from this change that is related to the frequency and duration of the exercise intervention, the population under consideration has been extended: the RCT was conducted on subjects with hip OA only. As prevalence for knee OA in comparison to hip OA is even higher, the program will be offered to patients with hip and/or knee OA. Subjects with knee OA will therefore substitute some of the hip-exercises with knee-specific exercises. On this note, subjects with knee OA receive an amendment for the exercise manual with knee-specific exercises. Results of this study are therefore very valuable as they allow us to verify whether an &#x0201c;evidence-based exercise intervention&#x0201d; can successfully be implemented into everyday routine or not.</p><p>(II) Our follow-up data will be gathered up to 2&#x000a0;years after the initiation of the supervised exercise intervention and will therefore give information on clinical and economic outcomes in the long-term.</p><p>(III) The intervention program of this study is predefined and we do not differentiate between different dosages. Nonetheless data on adherence to exercise can be related to effect size and may allow an interpretation on continuity of an exercise intervention in relation to response, whereby confounders for exercise adherence such as pain or dissatisfaction with the intervention etc. have to be considered as well. Another aspect that is related to exercise dosage is the possibility to compare results of this study to other interventions with different exercise frequencies, intensities, times and types of intervention (FITT). This comparison may therefore contribute to the knowledge gained with respect to dose&#x02013;response relationships of exercise interventions in OA.</p><p>(IV) Aside from the comparison of different interventions in general, an individual perspective may gather new knowledge in terms of personal contextual factors that are related to intervention outcome. Identification of possible predictors of treatment responsiveness is therefore another important issue of this research. For example data of previous studies report a gender-specific response to exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Additional confounders may be related to baseline pain level, self-efficacy, socio-demographic data etc. In the context of this study, a responder analysis will be conducted according to the OMERACT-OARSI Set of responder criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A sub-analysis comparing personal contextual factors of responders versus non-responders may allow a better understanding of relevant prerequisites for successful exercise participation and therefore facilitate individualized treatment recommendations in OA.</p><p>(V) Considering published reports on cost-effectiveness of non-pharmacologic, non-surgical interventions for hip and/or knee OA, Pinto and colleagues concluded in their review in 2012 that there is only limited evidence for the cost-effectiveness of conservative treatments for hip and knee OA. In this context they highlighted the need for more high-quality economic evaluations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Since then studies have been published that indicate no cost-saving but cost-effectiveness of exercise interventions in knee or hip OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In addition, an increasing number of study protocols include economic outcomes and underline the need for the evaluation of economic outcomes aside from clinical measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The aforementioned studies as well as the trial of this protocol will allow a better understanding of cost-utility measures in consideration of different exercise programs and populations under study.</p><p>(VI) Although non-pharmaceutical trials are not obligated by law to report on adverse events, safety should be evaluated in clinical trials. Knowledge on adverse events may allow a more precise determination of contra-indications for a given exercise setting and/or population group. Report of adverse events is also important as exercise interventions can initially result in a slight increase in pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Knowledge on potential short-term side-effects in the primary phase of the intervention period is important as it allows health care providers to inform patients about potential harms with no significant lasting effect on health outcomes. Another important safety aspect is related to frequency and severity of adverse events according to the mode of delivery: Reports on adverse events related to exercises may differ between group sessions and home-based exercises. Safety in the home setting may be hampered as exercises are not controlled by a health care professional and the environment may be less appropriate for the execution of exercises (i.e. tripping hazards are more likely in a home-based setting). Information on adverse events is requested in the self-administered questionnaires at the end of the intervention period. This study may therefore gain knowledge on safety aspects and subsequently allow recommendations to improve safety of supervised as well as independently undertaken exercises. However it has to be mentioned that a reporting bias-especially in the context of home-based exercises - cannot be ruled out, as no immediate adverse event reporting is implemented in this study.</p><p>There are further limitations to our study which are&#x02014;from our perspective&#x02014;mainly related to concomitant health care interventions, limited long&#x02014;term follow&#x02014;up data and the statistical power in terms of economic evaluations.</p><p>Referring to the first point it has to be mentioned that all participants of the study are allowed to take part in additional health care offers. This holds true for participants of the control group as well. They may also attend the hip and knee training under study within the follow-up phase. This cannot be prohibited as all insurance holders have the same rights to participate in health care services offered. The exclusive participation in the assigned intervention (supervised exercise versus matched pair control group) can therefore only be guaranteed for the first 3&#x000a0;month of the study. This timeframe is also relevant for the evaluation of the primary outcomes. To control for potential confounders related to additional health care interventions, all follow-up questionnaires ask for participation in any course or training offer.</p><p>Although follow-up data for two years will be gathered in the context of this trial, statements on the effect of the intervention in the long run such as time to surgery and disease specific health care costs may be hampered. If 24-months evaluations are positive in terms of study outcomes, a protocol amendment for a 5-year follow up may be considered.</p><p>This study has 80&#x000a0;% power for unfavorably high cluster effects, in realty probably more than 90&#x000a0;% power to detect clinical relevant changes in the primary outcomes of the trial. Aside from clinical outcomes, cost-utility measures are of special interest in this study. Yet economic outcomes are expected to have much smaller effect sizes. We therefore decided to include all eligible patients, willing to participate in the trial, to increase power for the economic evaluation.</p><p>In due consideration of the burden of OA from an individual as well as economic perspective, the importance to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of conservative treatment strategies is obvious. This applies in particular for lifestyle interventions such as physical exercises as they can be carried out by the patient himself and are therefore of special importance in the treatment of chronic diseases such as OA. Results of this trial will document accurately the effects of exercises on clinical and economic outcomes as well as safety aspects in a health care setting on the basis of a large sample size. As such, results of this trial should provide externally valid exercise recommendations in hip or knee osteoarthritis.</p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Data privacy, ethics approval and consent to participate</title><p>Data privacy is warranted by including different parties to guarantee pseudonymization of patient data derived from different data sources.
