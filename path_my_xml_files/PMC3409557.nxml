DTP vaccinated children had a better anthropometric status for all indices than DTP unvaccinated children. Small mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) was the strongest predictor of mortality. The death rate ratio (DRR) for DTP vaccinated versus DTP unvaccinated children differed significantly for girls (DRR 2.45; 95% CI 0.93 to 6.45) and boys (DRR 0.53; 95% CI 0.23 to 1.20) (p=0.018, homogeneity test). Adjusting for MUAC, the overall effect for DTP vaccinated children was 2.62 (95% CI 1.34 to 5.09); DRR was 5.68 (95% CI 1.83 to 17.7) for girls and 1.29 (95% CI 0.56 to 2.97) for boys (p=0.023, homogeneity test).

Children less than 3 years of age are visited every 3 months to collect information on breastfeeding, hospitalisation, vaccination status, background factors and survival. Furthermore, BHP registers all births at the maternity ward in Bissau and LBW babes and their mothers are driven home to facilitate follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>LBW cohort</title><p>BCG is not given at birth to LBW children. The LBW cohort was initiated to study the impact of BCG at birth and neonatal vitamin A on infant mortality in a randomised trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> NCT00146302 and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> NCT00168610).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> Since twins weigh less than singletons, a large proportion of LBW cohorts are twins. LBW children were enrolled at the maternity ward or at the first health centre contact after birth. We used the data on routine vaccinations to study the impact of DTP on mortality between the 2-month and 6-month visits.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Information on vaccinations</title><p>At each visit, weight, length, arm circumference, head circumference and abdominal circumference were measured and a tuberculin skin test carried out. Importantly, it was also registered whether the vaccination card was seen and all vaccine dates were noted. Vaccinations after the 2-month visit were not used in the survival analysis as this would have introduced survival bias. A total of 13 children received measles vaccine (MV) at 4&#x000bd;&#x02013;5 months of age as part of a trial of early MV.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> We also asked to see the vaccination cards of children who had died.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Child deaths</title><p>Around 3 months after a death, a verbal autopsy was conducted by a clinician who assigned a probable diagnosis.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The main outcome was the effect of early DTP (yes/no) on mortality analysed in a Cox proportional hazards model with age as underlying time. Children entered at 2 months of age and were followed to death, measles vaccination, migration or the 6-month visit, whichever came first. We adjusted for possible dependence of life-times of twins by calculating standard errors that allow for intra-twin correlation (robust standard errors and 95% CIs) as 22% of the children were twins. We conducted a secondary analysis in which children were followed to 9 months of age, the age of routine measles vaccination; this analysis is less certain because date of death was collected several months later and some children may have been vaccinated against measles before 9 months unbeknownst to us.</p><p>The randomisation to BCG at birth or later influenced the sequence of vaccinations and all analyses were therefore adjusted for the BCG arm. The results are presented as death rate ratios (DRR) with 95% CIs. The assumption of proportionality in the Cox model was checked using Schoenfeld residuals (p&#x0003e;0.20, for both sex-specific DTP effects adjusting for BCG arm and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC)). The effects of anthropometric indices were modelled as quantitative variables expressing a change in mortality per unit increase of the index. We tested for log-linearity of quantitative variables (eg, weight) using a quadratic factor. We used a &#x02018;homogeneity test&#x02019; to represent a test of no interaction. The Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method was used to draw crude cumulated mortality curves. We assessed nutritional status by anthropometric measurements. We calculated weight-for-age z scores and height-for-age z scores using WHO child growth standards (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/childgrowth/software/">http://www.who.int/childgrowth/software/</ext-link>). The weight-for-height z score (WHZ) had too many missing values (N=29) because the programme does not calculate scores for children with a height of less than 45 cm. Results for WHZ have therefore not been presented. Nutritional status influenced time to DTP vaccination and we therefore controlled for a healthy-vaccinee effect by adjusting for anthropometric measurements.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s8"><title>Results</title><sec id="s9"><title>The LBW cohort</title><p>The follow-up in the LBW cohort is described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>.

Third, follow-up was very good for a highly mobile urban population. Fourth, we could control for many nutritional, health and socio-economic indicators.</p><p>The effect of early DTP did not depend on the timing of DTP vaccination. We focused on the 2&#x02013;6-month period for which the data quality would be best, but the negative effect remained the same until 9 months of age when the children received MV. Only half the children followed the WHO schedule of BCG at birth and DTP later. Since this group displayed the strongest negative effect, we may have underestimated the negative effect of DTP.</p></sec><sec id="s17"><title>Interpretation</title><p>Comparing subsequent mortality for DTP vaccinated and DTP unvaccinated children at the 2-month visit is not equivalent to testing DTP vaccination versus no DTP vaccination because more than two-thirds of the unvaccinated children received DTP during follow-up. However, this comparison measures the effect of early DTP vaccination. Since the healthiest children were vaccinated early, DTP vaccinated children should have had lower mortality than the delayed DTP group. It has been suggested that sick children come to the health centre for treatment and receive DTP vaccination simultaneously and that this could explain why DTP vaccination is associated with increased mortality.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> That is not the case in Bissau. The children are coming to the health centre either for treatment or vaccination.</p><p>The crude and adjusted analyses gave similar results. We see no selection bias which can explain why DTP has different effects for boys and girls or the higher mortality among DTP vaccinated girls. Sex-preferential treatment cannot explain this pattern. After measles vaccination girls have lower mortality than boys. Furthermore, in the present study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">table 3</xref>), girls had higher mortality than boys among DTP vaccinated children but lower mortality than boys in the delayed DTP group. The DTP related excess mortality was not seen merely among malnourished girls at risk of death. Hence, DTP may deregulate the female immune system so that subsequent unrelated infections are fought inefficiently.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>

Little is known about pertussis-related child mortality in the prevaccination era in Africa. Only one community study in Kenya has assessed the impact of pertussis: in the early phase of the vaccination programme, case fatality was 1.3% and pertussis accounted for 6% of infant deaths.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref> With increases in mortality of 80&#x02013;150% in observational studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref> DTP is likely associated with increased female mortality also in situations without herd immunity.</p><p>The inconsistency between the evidence and current policy is unacceptable. The Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety has indicated that it will monitor the non-specific effects of vaccines,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref> but also asserted that compelling evidence from observational studies is unlikely. No official initiative has been taken to resolve the contradictions. Given the implications of the negative non-specific effects of DTP for girls, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of delaying DTP seem justified.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref> The working group on the non-specific effects of vaccines came to similar conclusions, and has ranked an RCT of DTP as a high priority.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="con"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> CSB and PA were the chief investigators and are guarantors.
