therapeutic effects on stroke patients&#x02019; functional ability. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty
stroke patients were assigned to one of two groups: inspiratory muscle training (n=10),
and control (n=10), randomization. The inspiratory muscle training participants undertook
an exercise program for 30 minute per times, 5 times a week for 6 weeks. The investigator
measured the patients&#x02019; trunk impairment scale (TIS) and 6 minute walking test (6MW) for
functional ability before and after IMT. [Results] The TIS appeared some significant
differences in both groups before and after the training. The 6MW test showed some
significant differences in the inspiratory muscle training group, but didn&#x02019;t show any
significant difference in the control group. And the differences in both groups after
depending the inspiratory muscle training were significantly found in the tests of TIS and
6MW test [Conclusion] The results showed that the inspiratory muscle training in stroke
patients are correlated with the trunk stability and locomotion ability, suggesting that
physical therapist must take into consideration the inspiratory muscle training, as well
as functional training to improve physical function in stroke patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Inspiratory muscle training</kwd><kwd>Trunk impairment scale</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke patients can experience hypoxia due to oxygen saturation and decreased

were people who have been diagnosed with a stroke 6 months or longer, hemiplegic patients,
through computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance image (MRI). We used a randomized
controlled trial and assigned 10 people to the IMT group and the other 10 to the control
group. All the subjects sufficiently listened to explanation on this study and consented to
participate in the experiment. Inclusion criteria of the study and consented to participate
in the experiment. Inclusion criteria of the study criteria of the study are as follow; had
no visual field defect and auditory sense; Scored at least 24 on the Mini-Mental State
Examination-Korean; Independent sitting and gait; had no pulmonary embolus; no orthopedic
problem, or unstable cardiac condition; had not undergone chest or abdominal surgery<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.
This study was approved by the University institutional review board and was conducted in
accordance with the ethical standard of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>Both groups received a temporizing Neuro Developmental Treatment (NDT) physical therapy for
30 minutes per time, 3 times a week, for 6 weeks. The experimental group received additional
IMT. IMT was performed using a threshold, Respifit S (Inspiratory &#x00026; Expiratory
Rehabilitation System, Biegler GmbH, Australia).</p><p>IMT was a measure of the initial maximum inspiratory pressure and then the resistance was
conducted in 80% of the measurements. We have calculated subjects&#x02019; Pi<sub>max</sub> (Maximal
static inspiratory pressure) and began training with 80% of the maximum resistance. The
amount of inspiration and expiration were displayed and if the amount was over 80%, it was
recorded as a success and less than 80% was recorded as failure. If subject failed more than
three times, we have reset the Pi<sub>max</sub> and continued the test new Pi<sub>max</sub>.
IMT is set up 10 times in one training set and the two sets were carried out, it took a
break of 10 seconds between each set<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Before the 6 minute walking (6MW) test, a 10 meter walking test was conducted twice to
determine the ability of the subjects to walking ability ahead of the test. They took a 6
minute walking (6MW) test with a break time. The trunk impaired scale (TIS) consists of
three items: static sitting balance, dynamic sitting balance and co-ordination (The trunk
impairment scale: a new tool to measure motor impairment of the trunk after stroke). TIS
performed three times in order not to achieve the maximum value in one or both attempts.</p><p>All analysis were performed using SPSS for Window version 18.0 and expressed as mean &#x000b1;
standard deviation (SD). The change in each group&#x02019;s 6MW test and TIS between before and
after the IMT program using the paired t-test. Comparisons between groups were performed via
the independent t-test. P values less than 0.05 at the 95% confidence level were considered
significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Investigating the IMT group&#x02019;s functional ability, there appeared significant difference in

also impacts the electronic signal of the paralyzed side of the patients&#x02019; thoracic area, it
also directly and indirectly affects cardiopulmonary function<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. These phenomena show the weakness of the paralyzed side of the
diaphragm and the intercostal muscle, and the reduction of abdominal muscle and pulmonary
function weakness, which makes it difficult to control posture and which can result in
functional movement disorders<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus,
asymmetric posture, decreased muscle strength, and paresis impact the efficiency of
breathing and result in respiratory tract changes<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. To address these concerns, it is necessary to properly maintain
pulmonary function and to conduct proper interventions.</p><p>This study demonstrated that IMT was correlated with TIS and the 6MW test in stroke
patients. Furthermore, in a previous study, IMT significantly increased the ability of
stroke patients to engage in long walk and control their trunk muscles <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. This result is similar to the result reported in the
present study, which found that, after a 6-week IMT program, stroke patients&#x02019; demonstrated
significant improvement in balance and transverse abdominal muscle (TA) and internal oblique
muscle (IO) thickness, and demonstrated that a 6-week IMT program improved deep abdominal
muscle thickness. Moreover, the Berg balance scale (BBS) scores were significantly increased
in the experimental group than in the control group<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, this present study aims to determine if IMT would
improve trunk control stability in stroke patients. As shown by the comparison between the
IMT group and control group, TIS was significantly increased in the IMT group in comparison
to the control group. The results explain the correlation between trunk stability muscles
and respiratory muscle strength and endurance in stroke patients.</p><p>Dall&#x02019;Ago et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>demonstrated that a
12-week IMT program decreased the incidence of heart failure and strengthened inspiratory
muscle after increasing the 6MW test distance by 19%. Kim<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> demonstrated that after engaging in respiratory muscle training,
the 6MW test distance increased from 352.3 meters to 363 meters in patients with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In the present study, the 6MW test distance was
significantly increased in the IMT group. This result shows that increased respiratory
muscle strength leads to better trunk stability when walking. Such trunk stability has been
shown to significantly increase when the walking distance increases by improving body
balance and weight transfer in stroke patients.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of our study that IMT increased TIS and the 6MW test result in
stroke patients, and it is believed that enhancement of respiratory function will speed up
the patients&#x02019; return to society by increasing their trunk control and locomotion ability.
Further studies are need to provide functional ability items test for stroke patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Roffe</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Sills</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Pountain</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>A randomized controlled trial of the effect of fixed-dose
