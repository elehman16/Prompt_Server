Oral processing characteristics are influenced by food texture. Very little research has been done on the effect of food texture within solid foods on energy intake.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The first objective was to investigate the effect of hardness of food on energy intake at lunch, and to link this effect to differences in food oral processing characteristics. The second objective was to investigate whether the reduction in energy intake at lunch will be compensated for in the subsequent dinner.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>Fifty subjects (11 male, BMI: 21&#x000b1;2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, age: 24&#x000b1;2 y) participated in a cross-over study in which they consumed ad libitum from a lunch with soft foods or hard foods on two separate days. Oral processing characteristics at lunch were assessed by coding video records. Later on the same days, subjects consumed dinner ad libitum.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Hard foods led to a &#x0223c;13% lower energy intake at lunch compared to soft foods (P&#x0003c;0.001). Hard foods were consumed with smaller bites, longer oral duration per gram food, and more chewing per gram food compared to the soft foods (P&#x0003c;0.05). Energy intake at dinner did not differ after both lunches (P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.16).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Hard foods led to reduced energy intake compared to soft foods, and this reduction in energy intake was sustained over the next meal. We argue that the differences in oral processing characteristics produced by the hardness of the foods explain the effect on intake. The sustained reduction in energy intake suggests that changes in food texture can be a helpful tool in reducing the overall daily energy intake.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors have no support or funding to report.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The rise in obesity over the last decades is considered to be related to changes in the food environment <xref rid="pone.0093370-Carnell1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093370-Hill1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.

Video recordings of 14 subjects were missing due to technical problems with the recordings on a test day. Video recordings were collected using a camera that was placed approximately 30 cm in front of the participants in the sensory booths. From these video recordings, the number of bites, the number of chews and the duration of the bites in the mouths (from the start of a bite until the last swallow before taking a new bite) were measured for consumption of hamburgers and rice salads separately. Two different experimenters coded independently all videos and the average was calculated when coding reliability was at least 80% for each variable. Whenever agreement was lower than 80%, which occurred in &#x0003c;5% of the coded videos, the two experimenters watched the video together and re-coded the data together. The average bite size (g/bite) per subject was calculated by dividing the ad libitum intake of a food-item (hamburger or salad) by the total number of bites of that food-item. The oral duration per bite per subject was calculated by measuring the time from the start of the bite until the bite was swallowed. The total oral duration (s) needed to consume a food-item was calculated as the sum of all oral durations of the bites of that food-item. The oral duration per gram was calculated by dividing the total oral duration per food-item by the ad libitum intake (g) of that food-item. Likewise, the chews per gram were calculated in the same manner. The overall eating rate (g/min) of the lunch was calculated by dividing the ad libitum intake (g) of both food items by the total duration (min) of the lunch.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Standardization of satiety</title><p>To standardize the satiety state, subjects always started both lunch sessions at the same time. Dinner started exactly five hours after lunch. Subjects were instructed to consume the same breakfast at least three hours before lunch on each of the two test days. In addition, subjects were instructed to only drink water or coffee or tea without milk and sugar before lunch, and between lunch and dinner. After lunch, subjects answered questions about what they ate for breakfast and if they ate or drank between breakfast and lunch. After dinner, subjects answered questions about whether they ate or drank between lunch and dinner.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Effect of hardness on intake, appetite ratings, hedonic ratings, sensory ratings, and oral processing characteristics were assessed in generalized linear models that included subject. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were calculated for hedonic ratings, sensory ratings, and oral processing characteristics vs. food intake. Differences between correlation coefficients of softer and harder versions of the food-items were tested by Fisher's (<italic>z</italic>) tests. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.1.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Data were presented as means &#x000b1; SDs.

Subjects felt equally full after both lunches despite a 13% difference in energy intake. The reduction in energy intake at lunch was not compensated for at dinner. This result indicates that differences in hardness in food led to a sustained reduction in energy intake over the course of the day.</p><p>The reduction in intake of the hard foods is likely to be explained by its effect on oral processing characteristics. The hard foods were perceived as harder, dryer and chewier than the soft foods (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0093370-t003">Table 3</xref>). Consumption of the hard foods resulted in slower eating rate with smaller bite sizes, longer oral residence durations, and more chewing per gram food. It has already been shown that these oral processing characteristics affect the amount of food intake in studies were these characteristics were manipulated explicitly by instructions on the frequency of chewing <xref rid="pone.0093370-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093370-Smit1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, or experimentally by using fixed bite sizes and oral residence durations <xref rid="pone.0093370-Bolhuis1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093370-Bolhuis2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093370-Weijzen1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In the present study, subjects ate in response to the foods presented and did so naturally, without an explicit intention or conscious awareness that they were eating less.</p><p>Changing food texture is an efficient way to influence oral processing characteristics and food intake. However, very little research has been done in this field. A study by Zijlsta et al. <xref rid="pone.0093370-Zijlstra3" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> compared three types of solid foods (luncheon meat, meat replacer and candy) in soft and hard versions. Differences in hardness did not affect ad libitum intake in this study <xref rid="pone.0093370-Zijlstra3" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. It may be that the textural differences in their study were too subtle to produce meaningful differences in oral processing that could affect ad libitum intake. The eating rate between the soft and hard versions was only different for the luncheon meat (&#x0223c;16%), but not for the other two foods <xref rid="pone.0093370-Zijlstra3" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Forde et al. <xref rid="pone.0093370-Forde2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> have shown that &#x0201c;mashed&#x0201d; food increased the eating rate by approximately &#x0223c;20% compared to the &#x0201c;whole&#x0201d; version of the same food items. This led to a &#x0223c;10% difference in food intake in grams and was primarily driven by the vegetable component of the meal. The results of the present study showed that the eating rate was &#x0223c;32% lower for the lunch with hard foods. In addition, the oral duration per gram food (s/g) was about 40% higher in the harder version of hamburger and 105% higher in the harder version of rice salad compared to their softer versions. These differences were large enough to produce significant reductions in energy intake for the harder versions of both the hamburger and rice salad.</p><p>The mean difference in food intake between the soft and hard versions was larger for the rice salad than for the hamburger. This is possibly the result of the larger differences in oral processing characteristics between the soft and hard versions of salad, like the oral duration per gram and chews per gram. Oral processing characteristics were also more strongly correlated to food intake in the salad compared to the hamburger. It is possible that visual cues <xref rid="pone.0093370-Wansink1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, and pre-planning <xref rid="pone.0093370-Fay1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> were more important in intake for the hamburger than the salad. It was easier for subjects to accurately monitor how much they consumed for the four presented hamburgers since they were pre-defined units, whereas it may have been more difficult for the 600 g of rice salad. Subjects may have had a tendency to consume whole units of the hamburger. This indicates that when texture modifications are made across different food items, the impact on oral processing behaviour and energy intake may differ depending on the nature of the food and the habitual manner in which it is consumed.</p><p>We chose to use similar ingredients for both the soft and hard version of the test foods (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0093370-t001">Table 1</xref>), in an effort to keep the palatability, macronutrient composition, and energy density equivalent. Despite these small differences in ingredients, the hard version of the hamburger was rated as slightly lower for pleasantness than the soft version of the hamburger. The results of the present study show that oral processing characteristics, but not pleasantness, were strongly correlated with hamburger intake. We therefore conclude that oral processing characteristics explain the reduction in intake of the hard hamburger, rather than the small difference in pleasantness.</p><p>With regard to the high prevalence of obesity, more attention is needed for the satiating capacity of foods. We found that hard foods lead to lower food intake, due to consumption with smaller bites size, higher chewing activity and longer oral residence durations. To get more insight in different textures of foods and the effort and time required for oral processing, Hutchings and Lillford <xref rid="pone.0093370-Hutchings1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> previously proposed the food oral process model to explain the breakdown path for different food types. In this model, food oral breakdown is defined on three distinct dimensions of degree of structure, degree of lubrication needed for swallow, and the time required in mouth to process the bite into a bolus that can be swallowed. A better understanding of the physical-chemical processes involved in the trajectory of oral breakdown may help in the design of foods with longer oral residence durations and greater requirements for chewing that result in earlier satiation and reduced energy intake.</p><p>This study shows that hard foods led to reductions in energy intake that sustain over the subsequent meal. However, it is not clear whether consumption of hard foods will produce sustained reductions in energy intake over longer periods. One study showed a reduction in food intake over two days when subjects took smaller bite sizes, whereas the changes in hunger and fullness did not differ from normal intake <xref rid="pone.0093370-Walden1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Other studies suggest that humans do not compensate well for moderate changes in energy intake over multiple days <xref rid="pone.0093370-Levitsky1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0093370-Levitsky2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. These findings encourage the idea that achieving satiation earlier through subtle changes in food properties could lead to decreased energy intake over the longer term. The next challenge will be to investigate whether changes in food texture can be used to produce sustainable reductions in energy intake over consecutive days.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Monica Mars, Els Siebelink and Desiree Lucassen for their advices and help in carrying out this study</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0093370-Carnell1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
