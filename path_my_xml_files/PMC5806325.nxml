Nonpharmacological treatments such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation have also been used. Of the several modalities studied, few have been found to be helpful in reducing PLP. However, the effects are neither lasting nor gratifying.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Mirror therapy was first reported by Ramachandran and Rogers in 1996 and is purported to relieve PLP by resolving visual-proprioceptive dissociation in the brain.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Studies have revealed the effectiveness of mirror therapy for PLP in both clinical and home settings, but all had either only few weeks of follow-up or had a small number of patients.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] One study did not find it useful.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Studies on large sample sizes over longer periods are lacking. This area being important for the intervention in cases of amputation, a need was felt to analyze this method of managing PLP. Hence, the present study was planned to assess the nature and severity of PLP in a larger group of amputees and to evaluate the effectiveness of mirror therapy in alleviating the PLP over a longer period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A pilot study was conducted at a tertiary Artificial Limb Centre (ALC) in Pune, Maharashtra.

</p><p>One of the authors enrolled 64 patients with PLP over the 6-month period. They were drafted into two groups (test and control) of 32 amputees each, using a random number table by the second author. The patients were coded by the third author and details were kept in a sealed envelope.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Assessment</title><p>All were assessed using the VAS and Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) on day 0 (baseline) and at 4<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>, and 12<sup>th</sup> week after the mirror therapy (i.e., 16 weeks from baseline). For control group, the assessment was till 20<sup>th</sup> week, as they underwent 4 weeks of covered mirror therapy prior to commencement of actual mirror therapy. The assessing author (author 1) was blinded to which group the patient belonged.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>The visual analog scale</title><p>The VAS evaluates pain subjectively. It consists of a 100-mm line, with two end points representing &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;worst pain imaginable.&#x0201d; Patients are instructed to mark on the line according to the level of pain and the same is measured. Follow-up scores after therapeutic intervention provide an indication of whether the pain is reducing or not. VAS is reliable to be used to assess acute pain, has excellent test&#x02013;retest reliability, and has a good validity and reliability.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] The second author, who was blinded to which group the patient belonged, applied this scale.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Short-form version of the McGill Pain Questionnaire</title><p>SF-MPQ was developed in 1987 by Ronald Melzack.

</p></sec><sec id="sec3-5"><title>Procedure</title><p>Mirror therapy uses a flat mirror placed parasagittally in front of the patient's body with the reflective surface toward the sound limb so that the amputee sees the reflection of the sound limb in the mirror [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> &#x00026; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>]. This reflection mimics the amputated limb, and with movement of the intact limb, the mirror provides an optical illusion that the phantom limb is moving simultaneously. Patients in the test arm were told to move both their intact and phantom limbs while seeing the image of the moving limb. Patients in control arm were told to move both their intact and phantom limbs in a similar manner, but in their case, the mirror was covered so that no reflection is seen. The therapy was conducted for both groups for 15 min a day, 7 days a week, over a period of 4 weeks. The control group underwent the routine with the mirror covered for the first 4 weeks, and thereafter crossed over to doing it without the cover for another 4 weeks.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Upper-limb amputee on mirror therapy</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPsy-59-457-g001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Lower-limb amputee on mirror therapy</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPsy-59-457-g002"/></fig><p>Mirror therapy involved performing the following set of movements on both sound and phantom limb sides at the same time.</p><p>

Both the test and control groups did not differ significantly in terms of distribution of these two categories, in terms of cause of amputation, laterality of amputation, and duration of PLP prior to intervention. These and other issues shall be elaborated in articles to be published soon. The age of patients ranged from 17 to 62 years. There was no record of any other significant injuries in the patients. Of the 32 participants in control group (covered group), 3 left the session due to surgical procedures required for revision of stump and 1 participant discontinued as he was transferred to another center for management of fever, both due to causes unrelated to PLP. The total 28 amputees in control group completed the mirror therapy. A total of 60 participants, 32 in test group and 28 in control, were available for analysis until 12<sup>th</sup> week after therapy. All were males, as there is no inpatient facility for females at this center. No harm or adverse effect of therapy was reported by any of the participants.</p><p>Thirty-seven (61.67%) of them had left-sided and 23 (38.33%) had right-sided amputation. However, there was no significant association between laterality of amputation and baseline PLP (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.393 in cases and <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.88 in controls). Majority of them had lower-limb amputation (84%). The distribution of the site is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.

Continuous and intermittent pain disappeared by the end of 8<sup>th</sup> week, and at the end of 16<sup>th</sup> week, only brief pain remained in a few amputees.</p><p>As regard frequency of pain, at the beginning of the study, a majority of participants had experienced PLP several times a week. This was followed by once a day, once a week, several times a day, permanent, and once a month in that order. Frequency gradually reduced. At the conclusion of the study, a few amputees experienced the pain once a month and less than once a month.</p><p>On evaluation of pain by SF-MPQ, the score reduced gradually from mean baseline score (3.65) to lowest level (0.15) at the end of 16<sup>th</sup> week in test group.

However in control group, there was no significant change in mean pain score during the initial 4 weeks of covered mirror therapy. However, when control group switched to uncovered mirror therapy after 4 weeks, there was a significant decline in the mean pain score (8 weeks). This indicates that mirror therapy definitely reduced the PLP. The decline in PLP score was maintained at significantly low levels even 12 weeks after therapy has been stopped (16 and 20 weeks in test and control groups, respectively).</p><p>The commonest site of amputation was below knee [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>].</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Location of amputation</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPsy-59-457-g004"/></fig><p>There is reduction in phantom limb pain by fourth week of mirror therapy compared to control group where mirror was covered, and it is maintained untill twelve weeks after therapy ended.

In this group, 33% of the participants reported a decrease in pain after 4 weeks while 67% of the participants reported an increase in PLP. PLP decreased in eight of the nine (89%) participants who crossed to mirror therapy after either a covered mirror or mental visualization group. On comparison of changes in the score on the VAS at 4 weeks, the mirror group differed significantly from the covered mirror group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.04).[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In another randomized controlled study involving eighty amputees, Brodie <italic>et al</italic>. did not find virtual mirror therapy as being useful.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>Our study also did not show reduction in PLP after 4 weeks in control group; however, subsequent evaluation at 8<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup>, 16<sup>th</sup>, and 20<sup>th</sup> weeks revealed a significant reduction in PLP.</p><p>Complete resolution of PLP was reported by Darnall, following a month-long self-delivered home-based mirror therapy in amputees with lower-limb PLP,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] while others reported improvement even within 2 and 3 weeks of mirror therapy.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] On the other hand, Catherine Mercier and Angela Sirigu in 2009 reported 38% reduction in PLP after 4 weeks of virtual visual feedback.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] However, none of these studies had a follow-up period after end of the therapy, so it is not known whether the relief was maintained.</p><p>Though adverse effects of mirror therapy such as confusion, dizziness, sensation of irritation, and grief have been reported by some studies, none of our participants reported such effects.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The questionnaires in our study did not evaluate for this, but one of the authors interacted with the participants during the therapy and followed up to ascertain such adverse effects.</p><p>Several mechanisms have been put forth to explain how mirror therapy helps reduce PLP. Mirror therapy effect is connected to cortical reorganization: as PLP decreased, using visual input of an intact limb as a substitute for the now-missing proprioceptive feedback from the amputated limb, the representation in the S1 (somatosensory cortices) of both cerebral hemispheres becomes more similar, partially recreating their presumed normal state. It is suggested that the mismatch between what the limb feels like and how it looks during mirror therapy is the likely reason for pain relief. The primary motor cortex is also activated by observation of mirror image. Furthermore, treatment effectiveness depends on an ability to relate the mirror image to one's phantom (i.e., the feeling of observing one's own hand). This finding is supported by a decrease in cortical activity in inferior parietal cortex, an area connected to a feeling of agency and pain generation.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</p><p>Like mirror neurons exist for motor commands, there are &#x0201c;pain&#x0201d; mirror neurons in the anterior cingulate gyrus that fire when participants are hurt with a needle or watching someone else being hurt. Touch receptors from the skin send signals which after relay in the thalamus project to the somatosensory cortex (S1) and eventually to the superior parietal lobe. The presence of mirror neurons in the brain is also supported by the phenomenon of tactile sensation in the phantom limb elicited by touching the virtual image of the limb in the mirror. When an amputee watches his/her intact limb mirror image during the mirror therapy, the &#x0201c;touch mirror neurons&#x0201d; fire, but the receptors in the skin (of the image) are not stimulated and this lack of activity (the &#x0201c;null signal&#x0201d;) informs regular large but not special touch neurons (i.e., nonmirror touch neurons) that amputated limb is not being touched. They in turn partially veto the output of mirror touch neurons and modulate the somatosensory inputs. This activation probably blocks the protopathic pain perception in the PLP, thereby leading to relief of PLP.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</p><p>All these studies evaluated the changes over a very short period of time. The diminution of PLP for a prolonged period of time as shown in this study suggests that probably some of these changes may be permanent. This needs to be evaluated in further studies. Limitations of the study have been lack of female patients and no assessment tool being used for evaluation of emotional status of patient. Since the findings were in a wide variety of PLP patients, the findings could be generalized to at least male amputees.</p><p>Findings of the study revealed some important indications in the intervention after amputation. Mental health needs of the patients can be addressed by mitigating the pain after amputation. It is worth mentioning here that mirror therapy is effective in PLP irrespective of its intensity, duration, and frequency. It has been observed that improvement is maintained up to 12 weeks&#x02019; posttherapy. It cannot be overemphasized that the present study is by far the longest follow-up study to date not only in India but also in the literature available on the subject.</p><p>The impact of therapy is heartening and future studies may include female patients. It is recommended that further multicentric studies with larger number of participants and longer follow-up period are required to establish the long-term effectiveness of mirror therapy to relieve PLP.</p><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Declaration of patient consent</title><p>The authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms.
