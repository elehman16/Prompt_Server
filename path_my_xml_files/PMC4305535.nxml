stimulation on fatigue recovery of the erector spinae with cumulative fatigue induced by
repeated lifting and lowering work. [Subjects] Thirty-two healthy men volunteered to
participate in this study and they were randomly divided into three groups: a MC group of
12 persons who underwent microcurrent, a TENS group of 10 persons who underwent
Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and a control group of 10 persons who only
rested. [Methods] Cumulative fatigue was induced and then, EMG, muscle tone, CK and LDH
serum levels of the erector spinae were measured. Each group then underwent the assigned
intervention and was re-measured. To analyze the differences in fatigue between before and
after the intervention, the paired t-test was conducted, while groups were compared using
analysis of covariance with a control group. [Results] The MC groups showed a significant
reduction in muscle fatigue and decreased muscle tone when compared to the control group.
However, no significant differences were found between the TENS and control groups.
[Conclusion] These results suggest that microcurrent stimulation was effective for
recovery from cumulative muscle fatigue while TENS had no effect.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Fatigue</kwd><kwd>Microcurrent</kwd><kwd>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Repetitive lifting and unloading as well as moving with excessive weights have been known
to be major causes of various musculoskeletal disorders and low back pain<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Such carrying or actions may increase the
load on the spine while decreasing the pressure that protects the spine, thereby increasing
the risk of low back pain and injury to the spine<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, to ensure workers&#x02019; safety and prevent injury, cumulative
fatigue induced in repetitive work environment needs to be in studies using various
interventions for recovery from fatigue.</p><p>In this study, muscle fatigue, tone of the erector spinae, and blood levels of CK (creatine
kinase) and LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), two blood serum enzymes, were measured before and
after the intervention and their results were compared to analyze the cumulative
fatigue.</p><p>TENS causes muscle contraction by stimulating &#x003b1;-motor neurons. It has been widely used to
improve reduced muscle function, muscle strength, and joint range of motion, as well as the
muscle activities of neurological patients. However, if long-term TENS is applied to the
human body, it can cause muscle fatigue and the accumulation of waste matter, and serious
muscle damage. It has also been reported that TENS does not have a significant effect on
fatigue after high-intensity exercise<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, although therapies using TENS may have a variety of advantages, more study is
required to conclusively determine the effect TENS has on muscles with cumulative
fatigue.</p><p>Microcurrent stimulation plays a role in restoring cells or facilitating healing by
increasing the creation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and proteins, and curing wounds
through the supply of electric energy at the cell level, which restores the potential of the
cell membrane to normal potential<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
recent years, a number of studies of microcurrent stimulation have been performed for in a
wide range of conditions such as fracture and fatigue recovery, and various diseases
involving cancers and diabetic nerve damage<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, microcurrent stimulation
is known to be effective for cumulative fatigue recovery as it reduces CK in the blood of
patients with delayed onset muscle soreness<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, a study by Cheng et al. reported that microcurrent
stimulation had no positive effect on the recovery of an arm with delayed onset muscle
soreness<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, microcurrent stimulation and TENS were administered to subjects with
cumulative fatigue to analyze their effects on fatigue recovery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty-two male persons in their 20s participated in this study and they were randomly
divided into three groups: an MC group of 12 persons who underwent microcurrent stimulation,
a TENS group of 10 persons who underwent transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and a
CON group of 10 persons who only rested. The subjects had no musculoskeletal disorders or
related disease histories and were restricted to right-hand dominant males. Prior to
participation in this study, subjects were given a detailed description of the experimental

motions. To maintain the same work condition, a 75-cm-high small table was prepared and a
30-cm-wide, 30-cm-deep, and 25-cm-high box was filled with a 10-kg dumbbell<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. As soon as subjects had completed
repeated lifting and lowering of the box 100 times during 15 minutes with a symmetrical
posture in the sagittal plane<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, the
pre-test measurements were conducted. Immediately after the pre-test, the TENS group was
administered transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (ES-420, Ito, Japan) after
connecting two rectangular radiofrequency catheters (50&#x000d7;90 mm). The longissimus and
iliocostalis were treated for 20 minutes (monophasic pulsed direct current of 80&#x02005;Hz with
phase duration of 10&#x02005;s, pulse width of 300&#x02005;&#x000b5;s and on/off time 10&#x02005;s/50&#x02005;s). The MC group
received microcurrent from a microcurrent stimulator (ES-420, Ito, Japan) at 100 mA and 0.3
Hz on the same spot for 20 minutes. The CON group took a rest for 20 minutes while lying
prone on the floor. Immediately after the intervention, EMG, muscle tone, CK, and LDH were
measured. The temperature and humidity in the laboratory were maintained at 23&#x02005;&#x000b0;C and
60%.</p><p>Muscle activating signal was checked by using surface EMG machine (MP100, biopac, USA). The
sampling rate of the signal was 100&#x02005;Hz and bandpass filtering was performed between
20&#x02013;500&#x02005;Hz. The digitized signal was processed with FFT (Fast Fourier transformation) using
Acqknowlege 3.91 software on a personal computer to obtain the median frequency (MF).
Maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) was measured using a dynamometer (T.K. K. S102, Takei,
Japan). The closest two of the recorded values were averaged and used as the MVC value of
the subjects. After the MVC measurement, 60% MVC was calculated for the quantification of
the collected measurement values from the experiments so that measurements before and after
the treatment were performed with the above method. The electrode was attached to the right
and left erector spinae of the right- and left-side back and the longissimus and the
iliocostalis around the hip. To measure the EMG of these muscles, a pair of surface
electrodes was attached horizontally in the right and left directions to the muscle belly
5&#x02005;cm away from the neurocentral joints of thoracic vertebrae T10 and lumbar vertebrae
L2<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In order to measure muscle tone of the erector spinae, a myotonometer (Missoula, MT,
Neurogenic Technologies Inc., USA) was used. While subjects rested on a bed, the longissimus
and the iliocostalis at the waist were measured. The measurement probe consists of inner and
outer cylinders. According to the resistance of the tissue, the distance between two
cylinders changes and the resistance of the tissue is converted into force. The force
applied to the cylinder was divided into eight stages (0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, 1.25, 1.50,
1.75, 2.00&#x02005;kg) so that measurement at each position of the level of displacement could be
made. Force-displacement curves were created using computational software and the areas
under the curve (AUC) were calculated from the obtained data. The area under the curve (AUC)
is indicating of level of muscle tone<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>SPSS/win 18.0 was used for all statistical processing. Means and standard deviations of all
measurements were calculated and analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to test the
homogeneity of the experimental groups. In order to analyze the effect of the treatment on
muscle fatigue, muscle tone, and CK and LDH serum levels, the paired t-test was used to
examine within group pre- and post-test differences, while analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)
was used to compare the MC and TENS groups with the CON group. The significance level was
chosen as &#x003b1;=0.05 for all analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Microcurrent stimulation, TENS, and rests were given to subjects who had fatigues and then

When cumulative fatigue occurs, loads on the vertebrae continue to increase during the
repetitive work whereas pressure that protects the vertebrae starts to reduce thereby
increasing the risk of low back pain<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Clarkson et al. reported that when subjects aged between 18 and 40&#x02005;years performed repeated
of lifting and lowering, 50 times, with maximum eccentric contraction, muscle damage to the
biceps brachii was induced along with increases in both CK and LDH level in the blood<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The accumulation of markers of fatigue in
the blood and muscle fatigue due to repetitive lifting and lowering work is known as one of
the main reasons for injury during work<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>An increase in muscle tone indicates an abnormal state in the musculoskeletal system and it
is used as an indicator of muscle fatigue<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Roja et al. reported that with additional lifting and lowering of
heavy goods, muscle tone of workers increased further, whereas workers without such
repetitive work showed relatively less muscle tone<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, muscle tone was shown to correlate with EMG frequency
and a decrease in muscle fatigue increases muscle tone as well<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, cumulative muscle fatigue and muscle tone
showed significant changes after the intervention. In particular, subjects administered
microcurrent stimulation showed significant changes in muscle fatigue and muscle tone.</p><p>Weber et al. administered microcurrent stimulation to subjects with delayed onset muscle
soreness and reported no significant difference in muscle fatigue was shown by the
subjects<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, a study by Cho et
al. reported that patients with plantar fasciitis who wore shoes that produced microcurrent
stimulation for six weeks showed a significant reduction in, muscle fatigue in the tibialis
anterior as assessed by the median frequency<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Their result is similar to that of our present study in which
muscle fatigue in the right and left erector spinae was reduced significantly. Microcurrent
stimulation can induce cell responses in damaged tissues through bioelectricity thereby
assisting with the healing of tissues. It can also facilitate endogenous bioelectric current
which would reduce resistance in the damaged portion, and promote conduction of bioelectric
current assisting with the recovery of homeostasis of the human body. That is, microcurrent
enhances electrical and chemical processes, which assist the healing process, returning
damaged muscle tissues to a normal state<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Reduction of the median frequency value indicates a reduction in
muscle fatigue<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>, and muscle tone and microcurrent stimulation is more effective for
the recovery of muscle fatigue and muscle tone than only taking a rest. The microcurrent
therapy increased collagen formation speed in the recovery of damaged cells more than in the
TENS therapy, which is why the microcurrent stimulation had a more positive effect on muscle
fatigue and muscle tone.</p><p>No significant differencs were found after the intervention between the TENS and CON
groups. This result is in agreement with Park&#x02019;s study in which an administration of 100 PPS
to finger muscles for 30 minutes had no effect on muscle fatigue and muscle strength<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although appropriate stimulation through
TENS can help to prevent fatigue accumulation by increasing the local blood flow, the
temporary increase in local circulation was not sufficient enough to have a significant
effect on muscle fatigue recovery.</p><p>A study by Lim reported that after heavy exercise, CK and LDH decreased slightly or
increased for up to 30 minutes, together with aggravation of the pain in patients with
delayed onset muscle soreness<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, future should investigate
intervention effects on cumulative fatigue over 24 hours. Furthermore, a study that can
provide a generalized conclusion through a large number of subjects and various measurement
tools shall be conducted in the future.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>MH</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Jung</surname><given-names>DY</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Effects of back-belt on electromyographic activities and
