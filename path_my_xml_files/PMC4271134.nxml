However, for many patients, a single medication is not sufficient in this respect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. If the target IOP cannot be achieved using a monotherapy, a combination of drugs with different mechanisms of action is recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In recent years, the use of fixed combination (FC) glaucoma medications in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension has substantially increased. Fixed combinations contain two medications in a single bottle, which may be more convenient for the patient because fewer instillations and bottles are used, and thus likely improves compliance and adherence because of the simpler treatment regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Multiple topical therapies may also be associated with a higher incidence of side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Increased exposure to preservatives may have untoward effects on the ocular surface and may lead to a higher incidence of ocular signs and symptoms, and poor compliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Benzalkonium chloride (BAK) is the most widely used preservative in IOP-lowering ophthalmic preparations. However, it has been demonstrated in a variety of experimental and clinical studies to be pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory, to damage tear film layer, corneal epithelium and corneal nerves, and has a negative impact on the number of conjunctival goblet cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Ocular surface disease (OSD) and dry eye syndrome are frequently detected in patients treated with preserved glaucoma medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It has been shown that OSD is related to the number of preserved eye drops used, the prolonged use of preserved medication and the total benzalkonium chloride (BAK) exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>The use of preservative-free (PF) formulations may avoid these negative effects of BAK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Tafluprost ophthalmic solution 0.0015% (Taflotan&#x02122;, Saflutan&#x02122;, Tapros&#x02122;, Santen, Osaka, Japan) was the first prostaglandin analog (PGA) that became available in a PF formulation. The IOP-lowering efficacy of this PF formulation is comparable to that of latanoprost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. PGA/timolol FCs are frequently used in glaucoma management. Both active ingredients of these fixed combinations have a different mode of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These fixed combinations provide an IOP reduction of approximately 30&#x02013;37% and have to be instilled only once daily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The additivity and safety of tafluprost and timolol administered in a non-fixed combination (NFC) have been demonstrated in two randomized, double-masked, parallel-group, multicenter clinical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Thus, PF prostaglandin/timolol FC for the treatment of patients with glaucoma and ocular hypertension may have potential benefits for patients using fixed combinations of a prostaglandin analog and timolol.</p><p>The present study in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension was designed to compare the IOP-lowering efficacy, safety and tolerability of the PF FC of tafluprost 0.0015% (TAF)/timolol 0.5% (TIM) ophthalmic solution to those of its individual components, namely, PF tafluprost 0.0015% and PF timolol 0.5%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design</title><p>This was a stratified, double-masked, randomized, multinational, multicenter phase III study conducted in 60 centers and 10 countries. The study was registered with ClinicalTrial.gov #NCT01292460, and was reviewed and approved by the independent ethics committees of each participating country. Prior to enrollment, written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The study was conducted in accordance with the current good clinical practice (GCP) requirements. All procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation (institutional and national), and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000 and 2008.

All patients were required to be treated either with a PGA [prostaglandin stratum (PS)] or with timolol 0.5% (TIM) [timolol stratum (TS)] monotherapy for at least 2&#x000a0;weeks before the screening visit. To be eligible for study participation, the patients were required to have IOP in either treated eye of&#x000a0;&#x02265;22&#x000a0;mmHg at any time of the day during the screening visit for prior timolol users (TS) or&#x000a0;&#x02265;20&#x000a0;mmHg for prior prostaglandin analog users (PS). Other inclusion criteria were an increase of at least 2&#x000a0;mmHg in the average diurnal IOP (measured at 8:00 a.m., 10:00 a.m., 4:00 p.m and 8:00 p.m.) at the baseline visit as compared to the average diurnal IOP at the end-of-run-in period 2&#x000a0;weeks after the screening visit with either open-label timolol 0.5% (TS) or tafluprost 0.0015% (PS) treatment and a best corrected visual acuity no worse than +0.6 logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution (logMAR) in both eyes. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy and planned pregnancy for the study period; nursing; corneal abnormalities or other conditions preventing reliable applanation tonometry; prior refractive eye surgery; hypersensitivity or contraindication to tafluprost or timolol; prior filtration surgery or any other ocular surgery including intraocular laser procedures within 6&#x000a0;months prior to screening in the eye(s) to be treated; advanced visual field defects in either eye or anticipated progression during the study period; risk for angle closure (&#x0003c;2 grade anterior chamber angle width according to Schaffer&#x02019;s classification); use of contact lenses at screening or during the study; and inability to safely discontinue the use of ocular hypotensive medications during the wash-out period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study Visits and Treatment</title><p>The study visits included screening, end-of-run-in, baseline, 2 and 6&#x000a0;weeks, 3 and 6&#x000a0;months, and post-study (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). At the screening visit, all eligible patients were assigned according to their prior treatment regimen [timolol 0.5% (TIM) or PGA] to receive either PF timolol 0.5% (TS) twice daily (8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m.) or PF tafluprost 0.0015% (PS) once daily (8:00 a.m.) for 2&#x000a0;weeks. The run-in period was followed by a wash-out period of at least 4&#x000a0;weeks. At the baseline visit, the TS patients were randomized to receive either PF timolol 0.5% twice daily (8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m.), or PF FC tafluprost 0.0015%/timolol 0.5% at 8:00 a.m. and vehicle at 8:00 p.m. in the affected eye(s).

The primary evaluation of IOP was based on the worse eye and all patients who received at least one dose of the study medications and had at least one post-baseline measurement available [intention to treat (ITT) dataset]. If both eyes met the IOP criteria at baseline the eye with the higher IOP at the 8:00 a.m. IOP measurement was regarded as the worse eye. In case both eyes had the same IOP at baseline, the right eye was designated as the study eye. The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline in the average diurnal IOP at month 3. The primary statistical objective was to demonstrate that the PF FC tafluprost 0.0015%/timolol 0.5%, administered once daily in the morning is superior to both individual components of the FC: PF tafluprost 0.0015% (TAF) administered once daily in the morning (8:00 a.m.) and PF timolol 0.5% (TIM) administered twice daily (8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m.). Secondary efficacy variables included the proportion of responders at month 3 (defined as change from baseline IOP of 20% or more in increments of 5%), change from baseline in mean diurnal IOP at weeks 2 and 6 and month 6, and change from baseline in the time-wise IOPs at 8:00 a.m., 10:00 a.m., 4:00 p.m., and 8:00 p.m. at weeks 2 and 6 and months 3 and 6.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Safety and Tolerability</title><p>The analysis of the safety and tolerability data was based on all the patients who received at least one dose of the respective study medication and had a subsequent safety measurement. Ocular and non-ocular adverse events (AEs) were recorded at each visit. Slit lamp examinations were conducted at each visit and the findings were graded on a scale from 0 to 3 (0: normal; 1: mild; 2: moderate; 3: severe). Central corneal thickness (CCT) was measured at screening and at month 6 by ultrasound pachymetry. The severity of conjunctival hyperemia was assessed from baseline through month 6 using a set of reference photographs (redness grading) and a 5-point scale (0: none; 1: mild; 2: moderate; 3: severe; 4: very severe). Ophthalmoscopic examinations were conducted via dilated pupil at screening and at months 3 and 6, and included the evaluation of vitreous, retina, and optic nerve head. Visual field testing was performed at screening and post-study. Drop discomfort was evaluated at weeks 2 and 6 and months 3 and 6 on a 4-point scale (0: none, 1: mild, 2: moderate, 3: severe). Resting blood pressure and heart rate were measured twice during the day at 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. from baseline visit to month 6.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>A repeated-measures analysis of the covariance (RM ANCOVA) model was used to evaluate the primary efficacy variable within the TS and PS. A two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the mean difference estimated from the model was used for the evaluation of the superiority hypothesis. Superiority was achieved if the upper limit of the 95% CI (TS: FC&#x02013;TIM; PS: FC&#x02013;TAF) was less than 0&#x000a0;mmHg or the corresponding <italic>p</italic> value was less than 0.05. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used for discontinued patients in the ITT dataset at month 3. A Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel (CMH) test was used for the comparison of non-continuous variables between the two treatment groups. The planned sample size was 220 enrolled subjects (110 per arm) in the TS and 380 enrolled subjects (190 per arm) in the PS. These sample sizes provided the power of 90% based on differences of 2.0&#x000a0;mmHg for the TS and 1.5&#x000a0;mm Hg for the PS, a standard deviation (SD) of 4.0&#x000a0;mmHg for change in IOP, a drop-out rate of 20% and a two-sided 5% type I error. A smaller drop-out rate than anticipated was seen during the study, thus fewer patients could be randomized in the study without a loss in statistical power.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In total, 711 subjects were screened for the study.

Frequent dosing is related to poor adherence, thus a simplified dosing regimen of fixed combinations is likely to lead to an improvement in patients&#x02019; adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Furthermore, fixed combinations eliminate the risk of a wash-out effect caused by the instillation of a second eye drop after a too-short interval within a concomitant treatment regimen. Finally, the use of fixed combinations decreases, but does not eliminate the exposure of the eye to preservatives. There is strong evidence from both clinical and animal studies that chronic exposure to preservatives, particularly BAK, induces ocular surface changes, conjunctival inflammation, subconjunctival fibrosis, apoptosis of conjunctival epithelial cells and corneal surface changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Moreover, OSD and dry eye syndrome are very common in glaucoma patients: several studies report prevalence rates between 45 and 60% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Preservative-free glaucoma medications are generally better tolerated than preserved eye drops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we evaluated and compared the IOP-lowering efficacy, safety and tolerability of the PF FC of tafluprost 0.0015% and timolol 0.5% (administered once daily in the morning) to the individual PF components tafluprost 0.0015% (administered once daily in the morning) and timolol 0.5% (administered twice daily). It is well established that both PF tafluprost and timolol effectively reduce IOP as monotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], are additive in IOP reduction in concomitant use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and neither of these two substances requires BAK to enhance its IOP-lowering activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>The results of this stratified, double-masked, randomized, multinational, multicenter phase III study demonstrate that PF FC tafluprost 0.0015%/timolol 0.5% administered once daily significantly lowered IOP in each stratum, at each visit and time point during the 6-month study period. The IOP reduction in the FC treatment arms of both strata (PS and TS) was comparable. Mean time-wise IOP reductions from the corresponding diurnal baseline IOP levels in the TS ranged between 7.1 and 9.0&#x000a0;mmHg (26.7&#x02013;34.1%) and 8.2 and 9.0&#x000a0;mmHg (31.2&#x02013;33.5%) in the PS. These changes are clinically significant and in a comparable range to those found for other preserved prostaglandin/timolol fixed combinations: Mean diurnal IOP decrease from baseline with a preserved fixed combination of latanoprost/timolol was 8.0&#x000a0;mmHg after 13&#x000a0;weeks with untreated baseline IOP levels that were comparable to the present study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, in this study design patients were treated with timolol 0.5% twice daily during a 2-week run-in period. In a study comparing a preserved fixed combination of bimatoprost/timolol with the individual components, mean diurnal IOP was decreased by 8.1&#x000a0;mmHg in the fixed combination treatment arm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The proportion of patients achieving a reduction of mean diurnal IOP of&#x000a0;&#x02265;20% from baseline was 81.8%, which compares to 85.9% and 89.2% in this study for the TS and PS, respectively. Finally, a preserved fixed combination of travoprost/timolol reduced mean diurnal IOP from untreated diurnal baseline IOP levels between 27.2 and 30.2&#x000a0;mmHg to IOP levels between 18.7 and 18.2&#x000a0;mmHg at month 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p>The reduction of IOP in the FC treatment arms was superior to both individual components administered as monotherapy (PF TIM and PF TAF). In the TS of the present study, the model-based difference in IOP at month 3 (ITT LOCF dataset) between treatment arms (FC&#x02013;TIM) was &#x02212;0.885&#x000a0;mmHg (95% CI from &#x02212;1.745 to &#x02212;0.024&#x000a0;mmHg; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.044); thus the superiority of FC versus TIM was achieved. The analysis of sensitivity without the baseline values as covariate (RM ANOVA) confirmed this finding.</p><p>It should also be noted that one outlier in the FC treatment arm had a substantial effect on the result. This patient was discontinued after 14&#x000a0;days and the IOP of the unscheduled withdrawal visit was carried forward in the ITT dataset until month 3 according to the LOCF method. After discarding this patient (with data only from discontinuation visit after 14&#x000a0;days) from the ITT LOCF dataset, the difference was &#x02212;1.138&#x000a0;mmHg (95% CI from &#x02212;1.897 to &#x02212;0.379&#x000a0;mmHg; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.004) in the primary RM ANCOVA model (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Although this outlier was not removed from the overall analysis, it should be noted that it clearly influences the overall result (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) and brings forth the conservative nature of the LOCF analyses. It might further be considered that timolol has less efficacy than FC over a complete period of 24&#x000a0;h including night time IOP measurements due to reduced efficacy of timolol during the night [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. On the other hand, tafluprost monotherapy and the FC may appear better when a complete 24-h period is considered.</p><p>In the PS, the difference in IOP at month 3 (ITT LOCF) between treatment arms (FC&#x02013;TAF) was &#x02212;1.516&#x000a0;mmHg (95% CI &#x02212;2.044 to &#x02212;0.988; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001); thus superiority of FC versus TAF was achieved. The sensitivity analysis without the baseline values as covariate (RM ANOVA) confirmed these results. In the present study, the tafluprost/timolol FC was administered at 8:00 a.m. in the morning. In the PS, TAF was also instilled at 8:00 a.m., which allowed a fair comparison of the IOP-lowering effect of both treatment arms. Furthermore, timolol 0.5% was dosed twice daily in the TS. In general the evening administration had been slightly favoring the efficacy of prostaglandin analogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In a study conducted by Konstas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], morning versus evening dosing of a concomitant treatment of latanoprost 0.005%/timolol 0.5% instilled once daily was compared. Overall, a trend for greater daytime IOP reduction with evening dosing was found, whereas morning dosing tended to provide lower night time pressures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Furthermore, it could be shown for fixed combinations of travoprost and timolol, and bimatoprost and timolol, that evening dosing provided a better 24-h IOP control when compared to morning dosing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>The safety profile of the PF FC of tafluprost 0.0015% and timolol 0.5% was well in line with the known side effects of timolol and tafluprost. Specifically, the hyperemia rates of the FC were very low in both strata: 4.8% and 9.5% for the PS and TS, respectively, and 6.4% over the two strata. The reason for the lower hyperemia rate in the PS compared to the TS may most likely be explained by the previous exposure of these patients to prostaglandin therapies. In turn, conjunctival hyperemia was reported for 22.7% of the patients at month 3 in the bimatoprost/timolol fixed combination study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Accordingly, hyperemia was reported for 14.1% of the patients treated with travoprost/timolol preserved fixed combination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. These rates are considerably higher than those seen in the present study and suggest that the PF tafluprost/timolol FC may be better tolerated and an important treatment option for all patients who require an effective and safe combination therapy in clinical practice.</p><p>Despite the prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-masked design and the large number of patients in each stratum, our study has limitations. The tafluprost/timolol FC was administered in the morning. Therefore, we could not evaluate the potential efficacy differences between this regimen and the evening administration of the FC. A direct comparison of the morning versus evening dosing of the PF FC of tafluprost 0.0015%/timolol 0.5% may be needed to reveal possible efficacy differences of the 2 different dosing regimens after instillation of the new PF FC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our multicenter, randomized, double-masked parallel-group study shows that once daily morning instillation of PF tafluprost 0.0015%/timolol 0.5% FC provides clinically and statistically significant IOP reductions in patients with open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. The IOP reductions are superior to those achieved after administering the individual components, PF tafluprost 0.0015% and PF timolol 0.5%. The PF FC tafluprost/timolol was well tolerated and safe, and associated with a low prevalence of conjunctival hyperemia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><sec id="Sec16"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="12325_2014_163_MOESM1_ESM.pdf"><caption><p>Supplementary material 1 (PDF 192&#x000a0;kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec15"><title>Appendix</title><p>The following investigators participated in this multicenter clinical trial: The Preservative-free Tafluprost Fixed Combination Study Group:</p><p>Hannu Uusitalo (Tampere, Finland), Kai Kaarniranta (Kuopio, Finland), Ville Saarela (Oulu, Finland), Norbert Pfeiffer (Mainz, Germany), Ulrich Bartz-Schmidt (Tuebingen, Germany), Stephan Dunker (Troisdorf, Germany), Thomas Hamacher (Starnberg, Germany), Klaas Heidemann (Leer, Germany), G&#x000fc;nter Hofmann (Schweinfurt, Germany), Ines Lanzl (Prien, Germany), Karin Oehmig (Chemnitz, Germany), Gernot Petzold (Kulmbach, Germany), Ulrich Richter (Regensburg, Germany), Ulrich Thelen (Muenster, Germany), Axel Zehe (Dresden, Germany), Marie-Luise Scherzer (Regenstrauf, Germany), Nathalie Collignon (Li&#x000e8;ge, Belgium), U.F.
