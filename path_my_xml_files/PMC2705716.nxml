An important disadvantage of the technique is that many patients find the bowel preparation burdensome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Therefore efforts have been made to prepare patients for CTC with a less extensive bowel preparation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Minimizing bowel preparation may increase patient compliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], but will result in larger amounts of residual faeces in the colon. A prerequisite is that faecal material is labelled with oral contrast (i.e. faecal tagging) in order to differentiate faecal material from colonic structures.</p><p>To our knowledge, all limited prepared CTC studies have been performed using primary two-dimensional (2D) display methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The rationale for this approach is that submerged segments can be better assessed in 2D.</p><p>Previous studies in patients with extensive bowel preparation have indicated that primary three-dimensional (3D) reading may result in less false negative findings compared with primary 2D reading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. If a similar empty endoluminal view could be achieved by electronic removal of tagged material (&#x0201c;electronic cleansing&#x0201d;) in patients who have undergone limited bowel preparation, primary 3D could be a method of choice.</p><p>However, specific artefacts of electronic cleansing were described that potentially reduced the accuracy of CTC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This may be the reason for the paucity of papers on the use of electronic cleansing. A specifically noticeable problem is posed by the distracting &#x02018;ridges&#x02019; or &#x02018;pseudopolyps&#x02019; emanating from locations where air, soft tissue and tagged material meet.</p><p>We hypothesized that especially for inexperienced observers a primary electronically cleansed 3D (PEC3D) method may have advantages for evaluation of the colon: polyps are visible for longer than in a 2D method and PEC3D provides a more intuitive reproduction of reality. In this study we used a cleansing algorithm that was devised to improve 3D image quality at the junctions of air, soft tissue and tagged material.</p><p>Therefore the purpose of this study was to assess whether there was any difference in accuracy between two different reading strategies for the detection of colorectal polyps in a patient population that had undergone a reduced bowel preparation. The results of primary uncleansed 2D (PU2D) and primary electronically cleansed 3D (PEC3D) were stratified for reader experience.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population</title><p>The institutional review board of our hospital approved the study.

The use of oral contrast was combined with a low-fibre diet. The evening and morning before the CTC examination no solid foods were allowed. Explicit instructions about fluid intake were not given. No laxatives were used in order to minimize patient discomfort.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Scan parameters</title><p>CTC was executed according to state-of-the-art techniques. Patients were examined in prone and supine position after the intravenous administration of bowel relaxants (Buscopan; Boehringer Ingelheim, Germany or, if contraindicated, Glucagon; Novo-Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark). CO<sub>2</sub> was automatically insufflated (PROTOCO<sub>2</sub>L, EZ-E-M). Patients were not given intravenous contrast medium. Examinations were performed on a 64-slice multidetector CT system (Brilliance, Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands) with a reference mA&#x000a0;s value of 40&#x000a0;mA&#x000a0;s (<italic>z</italic>-axis tube modulation and automatic current selection was used).

The observers were blinded to the results of the reference standard. To avoid recall bias, we aimed to maximize the interval between the PU2D and PEC3D reading of the same patient. This period varied per observer (mean 33&#x000a0;days, range 7&#x02013;66) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). All detected lesions were recorded in a digital database. The method of detection (PU2D or PEC3D), colon segment and size of the lesion (as measured in the primary review method) of all findings were documented.

In short, the algorithm assumes that the measured density in a voxel arises due to a combination of three materials: soft tissue, air and tagged material. Initially, the percentage of materials in each voxel is determined. Subsequently, the partial volume of tagged material is replaced by air and the new density is calculated. Finally, a 3D method visualizes the colon from an endoluminal perspective as if there were no faecal remains.</p><p>During the study the algorithm was not yet integrated into the system and was therefore processed on a separate computer (Precision 690, Dell, Round Rock, USA). Afterwards, the cleansed data were reloaded on the workstation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Observers</title><p>Eight physicians participated in this study: two experienced observers (two research physicians working full time on CTC) and six novice observers (five radiologists, one recently qualified physician).</p><p>The two experienced observers had seen over 350 CTC examinations verified by colonoscopy (among these the 75 patients included in this study). All novice observers, without any notable prior experience with CTC, had undergone the same learning curve. The learning curve consisted of 50 selected CTC examinations from a publicly available database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Forty examinations were read using a primary 2D method and 10 using a primary 3D method. The ratio for this distribution was the assumption that detecting lesions in 2D is more difficult than in 3D, although the assessment of a suspected lesion is similar in both review methods. Personal feedback on false negative and false positive findings for polyps 6&#x000a0;mm or larger was provided by a radiology research fellow (more than 500 CTC examinations verified by colonoscopy).</p><p>The observers were aware of the fact that the actual study was done on FOBT positive patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Reference standard</title><p>The reference standard was based on the findings of the initial CTC reading, which was double read by two experienced observers (more than 200 CTC) and verified by colonoscopy with segmental unblinding. Colonoscopy was performed within 2&#x000a0;weeks after CTC.</p><p>A polyp seen during CTC was considered true positive if (1) its appearance resembled the corresponding adenomatous or nonadenomatous polyp at colonoscopy, (2) its segment or adjacent segment corresponded with the segment of the reference standard and (3) the polyp size as estimated by the endoscopist corresponded with the CTC size, considering a margin of error of 50%. Since the colonoscopy measurement is subject to inaccuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] this criterion could be overruled by the first two criteria.

In this GEE method, regression analyses were performed to compare the mean sensitivity values of the two methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].

The higher sensitivity comes <italic>without</italic> a statistically significant lower specificity. On average more review time was needed for PEC3D. Paradoxically, despite its superior performance in polyp detection, the image quality of PEC3D was rated significantly less than for PU2D.</p><p>Recently, two comparative studies of primary 2D and primary 3D review methods have addressed the merit of both techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. As in this study, more polyps of 6&#x000a0;mm or larger were detected using primary 3D, although in only one study the difference was statistically significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The reason for this superior sensitivity may be that abnormalities are visible to the observer for longer. Secondly, polyps that may have a similar appearance to folds on 2D are easier to distinguish from folds in 3D. However, the fact that primary 3D is often not used in CTC is probably based on practical grounds such as long review time and high computer requirements associated with this review technique in the past.</p><p>Compared with the abovementioned previous studies, in this study patients underwent a limited bowel preparation. There is a risk that the reported superiority of 3D in polyp detection would be neutralized by the reduction of visible colonic surface. In this study we report a large number of at least partially submerged polyps. This increases the risk of overlooking polyps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This is the reason why electronic cleansing was used in the 3D examinations.</p><p>Electronic cleansing has been subject to study for several years now [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Recently two comparative studies of electronic cleansing were published. In both studies electronic cleansing had an additional value in terms of sensitivity for some observers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In this study we assumed it had an additional value as well: nearly half of the polyps were in at least one position at least partially covered by faecal material (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p>Specific artefacts of electronic cleansing are described in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] e.g. ridges, pseudopolyps due to partial volume effect and floating debris due to untagged faecal material. These may be the reason that electronic cleansing for primary CTC evaluation has not often been used. The electronic cleansing algorithm we used in this study was specially designed to overcome artefacts of distracting &#x02018;ridges&#x02019; emanating from locations where air, soft tissue and tagged material meet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These ridges were in fact noted by none of the observers in this study.</p><p>Floating debris, though, was detected in the majority of patients examined in PEC3D (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). An important cause of debris is noise due to heterogeneously or insufficiently tagged stool. The three patients were excluded because of these artefacts. These artefacts stress the fact that more than just a good cleansing algorithm is important in order to achieve good 3D image quality i.e. a good tagging regimen, good patient compliance and good CT parameters. However, the three excluded patients were rated in PU2D by one to three observers &#x0201c;not diagnostic&#x0201d; as well. This stresses the fact that although 3D is more susceptible to tagging artefacts, 2D suffers from heterogeneous or insufficient tagging as well.</p><p>Artefacts were seen in the majority of patients reviewed in PEC3D. To be able to easily distinguish artefacts from polyps, it is important to be able to correlate electronically cleansed 3D images with complementary <italic>original</italic> uncleansed 2D images. This combination has limited the number of false positive findings when using PEC3D (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Using PEC3D did not statistically decrease specificity for any observer group at any size per-patient threshold i.e. true negative patients were not erroneously classified using PEC3D.</p><p>We have not studied a primary 3D reading method <italic>without</italic> electronic cleansing or primary 2D <italic>with</italic> electronic cleansing. Although interesting from a methodological point of view, we think that these approaches are not meaningful; the former is not since a large number of (partially) submerged polyps are prevented from being detected because they are otherwise covered by faecal material; the second approach is not since there is no need to electronically remove faecal material that can already be distinguished from colonic structures. However, one study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] demonstrated an additional value in terms of polyp detection of cleansing in a 2D approach. An important difference compared with our study is the nature of the preparation: barium instead of iodine and no low-fibre diet. This results in more adherent and solid stool that is &#x0201c;mentally&#x0201d; more difficult to read than the quiet homogeneous fluid levels seen in our patient population. Therefore, electronic cleansing may prevent reader fatigue in this patient population.</p><p>The mean difference between PU2D and PEC3D was in accordance with the expected difference between both techniques. However, the expected baseline sensitivity for polyps 6&#x000a0;mm or larger was higher (70%) than the actual measured sensitivity (51%). This had consequences for the statistical power of the comparison; however, statistical significance was still reached for the group of inexperienced readers.</p><p>The higher per-polyp sensitivity of PEC3D mainly concerned polyps 6&#x02013;9&#x000a0;mm (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The prevalence of adenomas with advanced features (i.e. villous components or high-grade dysplasia) in this size category tends to be low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The joint guideline of the American Cancer Society, the US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer and the American College of Radiology recommends colonoscopy and polypectomy for polyps 6&#x000a0;mm or larger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Thus, polyps in this size category may not be neglected.</p><p>The novice observers were trained according to the recommendations of the American College of Radiology and the European Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]; 50 CTC studies with 20&#x02013;50% prevalence with personal feedback on all false positive and negative findings for polyps 6&#x000a0;mm or larger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The response to training, though, is unpredictable and competence cannot be assumed after 50 cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In this study the two experienced observers (350 CTCs or more) outperformed the six novice observers. Thus, it is likely that the optimum number of training cases is more than 50, as suggested earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, the difference between these levels of experience in PEC3D is less than PU2D. So, in the phase of familiarization with CTC primary cleansed 3D is advantageous.</p><p>The group of experienced readers consisted of two observers compared with the group of inexperience readers that consisted of six observers. In general, experienced observers show less difference in polyp detection between review methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and will perform better when compared with inexperienced readers. Therefore, we expected the differences between both review methods to be insignificant in a very experienced observer group. This was confirmed by the two experienced reviewers in this study who performed very well using both methods. Thus, we think that although interesting from a methodological point of view adding four extra reviewers would not change the conclusion of this study.</p><p>A computer-aided detection algorithm has not been used in this study. Its effect will be twofold when applied to electronically cleansed data: the number of detectable polyps will increase as well as the number of detected artefacts. Since these effects are not yet balanced, this will be subject to further research.</p><p>This study has limitations. First the prevalence of polyps in this FOBT positive population was fairly high compared with an asymptomatic screening population. This may limit the generalization to an average risk screening population.</p><p>Secondly, in this patient population we used a low-dose scan protocol combined with sub-millimetre slices. Noise in the images may have limited the quality of the cleansing since faecal material appeared less homogeneous. Still, the quality of the images was rated diagnostic in the vast majority of the cases i.e. only three cases were excluded.</p><p>Thirdly, all patients had been prepared with oral iodine tagging resulting in a fairly homogeneously tagged colon content. Probably any electronic cleansing algorithm will perform optimal with homogeneously tagged stool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Accordingly, we expect the algorithm to be better suited for removing pools of (iodine) fluid compared with adherent heterogeneous faecal residue encountered in barium tagging.</p><p>Fourthly, before this study the experienced observers had evaluated all patients in the framework of a comparative study of colonoscopy and CTC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsna2008.rsna.org/event_display.cfm?em_id=6012336">http://rsna2008.rsna.org/event_display.cfm?em_id=6012336</ext-link>). These patients were evaluated at least 1&#x000a0;year before this study with a primary 2D review method. In the period in between both studies at least 100 other CTC examinations were read. So, it is not likely that this has influenced the performance characteristics of the experienced observers.</p><p>Fifthly, in this study we have used an enhanced 3D display i.e. the unfolded cube display. The advantage of this technique is that it covers nearly all colonic mucosa without image distortion in a single fly-through [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], compared with the conventional &#x02018;endoscopic&#x02019; view that needs a bidirectional fly-through to cover nearly all colonic mucosa. Therefore, our approach is a more time efficient method than a conventional 3D technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This may limit the generalizability of difference in review time, however <italic>not</italic> in accuracy.</p><p>In summary, we conclude that novice observers have a significantly higher sensitivity for the detection of clinically relevant polyps when using primary electronically cleansed 3D compared with primary 2D. For experienced observers, who performed better overall, there is no difference between both methods. Specificity is not affected when using primary electronically cleansed 3D. Therefore we recommend primary electronically cleansed 3D for novice observers in evaluating CTC in patients that have undergone limited bowel preparation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Open Access</title><p>This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License which permits any noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.</p><p><bold>Acknowledgments</bold> A grant was received from Philips Healthcare.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Levin</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Lieberman</surname><given-names>DA</given-names></name><name><surname>McFarland</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Screening and surveillance for the early detection of colorectal cancer and adenomatous polyps, 2008: a joint guideline from the American Cancer Society, the US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer, and the American College of Radiology</article-title><source>Gastroenterology</source><year>2008</year><volume>134</volume><fpage>1570</fpage><lpage>1595</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1053/j.gastro.2008.02.002</pub-id></citation><citation citation-type="display-unstructured">Levin B, Lieberman DA, McFarland B et al (2008) Screening and surveillance for the early detection of colorectal cancer and adenomatous polyps, 2008: a joint guideline from the American Cancer Society, the US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer, and the American College of Radiology.
