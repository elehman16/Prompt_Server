However, the complex natural history of HPV makes this difficult. We infer the viral transmissibility, rate of waning natural immunity and rates of progression and clearance of infection of 13 high-risk and 2 non-oncogenic HPV types, making use of a number of rich datasets from Sweden. Estimates of viral transmissibility, clearance of initial infection and waning immunity were derived in a Bayesian framework by fitting a susceptible-infectious-recovered-susceptible (SIRS) transmission model to age- and type-specific HPV prevalence data from both a cross-sectional study and a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of primary HPV screening. The models fitted well, but over-estimated the prevalence of four high-risk types with respect to the data. Three of these types (HPV-33, -35 and -58) are among the most closely related phylogenetically to the most prevalent HPV-16. The fourth (HPV-45) is the most closely related to HPV-18; the second most prevalent type. We suggest that this may be an indicator of cross-immunity. Rates of progression and clearance of clinical lesions were additionally estimated from longitudinal data gathered as part of the same RCT. Our estimates of progression and clearance rates are consistent with the findings of survival analysis studies and we extend the literature by estimating progression and clearance rates for non-16 and non-18 high-risk types. We anticipate that such type-specific estimates will be useful in the parameterisation of further models and in developing our understanding of HPV natural history.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>No part of the paper has been presented or published elsewhere.

The introduction of two prophylactic vaccines and the advent of new screening technologies have led to a surge in the number of HPV modelling studies. Such analysis can give insight into, for example, the epidemiological impact of combined HPV testing and conventional Pap smear screening; the marginal effect of screening in vaccinated populations or the effect of population-level behavioural heterogeneity on the impact of a screening or vaccination programme. The combined usefulness and challenge of modelling is the understanding and quantification of uncertainty. HPV infection has a particularly complex natural history: an initial infection may lead to the development of clinical lesions which either progress to a more severe grade of neoplasia or clear spontaneously. The more advanced the lesion, the lower the chance of viral clearance <xref rid="pone.0049614-Bulkmans1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049614-Jit1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Also, the risk of progression to high-grade lesions, and then subsequently to carcinoma, is higher for some HPV types than others: 70% of cervical cancers are associated with either HPV-16 or HPV-18 <xref rid="pone.0049614-Bulkmans2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049614-Castle1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049614-Khan1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049614-Berkhof1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Consequently, HPV modellers must make judicious choices of model structure and prior ranges for parameters determining e.g. the transmissibility of infection, rates of progression and clearance of clinical lesions and the rate of waning natural immunity following infection. Some HPV models of the early vaccine era were parameterised with one pre-specified set of parameters, assessing the sensitivity of model outcomes to each parameter in turn <xref rid="pone.0049614-Sanders1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049614-Hughes1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049614-Goldie1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. This approach limits the understanding of the interaction between input parameters. Both these studies and others <xref rid="pone.0049614-Barnabas1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049614-Myers1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> derived HPV natural history parameters from cohort studies in the epidemiological literature <xref rid="pone.0049614-Franco1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049614-Ho1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049614-Trottier1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049614-Remmink1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. However, such clinical studies are limited by wide intervals between follow-up appointments (which may allow multiple events to occur), unclear distinctions between the diagnosis of neoplastic grades and, in the case of estimating progression rates to cancer, ethical considerations. For this reason, there has been a move towards inferring HPV natural history parameters by fitting mathematical (mechanistic) models of HPV transmission and progression to point prevalence data on HPV infection and disease states. By so doing, it is possible to incorporate prior knowledge about the progression of infection and the protocols for screening and treatment in the study population. Early work on such inference of HPV-related parameters relied on obtaining a visually good fit between model projections and observed data <xref rid="pone.0049614-Barnabas1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049614-Kulasingam1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049614-Kohli1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Such an approach gives insight into model structures and parameter values that will yield a good fit to data but these are multiple and various <xref rid="pone.0049614-Jit1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Recently Kim et al. <xref rid="pone.0049614-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, Van de Velde <xref rid="pone.0049614-VandeVelde1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and Jit et al. <xref rid="pone.0049614-Jit1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> have evaluated the goodness of fit between model output and observed data for a wide range of possible model structures and systematically chosen parameter values and Bogaards et al. <xref rid="pone.0049614-Bogaards1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> have applied Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to characterise posterior distributions for the rates of transmissibility and waning natural immunity of 14 high-risk HPV types. These developments have allowed the beginnings of quantitative understanding of both the uncertainty and sensitivity of HPV natural history parameters. Such an insight is crucial to confident predictions of vaccination or screening programme effectiveness.</p><p>We have aimed to infer the viral transmissibility, rate of waning natural immunity and rates of progression and clearance of infection of 13 high-risk HPV types and for HPV-6 and -11, making use of two rich epidemiological datasets and a comprehensive survey of sexual activity from Sweden. Estimates of viral transmissibility, clearance of initial infection and waning immunity were derived in a Bayesian framework by fitting a susceptible-infectious-recovered-susceptible (SIRS) transmission model to age- and type-specific HPV prevalence data from both a cross-sectional study and a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of primary HPV screening. Rates of progression and clearance of clinical lesions were estimated from longitudinal data gathered as part of the same RCT. Where possible we compare our estimates of these parameters with those derived from similar studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>HPV Transmission Model</title><p>We developed a deterministic model of heterosexual partnership formation, mono-type HPV transmission and the potential progression to cervical cancer for each of 13 high-risk HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59 and 66) and for HPV-6 and -11. We model an age- and sexual activity- structured population with two sexual activity groups for each of three age brackets (14&#x02013;29; 30&#x02013;60 and 60+) where the size of the high sexual activity group is a fixed proportion (15%) of the overall population, regardless of age.

The rate of clearance of infection in males was considered equal to the rate of natural clearance in women <xref rid="pone.0049614-Giuliano1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Women with CIN-type lesions either progress to higher-grade lesions and then to cancer in a stepwise fashion (at a rate dependent on stage, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0049614.e002.jpg"/></inline-formula>) or clear the virus at rate dependent on stage (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0049614.e003.jpg"/></inline-formula> for CIN1 and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0049614.e004.jpg"/></inline-formula> for CIN2/3 lesions). Note that the clearance rate for CIN2 and CIN3 lesions is assumed to be the same; this allows for the scarce data available on infections of these grades and uncertainty in the clinical classification between CIN2 and CIN3. We did not consider spontaneous clearance at the cancer stage. The model structure for high-risk HPV transmission and progression is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049614-g001">Figure 1</xref>.

Estimates of the three natural history parameters were derived from posterior distributions of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains (chain length &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;20,000) using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm <xref rid="pone.0049614-Hastings1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The prior distribution for per-partnership transmissibility, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0049614.e081.jpg"/></inline-formula>, was uniform on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0049614.e082.jpg"/></inline-formula>, for annual rate of clearance of initial infection, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0049614.e083.jpg"/></inline-formula>, was uniform on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0049614.e084.jpg"/></inline-formula> and the inverse of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0049614.e085.jpg"/></inline-formula>, the duration of infection-induced immunity in years, was uniform on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0049614.e086.jpg"/></inline-formula>. Since a preliminary analysis attempting to infer the rate of loss of infection-induced immunity, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0049614.e087.jpg"/></inline-formula>, led to a posterior heavily skewed towards zero, it was decided to estimate the duration rather than the rate. This tendency of the rate of loss of immunity towards zero is suggestive of an underlying SIR process but, in setting the prior for duration of immunity from 0 to 100 years, we still allow for the possibility of an SIRS model structure. This is consistent with the observation by Baussano et al. <xref rid="pone.0049614-Baussano1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> that other modelling studies <xref rid="pone.0049614-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049614-VandeVelde1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049614-Kim2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> have found it necessary to assume some measure of induced or long-lasting immunity in order to achieve a good model fit.</p><p>In each iteration of the algorithm, a proposal for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0049614.e091.jpg"/></inline-formula> was sampled from a multivariate normal distribution with standard deviation 0.04 times the range of the corresponding prior density. The deterministic model was then run for this proposal set and the likelihood calculated as detailed in the main body of the paper. The proposal parameter set was then accepted with a probability determined by the ratio of its posterior density to that of the previous set.</p><p>For each type the algorithm was run for a chain of length n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;20,000. Visual inspection confirmed that the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm converged swiftly to the posterior distribution and parameter estimates were made rejecting a &#x02018;burn-in&#x02019; period of 100 iterations. Examples of the MCMC traces are shown in Figures S1 and S2 for HPV-16 and HPV-45 respectively. We report 95% posterior intervals for the posterior distributions of all MCMC-estimated parameters. These are obtained from the 2.5<sup>th</sup> and 97.5<sup>th</sup> percentiles of all iterates after the burn-in period.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>The observed age-dependent prevalence of high-risk HPV infection was accurately replicated by the appropriate type-specific model for each type (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049614-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In general, a good fit to the data was observed, with the model able to replicate the rapid acquisition of markers, the peak in prevalence in women in their twenties, and the decline thereafter. In the cases of HPV-33, -35, -45 and -58, the models over-estimated the prevalence of infection with respect to the data. This was not due to a failure of the Markov chain to converge (see <italic>Supplementary Material</italic>; further data available on request). The prevalence of HPV-16 infection in women taking part in the Swedescreen trial was higher than those of the same age (32&#x02013;38) attending Chlamydia testing, HPV-18 and HPV-33 were observed at closely comparable levels in both studies but all other high-risk types were less prevalent in the former group. This disparity probably represents the higher representation of highly sexually active women in the voluntarily attending Chlamydia screening in their mid-thirties.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Estimation of Progression and Clearance Rates of CIN-type Lesions</title><p>The median estimated rates of progression and clearance of CIN1-type lesions in four high-risk HPV types, each with a 95% adjusted bootstrap confidence interval, are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0049614-t003">Table 3</xref>.

HPV-16 was among those with the highest median estimates with an estimated 5-year cumulative proportion of clearance of 11.4% (5.4%&#x02013;15.0%). Such low rates of waning natural immunity imply that the protection conferred by infection with a certain HPV type might indeed be, at least for some, life-long; an assumption held in other modelling studies <xref rid="pone.0049614-Barnabas1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049614-Baussano2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have made estimates for the transmissibility, clearance and progression rates and rates of waning natural immunity for 13 high-risk types of HPV by using Swedish behavioural and epidemiological data to fit an ensemble of deterministic models of HPV transmission and progression. The datasets used included the &#x02018;<italic>Sex in Sweden&#x02019;</italic> sexual behaviour survey, longitudinal data on HPV prevalence and clinical disease progression from the randomised controlled trial of HPV testing, &#x02018;<italic>Swedescreen&#x02019;</italic>, and HPV type-specific prevalence data gathered as part of the Swedish voluntary Chlamydia screening programme. The analysis was formed of two stages. Firstly, rates were estimated for the stepwise progression of different HPV types to disease of increasing clinical severity and of clearance of different grades of late-stage infection. Secondly, these estimated rates were incorporated into a monotype SIRS-structured deterministic model of the transmission and progression of HPV. This model was then fitted to HPV prevalence data using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) routine, in order to estimate the transmissibility, rate of clearance of initial infection and rate of waning natural immunity of each type in turn.</p><p>It was observed that the models over-estimated the observed prevalence of four of the high-risk types. We suggest that this is an artefact of modelling the HPV types independently. Three of these types (-33, -35 and -58) are, in fact, three of the most closely phylogenetically-related to HPV-16; the most prevalent type. HPV-45 is the most closely related to the second most prevalent type, HPV-18. It is feasible that this similarity leads to cross-immunity between the types, effectively reducing the number of young women susceptible to infection with types -33, -35, -45 and -58.</p><p>We found variation in the rates of clearance of initial infection to be a very informative parameter in the fitting of type-specific models of HPV prevalence to data, indicating that this may be an important determinant in the differing prevalences between types. The lowest rates of clearance of initial infection were observed in HPV-16, -18 and -31, the most prevalent of the high-risk HPV types. This would again support the theory that higher prevalence is associated with persistence of infection, though we would agree with Bogaards et al. <xref rid="pone.0049614-Bogaards1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> that this does not preclude a role for transmissibility and immunity.</p><p>Our estimates of transmissibility did not differ significantly between types although there remained a large degree of uncertainty. Our inferred values were in line with those estimated in previous studies: the median per-partnership transmissibility of HPV-16 was estimated to be 0.718 with a 95% posterior interval of 0.286&#x02013;0.999) compared with 0.8 estimated by Hughes et al. <xref rid="pone.0049614-Hughes1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. However, values for all types were skewed towards the maximum limit of 1. We suggest that this may be attributable either to an underestimate in the sexual activity data or to the assumption of proportionate random mixing by age and sexual activity group, or to a combination of the two. Barnabas et al. <xref rid="pone.0049614-Barnabas1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> had a similar finding, noting that survey data will tend to underestimate sensitive sexual behaviour such as partner change rates. This study has the further complication that the sexual activity data used, although well matched to the study population in geographical and demographical terms, predates the epidemiological data used for fitting (and the time period of modelling interest) by at least ten years. It is reasonable to suppose that sexual behaviour trends in the intervening decade may well have given rise to a higher HPV prevalence than that contemporaneous with the sexual activity data, requiring an increase in the inferred transmissibility to compensate. Alternatively, the inferred transmission probabilities may have been pushed higher by assuming completely proportionate mixing. In fact this is a very strong assumption: age-dependent mixing in particular is known to be assortative and concentration of transmission in certain age groups may reduce the transmission probabilities needed to fit the observed data.</p><p>The rate of waning immunity was estimated to be very low; the 5-year cumulative proportions of clearance varied between 6%&#x02013;12% across the 13 types. This would imply that few women become susceptible to re-infection with any given HPV type and that the observed decrease in the force of infection in the early twenties is more likely to be due to immunity than to decreased sexual activity. Indeed, our estimates of the rate of waning immunity would imply that the protection conferred by infection with HPV is effectively close to life-long.</p><p>We have also further contributed to the literature estimating the rates of progression and clearance of clinical lesions due to HPV, extending the field by deriving type-specific estimates of progression rates up to CIN3-grade lesions for type -31 and 33 and clearance thereof. Our results implied that the rate of progression of other high-risk types from CIN1 to higher grade lesions was significantly lower than for HPV-16 and HPV-18, indicating that their less prominent role in the cause of cervical cancer may be due not solely to lower prevalence but also to an inherently lower oncogenicity. Our estimates are similar to others in the literature although they are subject to a large degree of uncertainty, highlighting the benefit that would be derived from pooling data on disease progression from <italic>Swedescreen</italic> with those collected as part of other studies elsewhere. Such collation would increase the power of the analysis, ensuring more certainty in the inferred rates.</p><p>Although this analysis provides some useful new insight into HPV-related parameters, it has some limitations. Firstly, the nature of deterministic compartmental models means that it is not possible to consider diversity in individual-level behaviour. For example, we estimate here the per-partnership transmissibility of HPV infection. In order to derive from this a per-act transmissibility requires us to assume an &#x02018;average&#x02019; partnership between a susceptible and an infected partner. Also, we assume that all women have an equivalent approach to screening and subsequent treatment. Such an assumption belies the true underlying heterogeneity; in fact, it is those women who do not attend screening who are more likely to go on to develop high-grade clinical lesions and cervical cancer. In considering the more subtle questions policy-makers face in terms of vaccination and screening programmes it is common for complex individual-based models to be used. However, the fitting of these models is similarly complex due to the long run times and inherent stochasticity of these models. The type-specific estimates we have made here for HPV transmissibility and rates of progression and clearance will facilitate the parameterisation of such individual-based models by, for example, providing prior ranges for natural history parameters. These models will then, in turn, allow a more thorough understanding of the complex natural history of HPV infection and its implications for the efficacy of vaccine and screening programmes in this new era of HPV prevention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0049614.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
