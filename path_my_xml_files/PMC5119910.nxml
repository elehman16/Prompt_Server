Falls and injuries are also among the top geriatric health issues because falls are often devastating and costly (<xref rid="bibr39-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Rubenstein, 2006</xref>). About one third of elderly more than 65 years old experience at least one fall accident per year (<xref rid="bibr16-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Gillespie et al., 2012</xref>). The rate of falls and severity of the resulting complications increases dramatically with age (<xref rid="bibr39-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Rubenstein, 2006</xref>). The majority of falls occur due to multiple interacting factors. For community-dwelling elderly, the two most important intrinsic predictors for a fall accident are taking medications and having a poor balance (<xref rid="bibr16-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Gillespie et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Several factors contribute to an adequate balance confidence and control, and consequently promote mobility and prevent falls. Essential factors are reliable sensory information from the visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive and mechanoreceptive systems; a well-functioning central nervous system (CNS) with feedback and feed forward loops able to withstand external and internal volitions; as well as adequate musculoskeletal strength and sufficient range of motion in the joints for adequate movement (<xref rid="bibr20-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Horak, 2006</xref>). Factors that can impair balance control are, for example, pain, cognitive impairment, and fear of falling (<xref rid="bibr21-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Howe, Rochester, Neil, Skelton, &#x00026; Ballinger, 2011</xref>). Moreover, age-related degeneration and a variety of diseases, more common with older age, can afflict all functions and systems involved in balance control (<xref rid="bibr24-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr38-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Rosenhall, 1973</xref>).</p><p>Falls prevention exercise is currently considered the best approach for primary and secondary fall prevention at a population level, and well-designed exercise programs have been evidenced to prevent falls and injuries for community-dwelling elderly (<xref rid="bibr12-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">El-Khoury, Cassou, Charles, &#x00026; Dargent-Molina, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bibr16-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Gillespie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr40-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Sherrington, Tiedemann, Fairhall, Close, &#x00026; Lord, 2011</xref>). The reported fall rate reduction for elderly who have participated in the Otago and the Otago-based fitness and mobility exercise programs has been 35% to 54% (<xref rid="bibr6-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Campbell et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bibr35-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Robertson, Campbell, Gardner, &#x00026; Devlin, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bibr42-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Skelton, Dinan, Campbell, &#x00026; Rutherford, 2005</xref>). These and other fall-preventive interventions are delivered by health care professionals either individually at home or in group sessions or with a mixed approach a few times a week, targeting strength and balance exercises, sometimes complemented by endurance exercise such as walking (<xref rid="bibr6-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Campbell et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bibr7-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Clemson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr16-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Gillespie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr19-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Hektoen, Aas, &#x00026; Luras, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr35-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Robertson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bibr37-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Robitaille et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr42-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Skelton et al., 2005</xref>). However, these earlier training programs do not specifically focus on exercises stimulating sensory reweighting, nor do they emphasize exercises improving gaze stabilization by challenging vestibulo-ocular and vestibulocervical interactions. These functions are crucial for a well-functioning postural control system, especially considering that degeneration and disease often afflict these systems with aging. Furthermore, performing balance exercises on an even more frequent basis than recommended by the Otago-based programs could instigate a more effective learning and consolidation process (<xref rid="bibr47-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Tjernstrom, Bagher, Fransson, &#x00026; Magnusson, 2010</xref>).</p><p>The purpose of this study was to enhance and simplify existing fall intervention programs by including exercises that promote the reweighting capabilities in the postural control system, as well as challenge the vestibulo-ocular and vestibulocervical interactions and improve gaze stabilization. The intention was to develop a comprehensive balance-enhancing exercise program (BEEP) that could be customized to individual balance skills, and be performed safely and efficiently by relatively healthy elderly. An aim was also to make the BEEP so condensed in time that it would not be considered too bothersome and hence be accepted as habitually performed as a daily routine in the home environment without professional supervision. Another objective was to determine the efficiency of multimodal training to enhance static and dynamic balance control in community-dwelling people more than 60 years old.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="section1-2333721416644149"><title>Method</title><sec id="section2-2333721416644149"><title>Participants</title><p>Forty community-dwelling elderly participants were recruited for the study.

Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before the tests, and they were informed that they could stop the tests and participation in the study for any reason and without explanation. The study was approved by the local ethics committee and performed in accordance with the revised version of the Helsinki declaration.</p><p>After interviewing participants regarding their medical and trauma history, they underwent a thorough medical examination with special attention to the head and neck region and the cranial nerves. Video equipment was used for the head impulse test (vHIT), smooth pursuit and saccades, as well as spontaneous, gaze-evoked, headshake, and positional nystagmus.

The exercise program was designed to be self-administered in the home environment with the help of written instructions, and after initial instruction and practice with a test leader. In addition, the program was designed to include essential multimodal components and to adhere to evidence-based training principles as outlined by the American College of Sports Medicine (<xref rid="bibr45-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Thompson, Gordon, Pescatello, &#x00026; American College of Sports Medicine, 2009</xref>). Only exercises that were simple to implement and safe to perform in a home environment were included. To minimize the risk of orthostatic hypotension and syncope, the program started with a 3-min warm up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2333721416644149">Figure 1</xref>). This also allowed the participants to mentally focus on the training. The program included exercises facilitating the sensory reweighting processes because aging causes a multitude of degenerative processes affecting the ability of all the sensory systems to detect position and movements. Hence, the BEEP was comprised of exercises on solid (floor) and compliant surfaces (double-folded exercises mats) while having eyes open (EO) or eyes closed (EC).</p><fig id="fig1-2333721416644149" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>The BEEP.</p><p>BEEP = balance-enhancing exercise program.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2333721416644149-fig1"/></fig><p>Stability needs to be maintained during challenges in controlling a multisegmented structure, and where the control of each joint requires resources in terms of muscle force of sufficient magnitude and flexibility.

Therefore, exercises facilitating strength, motor control, and coordination were also incorporated in the program. Exercises challenging gaze stabilization were included as well because the vestibular system senses head movement and spatial orientation, and produces reflexes to stabilize gaze and maintain posture.</p><p>Moreover, the BEEP could be individualized with progressive difficulty by the participants as their balanced proficiency improved. The participants were recommended to perform the exercises daily if possible, preferably while standing in a corner, close to a wall or in a door opening, and, when needed, having a chair in front of them to provide support if necessary.</p><p>The study was conducted as a prospective randomized single-blind controlled trial with an arm crossover. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2333721416644149">Figure 2</xref> depicts the study design and participant&#x02019;s flow throughout the study. The study involved data collection at three different points in time for the initial control group (ICG) and twice for the initial intervention group (IIG). Both groups were evaluated with a baseline (preintervention) and after 6 weeks. The ICG was reevaluated after another 6 weeks after having performed the BEEP. A phone checkup was conducted by a test leader after 3 weeks of training. All tests, except the posturography, were performed by a test leader who did not know which group the participants belonged to (ICG or IIG), except for the ICG when participants returned for their final evaluation.</p><fig id="fig2-2333721416644149" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Flowchart of the study.</p><p><italic>Note.</italic> BEEP = balance-enhancing exercise program; ICG = initial control group; IIG = initial intervention group; w = weeks.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2333721416644149-fig2"/></fig><p>To evaluate the efficacy of the BEEP, a battery of functional balance and psychometric outcome measures and questionnaires were chosen that relate to everyday activities.</p><sec id="section4-2333721416644149"><title>One-leg standing time (OLST)</title><p>Participants stood barefoot on solid surface (floor) or compliant surface (double-folded 2-cm-thick exercise mat) with EO or with EC up to 60 s until they put their foot down or repositioned the standing foot.

In the posttraining interviews, the participants described that their balance had improved when walking and that it was easier for them to get dressed, especially putting on socks.</p><sec id="section15-2333721416644149"><title>OLST</title><p>On solid surface with EO, the mean OLST improved by 13 s (+32%, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .001) after 6 weeks of training (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2333721416644149">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2333721416644149">Figure 3</xref>). Before the intervention, 29% of the participants could balance with EO on solid surface on either foot for 60 s, and 15% could balance on one of the feet for 60 s. After 6 weeks of intervention, 56% could balance on either foot for 60 s and 26% could balance on one of the feet for 60 s during the same conditions. The mean OLST on solid surface improved by 10 s (+206%, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .001) with EC after 6 weeks of training (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2333721416644149">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2333721416644149">Figure 3</xref>). None of the participants could balance on one foot for 60 s with EC before the intervention, whereas 12% could do so after the intervention. On the compliant surface with EO, only 29 of 34 participants managed the OLST test for more than 1 s before the training. Six of the 34 participants (17%) could balance for 60 s on both right and left feet. After the training, 17 of the 34 participants (50%) could do so. Before the training, five participants could balance for 60 s on only one of their feet. But after the training, four of them could balance for 60 s on both their right and left feet, whereas five additional participants were able to balance on one foot for 60 s. Thus, the mean OLST on either foot had improved by about 17 s (+54%, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .001) after the training. On the compliant surface with EC, only 12 of the 34 participants managed the OLST test more than 1 s before the training. The recorded mean improvements after the training were small, less than 1 s (7%, <italic>p</italic> = <italic>ns</italic>). None of the participants could balance on one foot on compliant surface for 60 s with EC before or after the training.</p><table-wrap id="table1-2333721416644149" orientation="portrait"

All these impairments increase the risk of becoming unbalanced and falling. Thus, most elderly must use other postural control strategies. They need to reweight sensory information and execution of movements to the components in the postural system that function better.</p><p>To promote CNS plasticity to change and evaluate different information sources, the BEEP was designed to include stability exercise sequences where the individual sensory systems in systematic combinations provide less information and the balance feedback loops are reweighted to the remaining functional balance systems (<xref rid="bibr48-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Tjernstrom, Fransson, Patel, &#x00026; Magnusson, 2010</xref>). Consequently, balance exercises with EO and EC on both solid and compliant surfaces with less foot support and sensory information were included: squats (Exercises 1a, 1b, 4a, 4b), heel/calf raising (Exercises 2a, 2b), one-leg standing (Exercises 3a, 3b, 5a, 5b), and head rotations (Exercises 6a, 6b).</p></sec><sec id="section24-2333721416644149"><title>Exercises improving gaze stabilization</title><p>The peripheral and central vestibular systems deteriorate with age, which may cause poor balance and dizziness in the elderly (<xref rid="bibr38-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Rosenhall, 1973</xref>).

Furthermore, the exercises were constructed so that they could provide motivational qualitative and quantitative feedback of balance improvements. The intention was that the elderly individuals would first learn to master a simpler exercise, and when their balance proficiency increased, it would be possible to proceed to more difficult and complex exercises, that is, use combinations of motor control and the sensory reweighting processes (e.g., one-leg standing with EC on a compliant surface for a longer time, as in Exercise 5). This ensured that the participants were exposed to challenging exercises facilitating sensorimotor control training.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section28-2333721416644149"><title>Training Outcome</title><p>The multimodal intervention approach significantly improved balance when standing on two feet while being perturbed both with EO and EC, and on different surfaces. Balance control also increased when balancing on one foot, both with EO and EC on solid surface and with EO on compliant surface. There were improvements in other balance measures, as well as in balance confidence.</p><p>The improvements might be due to the BEEP included exercises (e.g., one-leg standing and knee squats) with both EO and EC, first on solid surfaces, and, with increasing balance proficiency, progressing to completing the exercises on compliant surfaces. This facilitates the sensory reweighting process that is indeed necessary when one tries to balance without visual information when vibrations are causing perturbations or even more so when standing on compliant surfaces. The improvements in balance control, as well as in balance confidence, might also be attributed to the BEEP including exercises facilitating strength, motor control, and coordination. These were knee squats, heel/calf raises, as well as rotational jumps and head rotations, which also stimulated the vestibulo-ocular, vestibulocervical, and vestibulospinal postural systems. The improvements were corroborated by the participants noting that they were more balance confident when performing regular daily activities such as getting dressed, especially when putting on socks. Furthermore, the addition of vestibular-specific gaze stability exercises might also have increased the efficacy of the program. It has been shown that adding these type of exercises to standard balance rehabilitation results in greater reduction in fall risk in older adults with normal vestibular function who report dizziness (<xref rid="bibr18-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Hall et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The improvements in balance control were confirmed with posturography as well as OLST and several other functional balance assessment tests (<xref rid="bibr21-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Howe et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, the substantial improvements in balancing on one leg were corroborated with less sway recorded by the posturography when perturbed while standing on two legs on both solid and compliant surfaces. Including posturography as a measure of balance control is an advantage because functional balance measures usually lack the ability to detect balance impairment at its early phase when manifested problems do not yet exist (<xref rid="bibr32-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Pajala et al., 2008</xref>). Increased anteroposterior sway, that is, center of pressure movement measured by posturography, has been shown, however, to predict subsequent falls for elderly community-dwelling women (<xref rid="bibr3-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Bergland, Jarnlo, &#x00026; Laake, 2003</xref>). Moreover, it was imperative to verify the improvements in balance control after the intervention by the objective posturography method because one-leg standing was also included in the BEEP.</p><p>Another key objective of the study was to ensure that the intervention itself improved balance control and confidence, and not by the potential bias of the participants being made aware of their balance performance as they executed the tests and answered questionnaires. Thus, a randomized crossover design was utilized. After 6 weeks of exercises, the IIG had significantly improved in most balance tests, whereas the ICG only showed nonsignificant improvements when evaluated without having performed the BEEP.</p><p>It was important to involve participants who were relatively healthy to reflect the broader aging population. Thus, the BEEP is intended to be used as a complement to other physical activities focusing on balance improvement. As indicated by the high score in BBS, HAP, ABC, and the Mattiasson-Nilo questionnaires, our participants were relatively high functioning, mobile seniors who probably did not have high fall-risk levels. The study is thus highly relevant to the increasingly aging population. Hence, the BEEP has a potential to be applied before balance dysfunction becomes too advanced. Hopefully, the intervention has the potential to prevent fall accidents in the long term by successfully improving balance and promoting health. The program may assist and help maintain the functional capability and mobility performance of community-dwelling older adults with relatively low risk for falls.</p><p>When the participants had completed 6 weeks of intervention, the ability to balance on one leg with available visual information had increased by more than 30%. This improvement could have a significant positive impact in preventing fall-related fractures because this balance measurement has been validated for predicting frailty and hip fractures in community-dwelling elderly populations (<xref rid="bibr26-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Lundin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr29-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Michikawa, Nishiwaki, Takebayashi, &#x00026; Toyama, 2009</xref>).</p><p>When comparing the BEEP intervention results with a recent systematic review of &#x0201c;Exercise for Improving Balance in Older People&#x0201d; that included 43 studies using multiple exercise types, some differences are notable (<xref rid="bibr21-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Howe et al., 2011</xref>). The intervention resulted in greater improvement in walking speed&#x02014;mean difference (MD) 0.16 m/s versus 0.04 m/s (15 studies)&#x02014;and increased ability to balance on one leg on solid surface when visual information was available&#x02014;MD 13 s versus 5 s (nine studies). On the contrary, the improvement from the BEEP was lower in the TUG test&#x02014;MD &#x02212;1.2 s versus &#x02212;1.6 s (12 studies)&#x02014;and in the BBS&#x02014;MD 0.85 p versus 1.84 p (two studies). One possible explanation for these differences might be that the BEEP participants were slightly younger than in the Cochrane review (mean age 70 vs. 75) and thus might have had better balance before the intervention. Younger elderly with better balance can probably improve more in the OLST and walking speed tests, which are more challenging than the easier BBS and TUG tests. However, improvements in stability after the intervention, according to the posturography results, were not significantly correlated to age. Consequently, participants of all ages seemed to benefit from the BEEP intervention. The older participants improved their stability more than the younger participants during balance perturbations with EO on solid surface, which is one of the easier posturography tests, and during quiet stance with EC on compliant surface, which is more challenging.</p><p>Considering that elderly often have impaired or reduced visual acuity, the more than 200% improvement in balancing on one leg without visual information after the intervention is particularly noteworthy. Prior studies have shown that there is a significant age-dependent decrease in the ability to balance on leg with closed eyes (<xref rid="bibr5-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Bohannon et al., 1984</xref>; <xref rid="bibr43-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Springer, Marin, Cyhan, Roberts, &#x00026; Gill, 2007</xref>). In the above-mentioned systematic review by <xref rid="bibr21-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Howe et al. (2011)</xref>, only two studies were presented that investigated balancing skills on one leg with closed eyes on solid surface where participants improved 1.60 s after &#x0201c;multiple exercise types&#x0201d; compared with control participants (<xref rid="bibr1-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Arai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bibr21-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Howe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr44-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Suzuki, Kim, Yoshida, &#x00026; Ishizaki, 2004</xref>). However, after the intervention, the mean improvement was 10.25 s. A substantial difference though the mean preintervention time in the present study was 4.15 s, which is comparable with the mean 4.14 s presented for the participants in the Arai and Suzuki studies (<xref rid="bibr1-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Arai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bibr44-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Suzuki et al., 2004</xref>). The present cohort being slightly younger than in the above might again explain some of the disparities in improvements. However, in our study, age only correlated significantly with the improvement after the intervention for OLST on compliant surface with EC, as well as with sway standing unperturbed on compliant surface with EC. Accordingly, one of the distinctive strengths in the intervention may be that it includes exercises designed to train balance when vision is lacking. Balancing with EC is particularly difficult and thus appears to be an appropriate balance exercise to challenge the relatively healthy elderly.</p><p>Most other balance exercise interventions have been delivered by health care professionals either individually at home or in group sessions or with a mixed approach a few times week and are thus relatively costly compared with self-training (<xref rid="bibr6-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Campbell et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bibr7-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Clemson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr19-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Hektoen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr36-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Robertson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bibr37-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Robitaille et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr42-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Skelton et al., 2005</xref>). The BEEP is a purely home-based intervention where the exercises can be individually tailored by the participants as their balance proficiency increases. The improved balance results indicate that the exercises could be made sufficiently difficult by the participants to challenge their postural control system and instigate learning processes (<xref rid="bibr48-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Tjernstrom, Fransson, et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, it seems like relatively little time and effort had to be spent by the participants to accomplish the improvements compared with other exercise interventions. The roughly 16 min a day 4 times a week the participants spent only adds up to about half the weekly amount recommended by most other balance exercise intervention programs, that is, of at least 2 hr of balance exercises per week for at least 3 months on an ongoing basis (<xref rid="bibr6-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Campbell et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bibr7-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Clemson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr19-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Hektoen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr36-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Robertson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bibr37-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Robitaille et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr42-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Skelton et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, the mean total training time during the six weeks only adds up to about 6&#x000bd; hr, which is quite lower than the, at least, 50 hr that has been considered necessary to reduce falls (<xref rid="bibr40-2333721416644149" ref-type="bibr">Sherrington et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="section29-2333721416644149"><title>Study Limitations</title><p>A potential study limitation is recruitment bias of the participants. The participants recruited were already, or were made, health and balance conscious by first accepting and then participating in the study. One can question if the recruited participants are representative of the study objectives&#x02014;that is&#x02014;to improve balance in relatively healthy community-dwelling elderly without professional supervision. The participants in this cohort considered themselves relatively healthy despite that many of them had several concurrent medical conditions, some severe. Hence, they can be considered as being rather representative for the large group of active elderly who would be possible candidates for this type of intervention.</p><p>The participants were instructed to perform the training regularly and did so for a mean of 16 min 4 times a week. Furthermore, there were no dropouts due to lack of commitment or interest, except for one participant due to the coming holiday season. The dropouts had similar demographic and balance characteristics as the participants. The enthusiasm of all the other participants might be representative for many of the increasingly healthy and active elderly.</p><p>Relatively few participants in the cohort may explain the lack of improvement in some of the balance outcome measurements as well as in the questionnaires after the intervention for both the initial intervention and control groups. Another reason for lack of improvement could be the ceiling effect, particularly when interpreting OLST and tandem stance results because a maximum time limit was set to 60, respectively 10 s. The ceiling effect could also play a role when evaluating the result of the easier balance tests as the present cohort was relatively highly functioning elderly. Another bias to consider was that the participants performed the OLST and posturography tests in a nonrandomized order, that is, with EO and EC first on a solid and then on a compliant surface.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section30-2333721416644149"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Multimodal balance exercises offer an efficient, cost-effective way to improve balance control and confidence in elderly.
