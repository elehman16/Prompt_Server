As there is no cure, therapy aims for symptom release and reduction of disease progression. Physical exercises have been defined as a core treatment for osteoarthritis. However, research questions related to dose response, sustainability of effects, economic efficiency and safety are still open and will be evaluated in this trial, investigating a progressive weight machine-based strength training.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This is a quasi-experimental controlled trial in the context of health services research. The intervention group (n=300) is recruited from participants of an offer for insurants of a health insurance company suffering from hip or knee osteoarthritis. Potential participants of the control group are selected and written to from the insurance database according to predefined matching criteria. The final statistical twins from the control responders will be determined via propensity score matching (n=300). The training intervention comprises 24 supervised mandatory sessions (2/week) and another 12 facultative sessions (1/week). Exercises include resistance training for the lower extremity and core muscles by use of weight machines and small training devices. The training offer is available at two sites. They differ with respect to the weight machines in use resulting in different dosage parameters. Primary outcomes are self-reported pain and function immediately after the 12-week intervention period. Health-related quality of life, self-efficacy, cost utility and safety will be evaluated as secondary outcomes. Secondary analysis will be undertaken with two strata related to study site. Participants will be followed up 6, 12 and 24&#x02009;months after baseline.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>German Clinical Trial Register DRKS00009257.

OA goes along with symptoms such as joint stiffness, crepitus, occasional effusion, variable degrees of inflammation and functional impairment and worsens general health status and health-related quality of life.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;4</xref> OA therefore has a relevant impact on the individual and the healthcare system, inducing considerable direct and indirect healthcare costs.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Cumulative cost of absence from work, medical costs and community and social services in Europe is currently estimated at 0.5% of gross national product.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> The economic burden will further increase according to the demographic change in industrialised countries.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 7</xref> In consequence, development and evaluation of effective and cost-efficient treatment strategies are of particular importance to counteract the aforementioned increase of personal as well as economic burden of OA.</p><p>Joint replacement may be the final therapeutic option in hip or knee OA. In earlier stages, conservative therapeutic interventions are important to reduce pain and increase function and health-related quality of life.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 8</xref> The use of pharmacological therapies in chronic diseases is limited because of known and significant side effects.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Non-pharmaceutical interventions such as physical exercise programme are therefore of particular importance. Treatment effects are similar to simple analgesics and oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, reports on known side effects such as pain increase or falls are rare; thus, exercise appears to be a safe intervention.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 9&#x02013;11</xref></p><p>Different land-based intervention types have shown to be effective in terms of pain reduction and improvement of physical functioning in the short term in subjects with hip or knee OA.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 12&#x02013;14</xref> In consequence, international guidelines and expert panels recommend exercises for increasing strength and aerobic capacity as well as flexibility and neuromuscular training as first-line strategies for the treatment of hip and knee OA.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;18</xref></p><p>Despite given evidence and consistent recommendations, implications for research highlight the need for further studies to determine dose-response relationship of physical exercises on pain, physical functioning and other outcome measures,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13 17</xref> to assess intervention effects on self-efficacy, quality of life, need for joint replacement and use of analgesic medications<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> and to assess efficiency of the intervention from an economic perspective.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> These research topics will be addressed in a quasi-experimental controlled study in the context of health services research. The outlined study evaluates a supervised weight machine-based hip and knee strength training for patients with hip and/or knee OA in comparison to general care. The intervention is delivered at two study sites with differing exercise modes.</p><p>The primary aim of this superiority trial is to determine whether a 12-week progressive training programme decreases symptom-related pain and increases physical function in adult subjects in comparison to a matched OA control group in the short term. Effectiveness is quantified by the subscales pain and physical function of the Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC Index 3.1 NRS).</p><p>Secondary outcomes will be differentiated into a short-term perspective (3 months), a mid-term perspective (6 months) and a long-term perspective (follow-up data 12 and 24 months after the initiation of the intervention). The aims are to determine whether a 12-week progressive supervised weight machine-based strength training programme with a complementary 12-week facultative intervention period&#x02026;<list list-type="roman-upper"><list-item><p>improves muscle strength (no control comparator),</p></list-item><list-item><p>improves health-related quality of life and/or global rating of health,</p></list-item><list-item><p>decreases pain,</p></list-item><list-item><p>improves physical function,</p></list-item><list-item><p>improves self-efficacy and physical activity levels,</p></list-item><list-item><p>delays time to surgery</p></list-item><list-item><p>is efficient with regard to personal and/or social costs.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Aside from (I), all other secondary outcomes are compared with the control group.</p><p>In the context of a secondary analysis, outcomes will be differentiated into different intervention modes (mode of muscle contraction and number of repetitions for each muscle group) according to the instrument settings of the used strength machines at the two study sites being involved in the study. Exercise adherence, patient satisfaction and safety are further outcomes. They will be assessed throughout the intervention period for the intervention group only.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s1a1"><title>Design</title><p>This is a quasi-experimental two-centre controlled trial of a 12+12&#x02009;week strength training programme with an 18-month follow-up in the context of health services research. All participants are insurance holders of the large statutory health insurance company AOK Baden-Wuerttemberg (AOK-BW) with approximately four million members in the federal state in which the study is conducted. Participants of the intervention group (IG) will be compared with a matched-pair control group (CO) to investigate the effects of an exercise intervention on clinical and economic outcomes. Matched pairs between IG and CO are determined by means of the propensity score method. Participants of IG are further allocated into a machine-based concentric/concentric strengthening programme (IG-SG) versus a machine-based concentric/eccentric strengthening programme (IG-Z) according to their place of residence and therefore study site (centre Z or SG). Measurements will be taken at baseline (t0), 3 months (t3), 6 months (t6), 12 months (t12) and 24 months (t24). Economic data will further be evaluated retrospectively for 2&#x02009;years prior to baseline.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study flow diagram.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjsem-2017-000291f01"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Recruiting and participants</title><sec id="s1b1"><title>Recruitment of active study sample (IG)</title><p>The active study sample consists of eligible participants of a pilot project by the AOK-BW.

Further specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for study participation are listed in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="B1">box 1</xref>. The exercise programme is offered at two locations of the country. The recruitment period is 1&#x02009;year. In this time frame, the intervention will be offered to approximately 200 participants at each study site (Z and SG). Local insurants with hip and/or knee OA can participate provided that their physicians prescribe the healthcare offer. Prior to this, practitioners in the region of the two study sites are introduced into the new offer. They are requested to check comorbidities as well as OA diagnosis before transcribing patients to the healthcare offer. Interested patients then register for the exercise programme at one study site and get informed about its accompanying scientific evaluation. Further details including the study information sheet for participants and the informed consent form will be delivered by mail. This mail will be sent to each participant prior to the first training and test session. The mail further includes the self-administered questionnaires. It will be mentioned that study participation is not a presupposition for exercise participation. Eligibility of the patients to enter the exercise programme and to participate in the study will finally be determined by checking the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the exercise programme during the patient&#x02019;s first visit (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="B1">box 1</xref>) and retrospectively by information recorded via the self-administered questionnaire at t0 (SAQ, table 1). Patients refraining from the study receive the same exercise programme and isometric peak torque test for feedback but do not enter the statistical evaluation.

Subsequently, subjects are offered to participate in the preservation exercise programme over another 12 weeks (one session/week) from t3 to t6. After this supervised intervention period (t3 or t6), participants are further advised to continue physical exercises autonomously. In this regard, participants may attend further offers of the health insurance company.</p><p>Strength training is structured into motor learning (weeks 1&#x02013;2), strength endurance training (weeks 3&#x02013;5), maximum strength training (weeks 6&#x02013;12) and a facultative 12-week strength preservation phase (online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary file 2</xref>). It comprises exercises for hip, knee and core muscles. Training starts with a 5&#x02009;min ergometer warm-up, followed by 30&#x02009;s stretches of the subsequently loaded muscle groups. The strength training consists of two sets for each muscle group performed consecutively with the first set using weight machines for strength training (online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary file 3</xref>), followed by the second set applying functional exercises in supine, sitting and standing postures. Elastic rubber bands, exercise balls, weight cuffs and subjects&#x02019; own body weight are used as training devices (online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary file 4</xref>). While the functional exercises are identical at the two study sites, different kinds of strength training machines are used (study site SG: FREI AG, Kirchzarten, Germany; study site Z: Proxomed Medizintechnik, Alzenau, Germany). SG uses strength training machines where both agonistic and antagonistic muscles are trained in the same repetition in a concentric-concentric (con-con) mode. Z uses strength training weight machines where only the agonistic muscle group is trained separately in a concentric-eccentric (con-ecc) mode (online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary file 3)</xref>. The exercises performed are standardised (trainers receive a standard operating procedure) and matched between the two study sites. Matching includes overall configuration (height adjustment, adjustment to range of motion), movement velocity (2&#x02013;3&#x02009;s for each movement direction), number of repetitions and perceived exertion after the training set. However, the different exercise modes (concentric/concentric vs concentric/eccentric) at the two study sites lead to different overall workloads per muscle group. Participants at study site Z perform about twice the workload (load&#x000d7;range of motion of a repetition) for a muscle group. This also leads to more time spent for each exercise session at study site Z in comparison to study site SG. Thus, the complete training duration varies between 40 and 60&#x02009;min according to training site. However, pretesting indicated that, although training duration and workload differ, the perceived exertion ratings were similar for each strength training machine exercise when performing with the same percentage of a patient&#x02019;s isometric maximum voluntary contraction (iMVC) value.</p><p>For hip and knee exercises using weight machines, training intensity is determined according to the test results of the iMVC testing that is applied prior to the first exercise session of the programme (see also: outcome measures, physical performance tests). No iMVC strength testing will be performed for back extension and flexion to avoid adverse events related to spontaneous vertebrae fractures in subjects at higher risk for osteoporosis. Exercise loads for core muscles and for subjects who cannot perform iMVC testing for the lower extremity because of pain or subjective discomfort are guided via subjective exhaustion after the exercises (online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary files 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">5</xref>). This procedure is also used to guide progression of training loads within the intervention period. Training loads of functional exercises can be adapted by use of elastic rubber bands with different resiliencies, weight cuffs, subjects own body weight and varying lever arms of the moving extremity.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1d2"><title>Control intervention: general care (CO)</title><p>Participants of the control group receive general care and may attend other offers of the health insurance company.

We do not assume a relevant efficacy-effectiveness gap in the study described in this protocol because the intervention under study is a pilot offer for insurance holders at two sites of the country only, with highly experienced and trained providers in a resource-intensive &#x02018;ideal setting&#x02019;.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> We thus also assume standardised differences of 0.5 for this study according to the above-mentioned effect sizes of the randomised controlled trial by Krauss <italic>et al</italic>.</p><p>Due to the fact that we want to test the two endpoints (pain and physical function) simultaneously, we choose a level of significance of 0.025 (two sided, Bonferroni correction) and a power of 0.90 for each test. This leads to a sample size of 101 evaluable subjects per group in the parallel group design (nQuery release 7.0). We assume a prestudy drop-out rate of 25% due to non-eligibility or non-willingness of subscribers to the healthcare offer to participate in the study. We further assume a ~30%&#x02009;drop-out rate after inclusion. The intervention will therefore be offered to 400 participants; of them, 300 subjects should be allocated to the trial. This sample size estimation takes into account the secondary separate analysis of the factor study site/training mode with two levels. The control group includes one statistical twin for each participant. This leads to a final sample size of 300 subjects in the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>).</p><p>We refrain from analysing our data using a matched-pair design as propensity score matching does not guarantee that individual pairs will be well-matched on the full set of covariates, only that groups of individuals with similar propensity scores will have similar covariate distributions.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Despite this fact, propensity score matching including, among other variables, baseline WOMAC scores as matching factors may reduce variance of outcome measures and therefore probably increase the power of the study further if the propensity score is included as covariate in the statistical evaluation model. However, it is difficult to make a guess about this effect, and thus, we conservatively calculated the sample size obtained for the parallel group design.</p></sec><sec id="s1g2"><title>Statistical analysis of clinical endpoints</title><p>Controls and cases will be included into a linear model with the propensity score as covariate. Additionally, we will use models for longitudinal data using each measurement point (instead of only t0 and t3 for the primary analysis).

Secondary endpoints will be analysed analogously without claiming confirmatory interpretation of p-values.

The following secondary analyses are planned: (1) analysis of primary outcome in all subjects with adherence to the study protocol as to be defined by a blind data review (per protocol population); (2) analysis in the full set of eligible and included participants irrespective of their limitations in pain and physical function at baseline (t0); this analysis is done in order to improve external validity of the study even so we do not expect the same effect size in these participants; (3) analysis including study site as an additional factor to compare the effectiveness of both training approaches; and (4) separate analysis for both study sites and inspection of interactions between type of treatment and other prognostic factors.

If a dominant strategy does not exist (ie, lower costs and higher health-related effects in the intervention group), the costs will be related to the effects. The costs (including the supplementary costs of the pilot offer for participants) will be related to the differences between the groups (double-difference method, 2&#x02009;years preintervention and 2&#x02009;years postintervention) in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs, equation 1) and health-related effects (WOMAC Index: equation 2). The costs of the intervention will further be related to the differences in costs (double-difference method of the healthcare costs (unspecific healthcare costs (overall costs), specific healthcare costs and the costs for days of disability (human capital approach): equation 3). The time to surgery will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. For the economic evaluation, all participants have to be members of the insurance for the period from 24 months before baseline (tm24) up to 24&#x02009;month after baseline (t24).</p><p>Equation 1: Cost-utility analysis=incremental cost utility ratio (ICUR)</p><p><disp-formula><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">&#x00394;</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">&#x00394;</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Q</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">A</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">L</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Y</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">S</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Equation 2: Cost-effectiveness analysis=incremental&#x02009;cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER)</p><p><disp-formula><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">&#x00394;</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">&#x00394;</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">E</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Equation 3: Cost-benefit analysis=incremental cost-benefit ratio (ICBR)</p><p><disp-formula><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">&#x00394;</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">&#x00394;</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">B</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p></sec></sec><sec id="s1h"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>All participants of the exercise programme receive a postal mailing prior to the first training session.

The aim of the outlined study therefore is to address the above-mentioned research topics by evaluating a supervised weight machine-based hip and knee strength training for patients with hip and/or knee OA in the context of health services research.</p></sec><sec id="s1j2"><title>Strength of the study and value of the results</title><p>Evidence is needed for exercise dosage recommendations, and therapeutic validity of exercise programme should be warranted.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> The transparency of this study protocol with respect to patient eligibility, exercise setting as well as rationale and content of the therapeutic exercises gives consideration to this requirement and can therefore be identified as a strength of this study. Another strength is related to the choice and time point of outcome measures and its field of application: this study allows new insights into the effectiveness of an exercise intervention into patient care with respect to short-term as well as mid-term effects. The outcomes of the study are related to pain, physical function and economic measures on health-related quality of life, self-efficacy, adherence and safety. Therefore, a significant knowledge gain for the aforementioned aspects can be expected which are insufficiently investigated so far.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 19 20</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1j3"><title>Limitation of the study</title><p>A relevant open research question is related to the long-term effectiveness of an exercise intervention on symptoms as well as disease progression.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 12 17</xref> The two-year follow-up phase of this study will not allow sufficient data for statements on the effect of the intervention in the long run such as symptom release, time to surgery and disease-specific healthcare costs. This drawback of the study might be compensated by a protocol amendment for a 5-year follow-up if 24-month evaluations are positive in terms of study outcomes.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SP3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjsem-2017-000291.supp3</object-id><label>Supplementary file 3</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss3" xlink:href="bmjsem-2017-000291supp003.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SP4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjsem-2017-000291.supp4</object-id><label>Supplementary file 4</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss4" xlink:href="bmjsem-2017-000291supp004.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SP5"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjsem-2017-000291.supp5</object-id><label>Supplementary file 5</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss5" xlink:href="bmjsem-2017-000291supp005.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SP2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjsem-2017-000291.supp2</object-id><label>Supplementary file 2</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss2" xlink:href="bmjsem-2017-000291supp002.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We acknowledge support by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft and OpenAccess Publishing Fund of University of T&#x000fc;bingen.
