Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is increasingly recognized as an important element of the overall clinical assessment of psoriasis rather than simply an adjunct to objective measures of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is a short, self-administered, dermatology-specific questionnaire that is the most commonly used tool to evaluate HRQoL in psoriasis clinical research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Objective clinical manifestations of psoriasis are commonly assessed with the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), a validated scale that has been demonstrated to quantify clinical improvement in response to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Although it is difficult to correlate absolute values of the PASI and DLQI, several studies have explored the relationship between reductions in the objective severity of psoriasis as measured with the PASI and improvements in HRQoL as measured with the DLQI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In secondary analyses of 1,469 patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis from two clinical trials of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor adalimumab, a 90% or greater improvement in the PASI (PASI 90 response) was associated with a greater improvement in the DLQI than that associated with a 75% or greater improvement in the PASI (PASI 75 response) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Further, a study of the TNF inhibitor infliximab for severe plaque psoriasis demonstrated that the percent change in the PASI and the percent change in the DLQI for the combined infliximab and placebo groups were strongly correlated (Spearman&#x02019;s correlation of 0.61) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Additionally, patients who achieved a PASI 75 response had a greater mean improvement in the DLQI (81%) compared with patients who achieved 50&#x02013;75% improvement in the PASI (60% improvement in the DLQI). Katugampola et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] examined associations between the PASI and the DLQI in multiple clinical trials of four biologics (etanercept, infliximab, efalizumab, and alefacept) and reported that improvement in the DLQI paralleled improvement in the PASI 75 with treatment. Conversely, patients who had responded to ustekinumab treatment (PASI 75 responders) and were re-randomized to placebo during a withdrawal period exhibited rapid worsening of DLQI scores in parallel with loss of the PASI response; however, the association between DLQI and PASI scores was not formally analyzed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].

The protocol was approved by the institutional review board of each participating medical center. The REVEAL study consisted of three treatment periods (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In period A (weeks 0&#x02013;16), patients were randomized 2:1 using an interactive voice response system to receive double-blind subcutaneous injections of adalimumab or placebo. An initial dose of adalimumab (80&#x000a0;mg) or placebo was administered at week 0, followed by 40&#x000a0;mg adalimumab or placebo every other week (eow) from weeks 1 to 15. Patients who achieved PASI 75 at week 16 were eligible to enter the open-label period (period B, weeks 16&#x02013;33). To maintain blinding at week 16, patients who had received placebo during period A received two injections of adalimumab (40&#x000a0;mg), while patients who had received adalimumab were given two injections of placebo. All patients received adalimumab (40&#x000a0;mg eow) from weeks 17 to 31. Patients who achieved PASI 75 responses at week 33 were eligible to enter period C (weeks 33&#x02013;52).

DLQI total scores may range from 0 to 30, with a higher score indicating poorer HRQoL. A DLQI total score of more than 5 indicates a moderate effect of psoriasis on patient HRQoL; a DLQI score of more than 10 indicates a very large effect; and a DLQI score of more than 20 indicates an extremely large effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Thus, a DLQI total score of more than 10 supports the need for a more aggressive intervention. PASI scores may range from 0 to 72, with higher scores indicating greater disease severity. Post hoc comparisons of DLQI and PASI scores were evaluated at baseline, early in treatment (week 4), at the last point when all patients had at least a PASI 75 response (week 33), and after randomized treatment discontinuation (up to 19&#x000a0;weeks after discontinuation).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Patients who received adalimumab during period A, achieved PASI 75 responses at week 16 and week 33, and were subsequently re-randomized to placebo during period C were the focus of this subanalysis.

The slope of the regression line for DLQI versus PASI was 0.5094 at week 52 and 0.1978 at week 4, indicating that each unit change in PASI was associated with approximately twice as much change in DLQI at week 52 compared with the change at week 4. Linear regression modeling showed a significant interaction (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001) between study period (week 4 or week 52) and the relationship of PASI to DLQI, indicating that the correlation between PASI and DLQI was different early in treatment (week 4) from the correlation 19&#x000a0;weeks after discontinuation of treatment (week 52). The disproportionate worsening in DLQI scores was less apparent for patients with PASI 75 responses.

A post hoc analysis demonstrated that DLQI total scores worsened disproportionately relative to PASI scores, a difference that reached statistical significance; thus, HRQoL worsened disproportionately relative to the objective signs of disease recurrence. The patterns of correlations of DLQI component scores with PASI scores before and after treatment discontinuation supported the results obtained for the DLQI total score. Although the reason for the asymmetry between PASI and DLQI cannot be determined from the results of this analysis, we hypothesize that it occurred because patients were distressed by the recurrence of psoriasis symptoms that had been effectively controlled. Even mild disease recurrence may have had a negative effect on DLQI scores, perhaps because patients recalled the previous deleterious effects of more severe disease activity on their HRQoL. The psychological impact of psoriasis on patients is well documented. Patients with psoriasis have higher levels of anxiety and depression than healthy controls and often experience emotions of shame, worry, anger, and annoyance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Recently, Ghajarzadeh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] reported significant correlations between DLQI scores and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores in patients with psoriasis. Patients with psoriasis had BDI scores indicative of mild-to-moderate depression and DLQI scores demonstrating impaired HRQoL.</p><p>The results of this exploratory analysis of randomized withdrawal of adalimumab are consistent with a substantial link between treatment response and patient HRQoL; we hypothesize that findings would be similar with discontinuation of other treatments. The results of the current study highlight the importance of continuous therapy in patients with psoriasis. Even temporary discontinuations of treatment may be inadvisable in patients who have achieved disease control. Conversely, in the authors&#x02019; clinical experience, the erosion of HRQoL after treatment interruption may be a primary factor in influencing patients to reinitiate therapy. In support of these considerations, a recent systematic review concluded that continuous therapy is preferred for maintenance of disease control and HRQoL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>This study benefited from a double-blind design that may have minimized bias by masking assignment to continue adalimumab or receive placebo; this was probably particularly important for a subjective, patient-reported outcome such as the DLQI. Additional strengths were that the study was conducted at a large number of centers and that many patients were analyzed. Limitations of the study are that it was a post hoc analysis and, therefore, potentially subject to bias. Additionally, the comparison of PASI and DLQI scores was not evaluated beyond the relatively short period of 19&#x000a0;weeks after discontinuation of treatment. Finally, inherent limitations of the DLQI and PASI have been reported. Problems with the DLQI include inadequate measurement of mild illness, interpretability that has been rated only &#x0201c;acceptable,&#x0201d; and differential item functioning by disease, age, and sex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Although the PASI is the most thoroughly validated scale for psoriasis and is used extensively in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], it has been criticized for having a nonlinear scale, poor sensitivity, and lack of standardization for translation into corresponding clinical severity categories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. PASI scores on the lower end of the range (PASI &#x0003c;10) are less meaningful, so comparisons with DLQI scores among patients with low PASI scores may be more difficult. Furthermore, consistency and reliability of the PASI are influenced by the experience level of the physician [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Due to these limitations, this analysis must be considered exploratory and hypothesis generating; a prospective study would be needed to confirm the findings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Discontinuing therapy, as observed in this analysis with adalimumab, has several negative effects in patients with psoriasis, including a loss of objective response and a disproportionately large negative impact on HRQoL. Interruption of treatment will likely result in an increase of psoriasis symptoms and a disproportionate decrease in HRQoL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec13"><p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="13555_2014_43_MOESM1_ESM.pdf"><caption><p>Supplementary material 1 (PDF 275 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Trial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov #NCT00237887.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>AbbVie Inc. funded this study and participated in the study design, data collection, data management, data analysis, and preparation of the manuscript.
