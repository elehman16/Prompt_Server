The CRASH-1 trial (April 1999- May 2004) evaluated the effect of corticosteroid administration on patient outcomes after traumatic brain injury. The CRASH-2 trial (May 2005- February 2010) examined the effect of tranexamic acid administration in bleeding trauma patients. The two trials were of similar design but greater effort was made to reduce the carbon footprint of the CRASH-2 trial using several of the strategies outlined in the NIHR carbon reduction guidelines. In this study we compared the greenhouse gas emissions of the CRASH-1 and CRASH-2 clinical trials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>A carbon audit was conducted of the CRASH-1 and CRASH-2 clinical trials in collaboration with the Edinburgh Centre for Carbon Management (ECCM). The ECCM has completed over 1,100 greenhouse gas quantifications for public and private sector bodies. For each trial, carbon emissions were calculated for a one-year period corresponding to steady state patient recruitment for each trial (CRASH-1: August 2003 to July 2004, CRASH-2: August 2008 to July 2009). Data were collected on all trial elements that would generate carbon emissions according to the greenhouse gas reporting protocol developed by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Greenhouse gas emissions were estimated using conversion factors from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Swiss Centre for Lifecycle Inventories (SCLCI) and the UK Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The global warming potential in carbon dioxide equivalents for methane and nitrous oxides were calculated using conversion factors from the IPCC third annual report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].

This was because of the open plan form of the trial offices and the fact that other non-trial activities were carried out in the same area during the conduct of both trials. Emissions were therefore estimated on the basis of average per person emissions from office space and the number of trial employees (9 in CRASH-1 and 7 in CRASH-2). Electricity consumption of the trial team was based upon percentage of total electricity consumed by the trial office.</p><p>Carbon dioxide equivalents are reported separately for CRASH-1 and CRASH-2 by source of emissions, including emissions from coordination centre, trial related travel, commuting and drug box shipments.

Assuming the audit year is representative of total trial emissions, CRASH-1 was responsible for 924.6 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents and CRASH-2 for 508.5 tonnes. In CRASH-1 this would be equivalent to 681 round trip flights from London to New York for one passenger, and in CRASH-2 this would be equivalent to 374 round trip flights.

The main reason was that the CRASH-2 trial recruited more than twice as many patients in a shorter time frame than CRASH-1. This in turn was facilitated by the strong clinician interest in the research question, the use of an established network of international collaborators and the use of a simple trial design with data collection limited to key clinically relevant end points. The more efficient recruitment in the CRASH-2 trial helped to minimize carbon emissions per randomized patient.</p><p>Differences in the emissions arising from the delivery of trial drugs accounted for a large part of the difference in total carbon emissions between the trials. The trial treatment in CRASH-2 was lighter and more compact than in CRASH-1, weighing approximately 2.5 kg and 9 kg respectively. Each treatment pack in the CRASH-1 trial contained 11 glass vials approximately 5 cm in height and width that had to be protected from breakage during transit by means of protective packaging. On the other hand, the CRASH-2 treatment pack contained four small ampoules that required less protection. Despite a larger number of delivery sites in CRASH-2, emissions were nevertheless reduced in this sector illustrating how logistics can have an important impact on carbon emissions.</p><p>Emissions from the coordination centre were slightly lower for CRASH-2 than for CRASH-1. The carbon emissions from the coordinating centre were based on the number of office staff and there were fewer staff in CRASH-2 than in CRASH-1. In the CRASH-1 trial, handwritten data received by fax were double entered by two staff members at the coordination centre. CRASH-2 used direct data entry, which reduced the need for data entry staff as well as reducing the risk of transcription errors.</p><p>Trial-related travel often comprises an important source of emissions in clinical trials and limiting unnecessary travel can reduce their carbon footprint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Greater use of statistical data checking algorithms has been suggested as a strategy to reduce the need for on-site data monitoring and these methods were employed in both trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Additionally, teleconferencing, video-conferencing and web based training materials can be used to reduce travel.</p><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This study collected information on all sources of carbon emissions for two large multi centre trials. The same methodology was used to determine carbon emissions for CRASH-1 and CRASH-2, helping to ensure a valid comparison between trials. Furthermore, the audit was carried out by an independent, third party organization with extensive experience in quantifying and verifying GHG emissions from operational activities.</p><p>However, our study has limitations. The audit period was for only one year and extrapolation to the entire trial may have led to inaccuracy. Data were collected retrospectively, whereas prospective data collection would have been more accurate. The energy consumption of the coordination centre was not obtained by direct measurement, which could lead to errors in estimation of the true carbon emissions. Although the most up-to-date standardized carbon conversion factors were used, the science behind these equivalents is still developing and estimates may not represent actual carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. However, since the same conversion factors were applied to both trials, the comparison between trials and demonstrated reduction is internally valid.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study has shown that the efficiency of patient recruitment is a major determinant of the environmental impact of a clinical trial. There is a limit to the amount of greenhouse gases that can be emitted without causing serious climate destabilization. If society decides to allocate a proportion of its limited carbon budget to obtaining information on the safety and effectiveness of a health care intervention, then both researchers and research regulators have the responsibilities to ensure that the research is conducted as efficiently as is consistent with patient safety and that it provides valid and reliable information.</p><p>In the UK, there is a growing consensus that the regulation and governance framework for clinical trials has become an obstacle to their efficient conduct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The Academy of Medical Sciences has been commissioned by the UK Government to undertake an independent review of the regulation and governance of medical research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Although the CRASH-2 trial recruited patients more rapidly than its predecessor, this was largely driven by recruitment in Asia, South America and Africa, while recruitment in the UK was much less than anticipated largely due to these regulatory changes implemented after CRASH-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Streamlining and improving the regulatory environment has the potential to increase both the carbon and cost effectiveness of medical research.</p><p>Although efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of clinical trials are essential, it is important to acknowledge that healthcare itself is a major source of carbon emissions and that by ensuring the provision of safe and effective healthcare, health research plays a central role in avoiding medical waste. Pharmaceutical use is particularly carbon intensive and makes a major contribution to the carbon footprint of the NHS. The CRASH-1 trial showed that a drug that had been used in the treatment of head injury patients for over thirty years was at best ineffective, and probably harmful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The carbon cost of obtaining reliable information from well-conducted clinical studies is likely to be dwarfed by that of using treatments that are ineffective or harmful.</p><p>In summary, a number of strategies can be used to reduce the carbon footprint of clinical research. Although it is not always possible to reduce the weight and shipping distance of trial materials, the use of lightweight packaging can have an important impact on emissions. Statistical data monitoring, web-based training materials and tele-conferencing can help reduce travel. Direct data entry can reduce the need for transcription and will also lessen emissions from trial office space. While the focus of this study was on emissions from non-commercial clinical trials, the extent to which the principles might be applied in pharmaceutical industry directed trials is open to question. Industry led trials are often considerably more complex and involve much more data collection than non-commercial trials. On the other hand, it is likely that the carbon footprint of industry led trials is much larger, and the need to make emissions reductions even more important.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing
