Recently human umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cell (hUCB-MSC) infusion has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for CP, and the treatment efficacy remains to be confirmed by clinical trials. All 54 patients received basic rehabilitation as a background treatment. The infusion group comprising 27 patients received 4 infusions of hUCB-MSCs (intravenous infusions at a fixed dose of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup>) and basic rehabilitation treatment, whereas 27 patients in the control group received 0.9% normal saline and basic rehabilitation treatment. Several indices were tested from baseline up to 24 months posttreatment regarding efficacy and safety evaluations, including the gross motor function measurement 88 (GMFM-88) scores, the comprehensive function assessment (CFA), lab tests, electroencephalogram (EEG), routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and adverse events. The changes in the total proportion of GMFM-88 and total scores of CFA in the hUCB-MSC infusion group were significantly higher than that in control group at 3, 6, 12, 24 months posttreatment. Less diffuse slow waves were noticed after hUCB-MSC infusion in patients with slowing of EEG background rhythms at baseline. Based on the routine MRI exams, improvements in cerebral structures were rare after treatment. Serious adverse events were not observed during the whole study period. The results of the study indicated that hUCB-MSC infusion with basic rehabilitation was safe and effective in improving gross motor and comprehensive functions in children with CP.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>human umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cells</kwd><kwd>cerebral palsy</kwd><kwd>clinical trial</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1-0963689717729379"><funding-source id="funding1-0963689717729379"><institution-wrap><institution>Hubei Province Technology Fund</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="funding1-0963689717729379">No. 2013BCB002</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-0963689717729379"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cerebral palsy (CP) is one of the leading causes of childhood disability and affects the individual's development and ability to function<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0963689717729379" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. CP encompasses a group of movement disorders and affects posture. Motor limitations are attributed to a static disturbance in the developing brain, often accompanied by associated impairments and secondary health conditions<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0963689717729379" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. The pathogenesis of CP is still unclear, and several factors are considered to contribute to CP, such as prenatal factors (hypoxia and infections)<sup><xref rid="bibr3-0963689717729379" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, birth weight<sup><xref rid="bibr4-0963689717729379" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> as well as genetic factors<sup><xref rid="bibr5-0963689717729379" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Despite new developments in the field of obstetrics and perinatology, incidence of CP is reported as 2 out of 1,000 live births in premature deliveries and 1.1 out of 1,000 live births in mature babies (40+ weeks&#x02019; gestation)<sup><xref rid="bibr6-0963689717729379" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. The weighted prevalence of CP-related motor impairment is 1.25/1,000 children in China. For mild, moderate, severe, and extremely severe groups of motor impairment, weighted proportions of CP are 14.12%, 20.35%, 27.44%, and 38.09%, respectively. Weighted proportions of concurrent visual, hearing, and cognitive impairment are 5.00%, 6.98%, and 71.06%, respectively<sup><xref rid="bibr7-0963689717729379" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>.</p><p>Of all available treatments for CP, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) infusion was considered as a promising therapeutic alternative in clinical practices and numerous trials in recent decades<sup><xref rid="bibr8-0963689717729379" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-0963689717729379" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Additionally, developments in rehabilitation have also improved performance in several aspects, including intensive upper extremity training to improve bimanual performance, strength training to improve muscle strength, hippotherapy to improve muscle symmetry, and activities and balance training to improve reactive balance<sup><xref rid="bibr10-0963689717729379" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. It was more convenient to obtain human umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs (hUCB-MSCs), as their use has fewer associated ethical issues, and the cells have low immunogenicity when compared to other types of MSCs<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0963689717729379" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Compared to bone marrow-derived MSCs, hUCB-MSCs are more appealing due to their higher proliferative capacity, lower immunogenicity, and stronger immunosupressive potential<sup><xref rid="bibr12-0963689717729379" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Based on the therapeutic potential and convenient procurability, clinical research has been performed to study the safety and efficacy of hUCB-MSC infusion in children with CP, and the results were promising in some reported cases<sup><xref rid="bibr13-0963689717729379" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. For further confirmation of the safety and effectiveness of cord blood-derived stem cell infusion, several clinical studies have been conducted<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0963689717729379" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr14-0963689717729379" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-0963689717729379" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.

Nowadays, combined therapies have become a common strategy for CP treatment, and rehabilitation training was usually applied as a basic adjunctive therapy. Based on the data from our previous study, a significant improvement in gross motor function was observed when hUCB-MSC infusion and basic rehabilitation were combined<sup><xref rid="bibr17-0963689717729379" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. The efficacy and safety in combining hUCB-MSC infusion and rehabilitation would be further clarified with a randomized controlled clinical trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="section2-0963689717729379"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="section3-0963689717729379"><title>Ethics</title><p>This trial was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of the Taihe Hospital affiliated to Hubei Medical College (Hubei, China, Ethical approval No. 2010-06).

A total of 56 children with CP were enrolled during the recruitment phase which began on September 20, 2010, and 2 patients dropped out before the second course and were lost to follow-up. The last follow-up visit was in September 2015. All of the patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups on a 1:1 allocation. All of the patients and their families were blinded to the group assignment, and the patients received hUCB-MSC infusion with basic rehabilitation in the infusion group, whereas patients in the placebo-controlled group received basic rehabilitation and normal saline (0.9% NS). The investigators and charge nurses were made aware of the treatment information to handle emergencies, if any. The placebo and hUCB-MSC injectates could not be distinguished from one another by their appearances since hUCB-MSC turbid liquid was diluted with 0.9% NS before infusion.</p></sec><sec id="section6-0963689717729379"><title>Assessment Parameters and Schedule</title><p>The study schedule is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0963689717729379">Table 1</xref> with detail information as below.</p><table-wrap id="table1-0963689717729379" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Study Schedule Flow Diagram.</p></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0963689717729379-table1"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="3" colspan="1">Study Process Items</th><th colspan="14" rowspan="1">Study Stage</th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Screening</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Randomization (Day)</th><th colspan="4" rowspan="1">Cycle 1 (Day Since Rand)</th><th colspan="4" rowspan="1">Cycle 2 (Day Since Rand)</th><th colspan="4" rowspan="1">Follow-Up (Month Since Last Dose)</th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Day 7 to Randomization</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">8</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">15</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">22</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">102</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">109</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">116</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">123</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (&#x000b1; 7D)<sup>a</sup>

The GMFM-88 scale was usually employed to evaluate the recovery of gross motor ability of children with CP. Eighty-eight questions were addressed in the GMFM-88 scale for 5 function areas including &#x0201c;lying and rolling,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;sitting,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;crawling and kneeling&#x0201d; &#x0201c;standing,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;walking, running, and jumping.&#x0201d; Raw scores were collected. The proportion of raw scores in total scores for each function area was calculated since the full score in each area was different. Then the sum of raw scores in each function area was shown as a total score, and the proportion of total raw score in full mark at each study phase was evaluated. The changes in total score proportion and each functional score proportion between different phases were processed for analysis. The CFA scale was used for functional assessment in 5 functional areas including cognizance, language competence, self-care, motor function, and social adaptability. Raw scores were collected in each functional area, and the total scores were calculated as their sum. Then the changes in total scores and each functional score were processed for analysis.</p><p>Scales were finished at baseline and post-treatment during the 3rd month (&#x000b1; 7 d), 6th month (&#x000b1; 7 d), 12th month (&#x000b1; 15 d), and 24th month (&#x000b1; 15 d). The outcome results of scales were expressed as the main efficacy indices to show the overall functional improvement in the treatment. The difference between baseline and post-treatment scores was calculated. The changes in total score proportion in the GMFM-88 and the total score changes in the CFA were evaluated as clinical effective power. The clinical efficacy evaluation results could be divided into 3 levels according to the effective power: significantly effective when effective power reached 20%; effective when effective power reached 10% but less than 20%; and ineffective when effective power was less than 10%.</p></sec><sec id="section10-0963689717729379"><title>Exploratory measures</title><p>EEG was believed to be an exploratory measure to demonstrate the accompanied changes in cerebral electrophysiology, if any.

The resources were from the umbilical cord blood and tissues of healthy puerperal women with a negative result for all the following tests: syphilis, HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and toxplasma, nubellavirus, cytomegalo virus, herpes simplex virus, and other virus (TORCH 5). Several tests were performed on the collected samples following donor&#x02019;s requirement from the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) and American Association of Blood Banks. Then the hUCB-MSCs were separated by centrifugation and cultivated in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) enhanced with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF, Thermo Fisher Scientific) instead of any animal products.

The hUCB-MSCs were passaged and collected at the fourth generation, before storing them at &#x02212;196&#x000b0;C in cryopreservation storage equipment. A series of testing was carried out to ensure the quantity and quality of hUCB-MSCs before transporting for clinical usage, including tests for cytomegalovirus, human T-cell leukemia virus, and microorganisms, such as aerobic bacteria, anaerobic bacteria, and fungi. All these tests were negative.

Although the development of neuroregeneration provided some new options for CP therapy, alternative therapies were still limited. Based on the current data in clinical trials and case reports, hUCB-MSC infusion was a promising therapy compared to other types of MSCs. They were immunologically safe and easily accessible<sup><xref rid="bibr26-0963689717729379" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. The clinical application of MSC infusion was limited by several technical hurdles, such as source, transplant viability, therapy timing, dose, and immunogenic toxicity<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0963689717729379" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Different studies had various therapy timelines, frequencies, and doses.

Regarding the risk of overdose infusion, it was also reported that the umbilical cord blood (UCB) single-dose infusion units with total nucleated cell dose of more than 21&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup> cells/kg was one of the factors leading to higher mortality<sup><xref rid="bibr28-0963689717729379" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>.

Furthermore, it was suggested that the neuroprotective effect of hUCB MNCs could be enhanced by repeated cell administrations in a mouse model<sup><xref rid="bibr30-0963689717729379" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Multiple-dosing infusion was also used in some case reports<sup><xref rid="bibr13-0963689717729379" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and was shown effective at a fixed quantity of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> cells/dose, in our study. No difference was observed in AE incidence between groups. According to our results, it could be safely concluded that the hUCB-MSC infusion with basic rehabilitation was safe and effective to improve the gross motor function in children with CP.</p><p>In particular, significant improvement in gross movement was shown after hUCB-MSC infusion. The beneficial effects observed in the hUCB-MSC infusion group was superior to the control group with basic rehabilitation therapy only. The improvements in GMFM-88 total score proportion reached effective level in clinical efficacy evaluation 12 months posttreatment, while it failed to reach the effective level in the control group during the whole study phase (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0963689717729379">Table 4</xref>). It was coincident with clinical observation. The therapeutic efficacy of basic rehabilitation was influenced by several factors, such as treatment duration, patient compliance, efficacy evaluation system, and so on. Regarding the benefits of basic rehabilitation to gross motor function, the improvement was limited, based on the clinical effective power assessment within the 24-month follow-up phase, though slight improvement was observed with the treatments. The clinical effective power evaluation in CFA total scores was effective at 6 months and significantly effective at 24 months posttreatment in the hUCB-MSC infusion group. It was noticed that the clinical effective status in CFA was observed 6 months ahead of that in GMFM-88. It indicated that improvements in comprehensive function could occur even before significant development of gross motor function in clinical practice. Besides, in the control group, comprehensive function was improved at the effective level at 24 months posttreatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0963689717729379">Table 5</xref>). Taking the evaluation of GMFM-88 and CFA in the control group together, the efficacy of basic rehabilitation was limited, though it seemed inclined to improve slightly. The efficacy of basic rehabilitation was still ambiguous. The persistent efficacy of basic rehabilitation to CFA in the control group could not be evaluated after 24 months posttreatment due to the limitation of the study follow-up phase. Further study was needed since the lower limitation of the clinical effective level was just reached in the control group at 24 months posttreatment.</p><p>The safety of hUCB-MSC infusion was ensured at the 24-month follow-up phase after the last dose was administered. The patients did not show any signs of SAE nor immunologic rejection.</p><p>The cerebral function might be improved since better cerebral electrophysiologic trace was observed in the EEG of some patients. However, cerebral structure improvements were not observed in routine MRI results. This might be due to insufficient sensitivity of routine MRI to measure the changes at the cellular level. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was superior to routine MRI on corticospinal tract (CST) imaging, and the correlation between DTI parameters of the injured CST and the severity of motor dysfunction had been confirmed in previous studies<sup><xref rid="bibr31-0963689717729379" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>.</p><p>Moreover, after rehabilitation treatment, the DTI parameters could also reflect the motor function outcomes of pediatric patients with hemiplegic CP<sup><xref rid="bibr32-0963689717729379" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>.</p><p>Furthermore, increased metabolic activity in various areas of the brain could be shown in 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET/CT) scan images post autologous bone marrow mononuclear cell therapy in CP patients<sup><xref rid="bibr33-0963689717729379" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="bibr34-0963689717729379" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. It was indicated cerebral functional improvement could be induced by MSC therapy. The functional improvement was detectable given a proper technical approach. Further functional neuroimaging would be needed to explore the effects of hUCB-MSC therapy on cerebral functional areas, such as DTI and 18F-FDG-PET/CT.</p><p>Various preclinical studies on CP models showed that infusion of MSCs could lead to homing, viability, and differentiation of these cells into neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and so on<sup><xref rid="bibr27-0963689717729379" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="bibr35-0963689717729379" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. hUCB-MSCs were studied extensively in rat models with neonatal hypoxia/ ischemia and significant improvements were observed in behavioral function. The possible mechanisms of action include reducing proinflammatory cytokine levels<sup><xref rid="bibr36-0963689717729379" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="bibr37-0963689717729379" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>, and paracrine effects <sup><xref rid="bibr27-0963689717729379" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> to stimulate recovery in the injured brain. However, it might not be realistic to improve neurological function through neuronal replacement by hUCB-MSC infusion intravenously, considering the limited quantity of MSCs through the hematoencephalic barrier<sup><xref rid="bibr27-0963689717729379" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Although the safety of hUCB-MSC infusion was ensured up to 24 months in our long-term follow-up phase, further double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials are necessary to obtain more evidence of efficacy. Further neuroimaging monitoring would be of help to identify the influence of hUCB-MSC therapy on cerebral function in our future studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We acknowledge the assistance of all the patients and their families in this study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-0963689717729379"><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; Contribution:</bold> Li Huang and Che Zhang contributed equally to this work.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn2-0963689717729379"><p><bold>Ethical Approval:</bold> This study was approved by our institutional review board.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn3-0963689717729379"><p><bold>Statement of Human and Animal Rights:</bold> This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Taihe Hospital Affiliated to Hubei Medical College (Hubei, China, Ethical approval No. 2010-06).</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn4-0963689717729379"><p><bold>Statement of Informed Consent:</bold> Informed consent forms approved by IRB were signed by the patients or legally authorized representative before commencement of study.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="fn5-0963689717729379"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn6-0963689717729379"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research and/or authorship of this article: The present work was supported by Hubei Province Technology Fund No. 2013BCB002 and was conducted at the Children&#x02019;s Medical Centre of Taihe Hospital (Hubei, China).</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-0963689717729379"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
