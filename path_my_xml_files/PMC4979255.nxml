In 2000, the population of individuals above 65 years of age was 600 million people globally, which constituted 10% of the total population. Researchers predicted that this number will reach about 2.2 billion people in 2050, which is 21% of the global population.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>In 2008, the population of those aged 65 years and older was equal to 55 million people in the USA. It has been estimated that this population will be doubled (nearly 90 million people) in 2060[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and they will constitute 12% of the population.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>In the 2011 census, 5.7% of Iran's population consisted of individuals aged 65 years and older.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] It is expected that this number will increase up to more than 14% during the next 20 years.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>The elderly are considered as vulnerable individuals facing a series of specific problems which reduce their quality of life (QOL).[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Moreover, the level of physical inactivity is increasing in many countries and is observed more in high-income countries.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Only one-fifth of seniors perform enough physical activity.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In addition, 85% and 75% of US seniors are inactive women and men, respectively.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>In Iran, about 35.7% of the population (25.2% men and 46.5% women) is physically inactive, which is higher than the global average.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Furthermore, 86.3% of the elderly in Isfahan, Iran, do not have sufficient amount of physical activity, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Physical inactivity has risky consequences for public health all around the world.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] It is the fourth risk factor of global mortality;[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]5-10% of mortality among the elderly each year is due to this issue.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Physical inactivity is the cause of about 21-25% of breast cancer and colon cancer cases, 27% of diabetes cases, and 30% of ischemic heart diseases cases.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Scientific developments and urbanization have reduced the physical activity. Many activities which were previously performed physically by individuals are performed now by machines. Increasing working hours and its stress are the causes of lack of time and patience to deal with physical activity.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Its other causes among lifestyle changes include using the Internet, performing personal tasks, working behind a desk, and using cars instead of bicycles.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>In addition, chronic diseases cause limitation in activity for the elderly, which requires empowerment programs in order to prevent dependency and disability.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The majority of senior citizens need to strengthen their movement and muscles.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] On the other hand, empowerment was one of the goals of accessible health for people until 2010.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In addition, with increasing age, senior citizens experience problems related to self-care,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] which have negative effects on their self-esteem and result in inferiority, weakness, helplessness, and ultimately disappointment and discouragement.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>One of the most important ways to reduce changes due to aging is physical exercise. Physical exercises cause compatibility, increase the mobility period, create strong bones, control obesity, and maintain and even strengthen the capacities of cardiopulmonary, neurological, and musculoskeletal function, and increase fitness for the elderly. They can also reduce the rate of deaths due to chronic illnesses and the symptoms of depression.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Furthermore, hip fractures due to falls can be prevented with increasing bone density and muscle strength.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Unfortunately, despite the basic roles of nurses in different fields of elderly care and certain empowerment programs that are performed by directing and coordinating nursing care, a lack of these programs can be observed. Thus, the necessity to deal with these major issues in order to improve the health of the elderly is increased by 100-fold. Moreover, the researcher's observations are also effective in the selection of the subject. Those who work in the field of health care services witness frequent admissions of this stratum of the society to the hospitals daily. Sometimes low efficacy caused by induction of relatives and society's attitude toward them, lack of faith in their abilities, and severe dependence caused that they couldn'tmeet the least requirements. The implementation of the empowerment program can prevent the dependency of the elderly on others and would eliminate their inferiority complex, weakness, and helplessness. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of the empowerment program on physical mobility of senior citizens referred to Shahid Rezaeian Health Center, Iran, in 2014.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This was a semi-experimental research performed on 70 individuals (&#x0003e;65 years of age and older) with a family file at the health center.</p><p>In this study, the impact of the independent variable (empowerment) on the dependent variable (physical activity) was measured before and after the test. The inclusion criteria were: Age over 65 years, willingness to participate, the ability to answer questions, the absence of contraindications for sports, and the ability to participate in meetings. The exclusion criteria included participant's withdrawal from the study due to any problem. First, people of over 65 years of age with family files in Shahid Rezaeian Health Center were invited to refer to the health center on a specific date. After justification and explanation of the objectives and time period of the study and obtaining written consent forms to participate in the study, the subjects were selected based on the inclusion criteria. The participants were randomly placed into experimental and control groups based on the objectives and odd and even numbers of family files in the health center. The Individual and International Physical Activity Questionnaire was used for data collection.</p><p>This questionnaire evaluates the responder's physical activity during the past week, and activities lasting longer than 10 min were recorded. These activities included job activities, movement, household chores, and leisure activities which were classified as vigorous physical activity, average, and hiking. The empowerment program was conducted with a focus on physical activity among the elderly for the studied units.</p><p>The topics discussed in the intervention were obtained from relevant and influential texts and the Ministry of Health and Medical Education guideline to healthy lifestyle promotion for the elderly. This guideline includes the importance of physical activity for the elderly, the benefits of physical activity, problems of inactivity and inadequate physical activity, recommendations for physical activity, stretching exercises, strength, balance, static contractions (isometric), and recommendations for walking.</p><p>The experimental group was divided into five groups with seven participants in each of them because of administrative problems. Physical exercises were presented 1 h a week for 8 weeks using educational aids, audio-visual aids, lectures, group discussions, questions and answers, production and distribution of pamphlets and booklets, and practical exercises. Training and education sessions were conducted at the health center and booklets containing images were distributed among the subjects. Moreover, they were asked to do these exercises at home at least twice a day. The participants in both control and experimental groups were evaluated using the same initial questionnaires immediately after the intervention, and the results were compared with each other. This questionnaire is an international and standardized questionnaire, the validity of which has been confirmed in 12 different countries.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>The validity and reliability of the questionnaire was approved by Kelishadi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] In the research by SeyedEmami <italic>et al</italic>. on the effect of physical activity training on knowledge, attitude, and behavior of health contacts, the test-retest reliability of the questionnaire was assessed and the correlation coefficient was 0.74.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] The score of the questionnaire is calculated with the total amount of physical activity in the last week of based on the metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-minutes/week, and MET is a unit used to estimate energy expenditure of physical activity. A MET value is roughly equivalent to the energy consumption of an individual in resting position. All physical activities can be categorized as multiples of energy expenditure in resting position.</p><p>In this questionnaire, walking, moderate physical activity, and intense physical activity were considered as 3.3 METs, 4 METs, and 8 METs, respectively. To calculate the total amount of physical activity in each week, the amount of walking (MET &#x000d7; minute &#x000d7; day), moderate physical activity (MET &#x000d7; minute &#x000d7; day), and vigorous physical activity (MET &#x000d7; minute &#x000d7; day) were added up. Content validity was used to determine validity of the demographic characteristics questionnaire. Therefore, the researcher presented the questionnaire to several nursing and midwifery faculty members of Islamic Azad University, Khorasgan Branch, Isfahan, Iran, and provided the necessary clarifications. Their opinions were obtained and the necessary changes were applied in the final questionnaire. SPSS software (version 19; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for analyzing the data.</p><p>Independent <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare the mean score of physical mobility between the two groups before and after the intervention.

Moreover, in the case of sports injuries treated at the same center, the researcher would take responsibility for all costs. If desired, the possibility of undergoing the intervention was provided for the control group participants after sampling. In addition, due to moral considerations, educational booklets were distributed among control group participants like in the test group as empowerment, so that the control group was not deprived of them, but the test group had the opportunity to deal with them in empowerment issue.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>R<sc>ESULTS</sc></title><p>In this study, 70 elderly individuals were studied with an average age of 69.2 and standard deviation of 3.4 years.
