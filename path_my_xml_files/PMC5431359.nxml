The project was successful in reducing the risk of fatal or non-fatal first recurrent cardiovascular events. The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of cognitive behavioural therapy on self-rated stress, somatic anxiety, vital exhaustion and depression and to study the associations of these factors with the reduction in cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A total of 362 patients were randomly assigned to intervention or usual care groups. The psychological outcomes were assessed five times during 24 months and analysed using linear mixed models. The mediating roles of the outcomes were analysed using joint modelling of the longitudinal and time to event data.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The intervention had a positive effect on somatic anxiety (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), reflecting a beneficial development over time compared with the controls. Stress, vital exhaustion and depression did not differ between the groups over time. Mediator analysis suggested that somatic anxiety may have mediated the effect of treatment on cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The intervention had a small positive effect on somatic anxiety, but did not affect stress, vital exhaustion or depression in patients with coronary heart disease. Somatic anxiety was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and might act as a partial mediator in the treatment effect on cardiovascular events. However, the mechanisms between the intervention and the protective cardiovascular outcome remain to be identified.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Stress management</kwd><kwd>cognitive behavioural therapy</kwd><kwd>coronary heart disease</kwd><kwd>depression</kwd><kwd>anxiety</kwd><kwd>vital exhaustion</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-2047487317693131"><title>Introduction</title><p>Managing psychosocial risk factors such as stress, depression, vital exhaustion and anxiety are important in the successful prevention of recurrent cardiac events in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD).

The results have been inconsistent in that some studies have shown small or no benefit on cardiac outcomes, while others have shown positive results.

Of the 812 patients consecutively screened for eligibility, 362 were included and randomized (192 to the treatment and 170 to the control group), of which 85 (23.5%) were women. Of the 450 patients excluded, 302 did not meet the inclusion criteria (the most common reason was not fulfilling the time criterion of being referred to the general practitioner within a year, mostly due to hospital administrative reasons) and 148 declined to participate. Of the included patients 185 (51.1%) had been admitted after an MI, 122 (33.7%) for CABG and 55 (15.2%) for PCI. There was no difference in medical history or risk factor profile between the two groups at baseline. Seventy-one of the post-MI patients had a PCI during the index admission and three had a CABG. During the follow-up period (on average 94 months), 146 patients had at least one cardiovascular event, five of whom died from the first cardiovascular event.

The effect of the intervention on the primary outcomes was evaluated by the fixed effect interaction term between groups and time.

A psychological outcome was considered to be a mediator between the intervention and cardiovascular events if the following criteria were met: (a) the intervention had an effect on cardiovascular events; (b) the intervention was associated with the psychological outcome; (c) the psychological outcome was associated with cardiovascular events while controlling for the intervention; and (d) after inclusion of the psychological outcome, the hazards ratio (HR) of the intervention was smaller than the HR in (a).</p><p>Criterion (a) was tested using Cox proportional hazards regression.

In the mediation analysis of the four psychological outcomes according to Baron and Kenny,<sup><xref rid="bibr20-2047487317693131" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> the first criterion was met in that the intervention had an effect on cardiovascular events (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2047487317693131">Table 3</xref>).

Thus only somatic anxiety met all four criteria for being a mediator, although we only considered the fourth criterion descriptively.

There was an association between somatic anxiety, depression and vital exhaustion and the risk of fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular events. Somatic anxiety was found to be a mediator between the intervention and cardiovascular events.</p><p>It is unknown what the assessed somatic anxiety represents, with items that tap bodily sensation and muscle tension, but it might be both a reaction to the CHD, such as cardiac anxiety, or symptoms of stress originating from time urgency or hostility. The intervention&#x02019;s stabilizing impact on somatic anxiety, in contrast with the increasing levels in the control group, could be due to better coping abilities promoted by the intervention.</p><p>The ENRICHD study found that somatic, but not cognitive, symptoms of depression at 12 months following MI predicted subsequent mortality, whereas depressive symptoms measured close to the acute event were not related to the post-MI prognosis. Thus if psychological symptoms persist or worsen over a longer period of time, then they may be more hazardous. In the SUPRIM study, the control patients showed more somatic anxiety symptoms at later follow-ups. In parallel with the ENRICHD findings, this may indicate that patients who do not develop coping strategies for psychological symptoms, particularly somatic reactions, have a worse prognosis in the long term.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-2047487317693131" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p><p>The lack of effect on three out of four psychological outcomes, which were the main theoretical targets of the intervention, was unexpected based on the positive results reported from other studies with similar group interventions and psychological outcomes.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2047487317693131" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-2047487317693131" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr30-2047487317693131" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> However, the large and well-designed RCCP study, which found reductions in stress as well as cardiovascular events, recruited patients younger than 65 years who presented type A stress behaviour.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2047487317693131" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> This provided better preconditions to detect an effect on stress and of a behavioural intervention because there was more room for improvement and the study assumed more resourceful participants. Some of the positive effects of other studies may also be due to differences in the characteristics of the patient population, the trial designs and statistical analyses. Claesson et&#x000a0;al.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2047487317693131" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> were only able to perform per-protocol analyses, which may have amplified their effect and, according to the SWITCHD investigators, their results may have been biased due to regression towards the mean.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-2047487317693131" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p><p>Women generally exhibit more psychological suffering than men<sup><xref rid="bibr31-2047487317693131" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> and studies that included only women reported higher baseline levels than the SUPRIM study, in which only 23.5% of the participants were women.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2047487317693131" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-2047487317693131" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr30-2047487317693131" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Women might also be more responsive to this kind of treatment. Unfortunately, this study was underpowered for stratified sex analyses. In addition to recruiting both sexes, SUPRIM also recruited participants consecutively and without applying a lowest threshold of symptom level. This resulted in low levels of baseline symptoms with little room for improvement. In fact, participants in the SUPRIM trial did not differ from a matched non-patient population regarding stress, depression, anxiety or vital exhaustion.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2047487317693131" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>The suggested mediating effect of somatic anxiety is in line with previous research on the importance of anxiety as an independent predictor for CHD risk and prognosis in both healthy populations and in post-MI patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-2047487317693131" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="bibr33-2047487317693131" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Somatic aspects of anxiety, in contrast with cognitive anxiety symptoms, may be particularly important because they are associated with recurrent MI and mortality in post-MI patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr34-2047487317693131" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> The mediating effect was, however, small and even though it may be directly related to the reduction in cardiovascular outcome, it is unlikely to be the only explanation for the success of the intervention in reducing cardiovascular events. We cannot tell from our results whether somatic anxiety represents a strain that mediates the risk for later cardiovascular events, or whether somatic anxiety merely represents early symptoms of the cardiovascular-related illness. Several other risk factors, such as physical activity, blood pressure and the use of medication were unaffected by the treatment and are therefore unlikely to explain the reduction in cardiovascular events.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2047487317693131" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>Social support is known to be related to prognosis in patients with CHD<sup><xref rid="bibr35-2047487317693131" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="bibr36-2047487317693131" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> and group treatments for patients with CHD seem to be more successful than Individual treatments. The intervention lasted an entire year and it was observed that the participants often bonded strongly with each other. More social support as a result of this programme could be a possible mediator, but might not have been assessed sensitively enough because the study focused on support in daily life and not on perceived support from the group. The male patients reported better daily support at baseline than a control group from the general population, again leaving little room for improvement.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2047487317693131" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>There were a few methodological limitations. The psychological assessments were timed with the inclusion into the study and not with the onset of treatment, which was sometimes delayed for up to a year after the first assessment. However, a sensitivity analysis taking timing into account did not alter the results. It is possible that important mechanisms were not captured adequately. The two groups did not differ in prescribed medication, but actual compliance was not assessed and the measures of physical activity and social support were perhaps too blunt. Although the study was an RCT, the allocation was not blinded to the patients and this could affect the self-reported psychological outcomes. The Somatic Anxiety Scale is not thoroughly validated, which is a weakness in this study.</p><p>Stress management for patients with CHD led to slightly more positive levels of somatic anxiety in the intervention group compared with the control group. Somatic anxiety was found to be associated with fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events and was found to have a small mediating role between treatment and cardiovascular outcome. It is possible that small changes in a number of variables could work synergistically to affect cardiovascular events, but this could not be shown in the present study. Thus the mechanisms between the intervention and the protective cardiovascular outcome remain to be identified.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplementary material</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="CPR693131_supplementary_material.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d35e946" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Some of the data were previously published as an abstract from the ICBM 2014 Meeting: Burell G, Norlund F, Olsson E, Pavulans P, Svardsudd K.
