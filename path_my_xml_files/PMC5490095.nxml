EA is a very useful option for the management of postoperative pain in patients undergoing abdominal surgeries, but the risks and contraindications linked to EA may limit its use.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Systemic analgesics in the form of opioid analgesics may give rise to side effects and often provide insufficient analgesia.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Hence, other methods of postoperative pain management are desired.</p><p>Thoracic paravertebral block (PVB) provides good pain relief in patients undergoing thoracic and abdominal surgeries.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] There is enough evidence that thoracic PVB provides effective pain relief which is equally efficient to the EA; it is also associated with a lower incidence of side effects commonly associated with EA such as hypotension, nausea, and vomiting.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] It is because of these facts that PVB has been more frequently used in the present scenario for the treatment of postoperative pain. Thoracic PVB has been reported to be effective in open nephrectomy;[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] however, the comparison of the effectiveness of continuous thoracic PVB with continuous thoracic EA has not been done in patients undergoing open nephrectomy so far.</p><p>In thoracic PVB, a local anesthetic is injected near the thoracic spinal nerve at its exit from the intervertebral foramina; this results in unilateral somatic and sympathetic nerve blockade in multiple continuous thoracic dermatomes above and below the site of injection.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Hence, with PVB, one can accomplish a unilateral, band-like, segmental blockade similar to epidural block; however, the EA blocks the spinal nerves bilaterally giving rise to more prominent hemodynamic changes as compared to PVB.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>In this prospective, randomized, single-blind study we have compared the efficacy of postoperative pain relief provided by continuous thoracic PVB with continuous thoracic EA in patients undergoing open nephrectomy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>Prospective and randomized study; the protocol of the study was approved by the Institute's Ethics Committee.

The infusions in both the groups were provided by an elastomeric pump (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, California, USA).</p><p>A project nurse prepared sixty sealed envelopes as per the computer-generated random allocation sequence for the purpose of group distribution. The envelopes were opened by a nurse in the preoperative area before the patient was shifted to the operation theater; this nurse was not involved in the study.</p><p>An 18-gauge epidural catheter was placed in the epidural space at T8&#x02013;T9 or T9&#x02013;T10 inter-space in Group E patients or in the paravertebral space at T10&#x02013;T11 or T11&#x02013;T12 level in Group P patients, under local anesthesia, by an anesthesiology resident not involved in the study; the paravertebral catheter was placed utilizing loss-of-resistance technique as proposed by Eason and Wyatt.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The paravertebral or epidural infusion via elastomeric pump was started after induction of anesthesia. General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation was induced in all the patients using a uniform approach; for this, we utilized fentanyl 2&#x02013;3 &#x003bc;g/kg, propofol 1.5&#x02013;2.5 mg/kg, and vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg. The maintenance of anesthesia was done with propofol, isoflurane, and oxygen air mixture. A reduction in systolic blood pressure of &#x0003e;20% or &#x0003c;90 mm Hg was considered as hypotension and was treated by normal saline infusion or mephenteramine 5 mg intravenously (IV) in incremental doses. At the end of the surgery, residual neuromuscular paralysis was reversed with neostigmine 0.04 mg/kg and glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg. Following extubation, patients were taken to the postanesthesia recovery area. In the postoperative period, IV fentanyl via patient-controlled analgesia device was provided to all the patients for pain relief, with 5 min lockout interval and maximum hourly fentanyl dose of 2 &#x003bc;g/kg/h.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Outcome measures and patient assessment</title><p>Primary outcome measures were postoperative pain during rest (lying supine), deep inspiration, coughing, and movement (getting up from supine to sitting position); secondary outcome measures were postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), requirement of rescue antiemetic, hypotension, sedation, pruritus, motor block, and respiratory depression. All these measures were assessed by acute pain nurse blinded to group allocation.</p><p>All the patients were assessed on arrival to postanesthesia care unit (0 h), then at 2 pm, 6 pm, and 10 pm on the day of surgery postoperative day 0 (POD 0); 8 am, 2 pm, and 8 pm on postoperative day 1 (POD 1); 8 am and 8 pm on postoperative day 2 (POD 2); and 8 am on postoperative day 3 (POD 3). The evaluation of pain was done by a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS): 0 = no pain and 100 mm = worst possible pain. Acetaminophen 1 g IV every 6 h was given to all patients during this period. Modified Bromage scale was utilized for the assessment of motor block.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The assessment of PONV was done a four-point ordinal scale with 0 = no nausea or vomiting and 3 = severe nausea with vomiting;[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] all the patients with PONV grade of two or more received rescue antiemetic ondansetron 4 mg IV. The sedation of patients was evaluated using the Ramsay sedation scale; patient having Ramsay sedation scale of &#x0003e;4 was designated as sedated.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Patients having respiratory rate &#x0003c;8 breaths/min and oxygen saturation of &#x0003c;90% without oxygen supplementation were defined as having respiratory depression.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Sample size estimation</title><p>The size of sample size was decided depending on the findings of a pilot study performed at our institute; it was assumed that the study drug would decrease postoperative pain VAS scores by 30% as compared to placebo; this was possible with 25 patients in each group (with &#x003b1; = 0.05 and power = 80%).

The side effect profile of the two techniques was also similar.</p><p>The standard techniques of postoperative pain management in this group of patients include EA and systemic analgesics in the form of opioids. EA is recommended as a gold standard modality for the management of POP in patients undergoing abdominal surgeries;[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] however, it is associated with side effects and risks, which prevents its use in some patients. The common side effects include hypotension, itching, vomiting/nausea, and urinary retention; in addition, technical difficulties with insertion have been reported in up to 11% of patients along with a failure rate ranging from 17% to 37%.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Opioids contribute an important role in the treatment of POP as it carries a low-risk profile; however, opioids do not reduce dynamic pain and surgical stress[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and develop clinically relevant resistance in hours.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Opioids are associated with side effects such as PONV, itching, bowel ileus, and abdominal distension;[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] hence, the management of postoperative pain without opioids helps in minimizing postoperative pain and PONV.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Alternatives to EA, such as PVB, offer the advantage of providing pain relief on one hand and favorable side effect profile on the other hand.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] A meta-analysis of small, nonblinded trials compared thoracic PVB with thoracic EA in patients undergoing thoracic surgery and concluded that both techniques provided comparable analgesia with a higher incidence of side effects such as nausea, vomiting, urinary retention, failed blocks, hypotension, and pulmonary complications associated with EA.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In addition, an observational cohort study found that thoracic PVB was associated with lower incidence of major complications in patients undergoing pneumonectomy as compared to thoracic EA.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>PVB is used for a number of surgical interventions both as an anesthesia technique[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and for postoperative pain management.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Because of the unilateral sympathetic blockade, PVB produces smaller effects on the cardiovascular system as compared to other regional anesthetic techniques like a spinal or epidural block.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] PVB produces superior blockade of somatic nerves along with sympathetic nerves compared to EA; this results in better pain relief along with better conservation of lung physiological functions, neuroendocrine stress response, side effects, and respiratory complications in the postoperative period.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Open nephrectomy involves a subcostal flank incision which offers a wide operative field, but it requires a considerable amount of muscle cutting giving rise to significant postoperative pain and longer recovery period owing to large painful scar.
