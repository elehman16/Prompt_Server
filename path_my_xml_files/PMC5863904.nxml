The objective of this randomised control trial (RCT) is to determine the real-world effectiveness of strengthened depression identification and management on depression outcomes in hypertensive patients attending primary health care (PHC) facilities in South Africa (SA).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">The study design is a pragmatic, two-arm, parallel-cluster RCT, the unit of randomisation being the clinics, with outcomes being measured for individual participants. The 20 largest eligible clinics from one district in the North West Province are enrolled in the trial. Equal numbers of hypertensive patients (<italic>n</italic> = 50) identified as having depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) are enrolled from each clinic, making up a total of 1000 participants with 500 in each arm. The nurse clinicians in the control facilities receive the standard training in Primary Care 101 (PC101), a clinical decision support tool for integrated chronic care that includes guidelines for hypertension and depression care. Referral pathways available include referrals to PHC physicians, clinical or counselling psychologists and outpatient psychiatric and psychological services. In the intervention clinics, this training is supplemented with strengthened training in the depression components of PC101 as well as training in clinical communication skills for nurse-led chronic care. Referral pathways are strengthened through the introduction of a facility-based behavioural health counsellor, trained to provide structured manualised counselling for depression and adherence counselling for all chronic conditions. The primary outcome is defined as at least 50% reduction in PHQ-9 score measured at 6 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This trial should provide evidence of the real world effectiveness of strengtheneddepression identification and collaborative management on health outcomes of hypertensive patients withcomorbid depression attending PHC facilities in South Africa.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">South African National Clinical Trial Register: SANCTR (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sanctr.gov.za/SAClinicalTrials">http://www.sanctr.gov.za/SAClinicalTrials</ext-link>) (DOH-27-0916-5051).

Even in contexts such as South Africa, which has a large human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) burden, CVD is among the top three causes of years of life lost (YLLs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In relation to disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), which include quantification of YLLs and years lived with disability (YLD), data from South Africa shows a rapid rise in NCDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Estimates by the World Health Organisation (WHO) using DALYs suggest that NCDs were responsible for 28% of the total burden of disease in South Africa in 2004 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These conditions are becoming more prevalent with the diffusion of urban lifestyle risk factors, including tobacco smoking, unhealthy diet, alcohol consumption and physical inactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par47">The prevalence of hypertension, at 20% of the adult population, is of particular concern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], with CVD projected to increase by over 40% in the 35&#x02013;65 years age group by 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A survey of over 18,000 encounters showed that hypertension follow-up was the leading reason for attending primary care clinics, accounting for 10% of all consultations among adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Similarly, in a study at a primary care clinic in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, hypertension was the most common morbidity (65%) among 14,364 adult chronic disease patients with tuberculosis (TB), HIV, diabetes or hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par48">NCDs often co-exist with one another, as well as with mental disorders. Results from 245,404 participants from the World Health Surveys in 60 countries revealed that co-morbid depression was present in respondents with diabetes (9.3%), arthritis (10.7%), angina (15%) and asthma (18.1%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Prevalence rates of depression were highest when there was co-morbidity of two or more chronic physical conditions (23%). Relatively high rates of co-morbidity of NCDs are increasingly being reported in patients in South Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], with a local study also revealing a similar pattern where multiple co-morbidities were associated with increased psychological symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par49">Prevalence of depression in respondents from the World Health Surveys without chronic diseases on the other hand was less than 5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This suggests that people with NCDs are two to five times more likely to suffer from depression than those without NCDs, with the likelihood increasing with multiple co-morbidities. Depression co-existing with other NCDs was also shown to result in greater health decrements than when one or more physical conditions were present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Mental disorders have a mutually reinforcing relationship with NCDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], compromising both prevention and treatment through exacerbating modifiable risk factors, and by compromising adherence and self-care, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In addition, through compromising the endocrine and immune systems, depression and anxiety can have a negative interactive effect at the biological level, exacerbating vulnerability to, and the course of, existing NCDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par50">With respect to CVD in particular, co-morbid depression increases the risk of CHD and stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Risk factors for CHD and stroke are related to unhealthy lifestyles which are more common among people with depression or chronic ill-health. Depressed people are more likely to smoke&#x000a0;and less likely to exercise, adhere to chronic medication, or eat healthily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. It is also possible that there are common causal physiological pathways, such as inflammation, which underlie both CVD and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. With regard to the impact of common mental disorders on adherence in hypertensive patients specifically, some studies from high-income countries (HICs) show higher non-adherence in patients with co-morbid depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, it should be noted that a recent study in Ghana found that there was no relationship between co-morbid depression and/or anxiety and non-adherence, although they did find a relationship between moderate to severe stress symptoms and non-adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Health system reforms to accommodate the rise in co-existing chronic conditions</title><p id="Par51">In response to the rising burden of co-existing chronic diseases that includes HIV, TB and NCDs, the South African National Department of Health has piloted a multi-disease, integrated, chronic services approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Care for chronic conditions requires collaborative care, which extends beyond the biomedical model that characterises acute care, to incorporate the following elements: self-management support and access to behavioural-change programmes (to help patients have control over their illness and live with their condition); clinical decision support (to improve providers&#x02019; expertise and skills to provide the most evidence-informed care); clinical information systems (capturing patient-level information that will help clinical care and follow-up); delivery system design to promote chronic care (promoting planned team-based care and identifying the roles and responsibilities of the different members of the health care team so that they can work synergistically); linkages to community resources such as support groups; and quality improvement to improve the organisation of health care as a whole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par52">Such integrated collaborative care for clusters of co-existing illnesses described above, especially physical and mental disorders, has been shown to be more effective than usual care in HICs. Exemplary evidence of this is provided by the TEAMcare trial in the United States which targeted patients with depression and poorly controlled diabetes, heart disease or both, using nurse-led, multi-disease collaborative care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The TEAMcare intervention combined pharmacotherapy with psychosocial interventions, supported by self-help materials, to assist patients to solve problems and set goals to improve adherence and self-care.</p><p id="Par53">In South Africa, at the facility level, the integrated chronic care approach which is part of the integrated clinical management service, aims to strengthen the quality of care for chronic conditions through, inter alia: (1) facility re-organisation to improve the quality of care and servicing all chronic care patients at one service point and (2) strengthening clinical decision support through onsite in-service training using an integrated set of algorithms and checklists developed to support nurse-led identification and management of all common chronic diseases whether communicable, NCDs or mental illness &#x02013; called PC101 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. At the community level, well-controlled patients are supported to engage in self-management by community health worker (CHW)-driven, ward-based outreach teams (WBOTs), which are part of the primary health care (PHC) re-engineering framework in South Africa. At a population level, health promotion and population screening is envisaged to promote an informed and activated population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">While mental health problems managed at the PHC level are included in the basket of chronic disease categories catered for by this integrated approach, findings suggest that the limited mental health component included in the basic PC101 training is insufficient to improve PHC nurses&#x02019; knowledge of mental health conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and was not associated with increased case detection of depression in a previous trial focussing on NCDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. There is thus a need to strengthen the mental health component of this integrated approach in order to close the large treatment gap for mental disorders in South Africa, particularly in the chronic care population. While one in six adults experience a common mental disorder (depression, anxiety disorders and substance use disorders) over a 12-month period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], only one in four receives treatment of any kind [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p id="Par55">The Programme for improving mental health care (PRIME) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] in South Africa has been working in one of the districts where this integrated model has been piloted for the past 5 years to develop and evaluate the feasibility of an integrated collaborative-care package for depression and alcohol use disorders (AUD). The package includes strengthening of the mental health component of PC101 training and referral pathways for management of AUD and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]; the use of lay behavioural health counsellors to provide manual-based counselling for chronic care patients with depression, shown to have promising outcomes in a pilot trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]; strengthened referral pathways for initiation of psychotropic medication by primary health care physicians; as well as referral to mental health specialists for more severe and treatment resistant depression. In addition, systems strengthening innovations to support these efforts have been introduced through the EMERALD (Emerging Mental Health Systems in Low- and Middle-income Countries (LIMCs)) programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], including clinical communication skills for nurse-led chronic care and a strengthened employee assistance programme for primary health care providers experiencing personal problems and burn-out.</p><p id="Par56">Development of the strengthened mental health intervention has been iterative, guided by the United Kingdom (UK) Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for the development of complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and refined during two successive pilots, the first in a single clinic, and the second in a further three clinics. The resultant intervention has been scaled up to 10 clinics in the Dr. Kenneth Kaunda (DKK) District and a further 10 clinics in the adjacent Bojanala Platinum (BP) District during the period 2014&#x02013;2017. The intervention targets depression co-morbid with all common chronic conditions managed at primary care facilities.</p><p id="Par57">This paper describes one of a pair of trials evaluating the effects of this intervention on mental and physical outcomes among chronic care patients. The other trial (Co-morbid Affective Disorders, HIV and Long-term Health &#x02013; CobALT), focusses on chronically ill patients receiving antiretroviral (ART) treatment. These two conditions covered by this pair of trials account for most chronic care attendances in South Africa. Similarities and differences between the two trials are described in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The main distinction is the restriction of the trial reported in this paper to one of these districts, the eligibility criteria for patient participants and the choice of physical outcomes.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of the pair of trials evaluating the intervention developed during PRIME-SA</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Characteristic</th><th>PRIME (PRogramme for Improving Mental health carE-SA) trial</th><th>CobALT (Co-morbid Affective Disorders and Long-term Health) trial</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Setting</td><td>Dr. Kenneth Kaunda District, North West Province, South Africa</td><td>Dr. Kenneth Kaunda and Bojanala Districts, North West Province, South Africa</td></tr><tr><td>Clinic participants</td><td>20 primary care clinics</td><td>40 primary care clinics</td></tr><tr><td>Patient participants</td><td>Patients 18 years or older attending for hypertension treatment with a Patient Health Questionnaire score of 9 or more (<italic>n</italic> = 1000, 50 per clinic)</td><td>Patients 18 years or older attending for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with a Patient Health Questionnaire score of 9 or more (<italic>n</italic> = 2000, 50 per clinic)</td></tr><tr><td>Number and unit of randomisation</td><td>20 primary care clinics</td><td>40 primary care clinics</td></tr><tr><td>Trial participants</td><td>Patients 18 years or older attending for hypertension treatment with a Patient Health Questionnaire score of 9 or more (n = 1000, 50 per clinic)</td><td>Patients 18 years or older attending for ART with a Patient Health Questionnaire score of 9 or more (n = 2000, 50 per clinic)</td></tr><tr><td>Control arm</td><td>The Integrated Services Delivery Model which includes distribution and training in the PC101 guide</td><td>Same</td></tr><tr><td>Intervention arm</td><td>Three additional elements:<break/>1.

The South African National Department of Health guided selection of the site as it is a priority district for several initiatives to strengthen primary care, including the integrated chronic care approach and the establishment of ward-based teams of CHWs. DKK is also one of 11 districts where national health insurance is being phased in over a 14-year period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. DKK comprises four sub-districts, with a population of 796,823 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The main economic activities are mining and agriculture. Public health facilities include regional hospitals, primary health care facilities and one specialist in-patient mental health facility.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Location of the Dr. Kenneth Kaunda and Bojanala Districts in relation to South Africa</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2018_2518_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Interventions</title><p id="Par63">Control arm: the integrated chronic care approach implemented by the Department of Health (described in the introduction) forms the control comparison and has been implemented in both intervention and control clinics in the year prior to the introduction of the study intervention with various levels of technical support provided by the Department of Health. At facility level the main interventions have been the re-organisation of chronic care services and training of clinic staff in PC101. Queues, appointment systems and waiting rooms for communicable disease services (HIV, TB once the intensive phase of treatment has been completed) have been integrated with services catering for NCDs and mental health, resulting in a single chronic care service aimed at reducing fragmentation and promoting integrated care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Nurses in the control facilities are able to refer patients identified as having depression to PHC physicians for the initiation of antidepressants (as they are not authorised to prescribe antidepressant medications in South Africa); as well as to mental health specialists. The latter are, however, limited with only two district-level PHC psychologists available to service all PHC facilities in the DKK District. Limited specialist psychological and psychiatric care is also available at the district hospital.</p><p id="Par64">Intervention arm: in the intervention clinics, we strengthened the training of PHC nurse clinicians in the identification and management of depression through training in clinical communication skills and supplementary PC101 mental health sessions (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref> of web-based supplementary material for examples of PC101 guidelines). We trained facility trainers in the intervention facilities to deliver this supplementary training material. Facility-based trainers in the control facilities are not exposed to this training in the delivery of this supplementary material. In addition, we strengthened referral pathways for treatment and counselling (see the stepped-up collaborative-care model depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). For treatment, we provided supplementary training in mental health care for PHC physicians. For counselling, we introduced lay behavioural health counsellors into the intervention clinics, with structured supervision from the project psychologist and district-based psychologists that includes individual and weekly group supervision. A comparison of the training provided in the control and intervention clinics is contained in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The intervention coordinator is responsible for monitoring the intervention to ensure that each component is functioning optimally at the facility level. A detailed monthly monitoring document was developed and is used to monitor coverage of nurse training in the supplementary material given high nurse turnover, nurse referrals to counsellors and counsellor integration within the facility.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Collaborative-care package for depression</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2018_2518_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig><table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Comparison of training provided to control and intervention clinics</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Provider</th><th>Role</th><th>Training</th><th>Content of training</th><th>Method and timeframe</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="5">Control and intervention facilities</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">PHC nurses</td><td rowspan="3">Identifies, provides brief interventions and refers</td><td rowspan="3">Basic onsite PC101 training</td><td rowspan="3">Case scenarios used for training in the identification and management of common chronic diseases, including communicable diseases, NCDs (including hypertension), women&#x02019;s health and mental health.

Twelve clinics serving the central Matlosana sub-district comprised one strata, and eight&#x000a0;more rurally situated clinics from the Tlokwe, Maquassi Hills and Ventersdorp sub-districts the second stratum. We randomised clinics in each stratum on a 1:1 ratio yielding 10 clinics per group. Randomisation was completed using nQuery Advisor by the trial statistician independently of the managers who gave permission for the trial, and before implementation of the intervention or patient recruitment to ensure allocation concealment.</p><p id="Par67">Intervention clinic staff cannot be blinded to the clinic&#x02019;s treatment status given that they have to agree to additional training activities over and above the standard PC101 training; as well as the introduction of behavioural health counsellors. Although the outcome assessors (the fieldworkers) are not informed as to which clinics are in the intervention arm and which are in the control arm, it is not possible to guarantee complete blinding of the fieldworkers given the abovementioned intervention activities at the intervention clinics. To minimise the potential for bias, all patient screening, recruitment, interviewing, follow-up and quality assurance procedures are standardised across both arms to ensure that these data collection activities and procedures are applied equally in all clinics. The data collection team also operates independently of the intervention team, so as to limit exposure to the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Patient participants</title><p id="Par68">We recruit patient participants from the ambulatory primary care population attending chronic care services at the trial clinics. Participants are considered to be eligible for the trial if they are aged 18 years or older, report receiving treatment for hypertension and screen positive for depression with a total score of 9 or more on the (PHQ-9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). We chose the PHQ-9 given that it has been commonly used in other trials on depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], and is relatively short and easy to train fieldworkers to administer. Most importantly, it has also been validated on the target population in South Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. We did consider other depression measures such as the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D). The HAM-D, however, can take up to 15 to 30 min to administer, is ideally clinician administered and is also complicated to score, requiring substantial training in getting reasonable inter-rater agreement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Given that this is a pragmatic trial, our preference was to use a measure that could be relatively easier to administer and which had been validated in the population of interest. The PHQ-9 is aligned with the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Text Revision</italic> (DSM-IV-TR) diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder and the cut-off of 9 has been determined for the study population in a preliminary validation study involving 676 chronic care patients also from the DKK District. A cut-off of 9 and above was shown through the validation study to be the optimal cut-off for sensitivity and specificity indices against the &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; of a Structured Clinical Interview for a DSM-IV (SCID) diagnosis of major depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The trials findings will, therefore, apply to patients with major depressive symptoms at baseline. In this validation study, performance of a Setswana translation of the PHQ-9 with an adapted response to improve understanding of the time period when symptoms were experienced was compared against a structured clinical interview administered by a clinical psychologist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] (see Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> for a comparison of the original and localised validated version). Mean PHQ-9 scores at baseline will be compared between intervention and control arms to assess for any difference which could indicate potential selection bias. We exclude participants if they are in need of urgent medical attention, too ill to provide informed consent or plan to move outside the vicinity of the clinic during the 12 month follow-up period (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). We expect some patients to meet eligibility criteria for both pairs of trials owing to the growing overlap between HIV and hypertension, recognise that it is important to represent this co-morbidity within the trials, and so invite such patients to participate in both trials.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Flow of participants</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2018_2518_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig><table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Patient Health Questionnaire-9: general and localised versions</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by any of the following problems?<sup>a</sup></th><th>Not at all</th><th>Several days</th><th>More than half of the days</th><th>Nearly every day</th></tr><tr><th>Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by any of the following problems?<sup>b</sup></th><th>0 days</th><th>1&#x02013;7 days</th><th>8&#x02013;11 days</th><th>12&#x02013;14 days</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Little interest or pleasure in doing things</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Trouble falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Feeling tired or having little energy</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Poor appetite or overeating</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Feeling bad about yourself &#x02013; or that you are a failure or have let yourself or your family down</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Trouble concentrating on things, such as reading the newspaper or watching television</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Moving or speaking so slowly that other people could have noticed?

While the broad inclusion criteria and light-touch follow-up are consistent with the pragmatic design and are intended to maximise generalisability to an intervention in real-world circumstances, it can be difficult to assess whether all the study participants were eligible for the intervention and to quantify the processes of care in a causal pathway. A qualitative process evaluation will be conducted alongside the RCT to address these gaps and to understand how integrating mental health services for depression affects care of physical conditions like hypertension.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Data management</title><p id="Par84">Fieldworkers use handheld devices to collect data that is uploaded onto a secure server. The Trial Management Team manage data quality assurance through weekly telephonic data meetings when uploaded data is reviewed, as well as bimonthly face-to-face meetings of the Data Management Team comprising the data manager, principal investigators (PIs) and invited co-investigators, including the statistician depending on the need. Data is collected alongside the first phase of the CobALT trial in the DKK District, and is subject to the same standard operating procedures for data management for the CobALT trial. These include intensive fieldworker training in the administration of the interview, and onsite supervision by three fieldwork supervisors who perform daily quality checks on interviews conducted, observe interviews weekly to ensure the interviewer administers the questionnaire and performs the measurements as trained, and assists in addressing fieldwork problems that may have impeded data collection.</p><p id="Par85">Patients receive a ZAR50 voucher (just under US$3) in appreciation for their time.

This loss-to-follow-up rate was determined on the basis of a previous trial in South Africa involving chronic care patients, including those with depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. The trial statistician calculated a sample size comprising 50 patients in each of the 20 facilities making up 1000 patients (500 patients in the intervention arm and 500 patients in the control arm) to provide 90% power to detect an effect size of 17% (60% control versus 77% intervention), and 80% power to detect an effect size of 15% (60% control versus 75% intervention).</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Statistical methods</title><p id="Par87">We will analyse data using the STATA statistical package and will blind all analysis pertaining to the primary and secondary objectives until the analysis is finalised.

For the intention-to-treat analysis of the primary outcome, we will use binomial regression to estimate differences in proportions of participants considered having at least 50% reduction in depressive symptoms, as measured using PHQ-9 at 6 months. We will take into account the clustering of participants within facilities for any inference done. We will complete secondary analyses whereby we adjust for baseline PHQ-9 scores, and will test for interaction effects between physical conditions. Secondary analysis will also include a comparison of outcomes in intervention-group participants who did and did not receive the intervention with adjustment for baseline covariates; as well as sub-group analysis of blood pressure outcomes in patients who had uncontrolled blood pressure at baseline.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Process evaluation</title><p id="Par88">The UK MRC framework for the process evaluation of complex evaluations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] informs the process evaluation design. We have adopted a mixed-methods approach that combines quantitative process variables collected during the 12-month period of the trial and post hoc in-depth qualitative process evaluation interviews across the clusters that follow analysis of the trial outcome data. Through monitoring changes at a facility and district level on a regular basis, we will gather information related to contextual factors that may influence outcomes in the intervention and control clusters. To monitor fidelity and quality of implementation we will collect (1) process indicators on coverage of training sessions and supervision received across the intervention clusters for PHC providers and behavioural health counsellors, (2) data on the total number of patients identified and referred for treatment of depression, and (3) fidelity checks of the counselling implementation through analysing audio-recordings of counselling sessions. We will employ in-depth qualitative process evaluation interviews to examine variations in the trial outcomes associated with potential causal mechanisms and contextual factors. These interviews will be informed by the 6-month depression primary outcome data, and conducted <italic>post hoc</italic> on purposefully sampled clusters and individuals to understand variations in the clusters that may emerge in the outcome data and analysed using thematic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p id="Par89">In order to protect the confidentiality of the information provided by research participants, the research team, including fieldworkers, are required to sign a confidentiality agreement.

Specific adverse events, applicable to the PRIME-SA trial, and protocols for management and reporting are specified in a DSMB Charter and are detailed in Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>. Of note, given the high rate of positive responses to the ninth item of the PHQ-9 (&#x02018;Thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way&#x02019;) during the past 2 weeks in the formative PRIME work, and a low rate of reported deaths by suicide in the North West Province, the DSMB advised against over-interpretation of a single item in a questionnaire. We thus introduced a standard operating procedure previously described that distinguishes patients needing psychoeducation, where patients are provided with information on their condition and where to get help from local community resources and helplines, from those requiring immediate assessment by the clinic nurse and onward referral. Death is identified during the follow-up periods and the cause of death investigated by the fieldworkers through contacting the family and through reviewing the clinic files and the National Death Registry. Death by suicide is considered a serious adverse event as it could be associated with the intervention and is reported to the COBALT DSMB and UKZN BREC within 7 days of knowledge of confirmed suicide.<table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Defining, monitoring and reporting of harm in the PRIME trial</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Type of harm</th><th>Source and method of identification</th><th>Action(s) to mitigate harm to specific participants</th><th>Reporting frequency and to whom</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="4">Adverse events</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Positive response to ninth item of the PHQ-9: &#x02018;Thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way&#x02019;</td><td>Participant interviews (baseline, 6 month follow-up, 12 month follow-up).<break/>Flag within electronic questionnaire prompting interviewer to act</td><td>Repeat question to reduce telescoping-type reporting errors.<break/>If &#x02265;&#x02009;8 days in last 2 weeks, immediate referral to clinic staff.<break/>If between 1 and 7 days then written educational material given</td><td>6-monthly report to DSMB<break/>6-monthly to IRB (with DSMB letter of recommendation)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;PHQ-9 score of &#x02265;&#x02009;20 at 12 months suggesting persistent severe depression</td><td>Participant interviews (12-month follow-up).<break/>Data report (monthly)</td><td>Summary forwarded to clinic together with recommendations for further treatment</td><td>6-monthly report to DSMB<break/>6-monthly to IRB (with DSMB letter of recommendation)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Blood pressure severely raised (&#x02265;&#x02009;180/110) placing participant at immediate risk of cardiovascular event</td><td>Participant interviews (baseline, 6-month follow-up, 12-month follow-up).<break/>Flag within electronic questionnaire prompting interviewer to act</td><td>Immediate referral to clinic staff for review</td><td>6-monthly report to DSMB<break/>6-monthly to IRB (with DSMB letter of recommendation)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Raised blood pressure at follow-up representing undiagnosed or uncontrolled hypertension</td><td>Participant interviews (baseline, 6-month follow-up, 12-month follow-up).<break/>Longitudinal patient record</td><td>Summary forwarded to clinic together with recommendations for further treatment</td><td>6-monthly report to DSMB<break/>6-monthly to IRB (with DSMB letter of recommendation)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Serious adverse events</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Hospitalisation</td><td>Participant interviews (baseline, 6-month follow-up, 12-month follow-up).<break/>Routinely collected hospitalisation data.<break/>Data report (monthly).</td><td>No immediate action other than 6-monthly review by DSMB</td><td>6-monthly report to DSMB<break/>6-monthly to IRB (with DSMB letter of recommendation)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Death (excluding suicide)</td><td>Participant interviews (Loss to Follow-up Form).<break/>National Population Register.<break/>Data report (monthly)</td><td>No immediate action other than 6-monthly review by DSMB</td><td>6-monthly report to DSMB<break/>6-monthly to IRB (with DSMB letter of recommendation)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Death by suicide</td><td>Participant interviews (Loss to Follow-up Form).<break/>National Population Register (providing we are able to access cause of death).<break/>Data report (weekly)</td><td>Immediate notification of PI (LF) who will follow-up with fieldwork staff to confirm suicide and establish date of suicide</td><td>Notification of IRB, DSMB and NIMH within 7 days of knowledge of confirmed suicide</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>DSMB</italic> Data and Safety Monitoring Board, <italic>IRB</italic> Institutional Review Board, <italic>PHQ-9</italic> Patient Health Questionnaire-9, <italic>PI</italic> principal investigator</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p id="Par91">Further, while hospitalisation, prolonged hospitalisation and death would normally be considered serious adverse events, these events are expected to occur fairly frequently among the participant population given that they all suffer from hypertension which may also be co-morbid with other chronic conditions, thus increasing their vulnerability to hospitalisation and premature death. We thus monitor hospitalisations and deaths at 6- and 12-month follow-up interviews as well as link hospitalisation data on a quarterly basis, with a once-off linkage with the national population register being planned as well.

These stakeholders have expressed their commitment to implementing the intervention package should the trial results be successful. Scale-up would require, inter alia, the expansion of the PC101 training to include clinical communication skills; a dedicated mental health module; and role clarification of the lay behavioural health counsellors within the collaborative-care model.</p><p id="Par93">Further, the results of the trial will be written up in a main outcome publication within a year of the finalisation of the fieldwork, together with additional papers detailing secondary outcomes and sub-group analyses.

It interferes with treatment adherence as well as health-enhancing lifestyle changes, and has the potential to undermine investments in health care for these conditions. There is an urgent need to close the treatment gap for common mental disorders in LMICs and South Africa specifically, especially in patients who have multiple co-morbid chronic conditions &#x02013; given the negative health impacts and economic costs. It is particularly important to know whether such an intervention leads to cost saving both to the health care system (through improved physical health outcomes and reduced health care utilisation) and broader society (through improved functioning, productivity and income).</p><p id="Par95">Given the paucity of mental health specialists in LMICs, task sharing has been recommended as a strategy to close this gap globally as well as locally in South Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. PRIME in South Africa, in collaboration with the Department of Health has developed a collaborative-team-based package for depression care in the chronic care population that strengthens and builds on existing task-sharing strategies. The need for this RCT to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of this integrated collaborative approach is spurred by the lack of evidence on the effectiveness of collaborative-care models on mental and physical health outcomes in chronic populations in LMICs. The proposed trial will be the first RCT evaluating the real-world effectiveness of a task-shared collaborative team approach to caring for hypertensive patients with co-morbid depression in a LMIC.</p><sec id="Sec23"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par96">At the time of submission (September 2016) the trial is in follow-up stage.

Informed consent required that patients understood that their participation was voluntary and that they could withdraw at any stage; were required to sit for three interviews (baseline, 6 months and 12 months), and permit access to their patient records for research purposes.</p></sec><sec id="FPar4"><title>Consent for publication</title><p id="Par100">Not applicable</p></sec><sec id="FPar5"><title>Competing interests</title><p id="Par101">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec id="FPar6"><title>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</title><p id="Par102">Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></sec></notes><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Yach</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Hawkes</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Gould</surname><given-names>CL</given-names></name><name><surname>Hofman</surname><given-names>KJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The global burden of chronic diseases: overcoming impediments to prevention and control</article-title><source>JAMA</source><year>2004</year><volume>291</volume><issue>21</issue><fpage>2616</fpage><lpage>2622</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1001/jama.291.21.2616</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15173153</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mortality</surname><given-names>GBD</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Causes of Death C.
