The mature roots of these plants are used in many traditional medical formulations to treat several different conditions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] It has been used for more than 2000 years in Asia as a traditional medicine and dietary supplement.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>The primary active constituents of <italic>ginseng</italic> are thought to be the ginsenosides, which include more than 20 saponin triterpenes similar in structure to steroid hormones. These are believed to act via hormone receptors in the hypothalamus, pituitary glands, and other hormone sensitive tissues. Ginsenosides stimulate secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone, leading to production of increased release of adrenal hormones, including cortisol. Ginsenosides have also been reported to stimulate ribonucleic acid (RNA) transcription, protein synthesis, and hepatic cholesterol production. In addition, they may stimulate synthesis of adrenal hormone precursors.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>According to recent studies, a hypolipidemic effect of <italic>Panax ginseng</italic> extract (PGE) is associated with decrease in total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) levels and an increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level. Administration of PGE increased serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities while decreased MDA level indicating that antioxidant potential of PGE might induce hypolipidemic effect as one of action mechanism.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Evidence suggests that <italic>P. ginseng</italic> lowers cortisol levels in individuals with diabetes, while increasing cortisol levels in non-diabetic individuals.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Specific triterpenoid saponins (diols) are claimed to cause improvements in endurance and learning. These compounds are also believed to contribute to sedative and antihypertensive properties. A second group (trials) has been reported to increases blood pressure and function as central nervous system stimulants. Ginsenosides have carbohydrate-sparing actions and may increase muscle endurance.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>The effects of <italic>P. ginseng</italic> have been reported to be dose-dependent. Low-doses increase blood pressure, while high doses exhibit a hypotensive effect.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Additionally, <italic>P. ginseng</italic> is reported to have immunostimulatory effects on the reticuloendothelial system. <italic>P. ginseng</italic> has also been reported to reduce weight loss and stabilize white blood cell counts during chemotherapy and to accelerate postsurgical recovery. <italic>P. ginseng</italic> helps the body adapt to stresses caused by chemotherapy and radiation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Many reports from clinical and experimental studies suggested that <italic>ginseng</italic> may have beneficial effects on reducing serum TC level and enhancing antioxidant status.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>However, Ismail <italic>et al</italic>. reported that a <italic>ginseng</italic> extract (G-115) had no significant hypolipidemic or antioxidant effects in rabbits.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>Administration of <italic>P. ginseng</italic> has minimal side effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>Ginsenosides, have been known for the anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative activities by significant inhibitory effect on tumor necrosis factor-alpha.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>The most extensively studied biomarker of inflammation in cardiovascular diseases is C-reactive protein (CRP), for which standardized high-sensitivity assays (hs-CRP) are widely available.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>According to conflicting results from previous studies regarding the efficacy of <italic>ginseng</italic> on lipid profile and anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative activities of its components, we aimed to evaluate the effects of <italic>P. ginseng</italic> on lipid profile, pro-oxidant &#x02013; anti-oxidant status and hs-CRP level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted as a double-blind randomized controlled trial. For the proposed study, to achieve a similar difference between the ginseng extract and placebo treatment groups with an 80% power and confidence interval of 95%, it is estimated that a sample size of 15 subjects per group will be required, that is, 30 in total. 40 patients were selected. The sample size was calculated according to the previous study of Kim, <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] These patients referred to the cardiology clinic at Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad, Iran. No patients were on treatment with any medications. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined according to The American College of Cardiology (ACC) /The American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines.

Patients visited the clinic over a period of 8 weeks at three stages (0, 1, and 2). At each clinic visit, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) were measured for each participant. After allowing participants to rest for a minimum of 10 min, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured twice, and the averages were obtained. At stages 0 and 2, blood sampling and biochemical evaluation were undertaken. At stages 0 and 1, patients were administered the drug, or placebo [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].

For preparation of TMB cation, 18 mL of fresh chloramine T (10 mM) solution was added to 1 mL of TMB solution, incubated for 20 min; and 1.25 U of peroxidase enzyme solution was added to 9 mL of TMB solution. The working solution was prepared by mixing the two latter solutions, incubated for 5 min at room temperature and used immediately; 10 mL of each sample, standard or blank (distilled water) was mixed with 200 mL of working solution, in each well of a 96-well plate, which was then incubated in a dark place for 12 min at room temperature; at the end of the incubation time, 100 mL of 2N HCl was added to each well. The plate was then incubated for 45 min in a dark place and measured in an ELISA reader at 450 nm with a reference wavelength of 620 nm or 570 nm. A standard curve was provided from the values relative to the standard samples. The values of the PAB are expressed in arbitrary units, which are the percentage of hydrogen peroxide in the standard solution multiplied by 6. The values of the unknown samples were then calculated based on the values obtained from the above standard curve.</p><p>TC, TGs and HDL-C were measured using a standard enzymatic method by Biosystem kits and using an auto analyzer (BT 3000 model).

Each capsule contained 250 mg of ginseng extract, that contained 7 mg of ginsenosides and the components were characterized as follows: 2-3% for ginsenosides (Rb1, Rb2, Rb3, Rc, Rd, Re, Rg1), panacene, beta sitosterol, low molecular weight polysaccharides, flavonoids. Ginsenosides or panaxosides are a class of steroid glycosides, and triterpene saponins, found exclusively in the plant genus <italic>Panax ginseng</italic>.

Ginsenoside-Rc is a steroid molecule that can be found in the <italic>ginseng</italic> plant and is recognized for producing more sedative related results than other ginsenosides, such as ginsenoside-Re or ginsenoside-Rg.
