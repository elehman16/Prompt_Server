Most anxiety disorders, however, do not evolve from a traumatic experience. Insights from neuroscience show that memory can be modified post-learning, which may elucidate how pathological fear can develop after relatively mild aversive events. Worrying - a process frequently observed in anxiety disorders - is a potential candidate to strengthen the formation of fear memory after learning. Here we tested in a discriminative fear conditioning procedure whether worry strengthens associative fear memory. Participants were randomly assigned to either a Worry (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;23) or Control condition (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;25). After fear acquisition, the participants in the Worry condition processed six worrisome questions regarding the personal aversive consequences of an electric stimulus (UCS), whereas the Control condition received difficult but neutral questions. Subsequently, extinction, reinstatement and re-extinction of fear were tested. Conditioned responding was measured by fear-potentiated startle (FPS), skin conductance (SCR) and UCS expectancy ratings. Our main results demonstrate that worrying resulted in increased fear responses (FPS) to both the feared stimulus (CS<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) and the originally safe stimulus (CS<sup>&#x02212;</sup>), whereas FPS remained unchanged in the Control condition. In addition, worrying impaired both extinction and re-extinction learning of UCS expectancy. The implication of our findings is that they show how worry may contribute to the development of anxiety disorders by affecting associative fear learning.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Emotional memory is considered to lie at the root of anxiety disorders, and originates from a learned association between a previously neutral event (<italic>Conditioned Stimulus or CS</italic>, e.g., stranger) and an anticipated catastrophe (<italic>Unconditioned Stimulus or UCS</italic>, e.g., physical attack). Patients with anxiety disorders feel, think and act as if the feared CS predicts the later occurrence of a catastrophic outcome (UCS). Although Pavlovian fear conditioning serves as a valuable experimental model for studying associative fear memory, it falls short in explaining that most anxiety disorders evolve after relatively mild aversive events rather than traumatic experiences. Insights from neuroscience may shed light on this issue, showing that our memory is continuously updated through an active organization of new information within the context of previous experiences. Hence, processes following fear acquisition may also contribute to the development of pathological fear.</p><p>Negative thinking such as worry is a potential candidate for strengthening associative fear memory after fear acquisition. Worry is frequently observed in anxiety disorders <xref rid="pone.0034882-Harvey1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034882-Olatunji1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, and it also predicts anxiety symptoms over time <xref rid="pone.0034882-Calmes1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Worry has been defined as &#x0201c;a chain of thoughts and images, negatively affect-laden and relatively uncontrollable" (<xref rid="pone.0034882-Borkovec1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, p. 10). To account for the negative consequences of worry, specific components have been identified: the repetitive nature, the typical negative valence (e.g., catastrophizing on a real or potential problem), and the abstract level of thinking (e.g., thinking about meanings and implications) <xref rid="pone.0034882-Harvey1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034882-Watkins1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034882-Ehring1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Several mechanisms may explain how worrisome thoughts may strengthen associative fear. First, repeatedly thinking about the fear conditioning experience might both prolong the initial fear reactions as well as strengthen the association between the mental representation of the CS and the UCS, which can lead to increased fear. This can be further explained by recent advances in neuroscience showing that &#x02018;offline&#x02019; processes - the processing that continues after (new) learning - may modify the original memory. During the initial memory formation phase (and upon retrieval), memory traces seem to be open to change <xref rid="pone.0034882-Dudai1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034882-McGaugh1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034882-Nader1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The formation of the memory of an event can also be influenced by the emotional reaction following the event <xref rid="pone.0034882-McGaugh1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. These post-learning processes can strengthen or alter the initial association, potentially resulting in fear enhancement. Second, negative (catastrophic) beliefs (on the perceived threat or about oneself) may increase the threat intensity of the acquired fear memory. This increased threat intensity of the fear associations may not only strengthen subsequent fear responding, but may also strengthen the fear association itself. Previous studies in humans <xref rid="pone.0034882-Dunsmoor1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and in rodents <xref rid="pone.0034882-Laxmi1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> have even shown that increased threat intensity enhances fear generalization, a key characteristic of anxiety disorders. Third, worry activates an abstract mode of processing yielding a loss of episodic information <xref rid="pone.0034882-Harvey1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> and a less concrete representation of the experience <xref rid="pone.0034882-Ehring1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034882-Stber1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. A loss of specificity of the fear acquisition memory may also promote the generalization of fear.</p><p>In the present discriminative fear conditioning study, in which one of two neutral pictures (CS1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> but not CS2<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) is paired with an aversive stimulus (i.e. electric stimulus, UCS), we investigated the effects of experimentally induced worry on associative fear memory. For the worry induction we presented the participants with questions regarding their tolerance for and consequences of the anticipated aversive event (electric stimulus, UCS). These questions were based on the three main characteristics of worry (i.e., repetition, negative tone, and abstract style of thinking) <xref rid="pone.0034882-Ehring1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034882-Stber1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Our study is related to previous work on UCS-inflation that also provides an explanation for the development of anxiety disorders after relatively mild aversive events <xref rid="pone.0034882-Davey1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. UCS inflation refers to the observation that increasing the aversiveness of the UCS following acquisition could enhance the conditioned response to the CS, without additional associative learning <xref rid="pone.0034882-Davey1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. However, the process of UCS-inflation solely involves the aversiveness of the UCS. Note also that the evidence for UCS-inflation is not very robust and exclusively tested for electrodermal responding (<xref rid="pone.0034882-Arntz1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034882-deJong1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and see for critical discussion <xref rid="pone.0034882-Armfield1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>).</p><p>Here we tested whether a worry induction that immediately follows a fear conditioning procedure would enhance the retention of previously acquired conditioned fear. Conditioned fear responding (CR) was measured as potentiation of the eyeblink startle reflex to a loud noise by electromyography (EMG) of the right orbicularis oculi muscle. Stronger startle responses to the loud noise during the fear-conditioned stimulus (CS1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) as compared to the control stimulus (CS2<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) reflect the fearful state of the participant elicited by the feared CS. The fear potentiated startle (FPS) is considered a reliable and specific index of fear <xref rid="pone.0034882-Hamm1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, directly connected with and modulated by the amygdala <xref rid="pone.0034882-Davis1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The cognitive level of conditioning (anticipation of an aversive event) and contingency awareness of the fear association were captured by online UCS expectancy ratings during each CS presentation. We obtained skin conductance responses (SCR) as a more objective measure of UCS anticipation <xref rid="pone.0034882-Soeter1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034882-Weike1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> - given that SCR is less sensitive to possible demand effects of our worry manipulation than subjective UCS expectancy ratings. After differential fear conditioning, participants were assigned to either the Worry induction or the Control condition. We tested the effect of worry on the formation of associative fear memory after the worry manipulation. Furthermore, we included an extinction and reinstatement procedure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034882-g001">Figure 1</xref>) to investigate whether worrying would impair the &#x02018;unlearning&#x02019; of the fear-conditioned behavior and enhance the recovery of fear. Specifically, we tested whether the worry manipulation would: 1) enhance fear expression at immediate testing (i.e., stronger differential (CS<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/CS<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) responding), 2) promote fear generalization to the safe stimulus (i.e., enhanced responding to the CS<sup>&#x02212;</sup>), 3) impair extinction learning (i.e., diminished reduction in differential responding, 4) generate stronger return of fear (i.e., stronger differential responding at reinstatement testing), and 5) impair re-extinction learning - relative to the control manipulation. Predictions were equal for the three conditioned response measures, FPS, SCR and UCS expectancy, except that we did not predict an effect of worry on UCS expectancy at immediate testing as this measure generally reaches maximum CS<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/CS<sup>&#x02212;</sup> differentiation following an acquisition procedure.</p><fig id="pone-0034882-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0034882.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Experimental Design.</title><p>CS1: stimulus paired with the unconditioned stimulus (UCS; electric stimulus) during acquisition (75&#x00025; reinforcement rate); CS2: unreinforced stimulus; NA: Noise Alone trials during inter-trial intervals.

Our results demonstrate that worrying after fear acquisition can enhance subsequent conditioned fear to both the conditioned and safe stimulus and can impair extinction at the cognitive level of conditioned responding. Specifically, several minutes of rehearsing catastrophic statements on the personal consequences of a noxious event (i.e., the electric stimulus) resulted in enhanced fear-potentiated startle (FPS) to the originally feared stimulus (CS<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) and a generalization of fear to the safe stimulus (CS<sup>&#x02212;</sup>). In contrast, fear responses remained unchanged in the control condition. Note that the elevated conditioned fear response cannot merely be attributed to a general arousing effect, as worry did not enhance startle responding to the context (during the inter-trial intervals). Our worry induction elevated the immediate startle fear responses but the effect was not extended to later phases of testing (i.e., extinction, reinstatement and re-extinction). Further, as expected, the worry manipulation impaired extinction learning of UCS expectancy, generated a stronger return of differential UCS expectancy (reinstatement testing) that persisted to impair <italic>re</italic>-extinction learning.</p><p>Our finding that post-acquisition worrying affects the formation of fear memory can be explained by the literature on memory consolidation, which shows that a memory trace can be changed after its original acquisition by either neurobiological or behavioral manipulations <xref rid="pone.0034882-Dudai1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034882-McGaugh1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034882-Hupbach1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Note that we did not observe evidence for the alternative account of UCS inflation <xref rid="pone.0034882-Davey1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> as our retrospective evaluation of the UCS did not differ between conditions. Interestingly, the current finding that worrying enhanced subsequent physiological fear responding seems at first difficult to reconcile with the original claim that worry is associated with a suppression of emotional responding <xref rid="pone.0034882-Borkovec2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. However, a recent review and re-reanalysis of the existing experimental data on the effects of worry <xref rid="pone.0034882-Newman1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> revealed that the majority of experimental studies actually show that worry facilitates and maintains a sustained negative emotional state during the worry process itself <xref rid="pone.0034882-Brosschot1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In fact, re-analyzing previous studies in which a dampening effect of worry on subsequent physiological reactivity were found revealed that these effects are confounded by baseline differences <xref rid="pone.0034882-Newman1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. More specifically, if one already experiences negative arousal during worry, and worry is used as the comparison baseline, it appears that prior worry only prevents a further increase in emotional responding <xref rid="pone.0034882-Llera1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034882-PeasleyMiklus1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. When a pre-worry resting baseline is used as the comparison point, there is no evidence for a muting effect of worry on reactivity to fear stimuli (<xref rid="pone.0034882-PeasleyMiklus1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0034882-Lissek1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and see for review and discussion <xref rid="pone.0034882-Newman1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>). Even though our data do not allow drawing conclusions on the effects of worry during the process itself - as we did not measure reactivity during the worry manipulation - they are consistent with the propositions that worry 1) facilitates negative emotional reactivity <xref rid="pone.0034882-Newman1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and 2) prolongs the cognitive representation of the stressor and its concomitant negative emotional state <xref rid="pone.0034882-Brosschot1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>Although the effect of worrying was immediately expressed at the more implicit, psychophysiological level of fear (fear-potentiated startle), we observed a delayed effect at the more explicit, cognitive level of conditioning (UCS expectancies) (i.e., impaired (re&#x02212;)extinction learning). One explanation for the absence of sustained effects on startle responding may be that the extinction training - which is a robust manipulation in itself - overruled the effect of the current worry induction. Our manipulation of &#x02018;state worry&#x02019; by a <italic>verbal, cognitive</italic> task may have been too subtle to compete with the extinction manipulation to affect physiological responding. On the other hand, the present worry manipulation did impair extinction learning at the cognitive level of conditioning (UCS expectancy) and this effect persisted throughout re-extinction learning. It should be noted that this elevated differential UCS expectancy during reinstatement and re-extinction can be a consequence of incomplete extinction. The present findings of impaired extinction are in line with the recent proposition that worry reduces the capacity for emotional learning. Worry may affect the processing of emotional information in such a way that it interferes with learning from experience <xref rid="pone.0034882-Newman1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. This deficient emotional information processing may contribute to the maintenance of anxious meanings attributed to stimuli (e.g., feared CS) <xref rid="pone.0034882-Newman1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>Our present findings extend previous studies by demonstrating for the first time an effect of experimentally induced worry on <italic>conditioned fear responding</italic>. Furthermore, our worry manipulation about the personal negative consequences of the noxious event (i.e., electric stimulus) also produced a fear response to the safe stimulus. This effect may be interpreted as generalized fear responding and is in line with other studies showing that generalization is dependent on fear intensity (in humans: <xref rid="pone.0034882-Dunsmoor1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, in rodents: <xref rid="pone.0034882-Laxmi1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>). Stronger generalization of conditioned fear to safe stimuli has also been observed &#x02013; without any manipulation - in both individuals at risk for anxiety and patients with anxiety disorders (e.g., Gazendam, Kamphuis &#x00026; Kindt, Unpublished Data, <xref rid="pone.0034882-Lissek1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>). Fear generalization may be interpreted from a functional perspective. Upon a fearful experience, we are automatically in search for predictors of the event in order to prepare for future encounters <xref rid="pone.0034882-Barlow1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. If the expected outcome is perceived as more catastrophic, one may rely on a more generalized class of predictors in order to minimize the risk of &#x02018;missing&#x02019; the catastrophe.</p><p>The current study was limited in that the effects of worrying were only observed for the startle reflex and UCS-expectancies, but not for electrodermal activity (SCR). Also, the main effect of worry on the fear-potentiated startle was short-lived, that is, it did not extend to phases beyond the first test phase. It should be noted that we only tested the effect of worry on conditioned responding directly following the manipulation. Future studies could explore whether worry also affects the consolidation of fear memory (e.g., 24 hours later). An alternative explanation for the observed enhancement of fear responding is that worry may have induced anticipatory anxiety. However, induction of an anxious state would probably have resulted into a general increase of startle responding to the context. Given that the manipulation did not yield a difference between the worry and control condition in startle responding to the context (noise alone trials), we do not consider this explanation as very tenable (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref> page 8). Further, as our manipulation incorporated the three characteristics of worrying (i.e., the repetitive nature, negative content, and abstract style of thinking) <xref rid="pone.0034882-Ehring1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034882-Stber1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, the exact mechanism of the fear enhancement remains unclear. As such, this study can only be regarded as a first step, and future studies could disentangle the effects of the different components of worrying to explore which components may be responsible for the fear enhancing effects.</p><p>Germane to this issue is the lack of indexing the different components of worrying in our manipulation check. However, to our knowledge, no golden standard exists for assessing the separate components of worry. The evaluation of one's own thinking style by self-report (e.g., indicating the degree to which thinking is abstract, verbal or visual) is notoriously unreliable <xref rid="pone.0034882-Nisbett1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Moreover, a potential negative side effect of verbalizing thoughts is that it also may influence the process under investigation. Another potential limitation of our experimental design may be our control condition. In the present control condition we utilized a manipulation (i.e., difficult, neutral questions) to exert optimal control over the content of thinking. However, one may argue that control questions could alternatively lead to distraction. The difficulty of designing an appropriate control condition has also been recognized by other researchers in the field: the alternative of a passive control condition (i.e., doing nothing) may allow naturally occurring worry processes to take place <xref rid="pone.0034882-Hertel1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, whereas any active control condition may act as a distraction <xref rid="pone.0034882-Watkins1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Nevertheless, as fear responses remained stable after our control manipulation, the observed differences between the conditions can probably be attributed to the worry manipulation.</p><p>Another related point of concern regarding our manipulation is that a number of participants failed to comply with the manipulations. Depending on the idiosyncratic tendency to worry in daily life, for some individuals it may be difficult to engage in worry upon instruction (i.e., some participants from our worry condition reported having spent more time thinking about other, unrelated things than about the worry questions), whereas other individuals will habitually start to reflect on the aversive experience regardless of the instructions (i.e., some of our control participants spent more time spontaneously recalling the electrical stimulus than answering the control questions). This raises the issue of how worry and control manipulations could be improved. An alternative approach is to capitalize on individual differences in the tendency to worry (e.g., trait worriers). Our finding that participants who failed to engage in worrying were characterized by lower state anxiety scores (excluded participants, see page 7) supports the notion of individual differences in the susceptibility for induction of negative thinking styles. We further suggest that the efficacy of the control induction may be improved by using a (neutral) computer game or a reaction time task that fully occupies the mental activity, minimizing the possibility for unintentional worrying.</p><p>In sum, the present results suggest that worry after initial fear acquisition may affect the formation of fear memory and impair fear extinction. This study opens up new avenues to experimentally investigate the effect of cognitive dysfunctional processing styles on associative fear learning by incorporating these processes within a traditional discriminative fear conditioning paradigm.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Participants</title><p>Sixty-nine healthy undergraduate students (73.9&#x00025; female, age <italic>M</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;22.2 years) participated in the study in return for course credits or a small monetary reward (seven Euros).

In order to maintain electrically identical paths and reduce common noise, the ground reference was placed &#x000b1;3 cm below the orbicularis oculi pars orbitalis on an electrically neutral site <xref rid="pone.0034882-Soeter1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The eyeblink EMG activity was measured using a bundled pair of electrode wires connected to a front-end amplifier with an input resistance of 10 M&#x003a9; and a bandwidth of DC-1500 Hz. To remove unwanted interference, a notch filter was set at 50 Hz. Integration was handled by a true-RMS converter (contour follower) with a time constant of 25 ms. The integrated EMG signal was sampled at 100 Hz. Startle responses were identified allowing onset between 10&#x02013;120 ms after probe onset and peak amplitudes were identified from 20 ms after startle onset to 200 ms following this probe.</p></sec><sec id="s4d2"><title>Skin conductance response</title><p>Skin conductance was recorded through electrodes attached to the medial phalanges of the second and fourth fingers of the non-preferred hand.
