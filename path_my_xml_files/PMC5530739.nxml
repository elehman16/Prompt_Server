The inflammatory response to CPB is often evaluated using inflammatory markers such as cytokines, acute phase proteins and white blood cells in the peripheral blood. The most important cytokines related to cardiac surgery are tumour necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and IL-10, that are studied in blood samples[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] or bronchoalveolar fluid.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Cytokines are regulators of host responses to infections, inflammation and trauma. Some cytokines act to make the disease worse (pro-inflammatory) as IL-6, IL-8 and TNF &#x003b1;. Others serve to reduce inflammation and promote healing (anti-inflammatory). IL-10[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] is a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine produced by monocytes and macrophages and inhibits production of pro-inflammatory cytokines as IL-6 and IL-8.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Ketamine influences the immune response by interfering with cytokine balance.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] It reduced TNF-&#x003b1; production in mice immune-stimulated with lipopolysaccharide and reduced the production of IL-6 and IL-8.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The ratio between IL-6 and IL-10 was used to evaluate the magnitude of the inflammatory response. Ketamine-induced a significant lowering of this ratio which means that ketamine has a dominant anti-inflammatory effect.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>The aim of this study was to examine if ketamine alone could modulate the pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine response in cardiac surgical procedures for patients with congenital cyanotic heart disease. The primary outcome was the effect of ketamine on IL-6 levels in blood, and secondary outcomes included levels of IL-8, IL-10, TNF-&#x003b1; and C-reactive protein (CRP).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This prospective randomised controlled study approved by the Hospital Institutional Review Board and registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry on 13/05/2015 (registration number: ACTRN12615000468527). Written informed consent was obtained from patient's parents.</p><p>Patients were randomised using block randomisation technique and a research randomiser program; each patient was given a particular code number which was applied to the laboratory tubes and was different from his/her medical number. These numbers were determined by the anaesthesiologists in the research team so that the laboratory team was blinded to patient's data. Allocation concealment to groups was performed using sealed envelope technique.</p><p>Patients younger than 5 years with congenital cyanotic heart disease, baseline oxygen saturation 70%&#x02013;85% and admitted for cardiac surgery with CPB were included. Patients with recent pre-operative infection, elevated baseline CRP levels, on steroid therapy or having surgery requiring total circulatory arrest were excluded from the study.</p><p>Patients were randomised into three equal groups each with 22 patients. Group A (control group) included patients who did not receive ketamine. Group B included patients who received only an induction dose of ketamine 2 mg/kg intravenous (IV), while Group C included patients who received induction doses of ketamine 2 mg/kg IV and ketamine IV infusion 50 &#x003bc;g/kg/min started after induction of general anaesthesia and continued till weaning off bypass. Baseline IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF &#x003b1; and CRP were measured 1 day before surgery. Demographic data as patient's age, sex and weight were recorded.</p><p>Patients were sedated preoperatively with 0.5 mg/kg midazolam syrup orally 30 min before the operation. In the operation room, patients received additional doses of IV midazolam 0.05&#x02013;0.1 mg/kg if needed, monitored by electrocardiogram, pulse oximeter and non-invasive blood pressure. Anaesthesia for patients in Group A was induced with fentanyl 1&#x02013;2 &#x003bc;g/kg IV, etomidate 0.2 mg/kg IV and the tracheal intubation facilitated with rocuronium 0.5 mg/kg IV, while Groups B and C were given ketamine 2 mg/kg IV, in addition. Patients received cefazolin 40 mg/kg IV within 60 min before surgical incision and repeated every 4 h intraoperative. Central venous and arterial catheters were inserted, nasal and rectal temperatures were monitored. Anaesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane 1%&#x02013;2% and additional doses of fentanyl IV and rocuronium IV. Group C patients were maintained on ketamine IV infusion 50 &#x003bc;g/kg/min started after induction of anaesthesia till weaning the patients off bypass. None of our patients received steroids intraoperatively or within the first 24 h postoperatively.</p><p>Anticoagulation was achieved by heparin 4 mg/kg IV. CPB circuit was primed with blood (200&#x02013;300 mL packed red blood cells), 500&#x02013;1000 mL crystalloids (lactated ringer and normal saline) and 75&#x02013;150 mL human albumin 20%. Patients were cooled to an average temperature of 32&#x000b0;C&#x02013;34&#x000b0;C. Milrinone infusion 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg/min IV was started in all patients with the initiation of the bypass and continued all through the procedure and in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).</p><p>After coming off bypass, anticoagulation was reversed with protamine sulphate 4 mg/kg IV. Post-bypass samples for IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-&#x003b1; and CRP were collected. Ketamine IV infusion was turned off in Group C patients. In the cardiac surgery ICU, the third and fourth set of inflammatory markers and cytokines were extracted 6 h and 24 h after coming off CPB, respectively.</p><p>Each blood sample was collected in a coded red-top tube (CAT-BD vacutainer, NJ, USA). Serum concentration of IL-6 was determined using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Invitrogen, CA, USA). IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-&#x003b1; serum levels were determined using ultrasensitive ELISA kits (Invitrogen, CA, USA). All four markers were analysed on the fully automated microtitre plate analyser (ETI-Max3000, DiaSorin, Germany). CRP level was determined using high sensitive assay kit that was performed on the Chemistry analyser (Cobas C501, Roche Diagnostic, Germany).</p><p>Sample size calculation revealed that at least 22 patients were needed in each group to detect a difference of at least 25% of mean IL-6 with a power of 0.85 and significance level of 0.05, assuming that the mean and standard deviation of IL-6 (our primary outcome) in patients with congenital cyanotic heart disease is 19 pg/ml and 4.7 pg/ml, respectively.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Within each group, the baseline levels were compared to the levels after coming off bypass, 6 and 24 h after using the paired sample <italic>t</italic>-test while ANOVA test was used to compare results in between the three groups.

Triggering factors include surgical trauma, endotoxemia and the contact of blood with non-biologic tubing surfaces releasing ILs such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-&#x003b1;.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>The inflammatory response after CPB in adult cardiac surgery is well described, and the effect of ketamine on such response was examined in some studies. Although the inflammatory response is reported to be more pronounced in the paediatric cardiac surgery as a greater portion of blood is exposed to the artificial surface of the circuit and the cardiotomy suction,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] only a few studies examined this inflammatory response and the effect of ketamine on it in paediatric cardiac surgery.</p><p>IL-6 concentration is a good indicator of activation of the inflammatory cascade and a predictor of subsequent organ dysfunction and death.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] It has been associated with negative inotropic effects[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and myocardial stunning.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] It has been suggested that the acute cardio depressant effect of cytokines is related to the enhanced production of nitric oxide (NO).[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>We examined the inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines response to paediatric cardiac surgery for cyanotic heart diseases and the effect of two different doses of ketamine on that response.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that cardiac surgery with CPB is a major initiating factor for the inflammatory response which was evident by the significant increase of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and CRP in the three groups.</p><p>TNF-&#x003b1; was the only marker non-significantly elevated in response to CPB.</p><p>However, we could not prove any beneficial effect of ketamine on the inflammatory response as the inflammatory markers in both Groups (B) and (C) follow the same trend as in Group (A). The difference between these markers in the three groups was non-significant.</p><p>In 2012, Dale <italic>et al</italic>. published a systematic review of 6 studies including 331 adult patients (four studies performed for patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and two studies for patients undergoing major abdominal surgery). They found that intraoperative ketamine administration significantly inhibited the early post-operative IL-6 inflammatory response.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Ketamine was given at a dose 0.15&#x02013;0.25 mg/kg with induction in 5 studies and 1&#x02013;3 mg/kg in the sixth study. IL-6 levels were assessed in 5 studies up to 5 h post-operative and in one study it was extended up to 48 h. In spite that this systematic review concentrated only on IL-6, they reported that CRP, TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-8 were also examined in some studies but their concentrations either did not show differences or decreased in a fashion similar to IL-6 in ketamine-treated patients while IL-10 levels increased in two studies.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Welters <italic>et al</italic>. investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of ketamine in patients undergoing elective CABG. Patients received induction dose of ketamine 1&#x02013;3 mg/kg and were kept on ketamine infusion 2&#x02013;4 mg/kg/h. Blood samples for IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-&#x003b1; were obtained before induction of anaesthesia, 1, 6 and 24 h after unclamping. The results were compared to a placebo group in which no ketamine was administered. Post-operative IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 levels increased from baseline in both groups; however, they observed a significantly diminished post-operative increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8 in the ketamine group compared to the other group. Furthermore, patients of the ketamine group showed significantly higher plasma levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 1 h after opening the aortic cross clamp.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] They did not observe any significant increase in TNF-&#x003b1; production during cardiac surgery or any significant differences between both groups regarding pro- and post-operative plasma levels of TNF-&#x003b1; and CRP.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Our results are different from the previous two studies, especially regarding IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10. This may be due to the fact that the previous two studies were carried on adult patients undergoing CABG while our study was performed on paediatric patients in whom the inflammatory response might be more pronounced due to the large surface area of contact between the blood and the foreign surface of the bypass machine circuit.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In addition, the bypass machine for paediatric patients is almost always primed with blood which could be another cause for the marked inflammatory response,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] thus ketamine alone was not sufficient to abort or antagonise this reaction. However, as in our study, ketamine did not affect the levels of CRP as in Welters study as well.</p><p>Mcbride <italic>et al</italic>. found a persistently low plasma levels of TNF-&#x003b1; (&#x0003c;7 pg/ml) examined up to 24 h after the end of CBP in 10 paediatric cardiac surgery cases.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] This was similar to our TNF-&#x003b1; results.</p><p>Pinar <italic>et al</italic>. examined the effect of ketamine on serum and tracheobronchial aspirate IL-6 as compared to isoflurane in 34 patients aged 2&#x02013;24 months in a prospective randomised controlled study. Patients were divided into two groups; in the ketamine group, patients received an induction dose of ketamine 1&#x02013;2 mg/kg and were maintained with an infusion of ketamine 25&#x02013;75 &#x003bc;g/kg/min, while in the other group patients did not receive ketamine and anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane. IL-6 and white blood cells count were measured six times starting preoperatively and up to 24 h post-operative. In both groups, the IL-6 levels in serum and tracheobronchial aspirate increased significantly after the termination of the bypass, and there were no significant differences between both groups at any stage indicating that ketamine did not help in attenuating the inflammatory response.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>A limitation of our study was that we only examined the ILs as the markers of inflammation, however, the anti-inflammatory effects of ketamine may not be picked up by examining only ILs and may be related to other mechanisms or involve other pathways.</p><p>Ketamine inhibits NO production. <italic>In vivo</italic> studies, it has been observed that ketamine administration reduces NO production in immunostimulated macrophages and that this effect is dose- and time-dependent.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The vagal nerve is known to have anti-inflammatory properties. Acetylcholine released by the vagal nerve interacts with the &#x003b1;7 subunit of the nicotinic receptors of macrophage. By antagonising the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, ketamine acts as an inhibitor of the vagal nerve and blunts its anti-inflammatory properties.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>There was a systemic inflammatory response produced and triggered by the CPB evidenced by the significant elevation of the inflammatory markers measured.
