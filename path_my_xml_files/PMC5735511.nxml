Iron will be administered as per hospital protocol which instructs slow infusion at 20-40&#x000a0;mL/h for the first 50&#x000a0;mL, increasing to 120&#x000a0;mL/h based on patient tolerance.</p><p id="Par45">Patients will be pre-medicated with anti-histamine (10&#x000a0;mg cetirizine hydrochloride) and anti-emetic (metoclopramide 10&#x000a0;mg) 1 h prior to the iron infusion to reduce adverse reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].

Hence, higher scores indicate more severe symptoms. Scales are balanced to reduce the influence of response tendencies. Each scale sub-total is interpreted independently. Questions are structured to evaluate symptoms over a period of time (5-7&#x000a0;days) which is particularly useful to measure treatment impacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Both the MFI and EQ-5D have previously been validated in pilot studies of obstetric cohorts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par68">The PPSS developed by clinicians at Westmead Hospital is a 27 point self-report questionnaire measuring frequency across three subscales: frequency of clinical symptoms commonly observed in anaemic patients (6 questions), feeding status indicated by changes to breastfeeding habits (7 questions) and home factors to quantify the amount of assistance received to care for the newborn (11 questions). Validity of the scale to discern a relationship between anaemia severity, treatment and breast feeding quality will be determined at the time of data analyses through an embedded study.</p><p id="Par69">Prior to analysis data will be de-identified using study identification numbers and transferred from study files into an electronic database by a study researcher and re-checked by a second researcher. The database will be on a separate computer at the primary study site, accessible only by study researchers and statisticians who will sign a confidentiality agreement stipulating the terms of their use of the data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Follow up</title><p id="Par70">The follow up period consists of 4 weeks with face-to-face visits at Day 7, 14 and 28. At each of these visits women will be seen by a research midwife or doctor. Hb, ferritin and CRP will be checked and results recorded in the study file. Patients will have been discharged with completed pathology forms to facilitate compliance with follow-up laboratory testing. Women will also undergo a clinical examination following a specified checklist to assess for any features of infection or other adverse outcomes . Symptom scores using the three specified scales will be collected at each of the follow up sessions. Research midwives will make all effort to ensure compliance with follow up and can facilitate home visits, including pathology collections if required.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Monitoring/reporting of data</title><p id="Par71">Given the potential for serious adverse events with each treatment, an independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board has been appointed at the primary study site consisting of a consultant obstetrician, haematologist and anaesthetist who are not directly involved with the study design or execution, as well as an independent research midwife and a statistician. Members will be provided with a charter prior to commencement of the study by study researchers requiring them to convene every 2 months for the duration of the study where they will review the data for completeness, accuracy and to identify incidences and severity of any adverse reactions and their management.</p><p id="Par72">If the total incidence of severe adverse reactions (i.e. anaphylaxis, hematological reaction) exceeds 2 per 50 participants at any time in either treatment group, or if the difference in incidence of serious adverse events is greater than 50%, the study will be suspended until further review. Unscheduled DSMB meetings will be called whenever severe adverse reactions occur in either treatment group.</p><p id="Par73">Conclusions and recommendations regarding study modifications will be presented to the principal researchers after each DSMB meeting and attention to these recommendations will be reviewed at subsequent meetings. Final decisions to terminate the study will be made by study researchers in consultation with the DMSB and the ethics committee.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par74">Moderate to severe acute post-partum anaemia is associated with a number of short and long-term adverse health outcomes hence active treatment is necessary and is commonly indicated by a combination of haemoglobin and iron deficit and symptom severity. Whilst RBC transfusion is the mainstay treatment for severe symptomatic anaemia, wide practice variations exist in the management of mild-moderate anaemia in otherwise clinically stable women. If over treated with blood products, these women are placed at risk of transfusion related adverse effects, which although uncommon, can be life threatening and are almost always associated with ongoing morbidity.</p><p id="Par75">The argument supporting expectant management for these patients has been well outlined in recent studies though there is no standard definition of what expectant management entails. Some institutes advocate the use of oral iron only whilst others prescribe parenteral replacement. Long term data indicates that parenteral iron is faster and more effective than oral iron at restoring haemoglobin and total body iron deficits and has the added advantage of avoiding gastrointestinal side effects which often interrupt compliance in the post-natal cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Moreover, the lag period to replenish iron stores and induce erythropoeisis is significantly contracted with IV compared to oral therapy. This, coupled with an attractive safety and tolerance profile as well as being cheaper and more available, introduces parenteral iron as an appropriate alternative to blood transfusions in selected women.</p><p id="Par76">If our study hypotheses are true then intravenous iron presents as a safer, sustained and more cost-effective alternative to blood transfusion in the management of hemodynamically stable women with acute post-partum anaemia. Our findings will be particularly useful for patients ineligible for treatment with blood products due to clinical or religious reasons and in under-resourced settings both within Australia and internationally. Ultimately we would hope these findings support the widespread implementation of parenteral iron into routine post-natal practice policies in an effort to improve patient safety and minimise resource wastage.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BP</term><def><p id="Par5">Blood pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRP</term><def><p id="Par6">C-Reactive Protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Hb</term><def><p id="Par7">Haemoglobin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HR</term><def><p id="Par8">Heart rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HRQoL</term><def><p id="Par9">Health related quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IV</term><def><p id="Par10">Intravenous</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PPH</term><def><p id="Par11">Primary post-partum haemorrhage</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RBC</term><def><p id="Par12">Red blood cell</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RR</term><def><p id="Par13">Respiratory rate</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank and acknowledge Karen Bythe for her guidance with statistical analysis and Raj Ramakrishna for his input into study design modifications.
