The aim of this pragmatic randomized clinical trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of single and multiple-surfaces restorations performed following the Atraumatic Restorative Treatment (ART) premises compared with Conventional Treatment (CT) using bulk fill composite restorations in primary and permanent teeth.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>A total of 1,214 5-to-13&#x000a0;year-old children with at least one single or multiple-surface dentin caries lesion in primary or permanent molars will be selected in public schools of Barueri-SP, Brazil. The participants will be randomly assigned into 2 groups: CT (caries removal with bur and restoration performed with Scotchbond&#x02122; Universal Adhesive system associated with Filtek Bulk Fill &#x02013; 3&#x000a0;M/ESPE) and ART (Caries removal with hand instruments and restoration with high viscosity glass ionomer cement Ketac Molar Easy Mix &#x02013; 3&#x000a0;M/ESPE). Ten untrained dentists will perform the treatment in in dental offices located at public schools. The restorations will be evaluated after 6, 12 and 24&#x000a0;months by an independent trained and calibrated examiner. The restoration and tooth survival, the cost-effectiveness analysis between the two groups and the operators&#x02019; preferences regarding the techniques will be also evaluated. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank test will be applied for the restoration and tooth survival. All the average event rates in the two groups will be modelled and compared with a Cox proportional hazard shared frailty model since there is an operator-cluster effect. The significance level for all analyses will be 5&#x000a0;%.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Our hypothesis is that despite similar expected effectiveness between ART using high viscosity GIC and conventional treatment using bulk fill composite resin when treating single or multiple-surface in posterior primary and permanent teeth, ART will present superior cost-effectiveness.

Trough those studies design, a closer representation of the characteristics of the patient and how the intervention will take place in real clinical practice is expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, few pragmatic studies were conducted in dentistry, especially when the primary outcome is the effectiveness of restorative treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>The Atraumatic Restorative Treatment (ART) has been considered an innovative, painless and minimally invasive treatment for the management of caries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Initially, this treatment was recommended to populations in which the technical and operational conditions were unfavourable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, ART has been proven to be a high quality and reliable approach in the management of dental caries, and became, therefore, suitable for all patients, regardless of the economic and social situation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Allied to these indications, the fact anesthesia, rubber dam and rotary instruments are not required, stimulated the ART use in the public and private health systems compared to conventional treatment (CT).</p><p>In order to reduce the clinical time of the conventional restorative procedure, a new concept in composite resins is emerging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The &#x0201c;bulk fill&#x0201d; composite which intended to reduce the polymerization shrinkage stress (main drawback of composite resin), has been gaining strength in the dental market. Thanks to its technical ease of use, since the restorations can be performed by a single increment of resin (up to 4&#x000a0;mm), this material can be an alternative to restorations in public health, in which rarely rubber dam is employed. As the material is inserted in one increment, the time expended to perform the treatment can be shortened, thus reducing the chance of contamination and possibly increasing restoration longevity.</p><p>When it comes to the real applicability of ART compared to CT using composite resin, there is little evidence regarding both the longevity of these restorations and the preference of dentists on the use of each technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Due to the need of establishing the best scientific evidence about restorative treatment, the aim of this pragmatic clinical trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of single and multiple-surface ART-restorations performed compared to the CT in primary and permanent molars.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The present protocol follows the guidelines of the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethical aspects and registration</title><p>This clinical trial was approved by the Local Ethics Committee of Research in Humans (#1.293.897) and registered in the database for registration of clinical studies Clinicaltrials.gov (registration no.

In case of files containing identifiable data, those will be stored in locked filing cabinets and final dataset will be available for inspection under coordinator&#x02019;s endorsement. Thus, there is no Data Monitoring Committee. Only researchers will have access to participants&#x02019; information. Independent surveillance of trial data collection, management and analysis is undertaken by the main investigator (ICO) who has overall responsibility for the study and is in charge of the data. The collected data will be subject to audition by the coordinator; by raising data queries if necessary. This protocol has been peer-reviewed by the funding agency.</p><p>The adverse events related to the CT or ART (groups investigated in this trial) are those related to dental treatment.

This model is an extension of the Cox proportional hazard model that includes a frailty term (a statistical expression for random effect, unrelated to the clinical concept of frailty) to take dependency of events within a contextual (correlation between different falls by the same operator) into account. All participants will be included in the model until their last time point, which means that the model will use all available data right up to the time of withdrawal or trial completion.

The Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the multiple dimensions and how pragmatic the project is regarding all domains: eligibility, recruitment, setting, organization, flexibility delivery and adherence, follow-up, primary outcome and primary analysis.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>PRECIS domains diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12903_2016_260_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p>As a pragmatic study, the conditions reported in this protocol are similar to those in real dental practice and the operators are dentists who work for the public health system. The decision to not perform any training for the operators is to maintain a closer representation of the dentists&#x02019; reality in dental practice, since they have different backgrounds of undergraduate learning. In that way, the operators only will receive one guideline on how to prepare, restore and finalize the restoration according to the original procedures of ART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Regarding the procedures performed in the CT group, as all the dentists are used to do composite resin in their daily clinical practice, they will receive only some information about the manufacturer specifications for using these new materials. Due the evident differences between the techniques and materials used in each group presented in this trial, it is not possible to blind the patients, operators or evaluators.</p><p>Few clinical studies are reported in the literature using a bulk fill composite resin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to use this material also for restoring primary teeth. As this material can be used in a single increment until 4&#x000a0;mm allied to the use of a universal adhesive, which allows the self-etch technique, the clinical time may be shortened, reducing the contamination probability. As no rubber dam is available in public health dental practice in Brazil, the use of these materials could be an answer to improve the conventional treatment longevity.</p><p>In cases where the child has more than one eligible cavity in the same dentition and surface (for example: two single-surface cavities in a primary molar in the same child), only one cavity will be randomly selected. In case of different teeth (permanent and primary) or different surfaces (single or multiple-surface), more than one tooth can be selected for the research, since the analysis of each group will be done separately (for example: one single-surface in a primary molar and one single surface in a permanent molar in the same child). In this case, each tooth will be randomly allocated to the intervention group since the analyses are going to be done separately according to dentition and surface.</p><p>In order to evaluate the preferences of dentists and measure a professional-centered outcome, a questionnaire composed of sixteen items will be applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It aims to evaluate factors influencing dentists&#x02019; preference of amalgam or composite for posterior dental restorations, which can influence the quality of the restorations.</p><p>The growing use of cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) to evaluate the costs and health effects of specific interventions is dominated by studies of prospective new interventions compared to current practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The dental treatments (ART and CT) are daily performed during the normal clinical practice, but maybe with different materials (there is a large range of materials available in Brazilian market). In order to standardize the materials that will be used in this trial, we received a donation from the manufacturer. There is no conflict of interests, and the results will be published in good quality journals.</p><p>The patients of this trial will be children who study in the school where the dental office is located. Even it is not the best pragmatic way to perform the follow-up, the evaluation will be done by a single evaluator, in a school setting, in order to reduce drop-outs during the follow-up. This evaluation system is possible since we can locate the child aided by a national student&#x02019;s data website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Regarding our main outcome, to evaluate the survival rate of the ART and CT restorations, we chose the Roeleveld criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], that allows splitting the evaluations in minor and major failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], therefore the survival of the tooth (in case of primary dentition) can also be calculated. The objective of a restoration is to provide the patient a condition for arresting caries lesion and avoid pulp problems or extractions. For that reason, studies should focus on the survival of the restored teeth and not remain limited to the minor failures of restoration survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>The ART is already well described in the literature, both in primary and permanent teeth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and well accepted by dentist due to its ease of use. In another hand, little is known about bulkfill composite resin, which can also be used as an aesthetic restoration and in one single increment. In that way, this pragmatic study will contribute to improve the knowledge about the ART and CT for restoring single or multiple surface carious lesions in primary and permanent dentition.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Trial status</title><p>This trial is recruiting patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ART, Atraumatic Restorative Treatment; CONSORT, consolidated standards of reporting trials; CT, conventional treatment; DMFT, decayed, missing, filled teeth in permanent teeth; dmft, decayed, missing, filled teeth in primary teeth; GIC, glass ionomer cement; mm, millimeter; PRECIS, Pragmatic-Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary; WHO, World Health Organization</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec20"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12903_2016_260_MOESM1_ESM.doc" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>SPIRIT Checklist.
