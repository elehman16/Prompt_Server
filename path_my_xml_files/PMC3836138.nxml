A few studies are available that have assessed NO production with a biochemical approach. Hiragushi et al. showed that in subjects with type 2 diabetes, urinary NO (UNOx) excretion rates were higher in those with increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) versus those with normal GFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Additional studies suggested that it is the hyperglycemia that drives increased NO production associated with glomerular hyperfiltration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p><p>Using a much more direct way of assessing the functional contribution of NO to renal hemodynamics, Cherney et al.

Exclusion criteria were impaired renal function defined by a serum creatinine &#x0003e;1.3 mg/dL in men and &#x0003e;1.2 mg/dL in women; overt albuminuria &#x0003e;300 mg/day; any other severe renal, hepatic, or cardiovascular disease; current antihypertensive medication or lipid-lowering therapy; insulin therapy; current use of oral contraceptives or estrogen replacement therapy; and active smoking.

The renal NO system may thus be a novel therapeutic target for improving renal hemodynamics.</p><p>Experimental studies have shown that NO is a potent direct vasodilator of afferent and efferent arterioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Further, NO inhibits tubuloglomerular feedback&#x02013;mediated vasoconstriction of afferent arterioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Clearance studies have confirmed that NO is also an important mediator of renal hemodynamics in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that increased NO production could underlie the hyperperfusion state in human subjects with diabetes, as suggested by a number of animal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>In a first study addressing this issue in humans, Cherney et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) analyzed the response of renal hemodynamics to pharmacological NOS inhibition in 37 subjects with type 1 diabetes and in 21 healthy control subjects. For the analysis of the renal response to NOS inhibition, the 37 diabetic subjects were divided into those with glomerular hyperfiltration (GFR &#x0003e;135 mL/min) and those with normal GFR. <sc>l</sc>-NMMA led to a decline of GFR in the hyperfiltering diabetic subjects but neither in the diabetic subjects with normal GFR nor in healthy control subjects. Furthermore, the decline of RPF was exaggerated in the hyperfiltering group versus the other two groups. However, studies in patients with type 2 diabetes, a more heterogeneous group of patients owing to older age and greater number of concomitant cardiovascular risk factors, have been lacking to date.</p><p>In the current study, subjects with type 2 diabetes and increased HbA<sub>1c</sub> concentrations, reflecting poorer glycemic control, were characterized by higher baseline RPF. There was a trend toward lower FF in those with higher HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels (<italic>P</italic> = 0.08). This would be in keeping with experimental data of vasodilation of both afferent and efferent arterioles and would explain why glomerular filtration pressure and thus GFR remained unchanged with higher HbA<sub>1c</sub> values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). This also fits with experimental evidence that NO is a vasodilator of both afferent and efferent arterioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Indeed, as the main result of our study, the reduction of RPF and thus the contribution of NO to renal perfusion was greatest in subjects within the highest tertile of HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels. To confirm the increased functional contribution of NO to renal perfusion as demonstrated by the renal clearance technique, we performed two additional assays of NO production. Increased HbA<sub>1c</sub> was associated with an increase in the ratio of <sc>l</sc>-arginine to ADMA, which has been suggested as a marker of endothelial function and NO production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In addition to increased <sc>l</sc>-arginine/ADMA levels, increased NO activity in subjects with higher HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels was also supported by the finding of increased UNOx, which at least in part depends on renal production of NO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).</p><p>Our results of an increased NO production differ from the result of a reduction in cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels in female subjects with type 1 diabetes upon acute exposure to hyperglycemia during glucose infusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). However, the physiological effects of acutely induced hyperglycemia versus those of chronic hyperglycemia are difficult to compare (e.g., due to differences in acute shear stress). Furthermore, cyclic guanosine monophosphate is stimulated not only by NO but also by other hormones such as the natriuretic peptides. In keeping with our results, and using a similar methodology, the already mentioned study by Cherney et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) also found increased, rather than decreased, NO production associated with increased renal perfusion.</p><p>Of note, we have shown that increased HbA<sub>1c</sub> is related to renal hyperperfusion and increased NO production but not with renal hyperfiltration. &#x0201c;Hyperfilterers&#x0201d; may in fact be a distinct subgroup of subjects, characterized by increased cyclooxygenase contribution to afferent arteriolar tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Thus, the factors that determine renal hyperperfusion appear to differ from those that determine renal hyperfiltration (e.g., NO vs. prostaglandins).</p><p>Our study has several limitations. Since <sc>l</sc>-NMMA is an unselective NOS inhibitor, the precise isoform of NOS responsible for increased NO production in subjects with high HbA<sub>1c</sub> values remains to be identified. Some cell culture and some animal studies suggest that NOS2 (inducible NOS) is upregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), while others suggest that NOS3 (endothelial NOS) is the responsible isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Another limitation is that glycemia in the majority of our patients was rather well controlled, and perhaps even greater differences between groups would have been observed with a larger number of less well-controlled patients included. Further, to avoid confounding effects on renal endothelial function and hemodynamics, we excluded subjects with more severe hypertension (&#x02265;180/110 mmHg), those on antihypertensive or lipid-lowering therapy, and those on insulin treatment. This may have limited generalizability to a larger number of subjects with type 2 diabetes.</p><p>A number of experimental and clinical studies have shown that improved glycemic control ameliorates alterations of renal hemodynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Whether this is related to normalization of renal NO production remains to be investigated in future. Furthermore, additional therapies that target abnormal renal hemodynamics in subjects with type 1 and type 2 diabetes would be welcome in the clinical setting, as strict glycemic control is not always a realistic treatment target in every patient. We have previously shown that antioxidant treatment with folic acid is able to normalize increased NOS dependence of renal vascular tone in subjects with the metabolic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). As an additional treatment option, future studies need to address whether antioxidant treatment can improve renal hemodynamics by normalizing renal NO activity in subjects with diabetes mellitus.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by a grant from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (SFB 423, TP B5).</p><p>No potential conflicts of interest relevant to this article were reported.</p><p>M.P.S. designed the study, researched data, and wrote the manuscript.
