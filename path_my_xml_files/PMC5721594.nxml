The purpose of the trial was to test whether structured personal care, compared to routine care, for patients newly diagnosed with T2DM, reduced the incidence of seven pre-defined outcomes, including all-cause mortality and any diabetes-related outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In 1988, a random sample of two thirds of Danish general practices, excluding singlehanded practices with a doctor aged &#x02265;60&#x000a0;years, received an invitation to participate in the study. Of 1902 general practitioners (GPs), 474 (25.4%) volunteered.

Effect modification was assessed by a test for the interaction between randomization and SES groups in the corresponding model. Clustering with GPs was accounted for by the use of generalized estimating equations. Due to the multiple comparisons the level of statistical significance at 5% is not interpreted rigorously.

This effect was greater among patients living in urban areas compared to rural patients, but otherwise, there was no effect modification of education, employment and civil status on the intervention for the final endpoints. Overall the effect of the intervention on behavioural, biochemical and process-of-care measures was not different between the subgroups of the four aspects of socio-demography.</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p id="Par33">This study reports social inequity in mortality and diabetes-related morbidity, in line with other studies that have investigated the impact of level of education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], occupation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and socio-economic status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The present findings suggest that an intervention with structured personal care does not give rise to more social inequity in use of the health care system, as has been described in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Thus the results do not confirm results from studies of the general population showing that the number of consultations at the GP increases with decreasing socio-economic status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The fact that socio-economic differences in mortality and morbidity persist, despite formally equal access to the public health care system, could be due to different use of specialist care as suggested by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], but this does not seem to be the case for the intervention in our study.</p><p id="Par34">The presented benefit of structured personal care on long-term endpoints, also for patients with low level of education and patients on welfare benefits, cannot be ascribed to single elements of complex interventions. Patients with low level of education and income are frequently reported to be inadequately controlled with hyperglycaemia, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and unhealthy lifestyle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and some studies also suggest socio-demographic differences in prescription rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Our results are in line with earlier studies, concerning socio-demographic differences of intensive multifactorial interventions, which have been shown not to worsen or introduce social inequity in the control of T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Prior studies suggest that interventions seem to be effective, also among patient with low SES, in improving cardiovascular risk factors and prescription of medicine, but it is more difficult to assist patients in changing lifestyle and attitudes towards DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. As a high-risk group patients with low SES have potentially more to win [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], but they are also known to have poor compliance especially regarding lifestyle and attitudes towards DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The individualization of diabetes care in the DCGP trial with negotiation of treatment goals, taking patient resources in consideration may explain why this intervention seems to be effective across the spectrum of SES.</p><p id="Par35">Our results indicate that patients living in rural areas may have less benefit of the intervention compared to urban patients. An explanation for this finding could be because the uptake of the intervention was lower among rural doctors and/or because the compliance with the intervention among rural patients was low. We could not see any systematic differences in the 6&#x000a0;year follow up, on cardiovascular risk factors or behaviour between urban and rural patients that could reconcile these finding (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). However, our data suggest that rural patients are less often treated with cholesterol-lowering drugs as a result of the intervention, but few patients were actually treated with this medication in the middle of the 1990s. Other studies have reported that cholesterol-lowering agents are less often prescribed in deprived areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. A previous Scandinavian study reported no difference in mortality between urban and rural patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], like our study, other studies have suggested that people residing in more rural areas more often have undiagnosed diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. This implies that rural patients may be diagnosed at a later stage of the disease, possibly with a higher risk of complications and maybe less susceptible to treatment interventions than patients living in urban areas, this have to be investigated further.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Strengths and weaknesses of the study</title><p id="Par36">This study contributes to the knowledge on how SES and urbanisation influence the uptake and effect of diabetes interventions and may offer some advantages in comparison to prior studies. It is a strength of the present study that it reports hard endpoints after 19&#x000a0;years of follow up, but on the other hand a limitation that the results are from an early cohort.</p><p id="Par37">Furthermore, the results are likely to be generalizable to the wider population of patients with T2DM because the study was population-based, with no upper age limit, but also because the study was conducted in general practice where most T2DM patients are treated. Also, the elements of the intervention, including the negotiation of treatment goals between patient and doctor, resemble standard treatment procedures in current day general practice diabetes care and recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Finally, the study had a relative high number of GPs participating and the patient attrition rate was low.</p><p id="Par38">The most important limitation of this study is that it is a post hoc analysis of a randomized controlled trial. Since randomization did not take socio-demography into account, this could have created imbalance between the randomization groups in relation to socio-demography, this does not seem to be the case. We although found a minor difference in randomization regarding residence that means one should be cautious when interpreting these results. The fact that we could not describe any substantial difference between rural and urban patients at the 6&#x000a0;years clinical follow up &#x02013; means that the described potential difference in effect has to be investigated further. It is also a limitation that some elements of the intervention in the structured care arm were later applied to the routine care arm through national diabetes guidelines. The intervention could therefore prove to be more efficient than reported.</p><p id="Par39">Information on educational level, employment and civil status were self-reported which might cause misclassification, but on the other hand, this information is readily at hand for the physician. Furthermore, some of the reported socio-demographic differences in mortality and morbidity could be due to patients with low level of education, outside the labour market or living alone being diagnosed later in the natural history of diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and therefore presenting with a more advanced disease at diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Also a higher prevalence of comorbidity among patients with low SES in general could influence the result. We could however only find moderate decline in the association between low socioeconomic status and any diabetes-related endpoint when adjusting for comorbidity and baseline cardiovascular risk factors, which is in accordance with other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Long-term outcomes were registry-based and vital status was confirmed for all study participants. Not all non-fatal outcomes have been tested for validity, but this is generally considered to be acceptable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and differential misclassification according to treatment allocation and socio-demography is not expected.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par40">Structured personal diabetes care showed effect on the aggregate outcome any diabetes-related endpoint, even for the high-risk group of patients with low level of education and patients out of the labour market. Thus, structured personal care did not give rise to <italic>more</italic> health inequality among patients with diabetes but rather a tendency in the opposite direction. Patients living in rural areas, however, seemed to have gained less from the intervention compared to patients living in urban areas this finding has to be investigated further.
