Subjects received oral teriflunomide (70 mg once daily for 5 days followed by 14 mg once daily for 25 days) or placebo for 30 days. Antibody responses were evaluated following rabies vaccination (neoantigen) applied at days 5, 12, and 31 of the treatment period. Occurrence of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) to <italic>Candida albicans, Trichophyton</italic>, and tuberculin (recall antigens) was assessed before and at the end of treatment to investigate cellular memory response. Safety and pharmacokinetics were evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Forty-six randomized subjects were treated (teriflunomide, n = 23; placebo, n = 23) and completed the rabies vaccination. Geometric mean titers for rabies antibodies were lower with teriflunomide at days 31 and 38 than with placebo. However, all subjects achieved sufficient seroprotection following rabies vaccination (titers well above the 0.5 IU/mL threshold).

Although antibody levels for rabies in general were lower over time in the teriflunomide group than in the placebo group, all subjects achieved titers well above the 0.5 IU/mL threshold, defined by the WHO as appropriate seroprotection following rabies vaccination.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>Several neoantigens, such as the Phi-X-174, a virus-like bacteriophage, or the keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) protein, have been used in either healthy subjects or patients to investigate the impact of a disease-modifying therapy (efalizumab,<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> fingolimod,<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> rituximab or methotrexate,<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> or natalizumab<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>) on the immune response. We considered the rabies vaccine a more practical neoantigen for our study because it has a well-defined vaccination schedule, does not contain live virus, requires no extemporaneous preparation to use, and is well-tolerated, even in patients with humoral or cellular deficiency.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Previous studies have also found the rabies vaccine to be a useful tool to investigate the immune response in healthy subjects or patients.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Unlike the Phi-X-174 or KLH neoantigens, the rabies vaccine provides a threshold reference for seroprotection (antibody titer of 0.5 IU/mL<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>), allowing for a biologically relevant evaluation of the effect of teriflunomide on the functional immune response.</p><p>In addition, we assessed in parallel the occurrence of DTH reactions&#x02014;a global measure of cellular memory responses&#x02014;before and at the end of treatment. We found that teriflunomide had no deleterious impact on the cellular responses to a sample of recall antigens (<italic>C albicans</italic>, <italic>Trichophyton</italic>, PPD). These findings supplement those of a previous phase 2 trial (the TERIVA study; NCT01403376) in which patients with relapsing MS receiving teriflunomide mounted effective humoral antibody responses to seasonal influenza vaccination.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Safety data from teriflunomide clinical studies also support this view, since general immune competence did not seem to be significantly altered in phase 3 double-blind treatment periods (as measured by mild decreases in neutrophil and lymphocyte counts that remained within normal range with no associated infection)<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and over long-term extensions with up to 12 years of continuous exposure.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> In addition, several preclinical studies have demonstrated that teriflunomide does not exert cytotoxic effects and preferentially inhibits proliferative activity of strongly stimulated adaptive immune cells, providing further support for the selective impact of this agent on immune responses.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p><p>One potential limitation of our study is the relatively short exposure period (30 days), raising the question of generalizability of our findings to patients with longer-term exposure to teriflunomide in the clinical setting. By using a loading dose, our regimen achieved steady-state teriflunomide plasma concentrations after 5 days, which are comparable to those documented with longer-term teriflunomide 14-mg dosing in patients with MS.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Teriflunomide levels remained stable in our teriflunomide-treated cohort throughout the 25 days of 14-mg dosing, during which time we also observed a mild decrease in neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, similar in magnitude to the mild decreases observed in the clinical setting in patients with MS treated with teriflunomide.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Together, these pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic observations provide some reassurance regarding the generalizability of our findings. Also noteworthy are the previously described clinical observations,<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> including safety profiles related to immune competence, which support the view that longer-term administration of teriflunomide had no cumulative immune suppressive effect. While an immune response to rabies neoantigen does not necessarily indicate response to other antigens, our results are further supported by the TERIVA study results, in which patients continuously treated with teriflunomide for more than 2 years were able to mount effective responses toward multiple influenza vaccine strains.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> To ensure our results are not interpreted beyond the context of these studies, we refer to the teriflunomide prescribing information,<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> which recommends avoiding live vaccines, and note that although no general concern has been identified, vaccination success might be quantitatively and qualitatively affected by teriflunomide.</p><p>Our current study was performed in healthy subjects, not in patients with MS. Based on a lack of information on responses to rabies vaccination in patients with MS and the lack of a clear protective benefit from a rarely encountered infection, we felt that a study in healthy volunteers was more appropriate and the most practical and acceptable option to assess immune responses to rabies vaccination in humans. Nevertheless, patients with MS have been described as having responses to vaccinations that are similar to those observed in healthy subjects, with no obvious deficits in immune responses.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Therefore, our findings are likely to remain relevant to the MS population.</p><p>Since infections may increase the frequency of MS activity<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> and MS relapses associated with infections have been related to more severe long-term neurologic sequelae,<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> establishing safe and effective vaccination practices for patients receiving immune-targeted MS therapies is important. In our cohort of teriflunomide-treated individuals, the rabies vaccination was well-tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with previous studies.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Our findings, supplemented by the TERIVA study,<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> thus support the view that vaccinations with either inactivated neoantigen or recall antigens are effective while taking teriflunomide and that treatment with teriflunomide need not be interrupted if vaccination is deemed appropriate.</p><p>Our findings indicate that teriflunomide does not limit the ability to achieve adequate seroprotection against neoantigen, an indicator of the capacity to mount primary adaptive humoral immune responses, as all subjects achieved titers above the 0.5 IU/mL threshold following rabies vaccination. Furthermore, teriflunomide did not interfere with the cellular response to recall antigens, as demonstrated using DTH with 3 different recall antigens over a 1-month observation period. These results are consistent with the emerging view that teriflunomide selectively modulates immune responses, thereby limiting auto-aggressive immune responses involved in MS disease activity without functionally compromising a broad range of host protective immune responses.</p></sec>
