Baseline assessment takes place before randomisation, with follow up assessments post-intervention and at 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up. Primary outcome is meaning making (PMP, PTGI, SPWB).

Many cancer survivors experience feelings of loneliness and alienation, and have a need for peer support, therefore a group method in particular, can be beneficial for sustaining or enhancing a sense of meaning. If this MCGP-CS is effective for cancer survivors, it can be implemented in the practice of psycho-oncology care.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Netherlands Trial Register, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=3571">NTR3571</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cancer</kwd><kwd>Survivorship</kwd><kwd>Meaning</kwd><kwd>Psycho-oncology</kwd><kwd>Existential distress</kwd><kwd>Group psychotherapy</kwd><kwd>Effectiveness</kwd><kwd>Cost-effectiveness</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>In the past decade, life expectancies of cancer patients have increased significantly. Due to recent innovations in early detection and treatment, many patients have become cancer survivors and the population of cancer survivors is growing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Many cancer patients seem to experience the diagnosis of cancer as a challenge to experiencing life as meaningful, for instance due to shifted priorities in life, or physical hindrances in achieving goals. For some people, the diagnosis of cancer can lead to the experience of life with little or no meaning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Meaning in life is strongly associated to psychological well-being and is liable to alteration after a negative experience like cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Meaning-focused coping may be at the core of adequate adjustment to cancer: cancer patients who experience their life as meaningful are better adjusted, have better quality of life and psychological functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Therefore, a meaning-focused psychological intervention might be beneficial for cancer survivors to increase adequate adjustment to life after cancer and prevent and decrease psychological distress.</p><p>Several interventions for cancer patients focusing at least partly on experiencing meaning in life have been developed and evaluated. The outcomes of several evaluation studies are promising with improved self esteem, optimism, mood, sense of meaning, spiritual well-being and decreased suffering after intervention. These studies are, however, hampered by methodological limitations, like high dropout rates, no control for the effects of attention, insufficient information on the treatment protocol and short periods of follow up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Most of the studied interventions target cancer patients in the palliative phase. None of the described studies assess the cost-effectiveness. To our knowledge there are no randomized controlled trials on meaning-centered psychological interventions targeting cancer survivors.</p><p>In the proposed study, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of a newly developed meaning-centered group psychotherapy for cancer survivors, based on the Meaning-Centered Group Psychotherapy (MCGP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. MCGP, developed by Breitbart and colleagues, is grounded in Frankl&#x02019;s work and was designed to help patients with advanced cancer to sustain or enhance a sense of meaning, peace and purpose in their lives, despite the confrontation with death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Frankl stated that the will to meaning is the primary motivation of humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. He developed a meaning-centered approach in psychotherapy, called <italic>logotherapy</italic>, that focuses on assisting people to detect their individual meaning or purpose in life. A pilot randomized controlled trial showed that MCGP is potentially beneficial for advanced cancer patients for decreasing emotional and spiritual suffering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we adapted MCGP for cancer <italic>survivors</italic> (MCGP-CS). Based on outcome of a focus group study on 23 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and on the input of two psychotherapists with expertise in this specific area, we adjusted the MCGP manual to make it compliant for cancer survivors. Through this focus group study we obtained insight in how survivors experience and talk about meaning in life, and in their perceived need for help with meaning making. In addition, the results indicated that some cancer survivors succeeded in meaning making efforts and experienced sometimes even more meaning in life than before diagnosis, while others struggled with meaning making and expressed an unmet need for help [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In preparation of the randomized controlled trial (RCT) studying effectiveness, the feasibility of the MCGP-CS protocol was tested in a feasibility study among 11 participants, divided over two groups. The outcomes of the feasibility study were positive: patient satisfaction and compliance were high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Based on the results of these studies, the MCGP-CS manual and protocol were finalized. An example of an adjustment to Breitbart&#x02019;s original MCGP for palliative patients addresses attitudinal sources of meaning. In the advanced cancer patient protocol, patients are asked to respond to questions like &#x02018;What would you consider a good or meaningful death?&#x02019; &#x02018;How can you imagine being remembered by your loved ones?&#x02019; In the adjusted protocol for cancer survivors, they are asked to respond to questions like &#x02018;What are limitations in your life at the moment?&#x02019; &#x02018;How can you carry on in life, despite these limitations?&#x02019; &#x02018;What do you want to do <italic>now</italic>, that will make you happy and satisfied when you to die later?&#x02019; Another change that has been made, based on expert advices, is that every experiential exercise starts with a brief meditation exercise, so feelings can be processed at a deeper level.</p><p>The main goal of the present study is to assess effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of MCGP-CS, compared to supportive group psychotherapy (SGP) and to care as usual (CAU) among cancer survivors with psychological or existential distress after treatment and a need for help.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>This study is a prospective randomized controlled trial with three study arms: MCGP-CS, SGP and CAU. Cancer survivors are recruited in two different ways: via several hospitals in the Netherlands (region Leiden and Amsterdam) and via public media (i.e. advertisement on websites of patient societies, and in magazines and local newspapers). All cancer survivors who meet in- and exclusion criteria are asked to participate. Survivors are assigned through cluster randomisation to one of the three study arms. The baseline assessment takes place before randomisation, with follow up assessments one week post-intervention and at 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up. Reasons for dropout are registered. The study protocol, information brochure, questionnaires and informed consent form are approved as a multicenter study by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Leiden University Medical Center.

The main purpose of the MCGP-CS is to sustain or enhance a sense of meaning or purpose in the patient&#x02019;s life, in order to cope better with the consequences of cancer. MCGP-CS is a manualized 8-week intervention that makes us of didactics, group discussion and experiental exercises that focus around themes related to meaning and cancer survivorship. The sessions take two hours each and are held weekly. The participants use a workbook (called <italic>Life lessons portfolio</italic>) and get homework assignments every week. MCGP-CS is led by one psychotherapist with experience in treating patients with cancer. Each session addresses a specific theme that is related to the concepts and sources of meaning. The themes of the sessions are: 1. Concept and sources of meaning, 2. Meaning before and after cancer, 3. The story of our life as a source of meaning: what made us who we are today, 4. The story of our life as a source of meaning: things we have done and want to do in the future, 5. Attitudinal sources of meaning: encountering life&#x02019;s limitations, 6. Creative sources of meaning: responsibility, courage and creativity, 7. Experiental sources of meaning, 8. Termination: presentations of our life lessons and goodbyes.

Results will be reported on an intention-to-treat basis. The Linear Mixed Modeling (LMM) procedure will be used to estimate missing values. This procedure includes incomplete cases in the analysis and employs restricted maximum likelihood estimation to calculate parameter estimates. LMM assumes that missing data are missing at random. LMM will be used to investigate the longitudinal development of meaning making in the three groups. The effect of study condition will be tested using contrasts within the LMM. Mediation analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] will be used to test as whether development in the patients&#x02019; meaning making explains/mediates the expected improvement in psychological functioning in the MCGP condition.</p></sec><sec><title>Economic outcomes</title><p>For the economic evaluation we will make use of the pertinent guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. The societal perspective will be taken encompassing intervention costs, direct non-medical costs and indirect costs. The latter is not expected to be very important in the studied population, which is characterised by unemployment, but the data on production losses will be collected anyway. Production losses will be economically valuated using the friction cost method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Costs and effects will be analysed simultaneously, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) will be calculated and placed within 95% confidence intervals, 2,500 bootstrap replications of the ICERs will be projected on a cost-effectiveness plane, ICER acceptability curves will be plotted against different willingness-to-pay ceilings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], and sensitivity analysis will be conducted as a matter of course focussing on uncertainty in the main cost-drivers. This will be done for the costs per QALY gained in a cost utility analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>This study is conducted in accordance with local laws and regulations. Eligible patients are fully informed about the study and asked to participate. The patients receive a patient information sheet and flyer and they are also informed by telephone about the implications of participation. Patients have ample opportunity to ask questions and to consider the implications of the study before deciding to participate. Patients provide written informed consent, compliant with the local and ethical regulations, before participation. Patients are allowed to withdraw from the study without giving a reason, at any time. The study protocol has been approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The proposed study will assess the effectiveness of MCGP-CS, compared to SGP and to CAU in cancer survivors with psychological or existential distress after treatment. In addition, the cost-effectiveness of MCGP-CS will be determined.</p><p>There is a growing need for psychological interventions that target the issues that cancer survivors are dealing with in the aftermath of their disease. Meaning-focused coping is key to adjustment to life after cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Many cancer survivors experience feelings of loneliness and alienation, and have a need for peer support, therefore a group method in particular, can be beneficial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Group interventions may provide opportunities to cope with these problems. People who benefit from group interventions feel more comforted, less alone and have learned different ways to cope with their situation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p><p>To our knowledge there are no RCT&#x02019;s that evaluate the effectiveness of meaning-centered psychotherapy for cancer survivors. Also, there is little known about who benefits from these types of interventions. Also, there is little known on who benefits from these types of interventions. We want to conduct an RCT that compares MCGP-CS with a SGP that focuses on other issues that cancer survivors deal with (see Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). This way, we hope to establish whether a meaning-centered approach is more effective compared to care as usual, than a non-meaning-centered approach. Secondary analyses will be conducted to assess the predictors of effectiveness on an individual level, in order to gain more knowledge on which people benefit the most from the meaning-centered intervention.</p><p>To our knowledge, there are no cost evaluations of meaning-centered interventions. Since the number of cancer survivors is increasing rapidly, cost efficient psychological care is, from an economic point of view, important to warrant the feasibility of implementation in mental health care settings.</p><p>This study evaluates if MCGP-CS is effective for cancer survivors and if so, whether this is a cost efficient method. If this MCGP-CS is effective for cancer survivors, it can be implemented in the practice of psycho-oncology care. The broad collaboration in this project with several hospitals and psycho-oncology organisations, facilitates possible implementation in practice after this evaluation. There are few evidence based group intervention manuals available for cancer patients. For meaning-centered group psychotherapy for cancer survivors, there are no evidence based intervention manuals yet. Therefore, if the results of this RCT are positive on effectiveness measures, the intervention protocol can be an important addition to the advancement of evidence based psychological care for cancer patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>NvdS, WB, JV, KK, VW, CvA, RT, PC and IV contributed to the design of the study.
