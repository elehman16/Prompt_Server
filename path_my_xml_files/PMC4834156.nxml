Introduction</title><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic lung disease that results in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is characterized by chronic inflammation of the airways and airflow obstruction. The mechanisms underlying COPD progression are complex and involve inflammatory and immune responses. Inflammatory cells, predominantly CD8-positive T cells, neutrophils, and macrophages, are the predominant mediators of inflammation in COPD patients. Neutrophils in particular are considered to play an active role in disease progression. Recently, both animal and clinical studies have demonstrated that IL-17 and IL-23 are closely associated with COPD development and progression [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. One study demonstrated that the number of IL-23 positive immune cells was higher in the epithelium of severe COPD patients compared to control nonsmokers [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Additionally, IL-17A and IL-17F may recruit neutrophils indirectly and play an important role in chronic pulmonary inflammation [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>With the extensive therapeutic use of corticosteroids in patients with COPD, tolerance has become more common; therefore, alternative anti-inflammatory approaches are needed [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Since erythromycin was successfully utilized as a therapy for diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB) in the late 1980s, the application of long-term erythromycin to the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases has received increased attention worldwide and has shown positively curative effects. There have been many studies investigating the application of erythromycin to COPD therapy, indicating effects on prevention of disease exacerbation, antimicrobial activity, and the health status of COPD patients [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In the 2015 American College of Chest Physicians and Canadian Thoracic Society Guideline for the prevention of acute exacerbations of COPD, the use of a long-term macrolide to prevent acute exacerbations was suggested for patients with moderate to severe COPD, who have a history of one or more moderate to severe exacerbations in the previous year despite using an optimal maintenance inhaler [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects were unclear. Long-term and low-dose treatment with macrolides was widely used to treat chronic inflammatory lung diseases. The mechanisms underlying the effectiveness included inhibition of neutrophil activation and chemotaxis, which accelerated apoptosis and the elimination of neutrophils, improved phagocytosis by macrophages, and downregulation of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, and TNF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>) [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In a previous study involving a rat model of COPD, our group showed that erythromycin decreased the number of neutrophils and the concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These results indicated that erythromycin might have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities in addition to antibacterial functions. However, few studies have investigated the effects of low-dose and long-term treatment with erythromycin on IL-17 and IL-23 mediated airway inflammation in COPD patients. In order to further explore the effects of erythromycin on IL-17 and IL-23 mediated airway inflammation in COPD patients, stable COPD outpatients (GOLD II&#x02013;IV) were treated with a low oral dose of erythromycin for 6 and 12 months and the effects of treatment on inflammatory cells, IL-17, and IL-23 concentrations in induced sputum and peripheral blood and pulmonary function measured. We expected that this in-depth study could provide new ideas for the prevention and control of COPD.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Study Design</title><p>After recruitment and screening, a total of 54 eligible patients with stable COPD were randomly divided into an erythromycin group (<italic>N</italic> = 36) and a control group (<italic>N</italic> = 18). The erythromycin group was subdivided into group A (<italic>N</italic> = 18, treated with 125&#x02009;mg of oral erythromycin 3 times a day for 12 months) and group B (<italic>N</italic> = 18, treated with 125&#x02009;mg of oral erythromycin 3 times a day for 6 months followed by 6 months of follow-up). The numbers of inflammatory cells in induced sputum, results of spirometry tests, and the inflammatory indices were recorded at baseline and after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. All the indices were compared between groups and an intragroup comparison was performed. The original treatment was the same for patients in each group and included supplemental oxygen, treatment with theophylline, and treatment with inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids. Other macrolides, histamine antagonists, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and oral glucocorticoid treatment were not allowed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2.

Processing of Sputum Samples</title><p>Sputum was induced with inhalation of 3% hypertonic saline. The procedure was performed according to standard techniques described previously [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The induced sputum was collected in sterile test tubes and the volume was measured. An equal amount of 0.1% DTT was added to the collected sputum. The mixture was then placed in a 37&#x000b0;C water bath for 20 minutes and stirred once every 5 minutes for dissolution. An aliquot of the sputum was spread over a cell count board and the total cell count measured. The remaining fraction was centrifuged at 2000&#x02009;&#x000d7;g for 10 minutes and the supernatant was collected in Eppendorf tubes and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C for subsequent analysis. The cell layer was then mixed and spread over glass slides for Giemsa staining. Cell counts and classification were performed using a high-power microscope. In order to perform counting and classification, at least 200 inflammatory cells and the presence of &#x02264;80% squamous cells were required or the protocol was repeated.

Statistical Analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 16.0). The data for continuous variables were expressed as the mean and standard deviation, and the data were summarized as numbers (percentages). A <italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c; .05 was considered statistically significant. Serial examination of sputum inflammatory cells (total cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) was performed, and the concentrations of inflammatory markers (IL-17 and IL-23) in peripheral blood and sputum over the 12-month period were compared using a four-way repeated-measures variance of general linear model analysis using the number of visits as the repeated measurement and the numbers of inflammatory cells or inflammatory markers as the dependent variable. If Mauchly's test of sphericity was dissatisfied, epsilon correction coefficient was needed or conducted by multivariate variance analysis. Within-subject factor comparisons were performed using repeated-measures ANOVA. Post hoc tests utilizing the Bonferroni correction were conducted whenever the results of the repeated-measures variance analysis indicated statistical significance. The correlations between inflammatory cytokines including IL-17 and IL-23 in both induced sputum and serum and sputum inflammatory cell ratios including neutrophil and macrophage ratios were analyzed using Pearson's Correlation. Baseline parameters were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance or the Friedman tests based on the type of data and homogeneity of variance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>3.

Discussion and Conclusion</title><p>This randomized controlled study is the first to investigate the effects of low-dose and long-term treatment with erythromycin on the cytokines IL-17 and IL-23 in peripheral blood and induced sputum from patients with COPD. We found that erythromycin had a beneficial effect on pulmonary inflammation in patients with COPD. We observed a significant reduction in the total number of cells, neutrophil counts, and neutrophil ratio in induced sputum from COPD patients after commencement of erythromycin treatment. Previous work has shown a decrease in the neutrophil counts following macrolide treatment in patients with other chronic airway diseases such as DPB [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and asthma [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In a study by Basyigit et al., significant decreases in the total cell count in induced sputum and in the levels of IL-8 and TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> in patients (all male) with mild to moderate COPD were observed after 14 days of treatment with clarithromycin [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The current study demonstrates that macrolides enhance the ability of systemic macrophages to clear apoptotic bronchial epithelial cells [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Hodge et al. previously showed that azithromycin was able to improve the ability of alveolar macrophages to phagocytose apoptotic cells. This demonstrates that azithromycin may reverse the reduced ability of alveolar macrophages and monocyte-derived macrophages to clear bacteria and necrotic cellular debris, which can contribute to inflammation and secondary necrosis [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Although we did not observe an increase in the number of macrophages in induced sputum after treatment with erythromycin, a significant increase in the sputum macrophage ratio was observed. The results of our study are similar to those of previous studies described above. Erythromycin treatment may reduce the number of neutrophils in induced sputum by promoting phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. Despite their anti-inflammatory activities, macrolides may also play an important role in modulating immune activity.</p><p>Blasi et al. found that treatment with azithromycin for 6 months resulted in a decrease in the levels of IL-6 and TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> in patients with COPD [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Similar results were also observed in a study by Basyigit et al. [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In our study, decreases in the concentrations of IL-17 and IL-23 in induced sputum and peripheral blood were observed following erythromycin treatment in patients with COPD. We considered that inhibition of IL-17 and IL-23 could be one of the mechanisms by which erythromycin may reduce airway inflammation in patients with COPD. The nature of the immune reaction in COPD indicates that IL-17 and related cytokines may contribute to disorders of immunity [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. IL-17 has been closely associated with a subject of T helper cells such as Th17 cells, gamma-delta (<italic>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;</italic>) T cells, natural killer (NK) T cells [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and neutrophils that have also been shown to produce IL-17A in the lung [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In our study, positive correlations were observed between IL-17 and IL-23 in both induced sputum and serum and the neutrophil ratio, while negative correlations were found between IL-17 and IL-23 in both sputum and serum and sputum macrophage ratio. This demonstrates that the decrease in IL-17 and IL-23 levels might be closely related to the reduction in neutrophil accumulation and improvement of phagocytic function of macrophages. However, the concentrations of IL-17 and IL-23 in the induced sputum showed no significant decrease after 3 months of erythromycin treatment in patients with COPD compared to placebo-treated group, while a decrease in the total cell number, neutrophil counts, and concentration of IL-17 in serum was observed after 3 months of treatment. Thus, more meaningful inflammatory indices showed a distinct decrease after 6 months of treatment compared to 3 months.</p><p>The results indicate that at least 6 months of maintenance therapy with low-dose erythromycin was required to achieve an appropriate therapeutic effect on airway inflammation. However, additional studies must be performed to confirm these findings. We also found that once erythromycin was discontinued, inflammatory markers increased back to baseline. This finding was similar to the study by Blasi et al. They observed a decrease in the concentrations of TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> and IL-6 in EBC after 6 months of treatment in COPD patients with azithromycin; however, the concentrations then increased back to baseline once azithromycin treatment was discontinued [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. We also found that the reduction in inflammatory markers was more significant after 12 months of erythromycin treatment compared to 6 and that the levels of these related indices remained relatively stable. The results indicate that treatment of COPD patients with a low-dose of erythromycin is a long-term process.</p><p>COPD is a disease that is characterized by chronic pulmonary inflammation; therefore, anti-inflammation therapy should be administered as long as the inflammation persists. Low-dose erythromycin treatment in patients with stable COPD for 12 months may be more effective than treatment for 6 months. Interestingly, studies that have investigated treatment with macrolides in patients with COPD have produced inconsistent results. In a study by Banerjee et al., no significant effects on the total cell count in sputum, neutrophil count, IL-8, leukotriene B4, TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> levels, or neutrophil elastase were observed in patients with COPD after 3 months of treatment with clarithromycin [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, clarithromycin did cause a small decrease in the neutrophil differential.</p><p>Seemungal et al. also observed no significant differences between the macrolide and placebo arms of the study in measurements including stable FEV1, IL-6 in sputum, IL-8, myeloperoxidase, bacterial flora, or C-reactive protein in serum after treatment with erythromycin for 12 months in COPD patients [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Additionally, Fujii et al. and Basyigit et al. showed that treatment with macrolides resulted in a significant decrease in the number of inflammatory cells in sputum and in preinflammatory cytokines in induced sputum, which was consistent with previous studies [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Reasons for the inconsistent results regarding the effect of macrolide treatment in chronic inflammatory diseases may be complicated. We hypothesize that differences in the type of macrolide, dosage, and method of administration could explain the differences in the results.</p><p>The clinical effects of long-term and low-dose macrolide treatment on patients with DPB have been validated. In 1987, an open trial of low-dose, long-term erythromycin therapy with a 4-year follow-up period was reported. Kudoh et al. showed that treatment with 600&#x02009;mg of erythromycin for a period of 6 months to 3 years resulted in a significant decrease in the FEV1 [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, the results regarding the effects of macrolides on pulmonary function (i.e., FEV1) were inconsistent. Some studies have reported no improvement in pulmonary function in patients with chronic lung diseases after treatment with macrolides [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In our study, we found no significant differences in pulmonary function parameters including FEV1, FVC, IC, and FEV1 (% predicted) between the 3 groups over the 12-month period. We could not confirm whether erythromycin is able to improve pulmonary function in patients with COPD. However, we did observe a significant increase in the 6MWD after treatment with erythromycin and this effect persisted even after treatment was discontinued. This data may indicate that erythromycin treatment administered at a low-dose and long-term may improve the exercise capacity of COPD patients to a certain extent. It is worth noting that though long-term macrolide therapy is generally safe, there are associated adverse effects such as gastrointestinal complaints, hearing decrement, and left heart failure [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], which must be carefully considered despite the low incidence. Cautions should be recommended before initiation of long-term macrolide therapy, and regular monitoring of liver function, electrocardiogram indices, and heart function is needed during the treatment period. The effect of long-term macrolide resistance therapy patterns should also be considered.</p><p>Our study had a few limitations. The sample size was small and the 12-month treatment duration may not have been sufficient to assess pulmonary function completely. Clinical studies with larger patient cohorts and longer durations are therefore necessary to determine whether our findings can be replicated.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates that erythromycin treatment in patients with COPD has beneficial effects. This includes an improvement in airway inflammation, which may involve inhibition of the release of inflammatory cytokines IL-17 and IL-23. A decrease in the levels of these cytokines might be closely related to the reduction in neutrophil accumulation and improvement of phagocytic function of macrophages. Additionally, erythromycin treatment may also improve the exercise capacity of patients with COPD. Finally, treatment with erythromycin for 12 months may be more effective than treatment for 6 months. However, the optimum time for treatment with erythromycin in COPD patients is still not clear. Additional studies are required to further investigate the mechanisms of action of erythromycin, optimum dose, appropriate duration of treatment, and side effects in patients with COPD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The present authors would like to thank Guorong Liang (Department of Lung Function, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University) for his professional and excellent lung function testing assistance.
