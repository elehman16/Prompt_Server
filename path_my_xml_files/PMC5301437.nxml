One major cause of hospital readmission is dysfunctions in integrated pathways between community and hospital care that can cause adverse drug events (ADE). An ADE is generally defined as a side effect (anticipated or unanticipated) of an administered medication; it may be due to an adverse drug reaction or a medication error [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Furthermore, the French ENEIS 2 study showed that 1.3% of hospital stays originated from serious ADE in 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Data from the literature show that older patients and children are at high risk of medication errors specifically at hospital admission and discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>In accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) ("Assuring medication accuracy at transitions in care&#x0201d;) and French health authorities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], developing programs on the securing patients&#x02019; medications is crucial through the course of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Indeed, transitions between community and hospital settings are at the highest risk of medication errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>In this context, the pharmacist-led medication review may appear to be a way to improve patient safety. The medication review is a structured, critical examination of a patient&#x02019;s medicines; the objective is to reach agreement with the patient regarding treatment to optimize the impact of medicines, minimize the number of medication-related problems and reduce waste [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. When performed by pharmacists, this is called a pharmacist-led medication review.</p><p>The pharmacist-led medication review has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy to reduce medication discrepancies at admission and discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, it is difficult to assess the real impact of the pharmacist-led medication review in specific high-risk populations, such as pediatric and geriatric populations.</p><p>Meta-analysis shows that pharmacist-led medication reviews have brought substantial reductions in the rate of readmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This endpoint is important because the pharmacist aims to improve reductions in medication errors as well as the transmission of information to the interfaces of the care system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, the studies included have certain limitations: (1) a low level of evidence, (2) the heterogeneity of experimental intervention (medication reconciliation associated or not with treatment review or medication service liaison) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], (3) a different delay and different modalities in the endpoint assessment and (4) only one randomized controlled trial (RCT) performed in a pediatric population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>In such a context, it is important to demonstrate the effectiveness of a pharmacist-led medication review in high-risk populations (geriatrics and pediatrics) using a high level of evidence based on a large randomized controlled clinical trial. In our study, we hypothesized that this pharmacist-led medication review&#x02014;which consists of (1) preventing medication errors at transitions (admission or discharge) through medication reconciliation, (2) analyzing and revising treatment, (3) informing and educating patients and (4) coordinating health professionals&#x02014;may decrease hospital readmissions.</p><p>The primary objective of this study is to assess the impact of the pharmacist-led medication review on the rate of all-cause hospital readmissions and/or all-cause death at 30 days following initial hospitalization discharge. The secondary objectives are to assess the impact of the pharmacists-led medication review on the rate of all-cause readmission in care units, the rate of emergency department visits, the rate of mortality, the number of consultations post-discharge and patient treatment satisfaction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>This is a prospective, randomized, controlled and open-label study comparing two patient care strategies: (1) the experimental group, receiving a pharmacist-led medication review; (2) the control group, receiving typical care.

Data from several sources should be gathered; previous medical and pharmaceutical records before admission or information from the patient him- or herself and/or the family or caregivers, the community pharmacist and physician should be gathered by phone. First, the pharmacist or a pharmacy resident interviews the patient, and then the interview is conducted with the community pharmacist. If there are insufficient data, the pharmacist should call the general practitioner or the specialist. Based on these data, it is possible to formalize the complete list of medications taken by the patient before hospitalization. Then, the list is compared to the admission prescription. Differences from the admission prescription are discussed between the hospital pharmacist and hospital physician.

The methodology is based on the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials Statement (CONSORT, http:// <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.consort-statement.org/consort-statement/">www.consort-statement.org/consort-statement/</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>The full analysis population (including all subjects who will be randomized and at least evaluated at the baseline) will be used in the primary analysis, and the per protocol population (including all subjects who will be randomized and will not have major protocol deviations) will be used in the secondary analysis to assess the robustness of the results. No interim analysis is planned. Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized for the two groups (&#x02018;standard&#x02019; and &#x02018;experimental&#x02019; groups). Missing data will not be replaced.</p><p>Primary endpoint. The proportions of readmission and/or death at day 30 will be compared between the two groups (chi<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test). Proportions will be presented with 95% confidence intervals. Logistic regression will be performed to adjust potential confounding factors; variables relevant to the models will be selected based on their clinical interest and/or a threshold <italic>p</italic>-value&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.1 during univariate analysis. The center will be automatically entered into the model. The final models expressed the odd ratios and their 95% confidence intervals. The unadjusted analysis will be the primary analysis, and the adjusted analysis will be the complementary analysis.</p><p>Secondary endpoints. Qualitative variables will be compared between the two groups using the same procedure. The number of consultations and satisfaction scores will be compared between the two groups using Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test or Mann-Whitney test. Multivariate approaches (logistic or linear regressions) will be performed using the same procedure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Data management and data quality</title><p>Quality assurance and control, under the responsibility of the promoter, will be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (decisions of 24 November 2006) to guarantee the integrity of the data collected and the protection of patients as well as to respect the protocol and legislation throughout the entire period of patient inclusion and follow-up by a clinical researcher mandated by the sponsor.</p><p>The nature and frequency of monitoring are established according to the definition of the level of monitoring according to the patient's risk and will depend on the number of patients included, the rhythm of the inclusions and the difficulties observed during the study (procedures validated by the Quality Working Group of the FHF Promotion, which determines the level of monitoring to be carried out according to the risk for the subject) (OECD Recommendation on the Governance of Clinical Trials, December 2012).</p><p>In this test, the level of monitoring is classified as "minimal" with a patient risk of type A. This will be to verify the consents. If one or more consents are not compliant, files will be monitored randomly.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Ethical aspects, laws and regulations</title><p>This study is sponsored by the French Ministry of Health (PREPS 2014 no. 14&#x02013;0330). The Assistance Publique-H&#x000f4;pitaux de Marseille is the promoter and is in charge of all the administrative measures. As required by French law, all patients or their relatives will provide written informed consent to participate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The French committees for data handling (CIL) approved the study. The study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov since March 2016 under the number NCT02734017.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the effectiveness of pharmacist-led medication reviews in two extreme populations at high risk of medication errors, i.e., pediatric and geriatric populations. Moreover, the impact of pharmacist-led medication reviews on all-cause readmissions is not clear, and to our knowledge, there are no randomized controlled trials involving a large number of subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>In our study, we will evaluate patient satisfaction with their drug treatments. We hypothesize that a patient with a more precise explanation of his or her treatment will be more satisfied. Satisfaction being correlated with adherence, we believe this may decrease ADE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>We will use a randomized, open-label, controlled design, which is the most appropriate design to demonstrate the efficacy of pharmacist-led medication reviews in accordance with an Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group.</p><p>However, some issues related to the content of the protocol study should be discussed.</p><p>The open procedure is justified because the nature of intervention meant that personnel and participants could not be blinded. Indeed, the patients and the pharmacist are players in the intervention effect.</p><p>A cluster design should be proposed. Indeed, the experimental program is applied to the whole center and may affect all the individuals within it. To conform to the intervention application and to avoid contamination within the unit, cluster randomization may be advocated. However, this design requires the inclusion of several centers, and we have chosen to restrict the number of centers; we consider it easier to implement the experimentation in adherent centers, where the pharmacist teams and medical teams are working together, the best guarantee of the feasibility of the study. This risks minimizing the experimentation effect. Moreover, it is possible that our trial has less power because the pharmacist intervenes in both groups. However, it is not possible that the pharmacist does not intervene in the controlled group as required by law. Our tests therefore evaluate additional activities that have not yet shown their superiority.</p><p>The outcomes will be collected during a telephone follow-up 30 days after hospital discharge. We will call patients in the case of a patient who is older than 65 years, parents in the case of a minor patient or caregivers in the case of an elderly patient who is not able to consent. Moreover, if the patient reports a hospitalization or a visit to the emergency department during the 30 days post-discharge, a verification will be made by telephone call in the care unit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Trials status</title><p>At the time of manuscript submission (April 2016), the status of the trial is &#x0201c;open for participant recruitment.&#x0201d;</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec26"><title>Additional file</title><p>
