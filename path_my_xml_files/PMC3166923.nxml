Although this condition is highly prevalent, it is still extremely difficult to treat. Two potentially useful treatments for patients with chronic low back pain are called the <italic>McKenzie </italic>and <italic>Back School </italic>treatment programs. These programs have good biological plausibility, are widely available and have a modest cost. Although these treatments are already available for patients, the evidence that supports their use is largely based on low quality methodological studies. Therefore, a high-quality randomised controlled trial is required to compare, for the first time, the effectiveness of these treatments in patients with chronic low back pain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>One hundred and forty-eight patients will be randomly allocated to a four-week treatment program based upon the <italic>McKenzie </italic>or <italic>Back School </italic>principles. Clinical outcomes (pain intensity, disability, quality of life, and trunk flexion range of motion) will be obtained at follow-up appointments at 1, 3 and 6 months after randomisation. The data will be collected by an assessor who will be blinded to the group allocation.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This will be the first study aimed to compare the <italic>McKenzie </italic>and <italic>Back School </italic>approaches in patients with chronic low back pain.

Prevalence estimates of low back pain vary considerably depending on the population being studied as well as with regards to the definition of a low back pain episode. The only systematic review on this topic estimated that the point prevalence of low back pain ranges from 12 to 33%, the one-year prevalence of low back pain ranges from 22 to 65%, and the lifetime prevalence of low back pain ranges from 11 to 84%[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Given the high prevalence of this condition, low back pain is considered to be an important public health problem in many countries, including the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and European countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The direct and indirect costs that are associated with low back pain are immense; for example, the costs associated with low back pain in Australia are more than 1 billion Australian dollars, while in the United States of America, the annual costs associated with low back pain were estimated in 50 billion American dollars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Regardless of the observed differences in the costs to health systems in different countries, there is no doubt that low back pain represents an important economic problem worldwide.</p><p>Estimates of the prognosis of chronic low back pain are based on a limited number of studies. The largest prospective inception cohort that investigated the prognosis of chronic low back pain was conducted in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This study followed 406 patients with a recent episode of chronic low back pain for 12 months and observed that 35% of the patients completely recovered by 9 months and that only 41% recovered by 12 months. Clearly, the probability of recovery is considerably lower for chronic patients compared to patients with acute low back pain, making it necessary to develop better treatments for patients with chronic low back pain.</p><p>A range of therapeutic possibilities are available for patients with chronic low back pain. These treatments include educational programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], cognitive behavioural therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], electrotherapy and thermotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], manual therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The majority of these treatments are recommended by the <italic>European Guidelines for the Management of Chronic Low Back Pain</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], where the options considered to have the most benefit for patients are exercise combined with education programs and exercise programs that follow cognitive behavioural therapy principles. There is no evidence that suggests that any other type of treatment is better than programs that use exercise as the basis for the treatment of low back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, the literature is not clear with regards to which exercise programs are most effective for patients with chronic low back pain; therefore, better randomised controlled trials are necessary to clarify these questions. This need is emphasised by the <italic>European Guidelines</italic>, which suggest "that the effectiveness of specific exercise programs needs to be evaluated, specially programs that are commonly utilised but which have been inadequately researched (p. S196)"[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>Back School </italic>(a group-based treatment approach) and the <italic>McKenzie </italic>(an individually-based treatment approach) methods are promising therapeutic options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] that use exercise for the treatment of low back pain in addition to delivering theoretical information in order to educate patients about their condition, so that patients are better able to understand their condition and how to change their behaviour towards an episode of low back pain.</p><p>The <italic>Back School </italic>method was developed in 1969 in Sweden by Mariane Zachrisson Forssel, with the goal of preventing and avoiding recurrent episodes of low back pain. The program is composed of 4 sessions lasting approximately 45 minutes, being each session organised by theoretical components, which include: anatomy and spinal biomechanics; epidemiology; physiopathology of the most frequent back disorders; posture; ergonomics; common treatment modalities and a practical component (exercises for the maintenance of a "healthy back")[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>In 1981, Robin McKenzie proposed a classification system and individualised treatment regimen for low back pain called "diagnostic and mechanical therapy" or, simply, the <italic>McKenzie</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] method. The <italic>McKenzie </italic>method consists of three steps: evaluation, treatment, and prevention. The evaluation step is conducted using repeated movements and sustained positions where the symptoms in the lower back and lower limbs are classified into three subgroups: 1) derangement syndrome, 2) dysfunction syndrome, and 3) posture syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The choice of appropriate exercises in the <italic>McKenzie </italic>method is based upon the direction (flexion, extension, or lateral shift of the spine) that can lead to the following possible responses: pain reduction, "centralisation of symptoms" (i.e., symptoms migrating towards the middle line of the body), and the complete recovery of pain. The prevention step consists of educating and encouraging the patient to exercise regularly and self-care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Although both methods have been previously investigated, there have been criticisms regarding the methodological quality of these popular treatment programs for patients with chronic low back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Examples of these problems are: 1) lack of assessor blinding 2) small sample sizes, 3) inappropriate statistical analysis, 4) problems with the random allocation of participants, and 5) loss of follow up greater than 15%. The occurrence of one or more of the problems mentioned above introduces bias that compromises the internal and external validity of the study. Moreover, no study has directly compared the results of each technique on this condition. Therefore, the objective of this study is to compare, for the first time, the effects of the <italic>McKenzie </italic>and <italic>Back School </italic>techniques in patients with chronic low back pain. Our goal is to conduct a robust, randomised controlled trial from both a methodological point of view as well as in terms of generalizability.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Approval and registration of the study</title><p>The study commenced recruitment in May 2011 at the outpatient Physiotherapy Clinic of the Universidade Cidade de S&#x000e3;o Paulo (UNICID), in S&#x000e3;o Paulo/Brazil. The study design, procedures and informed consent were approved by the Ethics Committee in Research of UNICID (research protocol number 1349394) and was prospectively registered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] in the <italic>Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry </italic>(registration number ACTRN12610000435088).</p></sec><sec><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>We will recruit patients presenting with low back pain for at least three months and aged between 18 and 80 years. Participants with any contraindication to physical exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] will be excluded from the study based on the guidelines of the <italic>American College of Sports Medicine</italic>. Patients with serious spinal pathology (including fractures, tumours, and inflammatory diseases), nerve root compromise, cardio respiratory illnesses, and pregnancy will be also excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedures</title><p>Potential participants in the study will be welcomed by the study assessor who will determine which patients will or will not participate in the study, in accordance with the previously described eligibility criteria. The patients will receive information about the study and the criteria for study eligibility. If the patient is considered eligible, the assessor will collect the baseline data prior to randomisation. The assessor will be blinded with regards to the allocation of patients into the treatment groups. The primary outcomes of our study are pain intensity and disability at 4-weeks after randomisation. The secondary outcomes are range of motion of trunk flexion at 4-weeks, pain intensity and disability in evaluations at 3 and 6 months after randomisation, and quality of life in the evaluations at 4 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after randomisation. The study assessor will be unaware of the treatment that the patients received. Given the nature of the study, it will not be possible for the therapist or the patients to be blinded, which is expected in studies that compare the effectiveness of complex interventions such as exercise therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation procedures</title><p>Immediately after the baseline evaluation, patients will be sent to the physiotherapist responsible for the interventions. Before initiating the treatment, the patients will be randomly allocated into the two treatment arms <italic>(Back School </italic>or <italic>McKenzie</italic>) through a computer-generated randomisation schedule that was performed by one of the investigators who is not involved in the recruitment or treatment of the patients. The allocation of subjects will be concealed by using consecutive numbered, sealed and opaque envelopes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Before initiating the intervention, the therapist responsible for the treatment will open the envelope in front of the patient and will inform the patient of the treatment technique corresponding to the number on his/her envelope.

A detailed description of each of these instruments is described as it follows.</p><sec><title>Pain Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)</title><p>The <italic>Pain Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) </italic>measures the levels of pain intensity perceived by the patient using an 11-point scale that ranges from 0 to 10, where 0 is classified as "no pain" and 10 is classified as "worst possible pain"[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The participants will be asked to rate their levels of pain intensity based upon the last 7 days. This outcome will be measured in all time-points (i.e., baseline, 4 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after randomisation).</p></sec><sec><title>Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire</title><p>The <italic>Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire </italic>is an instrument that is widely used in research and clinical practice for the measurement of disability associated with low back pain and has been translated, cross-culturally adapted and clinimetrically tested for the Brazilian population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. It is composed by 24 items that describe daily situations that patients may have difficulty to perform because of their low back pain problem. The greater the number of items selected, the greater the disability. Participants will be asked to indicate the items that describe them on the day of the assessment. This outcome will be measured in all time-points (i.e., baseline, 4 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after randomisation).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Fleximeter</title><p>The Fleximeter (<italic>Fleximeter<sup>&#x000a9;</sup></italic>) is a measurement tool used for measuring flexibility and range of motion through an angular scale based on the mechanism of gravitational action. As it is an instrument that does not have articular vertices, but rather has a velcro that is placed at the articulation of interest which allows a number of diverse joint movements to be isolated, guaranteeing a measurement precision. The range of back flexion movement will be measured with the patient in orthostatic position with their knees extended and arms crossed across the thorax. The fleximeter will be positioned laterally in the thoracic region at breast height with the subject facing the assessor. The patient will be asked to bend his/her trunk to the maximum range possible. For logistical reasons (given a larger potential for missing data compared with the self-report outcome measures that can be measured over the phone, email or letter), we will measure ROM only at the baseline and at the 4 weeks follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>WHOQOL-Bref Questionnaire</title><p>The <italic>WHOQOL-Bref </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] quality of life questionnaire corresponds to a short version of the WHOQOL-100 that maintains the original clinimetric characteristics and is adapted for the Brazilian-Portuguese language. The <italic>WHOQOL-Bref </italic>is composed of 26 questions: two general quality of life questions, and 24 questions that represent each of the domains that the original instrument contains. It evaluates four quality of life factors: physical, psychological, social and environmental. Participants will be asked to respond to the questions with regards to the last 2 weeks. This outcome will be measured in all time-points (i.e., baseline, 4 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after randomisation).</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>As the <italic>Back School </italic>method requires four treatment sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], the same number of sessions will be used for the <italic>McKenzie </italic>method group in order to standardise the total treatment time for both groups.
