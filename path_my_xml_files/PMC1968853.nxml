Their limiting toxicity is delayed myelosuppression. A prospective, randomised crossover study of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) was performed in patients receiving BCNU for relapsed glioblastoma, to investigate whether the resulting haematological toxicity profile could be modified by rhGM-CSF. Adequate data for analysis were obtained in 13 patients. Following BCNU, the nadir neutrophil count was higher in 12 out of 13 patients during the rhGM-CSF-protected cycles compared with the unprotected cycles. The median nadir was also significantly higher (1.79, CI 0.76-3.52, P &#x0003c; 0.005). Five episodes of neutropenia (&#x0003c; 2 x 10(9) l-1) occurred during the unprotected cycles compared with none in the rhGM-CSF-protected cycles (P = 0.076). There was no evidence of any effect on platelets. This result shows that the haematological toxicity profile following therapeutic doses of BCNU can be modified. It suggests that rhGM-CSF and other growth factors should be investigated for clinical efficacy in chemotherapy using nitrosoureas.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00193-0135.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="541" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00193-0136.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="542" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00193-0137.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="543" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00193-0138.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="544" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00193-0139.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="545" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
