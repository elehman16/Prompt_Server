Oxidative stress plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of hypertension and atherosclerosis by directly affecting vascular wall cells.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Increased oxidative stress in accumulated fat is an important pathogenic mechanism of obesity-associated MS.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Therefore, dietary antioxidants may have a positive impact in reducing the oxidative stress, and thus alleviating metabolic complications.</p><p>Studies have reported high prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies in children and adolescents.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] High consumption of fast foods, soft drinks and sweets, and less intake fruits and leafy vegetables[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] in adolescents are associated with obesity and may also lead to micronutrient deficiency.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Micronutrient deficiencies are linked to a higher risk of overweight and obesity and other debilitating diseases,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] which can also have long-term consequences that include the risk of hypertension in adolescents.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Studies have found lower zinc status in obese children.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Thus, micronutrient deficiency coupled with obesity may increase the cardiometabolic risk in youth. On the other hand, antioxidant micronutrients, vitamin C, E, &#x003b2;-carotene and zinc, have been found to have a role in hypertension and MS.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Studies have yielded intriguing results suggesting the protective role of zinc against atherosclerosis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>Most interventions for pediatric obesity have focused on lifestyle approaches to address the main components of energy balance. A diet and exercise module is the first line of intervention that can be used to alleviate obesity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] Short-term intervention trials are effective in treating the obese; however, success has not been uniform and the effectiveness tends to decline overtime.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]</p><p>An integrated approach in the management of obesity can be devised by focusing on dietary antioxidants which are now known to have positive role in reducing the risk of adverse metabolic effects of obesity such as CVD.

Moreover, favorable changes were observed in arterial stiffness with multivitamin-zinc supplementation together with lifestyle than lifestyle alone. As CIMT and stiffness are known to be associated with risk of future CVD events,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>] the present study findings suggest that such supplementation may have clinical benefits in the long term.</p><p>A similar reduction in BMI has been reported by Chen <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>] in a short-term lifestyle intervention trial. Moreover, pronounced improvement in physical activity and television viewing was noted in our subjects, which is consistent with other interventional studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>] Also, improvement in LBM along with a reduction in BF% is a remarkable finding emphasizing the positive effect of lifestyle intervention on adiposity in both A and B groups. Reduction in waist circumference and BF% is in accordance with the finding reported by other studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>]</p><p>Mean concentrations of serum triglycerides, LDL and total cholesterol decreased significantly post-intervention in the present study, and our findings are in concordance with those of the studies in children administered a short-term diet and exercise regimen.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>]</p><p>Increased consumption of healthy foods and decreased consumption of unhealthy foods was evident in both A and B groups. Decreased fruits intake in all the three groups is possibly because of the seasonal variations and availability of fruits. Also, after counseling there was decrease in consumption of sweet fruits like mangoes, banana, sapota and figs.</p><p>Significant reduction in mean energy and fat intakes was observed in both the intervention groups, which could be likely responsible for decrease in their lipid levels. Besides, multivitamin-zinc supplementation might also have mediated the lowering of lipids in the supplementation group, in addition to lifestyle counseling.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Similar results were reported by Hashempour <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>] documenting the effect of zinc supplementation on insulin resistance in pre-pubertal obese children.</p><p>Average micronutrient density of diets showed significant increase post-intervention, indicating the positive effect of dietary counseling in both A and B groups. On the other hand, amongst the atherosclerotic parameters, significant reduction in the stiffness parameters along with improvement in arterial compliance was evident only in multivitamin-zinc supplementation group, highlighting the potential benefit of multivitamin-zinc together with lifestyle change on arterial stiffness in overweight/obese children. Obesity exacerbates BP responses, whereas diet and exercise restore it. Thus, in the present study, systolic bloods pressure decreased significantly as a result of intervention. The findings are in concordance with those of other studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>]</p><p>The fact that atherosclerosis is a reversible step at the early ages with improvements in cardiovascular risk factors and substantial weight reduction has been well established.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>] In an intervention trial, Mayer <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>] have documented that regular exercise over 6 months restores endothelial function and improves CIMT, associated with an improved cardiovascular risk profile in obese children. Furthermore, Woo[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>] observed some statistically significant improvement in CIMT after 1-year intervention, although the difference was small. Moreover, in the present pilot study, no such change in CIMT has been observed.</p><p>Most studies have demonstrated an association between multivitamin supplementation and change in metabolic profile in adults.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>] However, the effect of antioxidant micronutrient supplementation has been scarcely reported on arterial function in youth.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] As antioxidant vitamins such as C, E and &#x003b2;-carotene are thought to play a role in atherosclerosis, supplementation of these nutrients has been explored as a means of reducing cardiovascular morbidity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>] Thus, consumption of these micronutrients as nutritional supplements could be effective in improving cardiometabolic status, indeed in the presence of lifestyle changes, in children and adolescents as well.</p><p>One of the limitations of our study is the rate of drop-outs as also the absence of follow-up data on arterial measures for the control group. Thus, further intervention trials on larger samples are warranted to confirm these findings of this pilot trial.</p><p>Hence, along with lifestyle intervention, micronutrient supplementation may help additionally in improving the stiffness of the artery in overweight/obese children. In summary, our results demonstrate the efficacy of multivitamin-zinc supplementation in conjugation with lifestyle regime in young overweight individuals on attaining better health.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>A<sc>CKNOWLEDGMENTS</sc></title><p>Our sincere thanks to the Director of Hirabai Cowasji Jehangir Medical Research Institute for funding the study.
