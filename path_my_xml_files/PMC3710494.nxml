Case studies demonstrated promising effects but three preceding randomized controlled trials (RCTs) could not support the former results. More empirical support is necessary to further substantiate the effectiveness of <italic>in vivo</italic> exposure.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A total of 108 chronic low back pain patients are randomly assigned to one out of three conditions (A: exposure_long (15 sessions), B: exposure_short (10 sessions) or C: control condition cognitive behavioral therapy (15 sessions)). The inclusion criteria are: back pain &#x02265;3 months and a sufficient level of fear-avoidance. An effect evaluation, a process evaluation and an economic evaluation are conducted. Primary outcomes are pain-related disability and pain intensity. Secondary outcomes are: emotional distress, fear avoidance, catastrophizing and costs. Data are collected at baseline, upon completion of the intervention, after 10 sessions, and at six months following completion of treatment. Besides the comparison of exposure <italic>in vivo</italic> and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), we additionally compare a short and a long version of exposure to analyze dose response effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This is, to our knowledge, the first RCT comparing <italic>in vivo</italic> exposure to psychological treatment as usual in terms of cognitive behavioral therapy.

In Europe, one out of every five people experiences significant back pain that infers with quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In addition to its broad prevalence, CLBP is one of the major causes of medical expenses, work absenteeism and disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Since cognitive behavioral models of CLBP have become more widely accepted, a large variety of behavioral interventions have become available for the treatment of CLBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Psychological interventions have been found to be effective, with cognitive behavioral treatments showing moderate to large effect sizes for reducing self-reported pain, pain-related interference, depression and disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, it is unknown which interventions work best for particular subgroups of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and more research is needed to define subgroups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Vlaeyen and colleagues developed a treatment focusing on fear-avoidant back pain patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This treatment, known as graded <italic>in vivo</italic> exposure, is based on the fear-avoidance model of chronic pain, which postulates that fear and avoidance of movement contributes to the maintenance of pain via mechanisms of classical conditioning and reinforces disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. As in the treatment of anxiety disorders, the patient is gradually exposed to a feared stimulus, which in the case of CLBP is movement believed to lead to pain or potential injuries to the back. Approximately 10 years ago, the first single case designs showed that <italic>in vivo</italic> exposure reduced pain disability, pain catastrophizing, and pain-related fears with large effect sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In addition to the case studies, three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have compared graded exposure to a waiting list, graded activity programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] or treatment as usual, for example, usual medical care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These studies found that <italic>in vivo</italic> exposure was superior to control conditions at reducing pain-related fears and catastrophizing. Only one study found effects (at the trend level) on pain-related disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In summary, the efficacy of exposure treatment in the RCTs was inferior relative to the preceding case studies.</p><p>Therefore, as emphasized by the authors of previously published systematic reviews, additional RCTs, including larger sample sizes, cost-effectiveness-analyses, mediational analyses and treatment fidelity assessments, are required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><sec><title>Problem definition</title><p>Several questions concerning exposure <italic>in vivo</italic> treatment (EXP) for chronic back pain remain unanswered:</p><p>First, there is a lack of empirical evidence regarding whether interventions tailored for particular subgroups, such as <italic>in vivo</italic> exposure for fear-avoidant pain patients, are more effective than traditional cognitive behavioral treatments for the management of chronic pain problems (CBT-P). Although a variety of definitions of CBT exist, we favor the description provided by Turk, which incorporates behavioral (principles of learning), emotional and cognitive factors. Thus, we attempt to teach our patients &#x0201c;to recognize the connections linking cognitions, affective, behavioral, and physiologic responses together with their joint consequences&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Thus far, <italic>in vivo</italic> exposure has not been compared to cognitive behavioral treatment as it is usually delivered in clinical practice.</p><p>Second, it is unknown how many sessions of EXP are needed to achieve sufficient results and that patients get the needed benefit. In a single case paradigm, Vlaeyen <italic>et al</italic>. found significant reductions in disability and pain-related fears after only three exposure sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. On the other hand, recent reviews indicate that there is evidence that prolonged psychological treatment in chronic pain patients is beneficial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Hansen and colleagues showed that between 13 and 18 sessions of therapy in general are required for 50% of patients to improve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Besides the research on the dose&#x02013;response relationship in psychotherapy in general it is also very important to evaluate and develop the adequate treatment of more specialized treatment approaches. Thus, the analysis of the dose&#x02013;response relationship in exposure treatment for chronic pain is needed to establish an effective and economical length of treatment.</p><p>Third, CLBP is often described as a socio-economic problem because it is a major cause of medical expenses, work absenteeism and disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, economic aspects of CLBP treatments (for example, cost-effectiveness) have generally received little attention and thus should be incorporated into RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The present investigation, which began recruitment in August 2011 and is currently ongoing, utilizes a three-arm randomized controlled trial method to assess the efficacy of graded <italic>in vivo</italic> exposure (EXP) for CLBP relative to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-P). To our knowledge, this is the first study to implement <italic>in vivo</italic> exposure for CLBP patients in an outpatient setting in Germany, and is also the first study to compare graded <italic>in vivo</italic> exposure to CBT. Accordingly, we will assess the feasibility of this new treatment approach. Dose-effects will be analyzed by comparing a short and a long version of EXP. In addition, cost-effectiveness will be evaluated. Besides, the main questions meditational analyses and examination of effects of generalization are planned.</p><sec><title>Research questions</title><p>1) Is EXP more effective (at post-treatment and at six-month follow-up) at reducing pain-related disability and pain intensity (primary outcomes) as well as other symptoms compared to CBT-P in patients with fear-avoidance beliefs?</p><p>2) Are there any differences in treatment effects between the short (10 sessions) and the long (15 sessions) versions of exposure at post-treatment and at six-month follow-up?</p><p>3) What is the cost-effectiveness of EXP as compared to CBT-P?</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>A three-arm randomized controlled clinical trial will be performed in a university-based outpatient clinic in Marburg (Psychotherapieambulanz der Universit&#x000e4;t Marburg, PAM), Germany.</p><p>Patients are assigned to one of three conditions (A: exposure_long; B: exposure_short or C: control condition, specifically cognitive behavioral therapy for the management of chronic pain).</p><p>The study includes assessments at baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment and six-month follow-up, as well as process measures.</p><p>The study was approved by the ethics committee of The German Association of Psychology (DGPS, WR 052010_1).</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Our target sample is 108 patients with CLBP.

Potential participants are screened through an initial phone interview with a research assistant examining the basic inclusion criteria. Those who fulfill all of the basic criteria are invited to a second screening in our outpatient clinic where the criteria of fear-avoidance and disability are assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>Patients with CLBP are included if they meet all of the following criteria:</p><p>1.

Patients are excluded if they are unable to attend sessions regularly for physical or psychological reasons.</p><p>Physical and psychological comorbidities, such as depression, are not exclusionary so long as patients are able to attend sessions and complete homework. Recruitment started in August 2011 and will continue until the target sample of 108 patients with CLBP is achieved (expected to occur near the end of 2013). We anticipate that this timeframe will be adequate to achieve recruitment goals.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>To identify the target number of participants we used the G-Power Analysis software program (University of D&#x000fc;sseldorf, Germany <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.psycho.uni-duesseldorf.de/abteilungen/aap/gpower3">http://www.psycho.uni-duesseldorf.de/abteilungen/aap/gpower3</ext-link>.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Based on the effects of previous RCTs, we expected a small effect group x time (repeated measures) of 0.2 for the comparison of three groups (assuming an alpha level = 0.05, two-tailed, &#x003b2; = 0.95, correlation between measurements = 0.5). Results of the power analysis indicated a required sample size of 36 participants per group, for a total of 108. The data will be analyzed with the intent-to-treat (ITT) approach using the last value carried forward and including all patients who intended to participate, regardless of whether they dropped out or not.</p></sec><sec><title>Patient allocation and randomization</title><p>Patients are randomized to one of three conditions following a predetermined and computer-generated randomization schedule, pre-stratified by degree of pain catastrophizing (PCS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and disability (PDI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The median scores of the pain catastrophizing and disability data from a previous study are used as cutoffs. Within each stratum, a randomized block design with a block size of nine is used to ensure equal distribution of important patient characteristics. The randomization procedure is performed by a blinded research assistant who prepares sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelops. As is common in psychological treatments, it was not feasible to blind patients or therapists to treatment condition.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>We translated and adapted the protocol of Johan Vlaeyen and Jeroen de Jong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] for implementing EXP in a German outpatient setting. The intervention is delivered by two PhD students who are clinical psychologists and who received two different sessions of training from J. Vlaeyen and J. de Jong. In addition, each session is supervised afterwards by experienced psychologists. The control condition is a cognitive behavioral treatment for pain patients containing basic elements for the management of chronic pain that are standard in our outpatient clinic. The treatment includes graded activity, relaxation (progressive muscle relaxation) and cognitive interventions such as cognitive restructuring (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

Two blinded raters independently assess protocol adherence, treatment contamination and whether the treatments can be differentiated from each other using the method of assessing treatment delivery in clinical trials (MATD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In advance, treatment elements of both treatments were identified and listed in a randomized order for the ratings.</p><sec><title>Common features</title><p>Both treatments aim to restore functioning and to decrease pain-related disability. The first two sessions of all treatment conditions are identical. At the intake, participants receive printed material, including background information and worksheets. The first appointment serves as an anamnesis interview which is followed by an educational session. During the educational session, general information about pain, factors related to the maintenance of pain, and physical and physiological changes associated with chronic pain are discussed. Finally, all patients are encouraged to develop feasible treatment goals with respect to activities in which they would like to re-engage.</p></sec><sec><title>EXP - unique features</title><p>Graded <italic>in vivo</italic> exposure (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) aims to reduce pain-related disability via overcoming fear of pain/movements. The program offers two versions of exposure: a long form including 15 sessions (10 exposures) and a short form including 10 meetings (5 exposure sessions). After the first two sessions, the patient is encouraged to develop an individualized fear-avoidance model including pain, pain cognitions and avoidance. This circular model serves as a basis for transferring and explaining the therapeutic rationale. During session four, a fear hierarchy is established using the Photo Series of Daily Activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The patient makes harm ratings of 100 pictures showing daily activities. If the patient has understood the therapeutic rationale and is willing to do exposure he will be gradually confront feared stimuli, which are movements related to pain or potential injuries of the back. Patients are encouraged to engage in these feared activities as much as possible until anxiety levels have decreased. Behavioral experiments are integrated to challenge catastrophic beliefs about the feared consequences of pain or specific movements. This intervention is intended to produce cognitive and behavioral changes and offers the patient the opportunity to regain trust in his or her body. The process of overcoming fear and learning that feared consequences are unlikely to occur is believed to be the main mechanism of treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>CBT-P unique features</title><p>The primary goal of the CBT approach is the same as that of the exposure treatment, that is, to increase functional capacity. However, the method used to achieve this goal is different. CBT-P encourages patients to develop an adaptive style of coping by maintaining a problem-solving orientation. Patients are provided with different strategies to cope with pain. Initially, patients learn to increase activity by dividing the activities they want to perform in smaller steps to avoid phases of excessive demands followed by long terms of recovery. After this first phase, patients learn to practice progressive relaxation. During the third module, maladaptive pain-related cognitions are identified and discussed. Patients are taught to recognize the links between thoughts, feelings and behavior and to challenge negative appraisals as one strategy for interrupting pain-maintaining circuits.

Direct health-care costs include costs of health-care consumption in general (that is, general practitioner, physical therapists, hospital visits and so on.). The number of consultations is multiplied by the cost of each visit to calculate total costs.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>Data are collected at baseline (T0), after 10 sessions (T1, completion of EXP short), upon completion of the intervention (T2), and six months following completion of treatment (T3). Thus, participants in the short version of EXP complete only three assessments. Questionnaires are completed at home via the internet. This procedure reduces missing data and helps to keep study therapists blind to outcome data. Supplemental evaluations are carried out weekly, including process variables. If patients do not have internet access the assessment are provided on a computer in our outpatient clinic. Video recordings are carried out during each session to gather objective data for later analysis of treatment fidelity.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>The latest version of The Statistical Package for Social Science (IBM SPSS Statistics) version 19is used for data analyses. Intention-to-treat analyses (ITT) used to account for deviations from random allocation and missing data. A repeated measures design will be used with primary and secondary measures as dependent variables, group as the between-subjects factor, and time of measurement as the within-subjects factor.</p><p>Possible confounding variables (for example, duration of complaints) will be considered and included as covariates according to the results of correlation analyses. Effect sizes (Cohen&#x000b4;s d) will be calculated to determine the magnitude of the mean differences between groups on the outcome variables. According to Cohen&#x000b4;s guidelines, an effect size of .2 indicates a small effect, .5 a medium effect and .8 a large effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. We consider a 30% reduction on the NRS to indicate clinically important change on the core outcome measure of pain intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. The economic evaluation consisted of a cost-utility analysis and a cost-effectiveness analysis. For both analyses, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated as (C1-C0)/(E1-E0) where C is the cost and E is the effect and the experimental and comparator conditions are indexed with the 1, 0 subscripts.</p><p>The incremental cost-utility ratio will focus on the net costs per quality adjusted life years (QALY) gained. The cost-effectiveness ratio focuses on the net costs per reliable and clinically improved case of disability/pain. Probit analysis will be used for dose&#x02013;response effects. This approach based on probability theory and includes determining the observed rates and resulting probability of a response for a particular treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>Before participating, each patient receives and signs an informed consent form, which describes the details of the intervention and assessments. Participants are informed that they may cease participation at any time without consequences. In addition, participants are offered standard psychotherapy at our outpatient clinic if needed. The Ethics committee of The German Association of Psychology (DGPS, WR 052010_1) approved this trial.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>General</title><p>Despite the demonstrated efficacy of cognitive behavioral interventions for the treatment of CLBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], research on the efficacy of EXP is lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. To our knowledge, this is the first study to implement EXP in an outpatient setting in Germany. Furthermore, it is the first randomized clinical trial to evaluate EXP compared to cognitive behavioral treatment as usual for chronic pain. This comparison allows us to investigate whether fear-avoidant back pain patients benefit more from a treatment that addresses their specific pain-related fears than from a general psychological pain management program.</p><p>EXP is a relatively new approach for treating CLBP. During the process of developing and testing new interventions, it is important to investigate feasibility, cost-effectiveness and the underlying mechanism of treatment change. A recent review called for additional RCTs investigating approaches to CLBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and with one exception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], existing published RCTs have not investigated mechanisms of change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. To understand the process of change during EXP, the current RCT adds weekly measures of potential key mediators, such as self-efficacy, pain coping and pain beliefs. A novel feature of the current study is the inclusion of a short form of exposure therapy (10 sessions) in addition to a long version comprising 15 sessions. The analysis of the dose&#x02013;response relationship in exposure treatment is crucial to determining an effective and economical treatment length. Finally, as EXP represents a completely new approach in the German health care system, information about cost-effectiveness is very important. In general, information on the economic aspects of CLBP treatments is lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Accordingly, we integrated cost-effectiveness analysis with an adapted version of the TIC-P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Potential strengths of the study protocol</title><p>Participants will be recruited over a period of two years, which allows the inclusion of a larger sample (108 participants) relative to a prior RCT (N = 59) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Before administering the intervention, the therapists participated in two workshops taught by Johan Vlaeyen and Jeroen de Jong, the developers of <italic>in vivo</italic> exposure for CLBP. This training ensures that therapists have basic knowledge and competence in implementing the treatment. Weekly supervision is provided, and therapeutic difficulties are discussed as a team. In addition, our research team is in regular contact with the groups in Maastricht and Leuven. Regular meetings allow discussion of specific difficulties with treatment implementation. It has been observed that the quality of treatment is frequently neglected in studies evaluating therapeutic interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Accordingly, to improve the quality of the treatment protocol, adherence will be assessed through video-recordings of sessions and will be controlled in analyses. The Method of Assessing Treatment Delivery (MATD) proposed by Leeuw and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] will be used to assess treatment fidelity.</p></sec><sec><title>Potential limitations of the study protocol</title><p>The treatment in the present study is designed for patients with CLBP with sufficient levels of fear and avoidance (TSK &#x02265;35, Phoda-profile), and thus it is unclear whether results are likely to generalize beyond this specific pain population. Nevertheless, we attempted to keep the eligibility criteria very liberal (that is, no exclusion for comorbidities or medication use, moderate level of TSK) to offer broad access to the intervention. Secondly, the present study relies largely on self-report measures.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>It is important to determine whether a specialized treatment is needed for fear-avoidant back pain patients, a high-risk group characterized by substantial impairment, or whether standard CBT programs are adequate?
