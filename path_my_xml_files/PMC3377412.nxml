absenteeism caused by influenza-like illness (ILI), diarrhea, conjunctivitis,
and laboratory-confirmed influenza, we conducted a randomized control trial in
60 elementary schools in Cairo, Egypt. Children in the intervention schools were
required to wash hands twice each day, and health messages were provided through
entertainment activities. Data were collected on student absenteeism and reasons
for illness. School nurses collected nasal swabs from students with ILI, which
were tested by using a qualitative diagnostic test for influenza A and B.
Compared with results for the control group, in the intervention group, overall
absences caused by ILI, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, and laboratory-confirmed
influenza were reduced by 40%, 30%, 67%, and 50%, respectively (p&#x0003c;0.0001 for
each illness). An intensive hand hygiene campaign was effective in reducing
absenteeism caused by these illnesses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords: </title><kwd>Hand hygiene</kwd><kwd>campaigns</kwd><kwd>influenza</kwd><kwd>viruses</kwd><kwd>schoolchildren</kwd><kwd>Egypt</kwd><kwd>absenteeism</kwd><kwd>expedited</kwd><kwd>research</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) and diarrheal diseases cause substantial illness and
death worldwide. Most of the estimated 5.5 million deaths associated with ARI and
diarrhea occur in children from resource-limited countries. In these settings, where
access to health services is often lacking, effective prevention methods are paramount.
ARIs cause &#x0003e;4 million deaths annually and account for &#x0003e;7% of global deaths (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>). Many ARIs are caused by
viruses, including influenza A and B. Influenza viruses circulate in Egypt all year,
peaking in winter months (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>).
Although influenza is generally self-limiting, each year it causes 3&#x02013;5 million
cases of severe illness and up to 500,000 deaths worldwide (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>). The greatest number of excess deaths occur in
persons &#x0003e;65 years of age, yet influenza greatly affects schoolage children as well.
In addition, schoolchildren play a key role in transmission of influenza during
community epidemics (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><italic>4</italic></xref>). Slowing
or preventing transmission of influenza viruses among children may diminish the
explosive transmission pattern that often characterizes annual influenza epidemics
(<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><italic>5</italic></xref>).</p><p>Diarrheal disease is the second leading cause of childhood illness and death and is
responsible for &#x02248;2 million deaths annually in children &#x0003c;5 years of age (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><italic>6</italic></xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>). Frequent and prolonged episodes of nonfatal
diarrhea can lead to malnutrition, stunting of growth, and absenteeism in schoolage
children (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><italic>8</italic></xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>). In Egypt, where child mortality rates have been
reduced in recent years, diarrheal diseases still account for 13.9% of deaths in
children &#x0003c;5 years of age. Much of the reduction in deaths caused by diarrheal
diseases has resulted from better case management, including use of oral rehydration
therapy and improved water and sanitation. Although deaths have decreased, the incidence
of diarrheal diseases has remained relatively unchanged (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><italic>10</italic></xref>).</p><p>Hand hygiene is a key intervention for reducing transmission of ARI and diarrhea in
community settings. Hand hygiene, using antibacterial soap or alcohol-based sanitizers,
has been reported to result in notable reductions in the incidence of diarrheal diseases
(<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><italic>11</italic></xref>). Hand hygiene has also
been specifically recommended for prevention of diseases with pandemic potential, such
as severe acute respiratory syndrome and for influenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><italic>12</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><italic>14</italic></xref>). The objectives of this study were to measure
the effectiveness of an intensive hand hygiene intervention campaign in reducing the
incidence of absenteeism caused by illness and the incidence of laboratory-confirmed
influenza in schoolchildren in Egypt.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>We conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of an
intensive hand hygiene campaign in reducing the absenteeism of schoolchildren
due to illness, student in-class reported illness, and laboratory-confirmed
influenza. The primary outcome measure was a determination of the rates of
absenteeism caused by influenza-like illness (ILI) and laboratory-confirmed
influenza, in which absenteeism caused by diarrhea and conjunctivitis were
considered secondary outcomes. The study was performed over a 12-week period,
February 16&#x02013;May 12, 2008.</p></sec><sec><title>School Settings</title><p>Cairo Governorate was chosen because of the continuous availability of water in
school settings. The socioeconomic characteristics of families sending children
to government schools in Cairo are homogenous in terms of education, income, and
home sanitation facilities (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><italic>15</italic></xref>). Most schools in Cairo have 1 large restroom
with &#x02248;10 sinks and an additional 8&#x02013;10 sinks on the playground. No
sinks are available in the classrooms. Average size of each classroom is
&#x02248;48 m<sup>2</sup> with 69 students (&#x02248;0.7 m<sup>2</sup>/student).
Before the campaign, neither soap nor hand-drying material was available in the
schools. Handwashing, if done at all, was only performed by rinsing hands in
water. Hands were typically dried on clothing or air-dried.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample Size</title><p>The sample size was calculated with the intent to detect a 20% reduction in
laboratory-confirmed influenza in the intervention group, using a rate of 1.5%
of laboratory-confirmed influenza per week in the control group and 70%
participation. After doubling the sample to adjust for clustering, a total of 27
schools per group were adequate to detect this difference in
laboratory-confirmed influenza with 80% power and 95% confidence. (The formula
used to estimate the sample size is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.openepi.com/Menu/OpenEpiMenu.htm">http://www.openepi.com/Menu/OpenEpiMenu.htm</ext-link>.) Sixty elementary
schools (30 intervention and 30 control schools) were randomly selected from a
numbered list of all 725 government elementary schools in Cairo by using a
computer-generated random number table. All children at the intervention
schools, regardless of grade, were included in the hand hygiene campaign
activities, but absenteeism and illness data were only collected from children
in the first 3 primary grades.</p></sec><sec><title>School Teams</title><p>At each intervention school, a hand hygiene team composed of 3 teachers (social
studies, arts, sports) and the school nurse was established. The hand hygiene
team ensured that all predesigned activities for the hand hygiene campaign were
implemented on a weekly basis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).
The school nurses and teachers were trained to interview students, collect
absenteeism data, interview parents, and complete data collection forms, and the
nurses were trained to collect and process nasal swabs to test for influenza. At
control schools, the nurses were supported by a single surveillance officer who
was assigned to complete data collection forms.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Hand hygiene campaign activities in intervention schools, Cairo,

parents usually sent children to school with a small bag containing bar soap and
a clean towel. If families could not afford soap and hand-drying material, the
school administration provided them.</p><p><bold>S</bold>ix independent social workers visited the schools weekly; each
visited 10 schools per week (5 intervention and 5 control schools). During each
visit, they observed hand hygiene activities, soap and drying material
availability, and the process of students washing their hands during the school
day; they also verified the accuracy of the illness data collected by
teachers.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention Communication Campaign</title><p>An intensive campaign to promote hand hygiene was launched in the intervention
schools to raise the awareness of students, teachers, nurses, and parents
regarding the importance of hand hygiene and to increase the proportion of
students washing their hands. Hand hygiene teams required students in the first
3 primary grades to wash their hands at least twice during the school day for
&#x02248;45 seconds, followed by proper rinsing and drying with a clean cloth
towel.</p><p>Campaign materials were developed for 3 groups (students, teachers, parents). The
teachers&#x02019; guidebook included a detailed description of the
students&#x02019; activities and methods to encourage students to practice these
activities. Posters were placed near sinks in the classrooms and on the
playground. The primary message was to wash hands with soap and water upon
arriving at school, before and after meals, after using the bathroom, and after
coughing or sneezing.</p><p>Grade-specific student booklets were developed; each included a set of 12 games
and fun activities that promoted handwashing. At least 1 activity was used each
week. A special song to promote hand hygiene was developed and played regularly
at schools. Informational fliers were distributed to parents to reinforce the
messages delivered at the schools. Many schools were creative in motivating
students to comply with washing hands, such as selecting a weekly hand hygiene
champion, developing theater plays, and launching school contests for drawings
and songs.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Collection and Illness Definitions</title><p>Data were collected for 12 weeks during February&#x02013;May 2008. The regulations
of the Ministry of Education require schools in Egypt to record absences each
day in a school log book, classified as absence caused by either an illness or a
non-illness. The hand hygiene teams visited each classroom to verify the
information collected by the school administration. They also telephoned parents
of children absent due to illness on the first day of absence and interviewed
them to complete an absenteeism data collection form that included specific
symptoms of illness. Symptoms and signs of illness and detailed case definitions
were the same as those used by Bowen et al. (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>).</p><p>A student episode of absence caused by illness was defined as a student who was
absent for any number of consecutive or nonconsecutive days during 1 calendar
week with symptoms affecting the same organ system. The incidence of absence due
to illness was defined as the number of absences caused by illness per 100
student-weeks. Rates of absence caused by illness with specific symptoms or
signs were calculated as the number of absences due to illness associated with
specific symptoms per 100 student-weeks. The incidence of in-class illness was
defined as the number of reported in-class episodes of illness among the first 3
primary grade students per 100 student-weeks.</p><p>Children who were absent from school because of ILI (defined as fever
<underline>&#x0003e;</underline>38&#x000b0;C and either cough or sore throat) were
approached by the school nurse, who either visited the child at home (if
possible) or asked the child to visit the school clinic if they returned to
school within 3 days of absence. In addition, students who became ill during the
school day were referred by teachers to the school clinic nurse. The school
nurse interviewed the students and completed the in-class illness data
collection form that included the same symptoms and signs used on the
absenteeism data collection tool.</p></sec><sec><title>Laboratory Methods</title><p>Nurses collected a nasal swab from children who visited the school clinic with
ILI. Nasal swabs were collected by inserting and rotating a sterile swab into
the anterior nares; the specimen was then tested for influenza A and B viruses
by using QuickVue, a rapid, point-of-care antigen detection test designed for
use by nonlaboratory personnel (QuickVue; Quidel Corp., San Diego, CA, USA).
This test was conducted only for students who had prior written approval of a
parent.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and Informed Consent</title><p>The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the US Naval Medical Research
Unit No. 3 (NAMRU3) Institutional Review Board (Protocol
#NAMRU3.NAMRU3.2007&#x02013;0007). A written letter describing the purpose of the
study signed by the school principal of each school was distributed to the
parents or guardians of all students in the first 3 primary grades. In addition,
consent for obtaining a nasal swab from students reporting ILI was sought.
Control schools received the same intervention program at the end of the
study.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>To adjust for the cluster design effect, we calculated the rates of absenteeism
and illness separately for each school. This was performed by dividing the
number of episodes of absenteeism or illness by the number of student-weeks. The
answer was then multiplied by 100 to obtain rates per 100 student-weeks. Since
the rates were not normally distributed, the medians of the mean rates for the
intervention and control schools were compared by using the Wilcoxon rank-sum
test; p values &#x0003c;0.05 were considered significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>During the 12-week observation period, 20,882 students (282,832 student-weeks of
observation) were enrolled at the intervention schools in the first through third
grades; 23,569 students (250,584 student-weeks) were enrolled at the 30 control
schools. All parents approved providing information about their children&#x02019;s
illnesses; however, 7,112 parents (16%) did not give permission for the collection
of nasal swab specimens from their children, and the distribution was similar in
both groups (p&#x0003e;0.05). No significant differences were found for the 2 groups in
median age (8 years), sex distribution (51% male), or the median number of students
per school (635 [interquartile range 394&#x02013;978]).</p><p>One-week baseline data were collected for intervention and control schools 2 weeks
before the hand hygiene intervention activities. This step was carried out to test
data collection procedures and ensure the collection of good quality data. No
significant difference was found between the intervention group and control group in
the rate of absenteeism caused by ILI (relative risk 1.1, 95% confidence interval
[CI] 0.9&#x02013;1.4) or in the rate of confirmed influenza episodes (relative risk
0.8, 95% CI 0.5&#x02013;1.5).</p><p>During the 12-week observation period, 19,094 absences caused by overall illness were
reported at the control schools (7.2 absences/100 student-weeks), compared with
13,247 absences in intervention schools (5.7 absences/100 student-weeks)
(p&#x0003c;0.01). Across all schools, the overall reduction in absenteeism caused by
illness was 21% in the intervention schools compared with the control (p&#x0003c;0.05).
Absences caused by ILI, diarrhea, and conjunctivitis were reduced by 40%, 33%, and
67%, respectively, in the intervention group. No difference was observed for
in-class reported illnesses between intervention and control schools; control and
intervention schools reported 6,538 and 6,028 in-class illnesses, respectively

34.9% (n = 228) were positive. In contrast, 790 cases (46.3%) of ILI in the
intervention schools were identified through in-class reporting, and while a similar
proportion was tested for influenza virus (77%) (n = 609), only 18.4% (n = 112) were
positive for influenza virus (p&#x0003c;0.01). In control schools, 65.5% (n = 1,671) of
students were absent caused by ILI, of which 11.6% (n = 194) were tested and 27.3%
(n = 53) were positive for influenza virus. In the intervention schools, ILI was
responsible for 53.7% (n = 917) of absenteeism. Of these 917 students, 199 (21.7%)
were tested and only 6.5% (n = 13) were positive for influenza virus (p&#x0003c;0.01)

Overall, control schools were 1.6&#x000d7; (95% CI 1.1&#x02013;2.2) more likely to
report at least 1 confirmed case of influenza and 2.8&#x000d7; (95% CI

intervention schools.</p><p>The monitoring teams observed during their regular visits that &#x02248;93% of the
students in the intervention schools had soap and drying material available. All
intervention schools (except 2) had a rigorous system of ensuring that
schoolchildren were washing their hands at least twice daily.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Elementary schoolchildren are important vectors for spreading infectious diseases
between themselves, their families, and their communities, especially in developing
countries where public schools are extremely overcrowded. Aiello et al. noted that
infectious agents that children contract in schools can result in infections in up
to 50% of household members (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><italic>17</italic></xref>).</p><p>Influenza transmission dynamics and potential methods for control are of particular
interest in Egypt where avian influenza (H5N1) is endemic in poultry facilities,
both commercial and backyard (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><italic>18</italic></xref>). Concern persists regarding the potential for
recombination between seasonal influenza and subtype H5N1 strains with resultant
rapid transmission of the recombinant strain, especially among high-density
populations such as public school students and staff. In addition, nonpharmaceutical
interventions, especially hand hygiene to mitigate pandemic (H1N1) 2009 disease
spread, have been advocated by international organizations (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><italic>19</italic></xref>).</p><p>This randomized controlled intervention trial replicates well-known findings that
intensive hand hygiene campaigns are highly successful in reducing absenteeism
caused by illness and absenteeism caused by to ILI and diarrheal diseases among
schoolchildren (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><italic>20</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><italic>22</italic></xref>). This study also
duplicates recent findings that incidence of in-class reported illness is not
significantly decreased by promotion of hand hygiene (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>). However, this study also demonstrates a
decrease in laboratory-confirmed influenza as a result of an intensive hand hygiene
campaign.</p><p>The 21% reduction in absenteeism caused by illness in intervention schools in this
study is lower than the 42% observed among schoolchildren in the People&#x02019;s
Republic of China (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>) and
in similar US studies (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><italic>20</italic></xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><italic>21</italic></xref>). These differences might be caused by the nature of
the interventions implemented: ensuring a continuous free supply of soap as in China
(<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>), promoting the use
of alcohol-free instant hand sanitizers (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><italic>20</italic></xref>), or equipping classrooms with dispensers
containing alcohol as described by Guinan et al. (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><italic>21</italic></xref>).</p><p>In this 12-week hand hygiene trial, absenteeism caused by ILI decreased 40% and
laboratory-confirmed influenza decreased 47% in intervention schools relative to
control schools. These reductions are higher than the 21% and 16% reductions in
respiratory illness reported in 2 meta-analyses of hand hygiene interventions in
community settings (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><italic>22</italic></xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><italic>23</italic></xref>) and the elementary school
based hand hygiene program in China (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>). A recent study evaluating the effectiveness of
hand hygiene and facemasks in preventing influenza transmission in households in
Hong Kong showed reduction in influenza transmission, but the differences were not
significant (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr"><italic>24</italic></xref>).
Differences in study design (household-based versus school-based) or in intensity of
the intervention may have contributed to the positive effects in our study. Also,
the greater relative reductions of influenza in our study might be attributed to
specific influenza transmission dynamics for Egypt or the season when the study was
conducted. In addition, Egypt&#x02019;s unique hand hygiene campaign required
students to wash hands at least twice during the school day, which might have had a
direct influence on reducing influenza.</p><p>The incidence of absenteeism caused by diarrhea was 33% lower in schoolchildren in
the intervention schools. This result is similar to a Cochrane Reviews report that
handwashing reduced the incidence of diarrheal episodes in children and adults by
30% (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><italic>11</italic></xref>). However, our study
found a greater reduction in diarrhea than did a controlled trial conducted at a
single elementary school (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><italic>8</italic></xref>),
where the intervention only focused on providing alcohol-based hand sanitizers and
wipes to disinfect classroom surfaces. Higher reduction rates of absenteeism caused
by diarrhea (47%) were described in community settings that used soap for
handwashing (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><italic>25</italic></xref>).</p><p>Notably, the incidence of ILIs decreased more than did diarrheal disease (40% vs 33%)
in this study. Previous studies have shown a greater reduction in diarrheal disease
incidence, possibly because it is easier to adopt handwashing behaviors associated
with diarrhea such as preparing/eating food, defecating, etc., relative to those
associated with ILI such as washing hands after sneezing or coughing. Also of
interest in this study was the marked (67%) decrease in absenteeism caused by
conjunctivitis in intervention schools compared to results for control schools.</p><p>There are several important limitations in this study. First, because study teams and
schoolchildren and their parents were not blinded to the intervention,
underreporting of illness as a cause for absenteeism in the intervention schools may
have contributed to information bias. However, a rigorous system for identifying the
reasons for illness based on a standardized list of symptoms as well as regular
monitoring visits did not uncover any systematic errors. Differential interest of
study teams may have contributed to the low rate of testing in students who were
absent because of ILI in the control schools compared to the intervention schools
(12% vs 22%); however, because nasal swabs were collected only from students who
returned to school within 3 days of illness onset, it is unlikely that samples
tested reflected the most severe manifestation of illness. Absence incidence,
defined as <underline>&#x0003e;</underline>1 day of absence in given week, may have been
overestimated if a child were ill at the end of 1 week and at the beginning of the
subsequent week; however, such overestimation is unlikely to have occurred
differentially between the intervention and control schools.</p><p>The relatively short duration of observation (12 weeks) may have also led to an
overestimation of effect, as participants may have been more likely to adhere to new
hand hygiene behavior over a shorter period. This study was not designed to measure
sustainability of effect. In addition, the use of rapid tests for diagnosis of
laboratory-confirmed influenza with known low sensitivity (60% in some studies)
likely resulted in an underestimation of illness in each group; this would likely
bias the effects towards the null. Finally, because of delays in scientific and
official approvals, the campaign was not started until the end of the influenza
season; a higher baseline prevalence of respiratory and diarrheal diseases during
the trial period may have led to a stronger program effect on disease-specific
absenteeism.</p><p>This intensive hand hygiene intervention was effective in reducing transmission of
influenza among schoolchildren and was feasible and acceptable. In spite of
operational difficulties in schools, the Egyptian Ministry of Health recommended
hand hygiene as a means of reducing transmission of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and other
infectious diseases on a countrywide basis by using mass media campaigns (television
and radio programs) and focusing on schoolchildren. Sustaining intensive national
hand hygiene programs is challenging because of the high costs of training, printing
materials, and logistics involved. In addition, the lack of continuous availability
of soap and water is a limiting factor in remote areas. Identifying strategies that
provide national, long-term, cost-effective alternatives to promote hand hygiene is
critical in preventing transmission of diarrheal diseases and emerging respiratory
viruses of pandemic potential.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="citation"><p><italic>Suggested citation for this article</italic>: Talaat M, Afifi S, Dueger
