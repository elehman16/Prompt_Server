Each group divided into three subgroups of 15 each and obturated using a single cone, lateral compaction, and hybrid (tapered cone/lateral compaction) techniques. For evaluation of coronal leakage, &#x0201c;two-chamber setup&#x0201d; was used. The solution of enterococcus faecalis culture was injected in the upper chamber and incubated. If the bacteria pass through the canal and obturation materials, the lower chamber becomes turbid.

Of 10 samples of positive control group, 5 prepared with Reciproc file and 5 samples prepared with Neoniti A1 and no obturation.</p><p>In all groups, the files were cleaned from debris after each removal with clean gauze. During preparation, the canals were irrigated by physiologic saline with a 27-gauge needle. After completing the instrumentation, a #15 K file was passed 1 mm through the apex to the foramen to control the patency. Final irrigation of all root canals was performed with 5 ml of 5.25% NaOCl, and then 5 ml of 17% EDTA (Biodinamica, ibipora, Brazil) for 1 min and 10 ml distilled water as final irrigation.

At first to prevent lateral leakage,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] two layers of nail varnish (Saviz Co., Tehran, Iran) were applied on the outer surface of the roots except the apical foramen and the orifice areas. To make the two chamber leakage set up, a hole was made at the end of the 2-ml syringes, and the tooth samples were placed into the hole so that the orifice area was within the syringe and the apex was out of it. It forms the upper chamber that bacterial suspension was injected. For the lower chamber, the penicillin vial was used which would contain the cell culture medium. Silicone bonnets of the vials were punched proportion to the syringe end size. The syringes pressed into the vials.

A major concern for all clinicians is understanding the time required for bacteria to penetrate through root-canal obturation material and reinfect the entire canal length after preparation with two single rotary files: Neoniti A1 and Reciproc and obturation with these three technques: Single cone, lateral condensation, and hybrid techniques.</p><p>Various methods have been proposed to assess coronal bacterial leakage, including dye penetration, bacterial leakage, bacterial metabolites, electrochemical techniques, radioisotope, and fluid filtration. In this study, coronal leakage of <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> was chosen, because this method simulates the clinical conditions to some extent, moreover this bacterium is part of the normal oral flora of humans and is frequently found in dental infections with other aerobes and facultative anaerobes,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and is the most commonly microbes isolated from canals with post treatment disease.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Using single species in this study was to facilitate the setup and interpretation the results. Double-chamber technique models were used that it is also previously used by Saberi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>The results showed that regardless of preparation technique, in both Group N and R, maximum leakage was observed in lateral condensation technique (Domain: Reciproc: 4&#x02013;44 days, Neoniti A1: 3&#x02013;51 days) then single cone (Domain: Reciproc: 8&#x02013;43 days, Neoniti A1: 11&#x02013;41 days) and at the end hybrid technique (Reciproc: 10&#x02013;52 days, Neoniti A1: 12&#x02013;43 days) due to the fact that 40%&#x02013;47% of hybrid group and 14%&#x02013;20% in single cone group remained free of leakage by the end of the study.</p><p>The differences between the various methods of obturation in both groups N and R were significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.003), but there were no differences between the same subgroups, this finding indicates that preparation technique has no effect on bacterial leakage. Studies have shown that abturation following preparation with Ni-Ti rotary instruments had less microleakage than hand instruments, because the rotary files, making the smoother walls and these canals obturated more easily.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>AH plus sealer was used in this study. One study reported that AH plus showed less apical microleakage along with all the ZOE formulations or calcium hydroxide base sealers because of less solubility and lower shrinkage. Results showed that AH Plus/gutta-percha and Epiphany/Resilon provided the same coronal seal;[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] however, other studies indicating that gutta-percha and AH-plus do not offer resistance to coronal leakage and showing gross leakage increasing within the first 4 months following obturation when coronally challenged.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, 100% of the samples of in lateral compaction technique in two groups were infected within 3&#x02013;51 days. Void formation in the body of the filling while using the spreader and the shrinkage of the sealer and gutta-percha are possible reasons for the relatively inferior results obtained with lateral compaction techniques.</p><p>The minimum time for occurrence of leakage in lateral compaction technique was less than a week. Two bacterial leakage studies by Saberi <italic>et al</italic>. also showed that leakage occurs within a week in lateral condensation technique and in the lack of coronal seal.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Kersten <italic>et al</italic>. stated that the efficiency of the cold lateral compaction of gutta-percha which frequently used in root canal therapy is differ depending on the different morphology of the canals.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>In single-cone subgroups during the study period, 86% and 80% were infected in group N and R, respectively.</p><p>This noncompaction, single-cone filling of root canals has been introduced to minimize the sealer component with gutta-percha cones closely match to the geometry of NI-TI rotary instrument and ensure 3-dimensional obturation of the root canal without necessitating accessory cones and with less time spent.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] However, its success depends on the canal geometry and the ability of files to create a rounded tapered canals with a strict adaptation of gutta-percha cones to the prepared canals.</p><p>However, due to one gutta-percha cone and lack of compaction, the filling material does not be able to penetrate the canal wall irregularities and the will be accompanied by voids formation between sealer and gutta-percha and the coronal seal will not be established. Robberecht <italic>et al</italic>. compared tapered single-cone method versus warm vertical condensation and injection system and concluded that a better apical adjustment of gutta-percha and a greater number of filled lateral or accessory root canals was perceived with the combined-system filling technique whereas low voids were observed in single-cone group in the coronal two-thirds.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Yilmaz <italic>et al</italic>. reported that cold laterally compacted gutta-percha and the single-cone technique had similar sealing properties with the BeeFill system, which all were better than that of System B/Obtura II.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>In several studies, both cold laterally compacted and single-cone gutta-percha have been compared with vertical compaction techniques, demonstrating better,[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] similar,[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] or inferior[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] sealing properties. Such inconsistent results may be due to differences in tooth preparation, time, protocols of experiment, storage conditions, and the type of sealer used.</p><p>Another point that should not be ignored is adaptation of gutta-percha with the last file used in the canal.</p><p>Chesler <italic>et al</italic>. showed that all intramanufacturer diameters and tapers were significantly different from each other. For example, the diameter tolerance of #30 files is 0.02 mm and for gutta-percha cones is 0.07 mm. Discrepancy between files and cones can be 0.09 mm or nearly 2 ISO file sizes.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p>Obviously, a single technique is unable to establish a complete seal although the mass of gutta-percha used in this technique is more than lateral condensation.</p><p>In this study, the lowest leakage was observed in hybrid group where only 60% and 53% of the samples in N and R groups were infected, respectively, during the study. The use of accessory cones/tapered cone method reduced the coronal leakage significantly. Although in the present study, tapered cone/accessory cones method were significantly effective in reducing the coronal leakage, but the results also show that all three obturation techniques were unable to achieve an ideal seal.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSIONS</sc></title><p>Dentists should avoid oversimplification of treatment. Having sufficient knowledge about the anatomy of the root canal, adherence to the principles of preparation and three-dimensional filling are key issues, and it is recommended to including techniques that provide achieving these goals.</p><p>For example control of working length, using master cone fit to the apical size, using sealer and accessory cones and warm vertical compaction of gutta-percha to fill voids and irregularities can be mentioned.</p><p>Although the results of <italic>in vitro</italic> studies cannot fully extended to clinical condition, but, based on these studies, the
