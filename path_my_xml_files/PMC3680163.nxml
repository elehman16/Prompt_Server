We suggest emotion research is no exception. The awareness and conscious assessment required by self-report of emotion may significantly alter emotional processes. In this study, participants engaged in a difficult math task designed to induce anger or shame while their cardiovascular responses were measured. Half of the participants were asked to report on their emotional states and appraise their feelings throughout the experiment, whereas the other half completed a control questionnaire. Among those in the anger condition, participants assigned to report on their emotions exhibited qualitatively different physiological responses from those who did not report. For participants in the shame condition, there were no significant differences in physiology based on the self-report manipulation. The study demonstrates that the simple act of reporting on an emotional state may have a substantial impact on the body&#x02019;s reaction to an emotional situation.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by funding from National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) grant (HL079383) to WBM.

In physics, observing a particle requires another particle to interact with it, changing the properties of the particle to be observed <xref rid="pone.0064959-Feynman1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In computer science, adding a debugger changes memory allocation, which can alter the behavior of target code. In electrical engineering, measurement of current in a circuit entails adding a voltmeter, which necessarily changes current flow. Measurement effects may also be important in emotion research&#x02013;how people feel could depend on whether someone is asking. Reporting how we are feeling requires awareness and conscious assessment of our emotional states, and these processes may alter emotional experiences.</p><p>Emotions are complex processes involving multiple response channels, including physiological systems, facial and vocal expressive tendencies, and cognition <xref rid="pone.0064959-Barrett1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0064959-Keltner1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0064959-Larsen1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. These channels influence each other in a process that extends over time <xref rid="pone.0064959-Scherer1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>: emotional events trigger sequences of neural activity <xref rid="pone.0064959-Northoff1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0064959-Carreti1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0064959-Yamasaki1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, which result in changes in autonomic and neuroendocrine systems <xref rid="pone.0064959-Larsen2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0064959-Lovallo1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Reporting how we are feeling may interrupt these processes, replacing the characteristic thoughts and appraisals of the emotion with awareness of the emotion itself. This shift of attention and change in cognition may alter other aspects of emotional response. As a result, the emotional process on which we have been asked to report could be fundamentally altered.</p><p>An assumption that emotional processes will return to normal operation following self-report is tenuous. Subjective feelings, the conscious component of emotional response, don&#x02019;t arise from simple, passive perception. Awareness of our emotional states requires focal attention <xref rid="pone.0064959-Lambie1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, as well as an interpretive process that tends to recruit a wide range of information <xref rid="pone.0064959-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Though we may have the impression that feelings simply appear in consciousness, their generation entails an active process that consumes cognitive resources <xref rid="pone.0064959-Kron1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Such complex cognitions are likely to interact with emotional response, which involves its own set of characteristic thoughts <xref rid="pone.0064959-Leventhal1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>That conscious processing is capable of impacting emotion is well documented. Detailed, causal analyses of past emotional experiences can have a significant impact on current emotional states. Writing about negative emotional experiences for a few minutes every day can lead to significant physical and mental health improvements <xref rid="pone.0064959-Pennebaker1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0064959-Frattaroli1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Talking about past emotional experiences can also affect present physiology, with emotional disclosure being associated with changes in skin conductance levels and cardiovascular physiology <xref rid="pone.0064959-Mendes1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0064959-Hughes1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Attempting to understand the causes of negative emotion thus serves to ameliorate their negative effects. Reflective reasoning can also mitigate the negative effects of ongoing emotional experiences. Reappraising an emotional situation to be less impactful (e.g. consciously adopting the mindset of a medical student when watching a disgusting video) decreases self-reported emotional intensity, reduces emotion-related expressive behavior, and moderates a number of physiological variables <xref rid="pone.0064959-Gross1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0064959-Gross2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>Though diary writing and reappraisal require substantial cognitive processing, more subtle manipulations of awareness may also impact emotional processing. Scheier and Carver argue that awareness can enhance the saliency of emotion and result in a change in the relationship between emotion and behavior <xref rid="pone.0064959-Carver1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. They used individual differences to measure awareness and strategically placed mirrors to manipulate awareness, and found awareness of anger led to more aggressive behavior <xref rid="pone.0064959-Scheier1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, awareness of fear led to reluctance in approaching a snake and in receiving an electric shock <xref rid="pone.0064959-Carver2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0064959-Scheier2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, and awareness of positive and negative emotions lead to changes in ratings of emotional images <xref rid="pone.0064959-Scheier3" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. More recently, simply labeling the emotional content of an image has been found to affect neural activity. Participants who label emotions in faces shown to them exhibit reduced amygdala activity relative to those in control conditions <xref rid="pone.0064959-Lieberman1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0064959-Creswell1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, suggesting a reduction in the emotional impact of those stimuli. Given the variety of awareness prompts that have been found to affect different aspects of emotional processing, we hypothesized that simply asking participants how they are feeling on various dimensions might affect their emotional reactions.</p><p>We measured participants&#x02019; cardiovascular responses during a difficult mental arithmetic task designed to elicit anger (a non self-conscious emotion), shame (a self-conscious emotion) or no emotion (i.e. a control condition; <xref rid="pone.0064959-Jamieson1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0064959-Mauss1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0064959-Mendes2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. We provide a discussion as to the identifiability and discriminability of the emotion inductions in the general discussion below). Previous research has shown that such protocols result in distinct cardiovascular profiles; relative to shame, anger is associated with larger increases in cardiac output (a volume based measure of oxygenated blood pumped by the heart) and lower vascular resistance <xref rid="pone.0064959-Herrald1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0064959-Jamieson2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0064959-Mendes2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. These patterns of cardiovascular reactivity allow for a putative distinction between emotional experiences without the need to ask participants for a subjective report. Self-report of emotion instead served as a second independent variable. We manipulated participants&#x02019; thoughts and feelings by having them rate their emotional state along several dimensions, as well as appraise their situations. Half of the participants were asked to report on their emotional states and appraisals at various times throughout the experiment, while the other half were asked control questions that did not require conscious assessment of their emotional state. We hypothesized that asking participants to report their emotions could change their physiological responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>One hundred and twelve residents of the Cambridge, MA area (67 females, <italic>M</italic>

Participants were recruited through online classifieds and were prescreened prior to scheduling their lab visit. We excluded participants if they had a history of diagnosed depression or anxiety, had a doctor-diagnosed heart murmur/arrhythmia, or were pregnant. Participants were randomly assigned to one of 6 conditions in a 2&#x000d7;3 design including 2 levels of the report factor (<italic>report</italic> vs. <italic>no-report</italic>), and 3 levels of the emotion factor (<italic>anger</italic> vs. <italic>shame</italic> vs. <italic>control</italic>).</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Procedure</title><p>After application of physiological sensors, participants sat quietly for a 5-minute baseline period. Then, those in the <italic>report</italic> condition were asked to rate how <italic>proud, annoyed, happy, self-conscious, frustrated, sad, enthusiastic, calm, embarrassed, excited, angry, alert, ashamed, and satisfied</italic> they felt, each on an analog scale anchored with endpoints &#x0201c;Not at all&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;A great deal.&#x0201d; They also rated the degree to which they disagreed or agreed to ten statements: <italic>I feel confident about my abilities, I am having trouble understanding the instructions given to me, I feel impatient with others, I feel that others respect and admire me, I want to argue with others, I am easily distracted by others, I feel uncomfortable when no one is speaking to me, I feel small, I can calm down easily,</italic> and <italic>I am losing my temper</italic>. For the <italic>no report</italic> condition we created a questionnaire that was neither emotional nor self-reflective in nature. Instead, in the <italic>no report</italic> condition participants answered the same number of questions about their technology use (e.g., &#x0201c;How often do you use a webcam?&#x0201d;) using the same response scales.</p><p>Following the self-report, participants completed a difficult arithmetic task either through prompts from a computer while alone in a room (in the control condition) or in the presence of an evaluator (in the anger and shame conditions). All participants were asked to count backwards in steps of seven or thirteen from five-digit numbers. (In order to maintain a steady level of difficulty for all participants, those who were able to countdown by more than 119 (i.e. 17 steps) in the first minute were asked to count in steps of 13 for subsequent iterations). In both emotion conditions (anger and shame), evaluators gave negative feedback after each performance block, implying that the participant was performing poorly on the counting task and that excessive movement was interfering with physiological signals. We manipulated anger and shame by changing the tone in which the experimenter delivered the feedback. In the anger condition, evaluators were trained to deliver the negative feedback in a way that made them sound annoyed and incompetent (using the technique described by <xref rid="pone.0064959-Mauss1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>). In the shame condition, the evaluators gave the same negative feedback, but in a tone that was warm and matter-of-fact. The warmth of the experimenter in the shame condition was intended to cause participants to like the experimenter, making it more difficult to discount the negative performance feedback. The emotion conditions were designed so that participants would attribute their poor performance in the task either externally to an unreasonable experimenter (anger condition), or internally, to themselves (shame condition), thus activating the core relational themes of the two emotions <xref rid="pone.0064959-Tracy1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0064959-Blascovich1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0064959-Weiner1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Feedback was given over an intercom in order to minimize differences between the two conditions. In the control condition, participants completed the task through prompts from a computer program and did not receive negative feedback.</p><p>After this manipulation, participants in the <italic>report</italic> condition completed a second emotion questionnaire identical to the one they had completed previously, and those in the <italic>no report</italic> condition completed another control questionnaire. We then introduced a second task&#x02013;a digit span task <xref rid="pone.0064959-Wechsler1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In each of 14 trials, the experimenter read a series of digits and asked participants to repeat those digits in reverse order. The number of digits started at two for the first trial and increased by one digit every other trial. During this time, the experimenter spoke in a neutral tone and did not provide any feedback. This period thus provided a window in which to analyze critical physiological measures, immediately following both manipulations, and during which emotion was not concurrently being manipulated <xref rid="pone.0064959-Blascovich1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0064959-Mendes1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>To conclude the experiment, participants in the emotion conditions also rated the degree to which they agreed or disagreed with the statements &#x0201c;The experimenter did his/her job professionally&#x02019;, &#x02018;I enjoyed my interaction with that experimenter&#x02019; and &#x02018;I think the experimenter is a likable person&#x02019; each on continuous analog scales coded on a range from &#x02212;100 to 100 and anchored with the terms &#x02018;Strongly Disagree&#x02019; and &#x02018;Strongly Agree.&#x02019;</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Physiological responses</title><p>Our primary physiological variables of interest were heart rate (HR), pre-ejection period (PEP), cardiac output (CO, the total volume of blood pumped by the heart per minute), and total peripheral resistance (TPR, an overall measure of vasodilation versus vasoconstriction in the arterioles). The first two measures provide indications of sympathetic nervous system activation (especially PEP), and the latter two provide distinctions between approach (i.e., challenge) and withdrawal (i.e., threat) motivational states and have been linked to anger and shame <xref rid="pone.0064959-Carver2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>

Heat rate was obtained using two spot sensors in a lead II configuration (right arm, left leg). Impedance cardiography utilized four adhesive mylar bands that completely encircled the participant&#x02019;s neck and torso. ECG and ICG signals were sampled at 1000 Hz. All data were visually inspected, artifacts were edited and then responses averaged in one-minute bins using Mindware software (Lafeyette, OH). All measures were continuous with the exception of blood pressure (BP), which was taken intermittently at pre-defined intervals, as frequent BP measurement might artificially elevate BP levels. Intermittent measurement of BP resulted in some data loss.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Behavioral coding</title><p>Because participant self-reports were used as one of the independent variables, we include observations of participants&#x02019; behavior as one of the emotion manipulation checks.

What our data do suggest is that the physiological differences observed in the anger conditions are of practical as well as theoretical import.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Limitations and Alternative Explanations</title><p>One limitation of the present study is that not all manipulation checks were able to differentiate the anger and shame conditions. Evaluations of the experimenter differed between the two emotion conditions, as did physiological response, and both are consistent with an anger and shame interpretation. Behavioral coding suggested that anger and shame differed from the control condition in consistent ways, but behavioral coding did not differentiate between anger and shame conditions. We chose to examine anger and shame because we could induce the pair with only a subtle change in manipulation, reducing the potential confound created by vastly different emotion manipulations. In doing so, we necessarily diminished the difference between the two manipulations. As a result, it is likely that some participants in our anger condition felt some shame, and that some participants in our shame condition felt some anger. The behavioral coding results may also reflect the fact that anger and shame are closely related emotions <xref rid="pone.0064959-Tangney1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>. Not only can the experience of shame lead one to anger <xref rid="pone.0064959-Lewis2" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>, but also the experience of anger can lead one to shame <xref rid="pone.0064959-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>.</p><p>The present research represents one of the first attempts to examine the effects of subjective reports on physiological reactivity stemming from an emotional experience, and many questions remain. Our approach, which investigated two emotions each with a single manipulation, cannot fully determine when emotions will be affected by report manipulations, and when they will not. Anger and shame differ in that anger is not a self-conscious emotion whereas shame is, but there are other differences between the emotions that might account for the differences observed. For example, reporting one&#x02019;s anger may comprise a greater violation of social desirability, resulting in an increase in threat stress response.</p><p>Another possibility is that shame did not show an effect of report because the shame manipulation was relatively weak. Identifying emotion strength with change in a single physiological measure &#x02013; for example, heart rate &#x02013; would imply that our manipulation of shame was weaker than our manipulation of anger. Such an inference, however, is fraught with theoretical issues <xref rid="pone.0064959-Larsen2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0064959-Levenson1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. In contrast to the physiological indicators, both self-reports and behavioral coding suggest that participants in the shame condition felt as much if not more emotion than those in the anger condition. These variables, however, require comparison on different response scales. In the end, as with any comparison of different emotions, it is difficult to conclude that either anger or shame manipulation was more effective.</p><p>Nor is it possible to conclusively identify rumination as the key mechanism whereby these effects occur. We favor rumination as a likely mechanism because it is consistent with both the differences in the effect of the self-report manipulation observed between anger and shame conditions, and with the specific physiological changes observed in anger. But we did not test for rumination directly. Another possible mechanism is that self-reports and appraisals serve to contextualize the emotion and thereby change the experience. That is, theories suggest that contextualization is a key component of emotional processes <xref rid="pone.0064959-Gendron1" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0064959-Lindquist1" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>. In making participants aware of their thoughts and feelings, self-reports may have served to change this aspect of emotional response. Though contextualization does not provide a clear prediction for differences between emotions, it nevertheless provides another avenue whereby self-reports may alter physiology.</p><p>Finally, our preliminary investigation leaves open the question of whether self-reports of emotion, self-reports of our additional statements, or both are necessary to shift physiological response in anger. We included both emotion reports and appraisals in our self-report questionnaire in order to force participants to introspect on their feelings. As a result, the present data do not allow us to tease their effects apart.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Conclusion</title><p>What we can conclude is that the act of reporting on emotional states can alter emotional response. Even the simplest verbal measures invoke self-awareness of psychological processes <xref rid="pone.0064959-Lieberman2" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, causing changes in the neural and physiological concomitants of emotion. When emotion manipulations are interrupted by self-report measures, thoughts that are characteristic of emotional response are likely to be replaced by awareness and introspection. As these thoughts change, so too does physiology, fundamentally altering the emotional response.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Allison Gaffey, Kristin Concannon, and our undergraduate research assistants and members of the Health and Psychophysiology Laboratory for their assistance in conducting the experiment, and Minnar Xie and Peter Mans for their assistance in preparation of figures and manuscript.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0064959-Feynman1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Feynman RP, Leighton RB, Sands N (1971) The Feynman lectures on physics (Vol 3).</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0064959-Barrett1"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
