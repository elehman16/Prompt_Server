Despite broad research aiming to improve muscle function as well as heart and brain function, sufficient therapeutic efficacy has not yet been achieved and current therapeutic management is still supportive. In a recent pilot trial, oral treatment with <sc>l</sc>-arginine and metformin showed consistent changes of muscular metabolism both in vitro and in vivo by raising NO levels and expression of mitochondrial proteins in the skeletal muscle tissue of patients with DMD. This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial aims to demonstrate the superiority of <sc>l</sc>-citrulline and metformin therapy over placebo in DMD patients with regard to the Motor Function Measure (MFM) D1 subscore (primary endpoint) as well as additional clinical and subclinical tests.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A total of 40&#x02013;50 ambulant patients with DMD will be recruited at the outpatient department of the University of Basel Children&#x02019;s Hospital (Switzerland), as well as from the DMD patient registries of Switzerland, Germany and Austria. Patients will be randomly allocated to one of the two arms of the study and will receive either a combination of <sc>l</sc>-citrulline and metformin or placebo for 26&#x000a0;weeks. Co-medication with glucocorticoids is allowed. The primary endpoint is the change of the MFM D1 subscore from baseline to week 26 under <sc>l</sc>-citrulline and metformin therapy. Secondary endpoints will include the motor function measure (MFM) and its items and subscores, the 6-minute walking test, timed function tests and quantitative muscle testing. Furthermore, quantitative muscle MRI assessment to evaluate the muscle fat fraction as well as safety and biomarker laboratory analyses from blood will be included. For comparison, muscle metabolism and mitochondrial function will be analysed in 10&#x02013;20 healthy age-matched male children.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The aim of this study is to test if a 6-month treatment of a combination of <sc>l</sc>-citrulline and metformin is more effective than placebo in preventing loss of motor function and muscle degeneration in DMD. The MFM D1 subscore is used as a clinical outcome measure and a quantitative muscle MRI assessment as the surrogate outcome measure of fatty muscle degeneration.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01995032?term=duchenne+l-citrulline&#x00026;rank=1">NCT01995032</ext-link>.

The disease-causing gene product, dystrophin, is present in many different tissues throughout the body; however, the disease pathology is predominantly seen in skeletal and heart muscle. Altered neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), mitochondrial dysfunction and increased intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) concentrations have previously been described as impairing cellular function in patients with DMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. NO stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis by increasing sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#x003b3; coactivator-1&#x003b1; (PGC-1&#x003b1;) concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and is also critical for regulating muscle energy balance by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. NO and AMPK may synergistically increase mitochondrial function and biogenesis through independent mechanisms. Therefore, impaired nNOS function likely contributes to the observed mitochondrial dysfunction in DMD. Children with DMD show an elevated synthesis of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), a diminished homoarginine (hArg) synthesis and a reduced NO bioavailability compared to healthy children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. To increase NO levels to stimulate mitochondrial function, reduce oxidative stress and improve fat utilisation for energy production appears to be a promising approach to ameliorate the disturbed muscle cell metabolism in DMD. Activation of nNOS in skeletal muscle is AMPK dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and there is significant evidence for a beneficial effect of AMPK activation in the <italic>mdx</italic> mouse model of DMD. Chronic AMPK stimulation triggers beneficial adaptations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and ameliorates the dystrophic phenotype in the <italic>mdx</italic> mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. One of the best-known pharmacological AMPK activators elevating AMPK concentrations in human skeletal muscle is metformin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Consistent with its described activation of AMPK, metformin stimulates PGC-1&#x003b1; expression in the <italic>mdx</italic> mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and protects skeletal muscle from degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In summary, there is evidence that metformin in its role as AMPK activator substitutes deficient nNOS function in patients with DMD. This is achieved by direct stimulation of nNOS and independent increase in PGC-1&#x003b1; expression, both stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis.</p><p>To test the hypothesis of a synergistic effect of NO and AMPK to stimulate mitochondrial function, we conducted a proof-of-concept pilot trial in five patients with DMD aged between 7 and 10&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. That study evaluated the subclinical and clinical benefits of a combined therapy with the NO precursor <sc>l</sc>-arginine, and the pharmacological AMPK activator and indirect nNOS stimulator metformin over a treatment period of 16&#x000a0;weeks. The results of this trial were encouraging, as the treatment in mostly steroid-na&#x000ef;ve patients showed increased NO formation in DMD muscle as expected. More importantly, we also observed a positive correlation between increased markers of NO concentration and mitochondrial protein expression, indicating a direct relation between intramuscular NO and mitochondrial protein expression in DMD muscle. Motor function measure (MFM) scores and walking distances improved, whereas ambulatory DMD patients older than 7&#x000a0;years usually show a high annual decrease of MFM total and D1 subscores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Despite the small number of patients, the MFM total score (+3.6&#x000a0;%) and the D1 subscore (+6.2&#x000a0;%) improved in comparison to published natural history data and data for the standard treatment with steroids. Untreated ambulatory DMD patients older than 7&#x000a0;years showed a median annual total MFM decrease of &#x02013;7.9&#x000a0;% (D1 subscore &#x02013;17.2&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Additional evidence for a disease-slowing effect of the combination treatment was provided by thigh muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, which did not show any significant increase of the thigh muscle or body fat fractions during the time of the study as expected, based on natural history data. This pilot trial could confirm the theoretical concept of an amelioration of muscular metabolism by stimulating mitochondrial function. However, the number of patients was too small to generate significant clinical evidence for a clear therapeutic effect. Thus, we will conduct a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled efficacy and safety study to prove efficacy of the treatment using clinical, laboratory and imaging outcome measures as endpoints.</p><p>Recently, it was shown that not only <sc>l</sc>-arginine, but also <sc>l</sc>-citrulline, increases nitric oxide generation in humans. Furthermore, the intake of <sc>l</sc>-citrulline leads to higher peak concentrations of <sc>l</sc>-arginine than an equivalent dose of <sc>l</sc>-arginine itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. <sc>l</sc>-citrulline is a precursor of <sc>l</sc>-arginine; three-fourths of <sc>l</sc>-citrulline are converted to <sc>l</sc>-arginine in the kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Single oral doses up to 15&#x000a0;g have been well tolerated without side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Supplementation of <sc>l</sc>-citrulline restores muscular <sc>l</sc>-arginine and reduces muscle wasting under <sc>l</sc>-arginine-deficient and low-protein intake conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Additionally, a direct protective effect of <sc>l</sc>-citrulline on protein metabolism and skeletal muscle mediated through the inducible NOS (iNOS) isoform has been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. These considerations led us to change administration of oral <sc>l</sc>-arginine to <sc>l</sc>-citrulline instead.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The study is an investigator-initiated, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled efficacy and safety trial and is conducted over a treatment period of 26&#x000a0;weeks. We plan to enroll 40&#x02013;50 ambulant patients with DMD aged between 6.5 and 10&#x000a0;years. Ethical approval has been obtained from the local ethics committee (Ethics Committee of Both Basel cantons (EKBB EK63/13)) and the National Swiss Drug Agency (Swissmedic). The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01995032) prior to starting recruitment. Patients and parents are being informed about preclinical data, alternative treatments, risks and possible benefits of the study. Oral informed assent from affected children and written informed consent from parents are being obtained. The participation in this study is voluntary. If the patient or the parents do not want to participate, they will not experience any disadvantages concerning further medical treatment. The same applies if parents and patients withdraw their consent at a later time. Patients or caregivers can withdraw their consent or withdraw from the study without giving any reason. In case of withdrawal, the data collected until this point of time will be used, and the (blood) samples collected in the context of the study will be destroyed. In case of withdrawal, the patient will undergo a final visit for medical examination for his own safety. To obtain normal values for measures of muscle metabolism and mitochondrial function, blood and urine samples are analysed in 10&#x02013;20 healthy age-matched male children.

However, most instruments can assess ambulant patients only, making adjustments and/or additional assessments necessary when the disease progresses. The MFM, a validated assessment tool to measure motor function in both ambulant and non-ambulant patients with neuromuscular disorders, was developed in 2005 in France. It includes 32 items that evaluate three dimensions of motor performance, including specific motor functions, such as transfers and standing posture (D1), proximal and axial (D2), distal (D3) and a total MFM score involving all of the motor dimensions. The items are scored and summarised to comprise a total score, in which the maximum score represents normal motor function. The instruction manual, validation examinations and other publications using the MFM can be downloaded at the MFM website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.motor-function-measure.org/home.aspx">http://www.motor-function-measure.org/home.aspx</ext-link>). In a recent study, the annual decrease of the total score was 5.8&#x000a0;% for patients with DMD, indicating an overall decline in motor capacities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, independent examination of the D1, D2 and D3 subscores provided more information depending on the stage of the disease. In ambulant DMD patients, D1 was the most informative score, with a mean decrease of 17.2&#x000a0;% per year before loss of ambulation in patients aged 6&#x000a0;years and older. D1 seems to us to be particularly interesting because it is related to loss of ambulation and is responsive to short-term changes (3&#x000a0;months) and should provide sufficient information in a 6-month trial. Consistent with this, in our previous 16-week <sc>l</sc>-arginine and metformin pilot trial in ambulant patients with DMD, the D1 subscore provided the best effect size of all evaluated clinical parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Secondary outcome measures</title><sec id="FPar2"><title>Change of MFM total score, the D2 and D3 MFM subscores from baseline to week 26 under <sc>l</sc>-citrulline/metformin therapy</title><p>According to Bushby et al.

The 6MWT has been validated for use in DMD trials and measures the distance an individual is able to walk over a total of 6&#x000a0;minutes on a hard, flat surface. The goal for the person is to walk as far as possible in 6&#x000a0;minutes. The individual is allowed to self-pace and rest as needed as they traverse back and forth along a marked walkway. Data from 112 DMD patients aged 4&#x02013;17 years in an Italian cohort showed that the 6MWT performances increased (approximately 33&#x000a0;m/year) with age up to 7&#x000a0;years, with a clear point of slope change at approximately 7&#x000a0;years. After the age of 7&#x000a0;years, there was a variable decline in the 6MWT (&#x02013;12&#x000a0;m/year) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="FPar4"><title>Change of quantitative muscle MRI including muscle fat fraction and T2 times of thigh muscles visualised by MRI</title><p>In muscular dystrophies quantitative muscle MRI (qMRI) detects disease progression more sensitively compared to other clinical scores.

In each of these individual data sets, each patient was randomly assigned to the verum or a placebo group. For each patient, the post-treatment value was calculated as the sum of the baseline value and a random variate drawn from a normal distribution. Its standard deviation was estimated from the pilot data. For the placebo group, the mean change from baseline was set to &#x02013;17.2/52&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;16&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02013;5.3 (value taken from Table 2 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]). (The value from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] refers to changes within one year, i.e. approximately 52&#x000a0;weeks, and the pilot study lasted 16&#x000a0;weeks, thus the linear transformation of the values by /52&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;16.) For the verum group, the mean change from baseline was varied from 1 to 10 (in the pilot data, the mean change from baseline was 6.1). The resulting data set was analysed with an ANCOVA model (as outlined in the next section). The proportion of repetitions with a significant outcome corresponds to the estimated power. Assuming a drop-out rate of 10&#x000a0;%, a significance level of 0.05 and a power of 0.8, 47 patients should be recruited in order to be able to analyse 42 complete data sets.

If the combined treatment of <sc>l</sc>-citrulline and metformin is proven to be effective, it will offer a new symptomatic treatment option to slow muscular decline and therefore extend the time of free ambulation.</p><p>Planning clinical trials in DMD is challenging for the following reasons. (1) Disease progression does not follow a linear course when physical abilities are measured. Longitudinal studies using clinical measurements showed an improvement of gross and fine motor function up to the age of 6 to 7&#x000a0;years, then a plateau phase up to the age of 10 and then a phase of rapid decline during which free ambulation is lost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. (2) DMD is a rare disease, making recruitment for clinical trials difficult. (3) Clinical assessment is dependent on cooperation and often differs between ambulant and non-ambulant patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Several motor function or timed motor performance tests are validated to assess disease progression in DMD, such as the Northstar Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], the 6-minute walking distance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The Motor Function Measure (MFM) is a validated clinical score recommended in the guidelines on the clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of DMD published by the European Medicines Agency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Its interrater variability is low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It was shown to be highly correlated to age in patients with DMD and was even to some extent predictive for loss of ambulation in these patients. Loss of ambulation was shown to occur about one year after the MFM total score dropped below 70&#x000a0;%, or a drop in D1 subscore below 40&#x000a0;%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A main advantage of the MFM over other commonly used motor function or timed motor performance tests is that it can be used continuously throughout the course of a disease regardless of the severity of the disease and the patient&#x02019;s ambulatory status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p>Recently, we demonstrated that out of all analysed clinical measures, the MFM D1 subscore showed the most significant decline in ambulant DMD patients &#x0003e;7&#x000a0;years, resulting in the highest effect size and the lowest required patient numbers to treat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This score also seems to be particularly interesting because of its relation to loss of ambulation and its responsiveness to short-term changes. Therefore, to test our approach we selected the MFM D1 as the (primary) endpoint for the selected population of ambulant patients with DMD. For sample size estimation using the MFM D1 subscore as primary endpoint and assuming a drop-out rate of 10&#x000a0;%, a randomisation ratio of 1:1 and a power of 0.8, 42 patients should be recruited in order to be able to analyse 38 complete data sets. To be able to recruit sufficient patients in a reasonable time we choose to include patients with a walking distance of more than 150&#x000a0;m in 6&#x000a0;minutes. This is not optimal and is likely to include patients in a stable as well as a more unstable phase. Therefore, predefined subgroup analysis of patients walking more (stable group) or less (unstable group) than 350&#x000a0;m in the 6MWT has been planned.</p><p>To further increase the sensitivity to detect whether our intervention has a beneficial effect on muscle degeneration, we will use thigh muscle qMRI as a surrogate biomarker as the most important secondary endpoint. A surrogate (imaging) outcome measure must provide evidence of whether the treatment provides a clinically meaningful benefit. Therefore, it must (1) correlate with the clinical endpoint, (2) be sensitive to the effects of the intervention, (3) be clinically relevant to the disease and the treatment and (4) be readily measurable and interpretable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The qMRI fulfils all these conditions, if protocols for qMRI are set up in advance with regard to patient positioning, slice selection and ROI delineation, and if the technical staff performing the examination and evaluation have been trained accordingly. Recently we demonstrated that in comparison to clinical endpoints the effect sizes of qMRI were much larger in DMD patients; e.g. sample size estimations for qMRI data were up to 17 times smaller compared to the MFM total score and up to 7 times for the D1 subscore, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Thus, in case our sample size estimation (using the clinical endpoint) was inaccurately low, qMRI should still be able to detect whether our intervention can affect disease progression positively.</p><p>The determination of normal values of markers of muscle metabolism and mitochondrial function in blood and urine in an age-matched healthy cohort will allow a better integration of an eventual stimulation of NO concentration and reduction of oxidative stress in treated patients with DMD.</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial started enrolment in January 2014 and is expected to be completed by the end of May 2016.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>6MWT, 6-minute walking test; 8OHDG, 8ydroxydeoxyguanosine; ADMA, asymmetric dimethylarginine; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; Ca<sup>2+</sup>, calcium; DMD, Duchenne muscular dystrophy; hArg, homoarginine; MFF, muscle fat fraction; MFM, motor function measure; nNOS, neuronal nitric oxide synthase; NO, nitric oxide; PGC-1&#x003b1;, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#x003b3; coactivator-1&#x003b1;; qMRI, quantitative muscle MRI; QMT, quantitative muscle testing; SIRT1, sirtuin 1; TFT, timed function tests</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec24"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2016_1503_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>SPIRIT checklist.
