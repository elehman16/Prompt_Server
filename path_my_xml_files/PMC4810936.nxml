Mechanical ventilation is a cornerstone in management of ARDS patients. Low tidal volume combined with adequate positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) has been shown to reduce mortality.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] An open lung or lung volume recruitment maneuver (LVRM) is a procedure to recruit collapsed alveoli. It may be achieved by a brief raising of transpulmonary pressure to higher levels than that achieved during normal ventilation.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] It has been recommended as a useful tool to re-open collapsed lung regions, promoting homogeneity within the lungs, and eventually improve oxygenation. Recent review including our previous work had shown that using high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) was better, less barotraumas and unlikely to cause harm compared to conventional ventilation (CV).[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] It is characterized by the rapid delivery of small tidal volume of gas combined with high mean airway pressure (mPaw). Thus, it may be an ideal model for lung protective strategy.</p><p>Although several experimental studies have shown a positive effect of LVRM on oxygenation, clinical studies are currently controversies. Two recent randomized control clinical trials in adult ARDS have failed to show benefits of its use compared to CV.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Too high intrathoracic pressures applied during LVRM to expand the collapsed lung unit may cause further barotraumas as well as biological sequelae such as cytokines upregulation, and translocation may have clinical deterioration occurring following LVRM.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In addition, suboptimal technique, inadequate sedation, and muscle relaxant or uncontrol of fluid balance could be responsible for this failure.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Thus, it was our desire to study the clinical benefits of using LVRM with HFOV compared with CV with LVRM in children with severe ARDS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Design</title><p>This was a prospective, randomized control trial.

The PICU is a 10-bedded unit in the tertiary care referral center. They were enrolled by blocked randomization before start of the study. Nine children were randomly to CV with LVRM, and another nine children were allocated to HFOV with open lung technique group.</p><p>HFOV protocol used in this study was approved by our Institutional Review Board. Informed consents were obtained from the parents prior to their evaluation for HFOV therapy.

Starting mPaw at 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O (or used 35 cm H<sub>2</sub>O for subjects body weight [BW] &#x0003e;35 kg), the continuous distending pressure was sustained for 20 s (or 30 s for subjects BW &#x0003e;35 kg). Then, the piston started together with gradually weaned down mPaw to the target level (+5&#x02013;8 cm H<sub>2</sub>O above previous mPaw of CV), and other ventilator settings were adjusted accordingly base on clinical response. The initial pressure amplitude was set at 3 &#x000d7; mPaw of continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV), and frequency was set according to age. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) was gradually reduced stepwise to keep SpO<sub>2</sub> above 92%. The LVRM procedure was repeated if SpO<sub>2</sub> was below 95% with FiO<sub>2</sub> of 1. After 1 h, the initial arterial blood gas was obtained and ventilator settings were adjusted accordingly. Hypotension was defined as a 25% decreased in baseline mean arterial pressure (MAP).</p><p>Nine children were enrolled to CV with lung volume recruitment by using either Servo I or Bennett 840 ventilators as per protocol.

HFOV is an alternative mode of mechanical ventilator that helps to improve oxygenation. A recent consensus management of pediatric ARDS is recommended to use HFOV with incremental LVRM in severe form. It is, however, different than our technique that used decremental LVRM. Our previous study demonstrated applying decremental lung volume recruitment together with HFOV is effective and well-tolerated in pediatric ARDS. Recent publication investigated in adult ARDS failed to demonstrate benefit of using HFOV compared to CV. Nevertheless, there were lots of pitfalls regarding these particular trials and required further study. At present, there are very few studies involving LVRM in children, and there is none compared HFOV with CV in the same trial. Our study is the first prospective randomized control trial in severe Pediatric ARDS investigated clinical outcomes compared between HFOV and CV with decremental LVRM. We found a rapid and significant improvement in gas exchange evidence by improving PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> (138 &#x000b1; 49.7, 69 &#x000b1; 56.8%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and significant reduced oxygen requirement at 1 h after LVRM compared to CV. It is also in agreement with recent report from neonate and some adult studies.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] There was no significant difference in basic hemodynamic data compare between HFOV and CV following LVRM.</p><p>Ferguson <italic>et al</italic>. was the first to explore the benefit of using HFOV combined with decremental LVRM protocol in adult ARDS.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] They showed that using combination of HFOV with LVRM resulted in rapid and sustained improvement of oxygenation. Tingay <italic>et al</italic>. and De Jaegere <italic>et al</italic>. also demonstrated significant improvement in oxygenation by utilizing HFOV with LVRM in neonatal RDS whereas using different techniques.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Recent large multicenter clinical trials in adult ARDS has failed to demonstrate benefit of using HFOV over CV with LVRM protocol. This may explain the difference in physiologic alteration during HFOV in adult patients with ARDS or suboptimal technique of using HFOV. In general, patients who are on HFOV would require high dose of sedation and often need paralysis to ensure synchronize in ventilation. Both of these particular trials used muscle relaxant in only 50% of their patients. This common practice could make hemodynamic together with oxygenation in these patients more fluctuation and difficult to control. It also would lead to increase requirement of fluid bolus and vasopressors. The fixed oxygenation/mPaw table is also troublesome. In addition, more positive fluid balance is well known for increasing morbidity and mortality in patients with ARDS.</p><p>An open lung approach with higher levels of PEEP together with lung volume recruitment with protective ventilation strategy in CV should increase the end-expiratory lung volume through alveolar recruitment to avoid cyclic alveolar derecruitment. There were several reports of clinical responses following LVRM in ARDS patients,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] but there was very few in pediatrics. Moreover, its benefit and clinical efficacy have not been compared with HFOV in children with severe ARDS. Another recent publication strongly demonstrated the efficacy of HFOV over CV in management of extremely premature newborn with RDS by showing those who received HFOV had superior lung function at 11&#x02013;14 years of age. Our ARDS mortality in this trial is at 11% (2/18) which is better compared to recent report from ESPNIC group (17%).[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Three (3/9, 33%) patients in CV group had to cross-over to HFOV group and could eventually extubated. Thus, our study confirmed the clinical benefit of using HFOV in neonatal or children with severe respiratory failure.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] However, this study had some limitations such as our small sample size and represented only one center.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study showed the oxygenation benefit of using HFOV over CV with LVRM in severe pediatric ARDS.
