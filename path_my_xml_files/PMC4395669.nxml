muscular strength could aid firefighters with chronic lower back pain. [Subjects] The
research subjects were randomly assigned to two groups, the experimental group (n=8) and
the control (n=8). [Methods] The experimental group performed two types of exercise
programs four times per week for 8 weeks under supervision. Tests were performed before
and after the 8 weeks of exercise in accordance with the Korea Occupational Safety and
Health Agency&#x02019;s program. [Results] At the end of the 8 weeks of the rehabilitation
program, abdominal muscular strength were significantly increased in the experimental
group, and this indicates that the exercise therapy was effective for improvement of
muscular strength. [Conclusion] We found that exercise therapy is an effective
intervention that can reduce the pain of patients with chronic lower back pain. The
firefighters with chronic lower back pain who participated in this study exhibited
enhanced lower back muscular strength and obtained some additional benefits. They need
regular exercise.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Firefighters</kwd><kwd>Lower back pain</kwd><kwd>Muscular strength</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The activities of firefighters mainly include the use of firehoses, manual lifting, or

of exercises on fire fighter with low back pain who had experienced health risks due to
exposure to various adult diseases and illnesses, but the number of studies on back strength
are still rare. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of conventional
low back pain rehabilitation programs on firefighters who complained of low back pain by
analyzing how the program affects their back strength.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>All subjects of this study were the fire fighters. They were selected based on a body fat

focused on muscular strength (abdominal muscles, back muscles), flexibility, and balance.
The exercise duration was 10 seconds per repetition with three for weeks 1&#x02013;4, 12 seconds per
repetition with three repetitions for weeks 5&#x02013;6, and 15 seconds per repetitions with three
repetitions for weeks 7&#x02013;8, and the exercises were performed twice a day, four days a week.
We ensured that the subjects performed all of the exercises before and after the 8 weeks of
the exercise program. All the subjects underwent measurement of abdominal muscular strength,
and back muscular strength was measured by sit-ups holding and sit-arch back holding.
Subjects were each told their body to attach on the floor with knees at a right angle
upright. They were then told to hold their pose with raise upper body and hands on their
chest. For back muscular strength, subjects were told to lay face down and attach their body
to the floor. They were then told to put their hands on their head with their pose hold with
shoulders upward with maximally. We measured the elapsed time of each test. All subjects
were given 1 trial for each test. All experiments were reviewed and approved by the
Committee of the Ethics Kangwon National University. The pre-intervention and
post-intervention data were examined using the paired t-test for comparisons within each
group of subjects, and the independent t-test was used for comparisons between the groups.

The mechanical factors
of lower back pain are the spine, muscles surrounding the spine, ligaments, the sacroiliac
joint, nerves, the periosteum, and discs<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>It is essential for people with chronic low back pain to strength the low back muscles and
to increase in lumbar flexibility.</p><p>The treatment for chronic low back pain can vary depending on the type and source of pain.
Considering their job duties, low back pain in firefighters&#x02019; low back pain may originate
from injuries, job stress, or loading on different structures of the body. Weight training
is a physical activity that raises contractible or extensible contraction by using fixed or
adjustable resistance and utilizes free weight equipment including barbells or dumbbells, or
contractible or adjustable resistance machines. The effect of training has been shown in
precedent studies. Many researchers use a weight training program to investigate the effects
of exercise on low back pain. Pollock and Gettman<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that weight training was a significant method for people
with low back pain. Similar to this finding, Lee<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> used a resistance exercise and lumbar stabilizing exercise in
increase lumbar strength and to reduce pain. These two researchers found the effects of
weight bearing exercise enhanced lower back muscle strength. The present study analyzed
whether a rehabilitation program for firefighters with chronic low back pain would reduce
muscle pain and enhance muscle function in subjects complaining of back pain for more than 6
months without surgical treatment and neurologic abnormalities. We measured muscle pain with
the following question.</p><p>How do you think the results of the isometric strength test will relate to the muscular
strength necessary for firefighting? It is well documented that isometric strength exercises
only show an increase in strength within a 20 degree range on either side of the position at
which it was measured.</p><p>In the present study, the experimental group showed significantly increased abdominal
muscular strength compared with the control group. This finding indicated that the
stretching type rehabilitation program would have some additional benefits for firefighters.
Henchoz et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted a randomized
controlled trial with a 3-month exercise program. They analyzed the effects of an exercise
program on patients with chronic low back pain who had completed functional
multidisciplinary rehabilitation. The participants underwent 12-weeks of exercise program
and showed improvements in disability score and trunk muscle strength.</p><p>Compared with previous studies, weight training exercises were found to enhance isometric
muscle function, which hints that there would be various factors relating to this
finding.</p><p>The improvement of muscle strength can come with the increase of muscle size as a
priority.</p><p>Although, weight bearing exercise programs have many additional health benefits for low
back patients, our study focused on 8-types of back stretching exercise. An increase in low
back muscle flexibility would maximize the low back muscular strength, preventing low back
pain and reducing the risk of injuries<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, muscular flexibility and balanced growth of muscular strength are the fundamental
elements for of building a correct posture<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is necessary to increase muscular strength and muscular
endurance of the lumbar region including the abdominal muscular strength and back muscular
strength to help maintain correct postures, and this will reduce the dynamic loads on the
vertebra and tissues around the spine<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This current study used the exercise program conducted by the Korea Occupational Safety and
Health Agency. Although the results indicated that patients improved their low back pain,
further, more specific and diverse experiments and research are necessary with regard to how
exercises can be integrated into an ideal physical activity program that is suitable for a
person&#x02019;s own characteristics.</p><p>The results might indicate that low back pain suffers change their posture by increasing
the strength of the back muscle. This could mean that those with increasing pelvic tilt are
more at risk of having back pain. Further study is recommended to investigate this
relationship in subjects with moderate to severe disabilities.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>KD</given-names></name><name><surname>Ju</surname><given-names>SB</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>The effect of physical fitness and lumbar back strength of
