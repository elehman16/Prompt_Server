In addition, they must have had either (i) CKD [with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) determined by a local laboratory of &#x0003c;60 mL/min] and were receiving one or more HF therapies (ACE-Is, ARBs, beta-blockers); or (ii) a documented history of hyperkalaemia that led to discontinuation of therapy with an AA, ACE-I, ARB, or beta-blocker within 6 months prior to the baseline visit.

All participating sites received approval from their locally appointed ethics committee (or equivalent); all patients provided informed written consent, and the study was performed in accordance with current local and national regulations, the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and other applicable requirements governing the conduct of human clinical trials. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, with an identifier of NCT00868439.</p><p>Patients who completed screening and satisfied the eligibility criteria proceeded to baseline assessments, which included review of medical and medication histories, a physical examination, including weight, resting vital signs, and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), determination of serum K<sup>+</sup> (performed by both local and central laboratories), and clinical laboratory tests (including serum chemistry, haematology, and urinalysis); in addition, women of child-bearing potential had a serum pregnancy test.</p><p>Following baseline assessments, patients who continued to meet eligibility criteria were randomized 1:1 to RLY5016 or placebo treatment in a blinded fashion. Patients were instructed to take 15 g of study drug orally in the morning and evening (for a total daily dose of 30 g) and to mix study drug (supplied as a powder) with water or a low-potassium food prior to administration. Patients were also instructed to start spironolactone at a dose of 25 mg/day. After 2 weeks (i.e. on Day 15), spironolactone was increased to 50 mg/day if the patient's serum K<sup>+</sup> was &#x0003e;3.5 to &#x02264;5.1 mEq/L; the dose remained at 25 mg/day if the serum K<sup>+</sup> level was &#x0003e;5.1 to &#x02264;5.5 mEq/L; and patients were discontinued from the study if their serum K<sup>+</sup> was &#x02264;3.5 or &#x0003e;5.5 mEq/L.</p><p>Prohibited medications during the study included polymer-based drugs, other phosphate or K<sup>+</sup> binders, K<sup>+</sup> sparing medications, antacids, calcium or K<sup>+</sup> supplements, and intravenous cardioactive medications.</p><p>Throughout the 4-week treatment period, assessments of efficacy and safety were performed routinely. Serum K<sup>+</sup> was monitored at each clinic visit on Days 3, 7, 14, 17, 21, and 28. Serum chemistry, body weight, and vital signs were assessed on Days 7, 14, 21, and 28; haematology on Days 14 and 28; and 12-lead ECGs and assessments of concomitant medications and adverse events (AEs) were performed at each clinic visit.</p><p>All AEs encountered during the study and through 7 days following completion of study treatment were recorded.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Clinical endpoints</title><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change of serum K<sup>+</sup> from baseline to the end of the study (Day 28). Secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients with serum K<sup>+</sup> &#x0003e;5.5 mEq/L at any time during the trial and the proportion of patients whose spironolactone dose could be increased to 50 mg/day. Serum K<sup>+</sup> data measured at a central laboratory were used for the efficacy analysis. The safety of RLY5016 was assessed by the incidence of AEs or clinically significant changes from baseline in clinical laboratory values, vital signs, and ECG parameters.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A sample size of &#x0223c;100 patients (50 patients per treatment group) was determined to ensure at least 90 patients (45 patients per treatment group) would be available with primary efficacy data for analysis. This sample size had 90% power to detect a difference of 0.7 mEq/L in the mean change of serum K<sup>+</sup> from baseline to the endpoint [last observation carried forward (LOCF)] between two treatment groups. This calculation was based on a two-sided two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test with a 1:1 sample size allocation ratio, a standard deviation (SD) of 1 mEq/L, and a significance level of &#x003b1; = 0.05.</p><p>Efficacy and safety analyses were performed on the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population, defined as all randomized patients who received study medication and had available efficacy data. All mITT patients were included in the primary and secondary efficacy analyses. Baseline measurement was the last available measurement obtained prior to the start of treatment. The endpoint was obtained at Day 28 post-treatment or was derived based on the LOCF method for missing data.</p><p>A parallel lines analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was used for the analysis of the primary efficacy measurement. This ANCOVA model included treatment and region factors, and baseline serum K<sup>+</sup> as a covariate. The least squares (LS) estimate of the mean change in serum K<sup>+</sup> of each treatment and its 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. In addition, the LS estimate of the difference between RLY5016 treatment and placebo treatment (RLY5016 treatment minus placebo) and its 95% CI was calculated. Patients from all study centres were pooled for the analysis of the categorical outcome data. For the analysis of the dichotomous outcome data, a two-sample <italic>Z</italic>-test on two proportions between RLY5016 treatment and placebo treatment was performed. The difference between two proportions (RLY5016 treatment minus placebo) and its 95% CI were calculated. Adverse event analyses were performed for the safety population, which included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. The two-sided Fisher exact test was used to compare the incidence of AEs between two treatment groups. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Patient characteristics</title><p>Study data were collected between June 2009 and November 2009. A total of 120 patients were randomized (60 to each treatment group) and 105 patients (63 men and 42 women with a mean age of 68 years) received at least one dose of study drug (56 received RLY5016 and 49 placebo) (<italic>Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="EHQ502F1">1</xref></italic>). One patient randomized to RLY5016 received one dose of study drug but did not return to the clinic within the protocol-specified time period and was therefore not evaluable for efficacy. This patient was excluded from the mITT population, but included in the safety population.

Patients had a history of HF with a mean duration of just over 4 years, and an ejection fraction of &#x0223c;40%. Most patients were classified as NYHA class II or III. About one-third of patients had diabetes and the baseline eGFR for all patients was 81 &#x000b1; 33 mL/min (calculated based on assessments by a central laboratory). At baseline, four patients (4%) had severe renal impairment (eGFR &#x0003c;30 mL/min) and 28 patients (27%) had an eGFR &#x0003c;60 mL/min. Eleven patients (15%) had HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF; LVEF &#x02265;50%), 5 in placebo and 6 in the RLY5016 group. Two RLY5016-treated patients with HFPEF were included due to a history of hyperkalaemia that resulted in discontinuation of a RAAS blocker or beta-adrenergic blocking agent.

Reasons for discontinuation were attributed to AEs (four patients from the RLY5016 group and two from the placebo group); death (one patient in the placebo group); protocol-specified discontinuation criteria (two RLY5016 patients and three placebo patients); protocol non-compliance (one RLY5016 patient); investigator decision (one RLY5016 patient); randomization error (one placebo patient); and elective withdrawal (one placebo patient).

For patients with a baseline eGFR &#x0003c;60 mL/min, the difference between treatment groups was 3.31 mL/min (<italic>P</italic>= 0.61), and for patients with a baseline eGFR &#x02265;60 mL/min, the difference between groups was 1.06 mL/min (<italic>P</italic>= 0.78).</p><p>There were no significant changes on blood pressure or heart rate from baseline to the end of treatment at Day 28 between treatment groups. Furthermore, there were no clinically meaningful treatment-related changes observed for ECGs or physical examinations.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This first prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of RLY5016 to prevent hyperkalaemia in chronic HF patients receiving standard therapy, including an ACE-I or ARB and a beta-adrenergic blocking agent in addition to spironolactone 25&#x02013;50 mg/day, demonstrated that RLY5016 significantly decreased serum K<sup>+</sup>, reduced the incidence of hyperkalaemia, and increased the proportion of patients in whom the dose of spironolactone could be increased to 50 mg/day. These results were obtained in patients with HF and concomitant CKD, as well as in patients with HF and a history of hyperkalaemia requiring prior discontinuation of a RAAS blocking agent.</p><p>A 30 g/day dose of RLY5016 significantly reduced serum K<sup>+</sup> relative to placebo, with a difference between treatment groups of 0.45 mEq/L. Furthermore, RLY5016 prevented the development of hyperkalaemia (serum K<sup>+</sup> &#x0003e;5.5 mEq/L), and allowed a significantly greater percentage of patients to be up-titrated from 25 mg/day to 50 mg/day of spironolactone compared with placebo (91 vs. 74%, <italic>Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="EHQ502TB2">2</xref></italic>). The significant reduction in serum K<sup>+</sup> in patients randomized to 30 g/day of RLY5016 was observed within 2 days of initiating treatment and persisted throughout the 4-week course of the study (<italic>Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="EHQ502F2">2</xref></italic>).</p><p>In the subgroup of patients with HF and a history of hyperkalaemia requiring prior discontinuation of a RAAS blocker, but without concomitant CKD, the mean increase in serum K<sup>+</sup> and the incidence of hyperkalaemia following administration of spironolactone 25&#x02013;50 mg/day was relatively low in patients assigned to placebo (<italic>Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="EHQ502TB5">5</xref></italic>). The explanation for the relatively small increase in serum K<sup>+</sup> and low incidence of hyperkalaemia despite administration of 25&#x02013;50 mg/day of spironolactone in these patients is uncertain. In contrast, in the subgroup of patients with HF and concomitant CKD (baseline eGFR &#x0003c;60 mL/min), the incidence of hyperkalaemia after receiving spironolactone was 39% among patients taking placebo compared with 7% among patients taking RLY5016 (<italic>Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="EHQ502TB4">4</xref></italic>).</p><p>RLY5016 at 30 g/day was relatively well tolerated over the 4-week course of the study. Gastrointestinal side effects, generally mild or moderate in nature, were the most common side effects reported and occurred at a higher incidence on RLY5016 compared with placebo (<italic>Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="EHQ502TB6">6</xref></italic>). Treatment with RLY5016 caused a 6% incidence of hypokalaemia (serum K<sup>+</sup> &#x0003c;3.5 mEq/L) and a 47% incidence of a serum K<sup>+</sup> &#x0003c;4.0 mEq/L (<italic>Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="EHQ502TB2">2</xref></italic>), a difference of 37% compared with the incidence in the placebo group. A serum K<sup>+</sup> &#x0003c;3.5 mEq/L has long been recognized as an important risk factor for death in patients with HFREF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ502C15">15</xref></sup> Recent data have suggested that a serum K<sup>+</sup> &#x0003c;4.0 mEq/L, and even a serum K<sup>+</sup> &#x0003c;4.0 but &#x0003e;3.5 mEq/L, may also be associated with an increase in mortality in patients with HFREF and concomitant CKD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ502C16">16</xref></sup> Additionally, hypomagnesaemia (serum Mg<sup>2+</sup> &#x0003c;1.8 mg/dL) occurred in 24% of the patients and in two of the three hypokalaemic patients (serum K<sup>+</sup> &#x0003c;3.5 mEq/L). Hypomagnesaemia is associated with ventricular arrhythmias and may increase mortality risk in patients with hypokalaemia.</p><p>RLY5016 has a novel chemical composition that promotes ionization of the polymeric potassium-binding moiety under pH conditions present along the extent of the GI tract, particularly in the colon. As a result of this chemical structure, RLY5016 exchanges monovalent (Na<sup>+</sup>) and divalent cations (Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>) through the length of the GI tract and preferentially binds K<sup>+</sup> in the colon where the concentration of this cation is substantially higher than that of Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, or Mg<sup>2+</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ502C17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ502C18">18</xref></sup> The net effect of RLY5016-potassium binding in the colon is a reduction in serum K<sup>+</sup> under hyperkalaemic conditions, where increased K<sup>+</sup> secretion through BK channels represents an adaptive response to elevated serum K<sup>+</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ502C19">19</xref></sup></p><p>The RLY5016 polymer is synthesized as a 100 &#x000b5;m bead, with optimized flow and viscosity properties. RLY5016 is not administered with a cathartic, has not been associated with the occurrence of bowel necrosis, and has not been found to interfere with the absorption of drugs that are commonly administrated to patients with HF and CKD, with the exception of a 30% reduction in the bioavailability of valsartan and rosiglitazone in preclinical co-administration studies in rats (data on file).</p><p>RLY5016 binds soluble potassium in the GI tract, thereby effecting movement of K<sup>+</sup> from the serum into the intestinal lumen and ultimately reducing total body potassium by increasing fecal potassium excretion. Previous studies have demonstrated that the relationship between total body potassium and serum K<sup>+</sup> is non-linear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ502C20">20</xref></sup> When serum K<sup>+</sup> exceeds a &#x02018;buffering zone&#x02019; in the normal range (serum K<sup>+</sup> of 4.0&#x02013;5.0 mEq/L), then relatively small changes in total body potassium cause exaggerated changes in serum K<sup>+</sup>. Analysis of data from previous RLY5016 preclinical and clinical studies have shown that a fixed dose of RLY5016 has a greater serum K<sup>+</sup> reducing effect at higher serum K<sup>+</sup> values than at lower serum K<sup>+</sup> values (data on file). Based on the relationship between serum K<sup>+</sup> and changes in total body K<sup>+</sup> (mEq),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ502C20">20</xref></sup> it is predicted that at a serum K<sup>+</sup> of 6.5 mEq/L, a 30 g/day dose of RLY5016 that provides &#x0223c;25 mEq/day extra excretion of fecal K<sup>+</sup> will reduce serum K<sup>+</sup> to 5.5 mEq/L, whereas at a serum K<sup>+</sup> level of 4.0 mEq/L the same dose of RLY5016 will reduce serum K<sup>+</sup> to only 3.8 mEq/L. This suggests that RLY5016 may not cause hypokalaemia in patients with levels of serum K<sup>+</sup> greater than selected for the present study, such as those with hyperkalaemia.</p><p>Given the characteristics of the study, several limitations are apparent. LVEF was not a criterion for entry and on average, the patients in this study had less severe HF (and a higher LVEF than those included in RALES), therefore some of the patients did not meet current ESC/AHA/ACC-HF guideline recommendations for initiation of AA treatment. Additionally, the sample size was relatively small, the duration of the study was limited to 4 weeks of treatment, and a single dose of RLY5016 was evaluated.</p><p>The risk of a serum K<sup>+</sup> &#x0003e;5.5 mEq/L was emphasized by a recent study of over 245 000 patients in the Veterans Administration system who had a measurement of serum K<sup>+</sup> and on follow-up were found to have a significantly increased risk of death (with an odds ratio of 10.32) within 1 day of having a serum K<sup>+</sup> &#x0003e;5.5 mEq/L.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ502C21">21</xref></sup> While CKD has been shown to be an important predictor of hyperkalaemia in patients receiving multiple RAAS blockers, recent studies have found that patients with HF and normal kidney function, especially those with the NR3C2 215G genotype, may also develop hyperkalaemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ502C22">22</xref></sup> despite the finding that serum K<sup>+</sup> tends to decrease with the severity of HF in patients with normal kidney function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHQ502C23">23</xref></sup> While the acute treatment of hyperkalaemia associated with ECG changes characteristic of hyperkalaemia and or ventricular arrhythmias will likely continue to rely on the use of dialysis and other accepted strategies, the current results with RLY5016 in patients with HF and CKD suggest that it may be possible to avoid the need for dialysis in some patients. Longer term studies with a greater numbers of participants will be necessary to determine the long-term efficacy and tolerability of RLY5016 both for the prevention of hyperkalaemia as well as its treatment once it occurs. In addition, dose ranging studies will be required to avoid trading the risks of hyperkalaemia for those of hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by <funding-source>Relypsa, Inc.</funding-source> Funding to pay the Open Access publication charge for this article was provided by Relypsa Inc.</p><p><bold>Conflict of interest:</bold> B.P.: Relypsa*; AstraZeneca; AuraSense*; Bayer; BG Medicine*; Boehringer Ingelheim; Forest Laboratories; GE Healthcare; Medtronic; Merck; Nile Therapeutics*; Novartis; Pfizer; Takeda.
