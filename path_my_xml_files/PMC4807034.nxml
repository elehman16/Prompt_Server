These variables could improve with exercise. The aim was to study the effects of moderate exercise on functional capacity, body composition and risk of falls in patients with cirrhosis. Twenty-three cirrhotic patients were randomized to an exercise programme (n = 14) or to a relaxation programme (n = 9). Both programmes consisted of a one-hour session 3 days a week for 12 weeks. At the beginning and end of the study, we measured functional capacity using the cardiopulmonary exercise test, evaluated body composition using anthropometry and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and estimated risk of falls using the Timed Up&#x00026;Go test. In the exercise group, cardiopulmonary exercise test showed an increase in total effort time (p&#x0003c;0.001) and ventilatory anaerobic threshold time (p = 0.009). Upper thigh circumference increased and mid-arm and mid-thigh skinfold thickness decreased. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry showed a decrease in fat body mass (-0.94 kg, 95%CI -0.48 to -1.41, p = 0.003) and an increase in lean body mass (1.05 kg, 95%CI 0.27 to 1.82, p = 0.01), lean appendicular mass (0.38 kg, 95%CI 0.06 to 0.69, p = 0.03) and lean leg mass (0.34 kg, 95%CI 0.10 to 0.57, p = 0.02). The Timed Up&#x00026;Go test decreased at the end of the study compared to baseline (p = 0.02). No changes were observed in the relaxation group. We conclude that a moderate exercise programme in patients with cirrhosis improves functional capacity, increases muscle mass, and decreases body fat and the Timed Up&#x00026;Go time.</p><p><bold><italic>Trial Registration</italic>:</bold> ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01447537">NCT01447537</ext-link></p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was partially funded by Fundaci&#x000f3;n MAPFRE [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fundacionmapfre.org">www.fundacionmapfre.org</ext-link>] and Decathlon Foundation [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fondationdecathlon.com">www.fondationdecathlon.com</ext-link>] to buy the material and apparatus to perform the exercise and the relaxation programmes.

Furthermore, impaired muscle strength and functional limitations may contribute to the predisposition to falls observed in cirrhotic patients, particularly in those with cognitive dysfunction [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Several studies have shown that physical exercise improves muscle mass and strength, functional impairment and health-related quality of life in various populations, such as older adults [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and patients with chronic diseases, such as chronic heart failure [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], end-stage renal failure [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and Parkinson&#x02019;s disease [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Few studies, however, have assessed physical exercise in patients with cirrhosis, probably due to safety concerns [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>In a previous randomized study in individuals with cirrhosis, we observed that exercise together with branched chain amino acids supplementation was not only safe but also improved functional capacity, muscle mass and health-related quality of life [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In this previous study, we assessed functional capacity and muscle mass using the 6-minute walk test and anthropometry, respectively. However, the effects of exercise can be evaluated using more precise techniques, such as the cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) to assess functional capacity [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to evaluate body composition [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Nevertheless, few studies to date have analyzed the effects of exercise on CPET results in patients with cirrhosis [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and to our knowledge, the changes in body composition after an exercise programme have not been studied by DXA in these patients.</p><p>Exercise has proven useful in preventing falls in the elderly [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] but it has not yet been assessed whether it can decrease the risk of falls in patients with cirrhosis.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of moderate physical exercise on functional capacity, body composition and risk of falls using CPET, DXA and the Timed Up&#x00026;Go (TUG) test, respectively, in patients with cirrhosis.</p><sec id="sec002" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between September 2011 and June 2012, we conducted a prospective, randomized study at Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, a tertiary care hospital in Barcelona, Spain. The protocol conformed to the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice in Clinical Trials and was approved by the institution&#x02019;s clinical research ethics committee (Comit&#x000e9; &#x000c9;tico de Investigaci&#x000f3;n Cl&#x000ed;nica [CEIC] at Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau). All patients received information concerning their participation in the study and signed an informed consent form. The protocol was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01447537).</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Patients</title><p>We included 25 consecutive outpatients treated for cirrhosis. Cirrhosis was diagnosed by clinical, analytical and ultrasonographic findings or by liver biopsy. All patients had previous decompensations. Exclusion criteria were hospitalization for decompensation of cirrhosis in the previous month, variceal bleeding in the previous three months, previous variceal bleeding at any time without secondary prophylaxis of hemorrhage, large esophageal varices without primary prophylaxis, end-stage cirrhosis as shown by the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) &#x0003e;25, hepatocellular carcinoma or other neoplasia, active alcohol intake (in the previous 12 months), current overt hepatic encephalopathy, presence of ascites or edema, marked symptomatic comorbidities, contraindication for exercise, life expectancy of less than 6 months, and refusal to participate.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Study design</title><p>The study was carried out by a multidisciplinary team consisting of two physiotherapists, three nurses, four hepatologists, one cardiologist, one sports medicine physician, one internal medicine specialist, and one medical student. Patients were randomized to either an exercise programme (n = 15) or to a relaxation programme (n = 10). Both programmes consisted of one-hour sessions, 3 days a week for 12 weeks under the supervision of physiotherapists. The relaxation programme was a sham intervention to control for a possible effect of attention and contact time with healthcare professionals [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. All patients in both groups were evaluated at three visits: at baseline, at 12 weeks (end of study), and at 24 weeks (follow up). Patients were enrolled and randomized by the hepatologists (CG and GS). Randomization was performed using consecutively numbered opaque sealed envelopes. The study was designed with a different number of patients in each group because of limited availability of space and physiotherapists. The 15 patients in the exercise group were consecutively allocated into two subgroups: seven patients performed the exercise programme from 3 pm to 4 pm and 8 patients did so from 4 pm to 5 pm. Exercise was performed in the same room for both groups and was supervised by the same physiotherapist (CGG). The 10 patients in the relaxation group were supervised from 3 pm to 4 pm in a different room by another physiotherapist (TT).</p><p>In contrast with our previous study in which patients received branched chain amino acids in addition to the exercise programme [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], in the present trial we did not prescribe any specific nutritional intervention because our purpose was to determine the specific effects of the exercise programme.

The main end points were changes in functional capacity and muscle mass, and the secondary end point was the risk of falls. We hypothesized that these parameters would improve as a result of the exercise programme [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Clinical and analytical data</title><p>We recorded demographic and clinical parameters such as the etiology of cirrhosis, previous decompensations, Child-Pugh class, the MELD score, and pharmacological treatment.

The supervisors of cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) (MTD and RSG) were blinded to the group the patients had been assigned to. The initial treadmill speed was 3 km/h for the first 2 minutes, increasing 0.3 km/h for each subsequent minute. The initial slope was zero for the first 2 minutes, increasing 1.4% for each subsequent minute until it reached a maximum of 12%. Twelve-lead ECG (CS-200) recordings were made and blood pressure was taken using a Riester sphygmomanometer. A mask was used to collect exhaled gases. Using a Ganshorn Power-Cube gas analyser, we determined the following parameters: oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>) in ml&#x000b7;kg&#x000b7;min, oxygen pulse (PO<sub>2</sub>) in ml/beats, carbon dioxide production (VCO<sub>2</sub>) in l/min, respiratory quotient (RQ), baseline heart rate (HR) and maximum HR under stress (stress HR), ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VAT) expressed in relation to HR, percentage of VO<sub>2</sub> achieved in the VAT (%VO<sub>2</sub>), and exhaled volume in l/min. Baseline and maximum blood pressure were determined at each stage, and test duration was noted in minutes.

After a 10-minute warm up, cycle ergometry combined with treadmill walking was performed for 10&#x02013;15 minutes per session at the beginning of the programme and steadily increased to 25&#x02013;30 minutes at the end of the programme. Initial treadmill velocity was calculated and later increased according to patient tolerance. Patients also performed resistance exercise for arms using free weights and elastic bands for 5&#x02013;10 minutes. At the end of each session, patients performed balance, coordination, stretching and relaxation exercises for 10&#x02013;15 minutes. The intensity of exercise was increased on the basis of patient tolerance. To prevent variceal bleeding, the programme did not include exercises involving the abdominal muscles or exercises that could increase intra-abdominal pressure.

In the present study, we aimed to further investigate the effects of exercise in these patients. We evaluated an exercise programme alone and used more precise techniques than those used in our previous study.</p><p>The observed increase in total effort time and VAT time on CPET in the exercise group suggests an improvement in functional capacity. Although the improvement in VO<sub>2peak</sub> did not reach statistical significance, the percentage of patients with a functional limitation considering reference VO<sub>2peak</sub> values decreased from 71.4% at baseline to 42.8% at the end of the study. Zenith et al [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and Debette-Gratien et al [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] recently described a statistically significant increase in VO<sub>2peak</sub> values in cirrhotic patients after an 8-week and 12-week exercise programme, respectively. The lack of statistical significance in the increase in VO<sub>2peak</sub> in the present study could be because our patients were older and had a higher body mass index, and also because the exercise programme differed from that in the two previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Differences in the type of exercises, in the duration of the sessions, in the number of patients per session (two patients in the study of Debette-Gratien et al [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] vs 7 patients in the present study), and especially in the intensity of the exercise (60&#x02013;70% of the maximum heart rate in the present study vs higher intensities in the two previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]) could partly account for this discrepancy.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze the effects of exercise on body composition in patients with cirrhosis using DXA. DXA results indicated an increase in muscle mass and a decrease in fat mass in patients in the exercise group. One limitation with the use of DXA to evaluate body composition in patients with cirrhosis is the potential interference of fluid retention when muscle mass is extrapolated from lean mass results [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, our patients were in a stable condition and fluid retention was not detected in any patient by physical and ultrasound examination during the study. Our results are in line with those in the recently reported randomized controlled trial by Zenith et al [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These authors observed an increase in thigh muscle thickness measured by ultrasound in the 9 patients with stable cirrhosis after 8 weeks of exercise compared to the 10 patients in the control group.</p><p>The changes in anthropometric measures, an increase in upper thigh circumference and a decrease in skinfold thickness, also suggest an increase in muscle mass and a decrease in fat mass [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, while there was a positive correlation between anthropometry and DXA in the evaluation of changes in fat body mass, we did not observe such a correlation in the evaluation of changes in muscle mass. This lack of correlation has been noted by other authors [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and suggests that although anthropometric measures are more accessible and cost-effective in daily clinical practice than DXA, they are insensitive to subtle changes such as those observed in the present study. It is striking that in our study the circumference increased in the leg but decreased in the arm. The fact that patients performed most exercises with the legs and the loss of fat mass would explain this difference.</p><p>Sarcopenic obesity is described as a decrease in lean body mass with concomitant excess fat body mass, and it is increasingly recognized in older people and several chronic diseases, including cirrhosis [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In our study, more than half of the patients in both groups were obese. Those in the exercise group showed no changes in body weight despite gaining about one kilogram of muscle mass, probably due to the concomitant decrease in fat body mass of approximately one kilogram. Such a decrease is an interesting target considering that overweight and metabolic syndrome have been found to worsen prognosis in cirrhosis [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Berzigotti et al [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] recently reported that an exercise programme associated with a nutritional intervention in obese cirrhotic patients decreases body fat and improves portal hemodynamics.</p><p>Falls and fractures are frequent in patients with cirrhosis and a common cause of complications, hospitalizations and deterioration in health-related quality of life [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In the present study, the improvement in the TUG test at the end of the programme in the exercise group indicates not only an improvement in the functional capacity of patients [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], but also a decrease in the risk of falling [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This finding supports the hypothesis that exercise can help reduce the incidence of falls in patients with cirrhosis, as observed in other populations [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], but a prospective randomized clinical trial with a high number of patients is needed to confirm this hypothesis.</p><p>Regarding safety, our findings confirm the results from our previous study [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] as patients had no complications of cirrhosis during the development of the programme. These results are also in agreement with the studies by Zenith et al [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and Debette-Gratien et al [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, most patients included in these studies, even with previous decompensations, were in a stable situation at the beginning of the exercise programme. Caution should be taken into account here as exercise may worse portal hypertension in patients not taking beta-blockers [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and renal function in patients with ascites [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Moreover, Berzigotti et al [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] recently underlined the need for nutritional assessment and supplementation when indicated before initiating an exercise programme in patients with decompensated cirrhosis to avoid further protein catabolism and loss of muscle mass.</p><p>In agreement with previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], the acceptability and compliance of the exercise programme was considered satisfactory. Patients in this group missed a mean of only 2.3 sessions. In contrast, in the relaxation group participants missed a higher number of sessions (12.6). We attribute this difference to a higher commitment and satisfaction of patients with the exercise than with the relaxation programme.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. The first of these is the small sample size. Nevertheless, such studies are difficult to conduct in a large number of patients due to limited availability of physiotherapists and shortage of space [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Moreover, most changes observed in the exercise group achieved statistical significance in spite of the small number of patients. Second, the low compliance with the programme and the study procedures, mainly CPET, among patients from the relaxation group limit the interpretation of the data. However, we did not observe significant changes in the parameters evaluated in an intention-to-treat analysis in this group, originally conceived as a control group. Finally, although more than two thirds of patients in our study presented at baseline functional limitations according to the results of the CPET, only 13% fulfilled the criteria for sarcopenia using the skeletal muscle mass index determined by DXA. This percentage is lower than the 40% previously reported incidence of sarcopenia in cirrhotic patients evaluated for liver transplantation using computed tomography scan at the third lumbar vertebrae [<xref rid="pone.0151652.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Probably this difference can be due to the different methods used to evaluate sarcopenia but also to the fact that our study population included compensated outpatients with more preserved liver function. Studies with a larger number of patients with cirrhosis and sarcopenia are needed to assess the effects of exercise in this setting.</p><p>In conclusion, with the limitations of the small sample size, in this study using CPET and DXA we found that a moderate exercise programme increases effort tolerance and muscle mass, and decreases body fat and risk of falls estimated by the TUG test in patients with cirrhosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0151652.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>The anonymized database with all the individual data of patients included in the study.</title><p>(CSV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0151652.s001.csv"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0151652.s002"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>The explanation of the structure of the database.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0151652.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0151652.s003"><label>S2 Text</label><caption><title>The original protocol in English.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0151652.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0151652.s004"><label>S3 Text</label><caption><title>The original protocol in Spanish.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0151652.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0151652.s005"><label>S4 Text</label><caption><title>The approval of the original protocol by the Ethics Committee of our centre.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0151652.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0151652.s006"><label>S5 Text</label><caption><title>CONSORT checklist.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0151652.s006.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Carolyn Newey for revising the English and Ignasi J.
