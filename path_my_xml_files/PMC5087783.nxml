The two major training modalities in COPD rehabilitation, endurance training (ET) and resistance training (RT), may both be efficient in improving muscle strength, exercise capacity, and health-related quality of life, but the effects on quadriceps muscle characteristics have not been thoroughly described.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Thirty COPD patients (forced expiratory volume in 1 second: 56% of predicted, standard deviation [SD] 14) were randomized to 8 weeks of ET or RT. Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were obtained before and after the training intervention to assess muscle morphology and metabolic and angiogenic factors. Symptom burden, exercise capacity (6-minute walking and cycle ergometer tests), and vascular function were also assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Both training modalities improved symptom burden and exercise capacity with no difference between the two groups. The mean (SD) proportion of glycolytic type IIa muscle fibers was reduced after ET (from 48% [SD 11] to 42% [SD 10], <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), whereas there was no significant change in muscle fiber distribution with RT.

Limb muscle dysfunction in COPD presents as muscle wasting, reduced strength, fiber-type shift from type I to type II, and reduced oxidative capacity.<xref rid="b1-copd-11-2659" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Although studies have explored the intrinsic muscular effects of both ET and RT, these studies compared COPD patients with healthy subjects in case-control designs.<xref rid="b4-copd-11-2659" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b8-copd-11-2659" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b11-copd-11-2659" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Thus, the ET-induced muscular effects have not been directly compared with RT in a randomized controlled trial design.</p><p>The present study explored the intrinsic quadriceps muscle characteristics after ET compared with RT in COPD patients. We hypothesized that the two training modalities would counteract muscle dysfunction by different mechanisms: 1) ET by increasing oxidative muscle fiber proportion, capillarization, and oxidative capacity; and 2) RT by increasing muscle fiber cross-sectional area, glycolytic fiber proportion, and anaerobic capacity. By obtaining biopsies from the vastus lateralis muscle before and after 8 weeks of exercise training, we tested this hypothesis in 30 patients with moderate-to-severe COPD randomized to either ET or RT. Walking distance, maximal cycling endurance, and symptom burden were assessed to determine whether there were differences in training effects between groups.</p><p>Vascular function plays an important role in regulation of blood supply to working skeletal muscles,<xref rid="b12-copd-11-2659" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and vascular function may be impaired in patients with COPD,<xref rid="b13-copd-11-2659" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> but whether exercise training alters blood flow to the working muscle in COPD has not been evaluated. Thus, our secondary aim was to evaluate the effects of training on leg muscle blood flow during exercise and vascular function determined by flow-mediated dilation (FMD).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a randomized controlled trial (1:1 allocation ratio) of ET compared with RT in patients with COPD. Eligibility criteria for participants were forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity ratio &#x0003c;0.7, forced expiratory volume in 1 second &#x0003c;80% of predicted, Modified Medical Research Council score &#x02265;2, resting arterial oxygenation &#x0003e;90%, and age between 40 and 80 years. Exclusion criteria were claudication, severe heart failure, unstable ischemic heart disease, and malignant diseases. Spirometry (Model 2120; Vitalograph Ltd., Buckingham, UK) and a general medical examination were performed prior to inclusion. A computer-generated random allocation sequence was performed, and sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes were given to the participants after inclusion and baseline tests. The researcher who enrolled participants and analyzed data was blinded to the training intervention. Sample size was determined using 6-minute walking distance of 54 m (standard deviation [SD] of 50 m) as the true difference (power 80%) between groups with type 1 error risk of 5%.<xref rid="b14-copd-11-2659" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>The trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Copenhagen Region (H-2-2013-150), registered on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT02050945), and conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. Verbal and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects before enrollment.</p><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>Both groups of patients were trained for 35 minutes, 3 times a week for 8 weeks. The choice of the duration and frequency of the training sessions was based on comparable studies of ET versus RT in COPD.<xref rid="b6-copd-11-2659" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> All training sessions were supervised to ensure safety, compliance, and progression of training intensity. Participants performed a short warm-up before and a cool-down after each training session.</p><p>ET was performed at moderate intensity adjusted individually to level 14&#x02013;15 on the Borg scale of perceived exertion. The training sessions included either cycling on an ergometer or walking on a treadmill. The workload (Watts and distance) for each session was registered, and participants were instructed to increase exercise intensity progressively.</p><p>RT was performed on machines (Technogym, Cesena, Italy) and consisted of 4 sets of strength exercises of major upper and lower body muscle groups (chest press, rowing, leg press, and leg extension). The load was initially set at 30% of one repetition maximum and increased to 40% of one repetition maximum. Each exercise included 4 sets with a duration of 30 seconds that allowed for 15&#x02013;20 repetitions to be completed. There was a 20-second break between sets and a 60-second break between exercises. Subjects were instructed to maintain muscle tension at all times during sets. Workload (kilograms) was registered for all sessions, and intensity increased accordingly. The balance between set duration and rest allowed for muscular fatigue to be induced with a moderate load. As load was adjusted regularly to keep sets within the targeted repletion range, the relative training intensity was kept uniform among subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><sec><title>Symptom burden, exercise capacity, and body composition</title><p>The symptom burden was assessed with the COPD assessment test which is a patient-completed questionnaire validated to monitor the impact of COPD on health-related quality of life (ranging from 0 to 40) where higher scores denote more severe impact. Exercise capacity was determined by a 6-minute walking test, peak oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>peak), and maximal workload (<italic>W</italic><sub>max</sub>). After verbal instruction, the 6-minute walking test was performed between 2 marked points 30 m apart. The VO<sub>2</sub>peak was assessed (CPET System; Cosmed, Rome, Italy) during an incremental bicycle ergometer exercise test that included 5 minutes of unloaded pedaling followed by incremental steps of 10 W per minute until exhaustion (<italic>W</italic><sub>max</sub>). The subject&#x02019;s limit of tolerance was used as the criterion for finishing the test. The greatest 20-second averaged VO<sub>2</sub> was taken as the VO<sub>2</sub>peak. Body composition was measured by whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan (Lunar Prodigy Advance; GE Healthcare, Madison, WI, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Muscle biopsies</title><p>After local anesthesia (lidocaine 20%) of the skin and muscle fascia, skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained by the Bergstr&#x000f6;m technique<xref rid="b15-copd-11-2659" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> from the vastus lateralis of the nondominant leg. Biopsies were separated; one part for protein analysis was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and another part for histology was mounted in Tissue-Tek<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Sakura Finetek USA, Inc., Torrance, CA, USA) and then immediately frozen in isopentane precooled in liquid nitrogen.</p></sec><sec><title>Fiber type and capillarization</title><p>Immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies against myosin heavy chain (MHC) type I and type IIa, endothelial cells, and laminin. Muscle fibers positive for antibodies against both fiber types I and IIa were considered intermediate.

The researcher who processed and analyzed the biopsies was blinded toward intervention and training status (antibodies and detailed description are given in the Supplementary materials).</p></sec><sec><title>Muscle protein content</title><p>We measured protein content of CS, eNOS, PFK, and VEGF by Western blotting.

FMD was calculated as a percentage change from baseline in peak diameter after deflation (Supplementary materials). After the FMD, the participants were placed in a one-leg kicking chair. Leg blood flow (LBF) in the common femoral artery was measured using Doppler ultrasound. LBF was measured at rest and during 1 minute of passive leg movements followed by 3-minute leg kicking at 12 W.<xref rid="b17-copd-11-2659" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18-copd-11-2659" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Effects within training groups were analyzed using a paired <italic>t</italic>-test, and differences between groups with Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test comparing the mean change from baseline, but where the assumption of normality was not met, we used the Wilcoxon and Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic>-tests. LBF measured at different time points was analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures (Holm&#x02013;Sidak post hoc). Data were analyzed using SigmaPlot (v 13; Systat Software, San Jose, CA, USA). Results are presented as mean values (SD) unless mentioned otherwise.

The CS content is thought to be more abundant in oxidative type I fibers than in the more glycolytic type IIa fibers and the highly glycolytic type IIx fibers.<xref rid="b28-copd-11-2659" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In agreement, CS is reduced in COPD compared to healthy individuals.<xref rid="b29-copd-11-2659" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Moreover, studies indicate that COPD patients have a higher reliance on glycolytic metabolism during exercise and that upregulation of glycolytic enzymes (including PFK) is related to overproduction of lactate in muscles compared to healthy individuals.<xref rid="b30-copd-11-2659" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="b31-copd-11-2659" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Ultimately, high muscle lactate can contribute to premature fatigue and exercise termination,<xref rid="b26-copd-11-2659" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b31-copd-11-2659" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> but lactate may also stimulate central fatigue through afferent signaling from the exercising limb.<xref rid="b32-copd-11-2659" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Improving the oxidative capacity of the muscle in COPD patients would therefore likely improve exercise capacity.</p></sec><sec><title>Leg muscle blood flow and vascular function</title><p>Working skeletal muscle is highly dependent on sufficient blood supply to match the increased demand for oxygen.<xref rid="b33-copd-11-2659" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Thus, impaired blood flow to muscles may aggravate muscle dysfunction in COPD. We found that during an acute bout of exercise, both training groups showed an initial raise and steady state in exercise hyperemia, as also observed in healthy individuals.<xref rid="b34-copd-11-2659" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> There was an overall effect of training on exercise hyperemia, but the increase was not significant within each of the two groups separately.

Another explanation for the increase in exercise hyperemia could be a reduced vasoconstriction after training. The ability to override sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity during exercise, termed functional sympatholysis, appears to impair leg muscle blood flow in patients with essential hypertension, while exercise training improves exercise hyperemia and functional sympatholysis.<xref rid="b17-copd-11-2659" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b40-copd-11-2659" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>This study is explorative, and there are some limitations that should be considered. Because established thresholds of minimal clinically important difference for muscle outcomes in COPD do not exist, our sample size calculation was not based on muscle outcome. We did not obtain sufficient muscle specimens from all subjects. Consequently, the paired number of samples from both pre- and post-training was smaller in the RT group than in the ET group for structural measures (n=6 versus n=13) and similarly for the analysis of muscle protein content (n=9 versus n=14). Maybe, the difference between the two training forms regarding effect on intrinsic muscle function is caused by that the quadriceps muscle was stimulated throughout all ET training sessions, but only during approximately 50% of each RT training session. Because of the small sample size and explorative nature of this study, we did not adjust for possible confounding variables including the age and the level of pulmonary function. Finally, we used perceived exertion to adjust the intensity of ET, but the actual exercise intensity may have varied between subjects depending on pulmonary function.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion and clinical implications</title><p>This study confirms that ET and RT improve symptoms and exercise capacity in patients with COPD. However, our data suggest that ET induces a more oxidative quadriceps muscle phenotype compared with RT. These results indicate that aerobic physical activity (eg, cycling or walking) at moderate intensity is the most efficient countermeasure of quadriceps muscle dysfunction in COPD, and we suggest that training of patients with COPD should include an aerobic component.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary materials</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Vascular ultrasound</title><p>We assessed endothelium-dependent dilation of the super-ficial femoral artery with flow-mediated dilation (FMD). We used an ultrasound machine (Logic E9; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) equipped with a probe operating at an imaging frequency of 9 MHz. Longitudinal ultrasound images of the artery were optimized in B-mode and saved in DICOM files until analysis. FMD was measured by the same sonographer at approximately the same time of the day before and after training, prior to 15&#x02013;20 minutes of supine rest. A cuff (D. E. Hokanson Inc., Belevue, WA, USA) was placed ~10 cm above the knee, and all recordings of vessel diameter were made proximally of the cuff. The arterial diameter was assessed at baseline for 2 minutes followed by 5-minute suprasystolic cuff inflation (~220 mmHg). Vessel diameter recordings were resumed from ~10 seconds before deflation and the following 5 minutes. The FMD was cal-culated as a percent change from baseline in peak diameter after deflation. Analysis of the artery diameter was performed using validated software (Vascular Research Tool v. 6; Medical Imaging Applications LLC., Coralville, IA, USA) for automated border detection of the saved DICOM files.</p><p>Shortly after, the FMD subjects were placed in a one-leg kicking chair. Leg blood flow in the common femoral artery was measured using Doppler ultrasound (frequency of 4.3&#x02013;5.0 MHz). All recordings were obtained at the lowest possible insonation angle and always &#x0003c;60&#x000b0;. The sample volume was maximized according to the width of the vessel and kept clear of the vessel walls. Doppler traces and B-mode images were recorded continuously, and Doppler traces were averaged over minimum eight heart cycles. Arterial diameter was measured during the systole and two-thirds of the diameter during the diastole. Leg blood flow was measured at baseline and during 1 minute of passive leg movements followed by 3-minute active leg kicking at 12 W.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Directly after performing the muscle biopsy from the vastus lateralis muscle, the biopsies were prepared using Tissue-Tek<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> O.C.T.&#x02122; Compound (Sakura Finetek USA, Inc., Torrance, CA, USA).

The specimens were kept at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until all the biopsies were cut and ready for immunohistochemistry.</p><p>The cross sections were then fixed for 2 minutes using a formaldehyde solution (F1635; Sigma-Aldrich Co., Sigma, MO, USA). Following rinsing the sections with a pH neutral 1% phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution, the specimens were blocked for 10 minutes using a 1% bovine serum albumin (A7906; Sigma-Aldrich Co.). The primary antibodies (myosin heavy chain [MHC] type I [M2421; Sigma-Aldrich Co.] and MHCIIa [SC-71; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa, IA, USA]) were diluted in an antibody diluent (S0809; Dako Denmark A/S, Glostrup, Denmark) together with polyclonal rabbit anti-laminin (Z0097; Dako Denmark A/S), and the sections incubated for 50 minutes. Following a rinse with PBS solution, the cross sections were incubated with the secondary antibodies for 50 minutes. The incubations were performed at room temperature.</p><p>The capillaries were identified using Biotinylated Ulex Europaeus Agglutinin I (B-1065; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA), which marks endothelial cells. The applied secondary antibodies were the following: donkey anti-mouse IgG (H+L) secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 555 conjugate (A31570; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and streptavidin conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (F0422; Dako Denmark A/S); donkey anti-mouse IgG (H+L) secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 488 conjugate (A21202; Thermo Fisher Scientific); and goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 350 conjugate (A21068; Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p><p>The cross sections were mounted using Prolong Gold Antifade Mountant (P36930; Life Technologies) and were stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until pictures of the biopsies were taken by a high-resolution camera (CoolSNAP; Photometrics, Tucson, AZ, USA) through a light microscope (Axioplan 2 Imaging; Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Jena, Germany). The muscle fibers and capillaries were counted using both computer programs, Microsoft PowerPoint (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA) and ImageJ 1.47 (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).</p><p>Overlay pictures of the different immunofluorescent images taken were used when assessing the muscle fiber distribution of the biopsies, as type I fibers were recognized as those expressing MHCI, type IIa fibers as those expressing MHCIIa, and the intermediate fibers as those expressing both MHCI and MHCIIa.</p><p>Type IIx fibers were identified as those fibers lacking expression of both primary antibodies, MHCI and MHCIIa.

The protein content was measured (colorimetric assay; Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) to insure equal sample concentrations. Loading buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and dithiothreitol were applied, and samples were boiled for 5 minutes. The lysate was loaded onto the gels (Criterion TGX 4%&#x02013;15% gel; Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.) where samples from one individual (before and after training) were loaded side by side on the same gel. Gels were run at 105 V for ~60 minutes. Protein was then transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Trans-Blot Turbo; Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.). Membranes were blocked and incubated with primary antibodies overnight. Membranes were washed and incubated with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG antibody (Dako Denmark A/S).
