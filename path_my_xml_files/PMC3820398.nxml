exercise on dynamic balance and gait function in stroke patients. [Subjects] The subjects
were 16 stroke patients, who were randomly divided into two groups: a core stabilization
exercise group of eight subjects and control group of eight subjects. [Methods] Subjects
in both groups received general training five times per week. Subjects in the core
stabilization exercise group practiced an additional core stabilization exercise program,
which was performed for 30 minutes, three times per week, during a period of four weeks.
All subjects were evaluated for dynamic balance (Timed Up and Go test, TUG) and gait
parameters (velocity, cadence, step length, and stride length). [Results] Following
intervention, the core exercise group showed a significant change in TUG, velocity, and
cadence. The only significant difference observed between the core group and control group
was in velocity. [Conclusion] The results of this study suggest the feasibility and
suitability of core stabilization exercise for stroke patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Core stabilization</kwd><kwd>Gait</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>A stroke is the rapidly developing loss of brain function due to a disturbance in the blood
supply to the brain. This can be due to ischemia caused by blockage or due to a
hemorrhage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. After a stroke, motor,
sensory, perceptual, or cognitive deficits may occur, and these impairments can have various
impacts on individual functioning through generation of disabilities and affect
rehabilitation potential<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Stroke survivors have difficulty in balance and postural control for standing upright
because they are impaired by asymmetric posture, abnormal body imbalance, and deficit of
weight transfer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Asymmetric movement also
decreases ability to stand upright, disorients the body midline and space, and hinders
appropriate alignment between vertebrae, trunk rotation, selective movement between trunk
and extremities, anterior-posterior tilt of the pelvis during weight transfer, protective
reaction, and equilibrium reaction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Previous studies have demonstrated the particular importance of trunk control in stable
walking and decreasing falling risk in stroke patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Core strengthening has been rediscovered in rehabilitation. The term has come to connote
lumbar stabilization and other therapeutic exercise regimens. In essence, it describes the
muscular control required around the lumbar spine for maintenance of functional stability.
The &#x0201c;core&#x0201d; has been described as a box, with the abdominals in the front, paraspinal and
gluteal muscles in the back, the diaphragm as the roof, and the pelvic floor and hip girdle
musculature as the bottom<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Particular
attention has been paid to the core because it serves as a muscular corset that works as a
unit to stabilize the body and spine, with and without limb movement. In short, the core
serves as the center of the functional kinetic chain. In the world of alternative medicine,
the core has been referred to as the &#x0201c;powerhouse&#x0201d;, the foundation or engine of all limb
movement<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. With regard to impaired trunk
control and poor balance, previous studies have advocated efficient neuromuscular control
for trunk stability and accurate trunk muscle recruitment patterns for control of spinal
load in relation to a given task and posture<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Many recent studies have reported on core stability and its affect on athletes and patients
with low back pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, however, few studies
on the relationship between core stability and balance ability and gait in patients with
hemiplegia have been reported. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the
effect of core stabilization exercise on dynamic balance and gait functions in stroke
patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> Characteristics of the subjects (N=16)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Core stabilizationexercise group (n=8)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group (n=8)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Gender (%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (62.5) </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7 (87.5)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Female</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (37.5)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (12.5)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Age (y)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">44.37 (9.90) </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">48.38 (9.72)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">166.50 (9.21)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">168.50 (5.63)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">63.83 (9.33)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">66.11 (10.97)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Months after stroke</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.88 (7.16)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.63 (4.86)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Side of hemiplegia (%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Right</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (50.0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (37.5)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Left</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (50.0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (62.5)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Type of stroke (%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Infarction</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (72.5)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (50.0)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hemorrhage</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (25.5)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (50.0)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>n (%) or mean (SD)</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>A total of 16 stroke patients who voluntarily agreed to active participation were included
in this study. The selection criteria were: 1) independent gait ability with or without
walking aid for a minimum of 15 m; 2) a Mini-Mental State Examination score greater than
24/30<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>; 3) adequate vision and hearing
for completion of the study protocol, as indicated by the ability to follow written and oral
instructions during screening; and 4) the capacity to understand and follow instructions.
Exclusion criteria were 1) a history of previous stroke or other neurologic diseases or
disorders; 2) patients with pusher syndrome (defined as leaning to the hemiparetic side and
giving resistance to any attempt at passive correction); 3) terminal illness; and 4) pain,
limited motion, or weakness in the non-paretic lower extremity that affected performance of
daily activities (by self-report). Each participant signed an informed consent prior to
participation. The subjects were randomly divided into the core stabilization exercise group
(eight subjects) and the control group (eight subjects). Subjects in both groups
participated in a general training program for five sessions, 60 minutes per week, during a
period of four weeks. Subjects in the core stabilization exercise group practiced additional
core stabilization exercises for three sessions of 30 minutes per week, for a period of four
weeks. General characteristics of the core stabilization exercise group and control group
are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>The core stabilization exercise consisted of three subparts, bed exercises, wedge
exercises, and ball exercises using a Swiss ball. First, the bed exercises without devices
consisted of bridge exercise, bridge exercise with legs crossed, bridge exercise with one
leg, curl-ups with straight reaching, curl-ups with diagonal reaching, bird dog exercise,
and side bridge exercise. Second, the wedge exercises consisted of curl-ups with straight
reaching, curl-ups with diagonal reaching, and curl-ups with arms crossed. Finally, the ball
exercises consisted of bridge exercise, bridge exercise to the side, bridge- ups, abdominal
curl-ups, bird dog exercise, and push-ups.</p><p>Dynamic balance ability was measured using the Timed Up and Go test (TUG). Subjects were
seated in a chair with armrests and then instructed to stand (using the armrests, if
desired) and walk as quickly and as safely as possible for a distance of 3 m. Subjects then
turned around, returned to the chair, and sat down. The time from the point at which their
spine left the back of the chair until they returned to that same position was recorded
using a stopwatch. A practice trial was provided, followed by three test trials. The average
time of the test trials was calculated. High intrarater (ICC=0.99) and interrater (ICC=0.99)
reliability have been demonstrated using this measure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Gait function was measured using a GAITRite system (GAITRite, CIR system Inc., Havertown,
Pennsylvania, USA). The standard GAITRite walkway contained six sensor pads encapsulated in
a rolled-up carpet with an active area of 3.66&#x02005;m in length and 0.61&#x02005;m in width. As the
subject walked along the walkway, the sensors captured each footfall as a function of time
and transferred the gathered information to a personal computer for processing of the raw
data into footfall patterns. The GAITRite system was used to measure the spatiotemporal
parameters, including gait velocity, cadence, step length, and stride length<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The SPSS statistical package, version 18.0, was used in performance of all statistical
analyses. The dependent variables were dynamic balance test and gait function. General
characteristics of the subjects and variables followed a normal distribution. The Paired
t-test was used to determine whether there were changes in balance and gait function between
before and after the training. The independent t-test was used for analysis of changes
between groups of dependent variables. Results were considered significant at p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title> Comparison of balance and gait measures within groups and between groups

functions of stroke patients. In this study, TUG was used to evaluate dynamic balance.
Ranges of TUG scores have been reported for various samples of elderly people. In a previous
study, men and women without known pathology, aged 70 to 84&#x02005;years (mean=75&#x02005;years), had a
mean TUG score of 8.50 seconds (range=7&#x02013;10)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Geiger et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that conduction biofeedback and conventional physical therapy programs resulted in
a decrease in TUG from 23.08 before participation in an exercise program to 14.62 after
participation in an exercise program. In our study, the before and after TUG score for
subjects in the core stabilization exercise group showed a significant decrease, from
33.06&#x000b1;18.39 sec to 27.64&#x000b1;13.73 sec (p=0.029); no significant difference (from 30.33&#x000b1;12.58
sec to 24.85&#x000b1;8.76 sec) was observed in the control group (p=0.057). Core training presumably
improved the balance of the lumbo-pelvic-hip complex, corrected postural alignments, and
increased balance of the whole body. As a result, dynamic balance ability for transfer of
center of gravity (COG) showed gradual improvement<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>More than 85% of stroke survivors eventually walk with or without assistance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The common features of walking after
stroke include decreased gait velocity and asymmetrical gait pattern<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Achievement of
normal gait patterns and speed is usually the ultimate goal of gait training. Bohannon et
al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that mean comfortable
gait speed ranged from 127.2 cm/sec for women in their 70s to 146.2 cm/sec for men in their
40s. Mean maximum gait speed ranged from 174.9 cm/sec for women in their 70s to 253.3 cm/sec
for men in their 20s. Both gait speed measures were reliable (coefficients&#x02265;0.903) and showed
significant correlation with age (r&#x02265;&#x02212;0.210), height (r&#x02265;0.220), and the strengths of lower
extremity muscle actions (r=0.190&#x02013;0.500). Holden et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the velocity of gait in hemiparetic subjects (n=10)
was 41% of normal. Duncan et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref><sup>)</sup>
investigated the effect of a home program aimed at improvement of endurance, balance, and
strength for stroke subjects whose mean duration after onset was 66 days. After eight weeks,
mean gait speed increased by 25 cm/sec among patients. Yang et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref><sup>)</sup> studied dual task programs in stroke subjects and measured
the speed of 5 m of walking. They found that gait speed showed a significant increase after
participation in the dual task program, from 86.52&#x02005;cm/sec to 115.35 cm/sec in chronic
patients after stroke (p&#x0003c;0.05). In our study, the core stabilization exercise group
showed a significantly increased gait velocity (from 44.83&#x000b1;18.83&#x02005;cm/s to 58.91&#x000b1;18.21&#x02005;cm/s,
p=0.024) and cadence (from 74.55&#x000b1;13.85 steps/min to 84.07&#x000b1;14.00 steps/min, p=0.041), and the
only significant difference observed between the core group and control group was in
velocity (p=0.039). These findings are consistent with those of previous studies and suggest
that core stabilization exercise increased posterior tilt of the pelvis and COG transfer
during the swing phase through core training. Lamoth et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref><sup>)</sup> studied that trunk coordination has an effect on gait parameters
and that flexible adaptations in trunk coordination to changes in walking velocity are
considered a hallmark of unaffected gait. And as found for cadence, the core stabilization
exercise group showed a larger increased than the control group but there was no significant
difference between groups. We suggest that core training might improve the stability of the
lower trunk and pelvis and result in increased ability with regard to static balance,
dynamic balance, and weight support of the more affected side and ultimately may contribute
to a more stable gait.</p><p>Through this research, the core stabilization exercise was found to be effective in balance
and gait functions of stroke patients. We expect that this core stabilization exercise will
be used at stroke patient care centers in physical therapy as an effective form of training
for balance and gait functions. Further research is needed in order to confirm the
generalization of these findings and to identify which stroke patients might benefit from
treadmill gait training.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other"><person-group><name><surname>Sims</surname><given-names>NR</given-names></name><name><surname>Muyderman</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group>: Mitochondria, oxidative metabolism and cell death in stroke.
