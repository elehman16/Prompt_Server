This study aimed to compare the effect of a <italic>Calendula officinalis</italic> extract-based cream and metronidazole on BV among women of reproductive age. In this study, 80 women of reproductive age with BV were randomly assigned to the <italic>C. officinalis</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 40) or metronidazole (<italic>n</italic> = 40). Diagnosis of BV was confirmed when at least 3 of the 4 Amsel criteria were met (pH &#x0003e;4.5, whitish grey or thin homogeneous discharge, release of a fishy odor on adding 10% KOH, and detection of clue cells on microscopic examination). For each group, either a methanol extract of <italic>C. officinalis</italic> or metronidazole vaginal cream (5 g) was used for 1 week intravaginally, and all signs and symptoms were assessed 1 week after treatment completion. Before the intervention, the two groups did not differ significantly with regard to vaginal burning, odor, dysuria, and dyspareunia, but itching was significantly more common in the <italic>C. officinalis</italic> group than in the metronidazole group (22.5% vs. 2.5%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.01). One week after the intervention, all women in both groups were free of symptoms, including vaginal itching and burning sensation, odor, dysuria, and dyspareunia. None of the women in either group suffered any side effects from <italic>C. officinalis</italic> or metronidazole. <italic>C. officinalis</italic> was effective for the treatment of BV in women of reproductive age, without any side effects. This herb could be recommended for women of reproductive age who uncomfortable with the potential side effects of synthetic drugs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Bacterial</kwd><kwd><italic>Calendula officinalis</italic></kwd><kwd>metronidazole</kwd><kwd>vaginitis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common disorder among reproductive-aged women, and its underlying cause is primarily a change in vaginal flora.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] BV is characterized by the suppression of the normal vaginal flora (hydrogen peroxide-producing <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>) and an increase in facultative and anaerobic bacteria.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The main cause of BV is unclear; however, it is more commonly seen with anaerobic bacteria than with aerobic bacteria.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>The prevalence of BV was reported to be 29.2% in a large study in the United States, which corresponds to 21.4 million women.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] One study in Iran showed that the prevalence of BV among reproductive-aged women was 16.2%[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] while another study in Iran found a prevalence of 15.6% among these women.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Because of the unpleasant odor associated with BV, most women experience embarrassment and feel dirty and believe that the smell can be detected by others. In addition, women with BV have low self-esteem and lower sexual satisfaction.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] BV can be treated with a variety of antimicrobial agents, such as ampicillin, penicillin, and metronidazole. However, metronidazole in the form of tablets, gel, or suppositories used for 7 days shows better results.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The use of antimicrobial agents has been associated with drug resistance and in some patients, recurrence of BV.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Furthermore, using metronidazole during pregnancy and while breastfeeding may pose some risks to the fetus and infant.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Therefore, researchers are looking for alternative treatment for BV. One alternative is the use of herbal medicine, which is associated with fewer complications and which could preserve the natural flora of the body.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] <italic>Calendula officinalis L</italic> (pot marigold) is a herbaceous plant from the Asteraceae family that contains phytochemicals such as flavonoids, saponins, carotenoids, triterpenoids, and tannins, which possess antibacterial activity.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Bissa and Bohra studied the antibacterial potential of the leaves, roots, and flowers of <italic>C. officinalis</italic> and found good activity against <italic>Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes,</italic> and <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The anti-inflammatory, antifungal, and antioxidant effects of <italic>C. officinalis</italic> have been demonstrated, but there is a lack of studies regarding its effect on BV. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the effect of <italic>C. officinalis</italic> and metronidazole vaginal cream on BV among reproductive-aged women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This was a double-blind randomized controlled trial for which 80 nonpregnant reproductive-aged women in Dezful, Iran, were recruited. The study setting was a public health center in Dezful, Iran (Health center no: 3). The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences (Ref no. IR.AJUMS.REC.1394.302). In addition, the protocol was registered in the Iranian Registry for Randomized Controlled Trials (Ref no. IRCT2015082921414N3). Written informed consent was obtained from all women before data collection. This study was started in early May 2016 and ended in late July 2016. The inclusion criteria were women aged 18&#x02013;45 years who were married and had BV. Women who complained of other types of vaginitis or were pregnant were excluded from the study.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Sample size</title><p>The required sample size with regard to recovery after using metronidazole and <italic>C. officinalis</italic> (70 and 80%),[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] with a maximum acceptable error of 0.3 either side and a 20% attrition rate, was calculated to be 40 for each group.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Herbal extract</title><p>The fresh flowers of <italic>C. officinalis</italic> were purchased from an Iranian herbal market, and they were converted to a powder at the Pharmacy School of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences. The <italic>C. officinalis</italic> vaginal cream was made using the stages of extraction and formulation. The first and second stages of extraction were as follow: the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined and the vaginal cream was prepared. All drug preparation processes were performed in the Bacteriology Department of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. The mean MIC (0.07 &#x003bc;mol/ml) was considered against particular bacterial strains in this study. The direct method, in which the concentration of the extract was determined and the drug then added, was used to add the plant extract to the culture. Considering the antibacterial potency of the methanol extract (MIC = 0.079 &#x003bc;mol/ml) compared to that of the ethanol extract (MIC = 0.125 &#x003bc;mol/ml) and considering the lower cost of methanol, the methanol extract was chosen for the formulation. Composition of base cream was cetostearyl alcohol, petroleum jelly, glycerin, mineral oil, preservative, and antioxidant. After preparation, 80 tubes of cream were made in two stages with the necessary testing done in each stage.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Randomization</title><p>A total of 80 women with BV were randomized into the <italic>C. officinalis</italic> and metronidazole groups. Permuted block randomization with a block size of 4 (using a random permutation table) was used. The metronidazole and <italic>C. officinalis</italic> labels were encoded as A or B by a person who was not aware of the purpose of the study. The <italic>C. officinalis</italic> and metronidazole formulations were similar in appearance and consistency. The person who distributed metronidazole and <italic>C. officinalis</italic> was not aware of the purpose of study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Intervention</title><p>A detailed history was taken from all patients who were seen at the health centers and a physical examination was performed. Vaginal pH was measured using pH strips. A Pap smear was then performed on all women who gave consent. Clinical signs and symptoms such as edema, inflammation, and changes in vaginal discharge were recorded for each participant. Next, a sample of vaginal discharge was obtained to look for clue cells and perform a whiff test using 10% KOH. Diagnosis of BV was confirmed when at least 3 of the 4 Amsel criteria were met (pH &#x0003e;4.5, whitish gray or thin homogenous discharge, release of a fishy odor on adding 10% KOH, and presence of clue cells in microscopy). Women who were diagnosed with BV were randomly treated with metronidazole or <italic>C. officinalis</italic> coded as A or B. All women in both groups received advice regarding avoiding intercourse, using cotton underwear, changing underwear regularly, keeping the perineum dry, and instruction on washing the applicator before starting treatment and after each use. Each woman in both groups received a tube of cream containing 50 g <italic>C. officinalis</italic> or placebo, and women were instructed to use one applicator of vaginal cream (5 g) before sleep for 1 week. The effect of treatment was assessed 1 week after completion of the treatment through an interview, observation, and laboratory testing of vaginal discharge. If a patient did not attend the follow-up, one of the investigators called her, and if she still did not attend, she was considered a dropout. The vaginal discharge samples were assessed using a microscope and appropriate tests. All data were entered in the medical records of the patients. All women were asked to report any side effects of the treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data were entered in Chicago, Illinois: SPSS Inc., USA.
