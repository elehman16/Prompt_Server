There is a universal acceptance that the gingival sulcus is under continuous challenge by bacterial plaque and provides a suitable site for harboring various microorganisms. These microorganisms damage the tissues by releasing various toxins, enzymes, and metabolic products, which are considered important in causation of gingivitis and periodontitis.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Several studies have reported that supragingival hygiene aids do not totally eliminate bacterial flora. Current periodontal therapy centers around the removal of subgingival plaque in an attempt to reestablish the simpler flora associated with health.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Brushing, flossing, rinsing, and the use of interproximal devices are limited in their ability to clear plaque microbes below the gingival margin.</p><p>Since antiseptic mouth rinses cannot penetrate the sulcus beyond 3 mm, there is an increased interest in direct instillation of antimicrobials. Two primary methods are being investigated to improve efficacy: Slow release devices and sub gingival irrigation.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Irrigation of periodontal pockets with antimicrobial agents has been found to affect the subgingival microflora and to improve the periodontal conditions to variable degrees. Results of various studies have shown that &#x0201c;flushing action&#x0201d; associated with irrigation disrupts the microbial ecology of periodontal pockets and reestablishment of a disease associated flora is delayed. Oral irrigation has been promoted and used as a dental hygiene aid for over 80 years. Many studies suggested that oral irrigation is effective in altering, both quantitatively and qualitatively, the unattached subgingival plaque. Site specific irrigation devices will deliver medicaments deeper in the pockets, thus ensuring penetration to the base of the pocket.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Different antimicrobials have been used as subgingival irrigants like chlorhexidine, stannous fluoride, metronidazole, tetracycline, hydrogen peroxide, etc.</p><p>In a study, subgingival irrigation with high concentrations of tetracycline was found to play a beneficial role in the management of patients with chronic periodontitis.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Spiramycin is a macrolide antibiotic, belonging to the same group as erythromycin, created considerable interest in the treatment of periodontal diseases by systemic administration. Studies regarding spiramycin have not been done as an irrigant in the control of subgingival flora. The present study aims at finding out the comparative efficacy of local irrigation of tetracycline and spiramycin in chronic periodontitis using clinical parameters.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Tetracycline hydrochloride</title><p>Tetracyclines comprise a group of broad spectrum antimicrobial agents that were introduced in to a clinical practice in the late 1940s. The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic antimicrobials, effective against all Gram-positive bacteria, and many Gram-negative species. Tetracyclines are used extensively in dentistry, particularly as adjuncts to periodontal therapy, an approach base on three perceived advantages: (1) Their effectiveness in suppressing Gram-negative anaerobic periodontopathogenic organisms in the subgingival plaque; (2) Their ability to concentrate in the gingival crevicular fluid at levels, substantially greater than that in serum; and (3) Their ability to bind to the tooth surface and then be slowly released in active form, a property which prolongs therapeutic effectiveness. Tetracyclines have been incorporated into a variety of delivery systems for insertion into periodontal pockets. These include hallow fibers, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer fibers, ethyl cellulose fibers, acrylic strips.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Nylund and Egelberg (1990)<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> designed a study to evaluate the effects of subgingival irrigation with Tetracycline as a supplement to mechanical plaque control and root debridement on clinical conditions of periodontal furcation areas. They suggested that future investigations on adjunctive antimicrobial furcation therapy need to be performed over longer periods of time and be aimed at evaluating re-occurrence of disease following the initial improvement. Furthermore, the antimicrobial agents may need to be administered in vehicles which provide active subgingival concentrations over prolonged intervals.</p><p>Tonetti <italic>et al</italic>. (1990)<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> measured the concentration of Tetracycline in the gingival fluid in the periodontal pocket following placement of controlled drug delivery monolithic fibers and subgingival irrigations. Results showed that zero drug release kinetics can be achieved in the periodontal pocket with a controlled delivery system made of 25 <italic>%</italic> tetracycline hydrochloride loaded ethylene vinyl acetate fiber.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>Spiramycin</title><p>Spiramycin, a macrolide antibiotic belonging to the erythromycin group. It has been shown in an <italic>in vitro</italic> study to be active against some periodontopathic bacteria - isolated from subgingival plaque.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Successful use of spiramycin in combination with mechanical debridement has been reported, but such studies were without the inclusion of placebo groups or a double blind studies. In experimental animals, spiramycin is reported to be retained in high concentration in alveolar bone, gingival tissue, and salivary glands for long periods and is gradually secreted into surrounding tissues, saliva, and crevicular fluid.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>Sznajder <italic>et al</italic>. (1987)<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> conducted a study to evaluate the effect of spiramycin on subgingival microflora in 10 patients. On a double blind basis, patients received placebo or spiramycin 3 g first day and 2 g daily for a fortnight. Results at 2 weeks examination showed a statistically significant reduction in motile rods and spirochetes, as well as pocket depth (PD) decreases. Al-Joburi <italic>et al</italic>. (1989)<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> compared the efficacy of two antibiotics, spiramycin, and tetracycline with a placebo in the treatment of advanced adult chronic periodontitis.

It can be deduced that 0.5% tetracycline hydrochloride and 0.5%spiramycin are more or less equally effective, it may be concluded that spiramycin can be used as subgingival irrigant. However, when the efficacy of root planing was compared with subgingival irrigation, root planing provided the more benefit. Further investigations are needed to document the effect of subgingival irrigation in periodontal condition with large number of patients, higher concentrations of antimicrobials, and a longer period of time.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold><italic>Conflicts of Interest: None</italic></bold></p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold><italic>Source of Support: Nil</italic></bold></p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Addy</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Langeroudi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Comparison of the immediate effects on the sub-gingival microflora of acrylic strips containing 40% chlorhexidine, metronidazole or tetracycline</article-title><source>J Clin Periodontol</source><year>1984</year><volume>11</volume><issue>6</issue><fpage>379</fpage><lpage>86</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">6589239</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Adriaens</surname><given-names>PA</given-names></name><name><surname>De Boever</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Loesche</surname><given-names>WJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Bacterial invasion in root cementum and radicular dentin of periodontally diseased teeth in humans.
