Several clinical trials in critically ill patients have reported that improvement of glycemic control reduces hospital complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), hospital stay, and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). In patients with T2D admitted to general medicine and surgery services, recent randomized, controlled trials have shown that treatment with a basal-bolus regimen results in significantly lower mean daily blood glucose (BG) and in a higher percentage of BG within target range than does treatment with sliding scale regular insulin (SSI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In addition, in general surgical patients, the basal-bolus approach results in a significant reduction in the frequency of composite complications, consisting of postoperative wound infection, pneumonia, bacteremia, and acute renal and respiratory failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). On the basis of these results, clinical practice guidelines have recommended the use of the basal-bolus approach as the preferred insulin regimen for the management of patients with diabetes not in the intensive care unit (ICU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>Despite the benefits of a basal-bolus regimen in improving glycemic control in non-critically ill patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), many health care providers and hospitalists are reluctant to integrate this approach into their clinical practice, probably because of its complexity and a fear of hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Because most patients in the hospital have reduced caloric intake as a result of medical illness or surgical procedures, we hypothesized that a single daily dose of basal insulin might result in similar glucose control and lower the rate of hypoglycemia relative to a basal-bolus regimen. Accordingly, we tested the efficacy and safety in general medical and surgical patients with T2D of a daily dose of basal insulin plus corrective doses with a rapid-insulin analog given by sliding scale (basal plus regimen) with a basal-bolus insulin regimen with glargine once daily and fixed doses of glulisine before meals and also with SSI (no basal insulin) given four times.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>In this multicenter, prospective, open-label, randomized study, we enrolled 375 adult patients admitted to general medicine and surgery services. We recruited patients with a known history of T2D and with a BG before randomization between 140 and 400 mg/dL, a known history of T2D for &#x0003e;3 months, age between 18 and 80 years, and treatment at home with diet alone, any combination of oral antidiabetic agents, or low-dose insulin therapy at a daily dose &#x02264;0.4 units/kg before admission. On admission, we stopped oral antidiabetic agents, and BG was measured before meals and at bedtime. Patients were recruited when BG was &#x0003e;140 mg/dL. Patients treated with low-dose insulin before admission had the same insulin regimen continued and were invited to participate if BG exceeded 140 mg/dL. We excluded patients with an admission, patients with any BG &#x0003e;400 mg/dL before randomization or with a history of hyperglycemic crises, patients with hyperglycemia without a known history of diabetes, patients admitted to or expected to require ICU admission, patients undergoing cardiac surgery, patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, patients with clinically relevant hepatic disease or impaired renal function (serum creatinine &#x02265;3.0 mg/dL), patients with a history of diabetic ketoacidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), pregnant patients, and patients with any mental condition rendering them unable to give informed consent.</p><p>Patients were randomized according a 2:2:1 ratio to one of three regimens: a basal-bolus regimen with insulin glargine given once daily and glulisine before meals plus corrective doses of glulisine by sliding scale for BG &#x0003e;140 mg/dL (Lantus and Apidra; Sanofi), a basal plus regimen with a daily dose of glargine and corrective doses of glulisine by sliding scale before meals for BG &#x0003e;140 mg/dL, or SSI for BG &#x0003e;140 mg/dL (Novolin R; Novo Nordisk). Patients in the basal-bolus group were started at a total daily dose (TDD) of 0.5 units/kg divided with half as insulin glargine once daily and half as insulin glulisine before meals. Patients in the basal plus group received 0.25 units/kg of glargine plus corrective doses of glulisine before meals. In patients &#x02265;70 years of age and those with a serum creatinine &#x02265;2.0 mg/dL, the starting TDD in the basal-bolus group was reduced to 0.3 units/kg in the basal-bolus, and TDD of glargine was reduced to 0.15 units/kg in the basal plus regimen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). The goal of insulin therapy was to maintain fasting and premeal glucose concentrations between 100 and 140 mg/dL. The doses of insulin were adjusted daily according to protocol (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc12-1988/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>).

In the RABBIT 2 surgical trial, 12% of patients treated with basal-bolus regimen had a BG &#x0003c;60 mg/dL and 4% had a value &#x0003c;40 mg/dL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In the current study, a BG &#x0003c;60 mg/dL was seen in 8 and 5% of patients treated with basal-bolus or basal plus regimens, and only 1% had a BG &#x0003c;40 mg/dL. As previously reported, treatment with SSI resulted in a significantly lower rate of hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Minimizing hypoglycemic events is of major importance in hospitalized patients because it has been shown to be an independent risk factor of poor outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p><p>The results of multivariate analysis indicate that the four more important factors associated with better glycemic control were the use of basal insulin versus SSI, duration of diabetes &#x02264;5 years, a randomization BG &#x02264;180 mg/dL, and an admission HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02264;7.5%. Patients with BG &#x0003e;180 mg/dL and HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003e;7.5% at admission had significant higher mean daily BG and experienced more treatment failures during therapy. This observation has important implications in clinical practice and indicates that T2D patients admitted with poor glycemic control (BG &#x0003e;180 mg/dL or HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003e;7.5%) should be treated with basal-bolus or basal plus regimens, and the use of SSI alone should be avoided because a third of all patients will continue to have significant hyperglycemia, which may increase the risk of hospital complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>We acknowledge the following limitations in this study. We excluded patients admitted to the ICU, those with clinically relevant hepatic disease or with serum creatinine &#x02265;3.0 mg/dL, patients with severe hyperglycemia, and those receiving a total dose of insulin &#x0003e;0.4 units/kg/day before admission. For such patients, higher insulin doses or a standard basal-bolus approach may be the preferred approach in achieving glycemic control. In addition, our study was not powered to determine differences in hospital complications across groups. The recent RABBIT 2 surgical trial, which included a larger number of general surgical patients, reported a significant reduction in the frequency of hospital complications in patients treated with a basal-bolus regimen compared with SSI treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Finally, in this study we observed a lower rate of BG within target range compared with previous randomized inpatient trials, in which we observed 55% of BG within goal in patients treated with a basal-bolus regimen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In this trial, we followed a similar starting insulin dose and escalation protocol, increasing insulin dose by 10% if BG was between 140 and 180 mg/dL and by 20% if BG was &#x0003e;200 mg/dL. It is possible that increasing the starting insulin dose and increasing insulin titration will result in better glycemic control; however, it may also increase the risk of hypoglycemic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p><p>In summary, most general medical and surgical patients with T2D treated with diet, oral antidiabetic agents, or low-dose insulin (&#x02264;0.4 units/day) can be managed with a single daily dose of basal insulin with supplemental (corrective) doses of rapid-acting insulin analogs before meals. This basal plus regimen resulted in improvements in glycemic control and frequency of hypoglycemic events similar to those seen with a standard basal-bolus insulin regimen, and both regimens resulted in better glycemic control and in fewer treatment failures than did the use of SSI alone. These results indicate that basal insulin is necessary for stable glucose control in the hospital and that the basal plus approach is an effective alternative to the basal-bolus regimen for the initial management of hyperglycemia in general medical and surgical patients with T2D.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
