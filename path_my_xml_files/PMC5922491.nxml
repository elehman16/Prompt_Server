This study compared the attitudes of Australian non-governmental organisation support workers towards people with mental illness with those of other health professionals. Three hundred and seventy four support workers were randomly allocated to answer questions about one of the six vignettes. Results indicated that non-governmental organisation support workers held more positive attitudes towards people with mental illness than those of general practitioners, psychiatrists and psychologists measured in prior research. These results suggest that non-governmental organisations may be a more positive and comfortable entry and referral point for mental health clients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>allied health professional</kwd><kwd>health professionals</kwd><kwd>help-seeking behaviour</kwd><kwd>inclusion</kwd><kwd>mental health</kwd><kwd>non-governmental organisations</kwd><kwd>social stigma</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January-June 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Mental illness accounts for 12.9&#x02009;per cent of the total disease burden in Australia, putting it third as a broad disease category behind cancer and cardiovascular disease (<xref rid="bibr11-2055102918765413" ref-type="bibr">Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, 2013</xref>). These rates of mental illness highlight the importance of help-seeking among mental health clients. Unfortunately, stigma interferes with help seeking and impacts mental and physical health outcomes for people affected by mental illness (<xref rid="bibr4-2055102918765413" ref-type="bibr">Corrigan, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bibr8-2055102918765413" ref-type="bibr">Henderson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bibr19-2055102918765413" ref-type="bibr">Pascoe and Richman, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr23-2055102918765413" ref-type="bibr">Rusch, 2009</xref>). Health professionals, particularly mental health professionals, are a first line of contact for people with mental health difficulties who are seeking help and support in a time of need. Despite their important role, health professionals&#x02019; attitudes towards people with mental illness may reinforce the stigma that this group of people experience (<xref rid="bibr17-2055102918765413" ref-type="bibr">Morgan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The impact of health professionals&#x02019; attitudes may be particularly damaging to this vulnerable population (<xref rid="bibr6-2055102918765413" ref-type="bibr">Frese and Davis, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bibr9-2055102918765413" ref-type="bibr">Horsfall et al., 2010</xref>). Although a review by <xref rid="bibr26-2055102918765413" ref-type="bibr">Wahl and Aroesty-Cohen (2010)</xref> indicates that there is a need for further research on health professionals&#x02019; attitudes, particularly among professions where contact with people with mental health issues is high, the non-governmental organisation (NGO) sector has been ignored in studies of health professionals&#x02019; attitudes. The extant research on the attitudes of psychologists, psychiatrists and general practitioners (GPs) towards people with mental illnesses has yielded inconsistent results. For example, different programmes of research indicate that these professionals hold the same attitudes as the general public (<xref rid="bibr16-2055102918765413" ref-type="bibr">Mental Health Council of Australia (MHCA), 2011</xref>), less positive attitudes than the public (<xref rid="bibr10-2055102918765413" ref-type="bibr">Hugo, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bibr18-2055102918765413" ref-type="bibr">Nordt et al., 2006</xref>) and more positive attitudes than the public (<xref rid="bibr25-2055102918765413" ref-type="bibr">Stuber et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr14-2055102918765413" ref-type="bibr">Lauber et al., 2004</xref>). To the best knowledge of the authors, there are no extant studies that include NGO mental health workers in Australia. This is despite the fact that provision of mental health services by psychologists and allied health accounts for 5.3&#x02009;per cent of government health spending, private psychiatrists account for 3.9&#x02009;per cent of the budget and GPs account for 3.6&#x02009;per cent of the budget, whereas NGO funding sits at 6.6&#x02009;per cent of government mental health spending in 2010&#x02013;2011 (<xref rid="bibr5-2055102918765413" ref-type="bibr">Department of Health and Ageing, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The NGO sector has also seen impressive growth worldwide and in Australia. Between 1992 and 2011, expenditure on NGO services as a percentage of state and territory spending, which is the bulk of health spending in Australia, grew from 2.1&#x02009;per cent to 9.3&#x02009;per cent of funding (<xref rid="bibr5-2055102918765413" ref-type="bibr">Department of Health and Ageing, 2013</xref>). The <xref rid="bibr27-2055102918765413" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization (2008)</xref> suggests that NGOs, described as informal community care, should form the larger part of mental health support services as a part of an integrated strategy to support people with mental health issues. Given the substantial impact that the attitudes of health professionals may have on outcomes for people receiving support, there is a need to compare attitudes between varied health professionals working in the mental health sector. A series of studies undertaken in Melbourne compared the attitudes of large samples of GPs, psychologists, psychiatrists and the general public (<xref rid="bibr22-2055102918765413" ref-type="bibr">Reavley et al., 2014</xref>).

The total sample of staff working at these organisations was approximately 1900, of whom 374 agreed to participate in this study. One NGO was national, one operated across two of the eastern states of Australia and one operated in one state only. The basic aims of the research were discussed with the senior staff in these organisations, who were instructed not to pass on the aims of the project and did not take part in the research. All persons employed by the organisations were invited to participate in the online survey by a link sent out by the administration staff in the participating organisations so as to preserve anonymity. The study received ethics approval from the Human Research Ethics Committee at the University of Queensland. Approval was also required from the research teams at the participating NGOs.

results of this research indicate that the attitudes of NGO workers towards people with mental health issues were more positive than those of the comparison mental health professionals. This finding emerges even when the NGO comparison group is limited to male NGO workers compared to the combined data of the male and female samples of other professional groups. The more positive attitudes among NGO staff may make NGOs more accessible than some of the other services and hence may encourage people to engage with care and to continue receiving appropriate support. Currently, NGOs both receive referrals from, and refer people to, public and private mental health professionals. NGO employees work alongside GPs, psychiatrists, psychologists, public and private mental health systems to support the physical and mental health of their mutual clients/patients and can thus act as a conduit for referrals and ongoing support for physical and mental health of people affected by mental illness.</p><p>One of the most comparable results in this study is social distance. Previous research has found no difference in the desire for social distance between health professionals and the public (<xref rid="bibr12-2055102918765413" ref-type="bibr">Jorm and Oh, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr22-2055102918765413" ref-type="bibr">Reavley et al., 2014</xref>). The consistent finding, both in the overall scores and in the breakdown between males and females, is that NGO workers have less of a desire for social distance compared to both other health professionals and the general public. This may be due to the high number of people working in these organisations who identify as someone with lived experience of mental illness. Two of the three organisations that participated include the percentage of people working in the organisation that identify as having lived experience of mental ill health in their annual reports. In one organisation, the percentage was 50, and in the other, the percentage was 70, figures that are greater than the proportion of the population that have lifetime experience of mental illness or substance use disorder in the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) surveys of 1997 and 2007 (<xref rid="bibr2-2055102918765413" ref-type="bibr">ABS, 2008</xref>).</p><p>To the best of these authors&#x02019; knowledge, there is no extant research on the proportion of psychologists, psychiatrists and GPs who identify as having lived experience of mental ill health. But the introduction of a peer workforce and lower educational barriers to entry suggests that the proportions may be higher in NGOs compared to those professions. In addition, <xref rid="bibr3-2055102918765413" ref-type="bibr">Bateman and Smith (2011)</xref> state that there is considerable lived experience among workers in Australian mental health NGOs. Relatedly, NGO workers thought that others held more stigmatising attitudes towards people with mental ill health than other health professionals or the general public. Previous research has suggested that health professionals are more reluctant to accept an illness in them than in a patient as evidenced by the higher scores on perceived stigma compared with personal stigma (<xref rid="bibr1-2055102918765413" ref-type="bibr">Adams et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr22-2055102918765413" ref-type="bibr">Reavley et al., 2014</xref>). However, a significant percentage of NGO workers have already acknowledged that they have a lived experience of mental illness; therefore, the reason for this more negative perception of others attitudes cannot be due to non-acceptance of their own illness. It may be that this group has direct personal experience of stigma from others and that this has negatively coloured their perceptions of others&#x02019; attitudes. It would be an interesting area for future research to establish why perceptions of the attitudes of other are so negative among these NGO workers.</p><p>The overall less positive attitudes among NGO workers towards people with schizophrenia are consistent with earlier research (<xref rid="bibr22-2055102918765413" ref-type="bibr">Reavley et al., 2014</xref>). However, the perceived attitudes of people with either early or chronic schizophrenia were not seen as being more likely to be weak than others with a mental illness, except between chronic schizophrenia and social phobia. In relation to the perceived attitudes of others, NGO workers believe that others perceive little difference between the mental illnesses included in the vignettes, but also believe that others have much less positive attitudes towards people with mental ill health than those of NGO workers.</p><p>As with any research, there are limitations to this study that should be kept in mind when interpreting these results. The comparisons with other health professionals rely on data published in previous research, using the <italic>N</italic>, mean values and standard deviations to make the direct comparisons that have been reported here.</p><p>The original data were published in 2014, which raises the possibility of a change in attitudes from health professionals in this intervening period. Previously published work that has assessed attitudes across a time span has not reported attitude changes across such a short time span (<xref rid="bibr22-2055102918765413" ref-type="bibr">Reavley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr26-2055102918765413" ref-type="bibr">Wahl and Aroesty-Cohen, 2010</xref>), but this possibility cannot be ruled out. In addition, only three NGOs participated in this research, and they may not be representative of other Australian NGOs. Nonetheless, there was a remarkable consistency of data obtained across the three organisations, suggesting that they may provide a reasonably representative sample.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section10-2055102918765413"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Mental health NGO workers, be they male or female, have generally more positive attitudes towards people with mental illness than was found among other health professionals and the general public. These data suggest that these organisations are well placed to be a low stigma point of entry to mental health support as well as a low-cost ongoing support and referral system for people living in the community with mental ill health. Research assessing why these attitudinal differences exist and why NGO support workers have more positive attitudes towards their clients than health professionals in other sectors would be valuable. Such findings may inform education strategies to promote positive attitude towards clients with mental health issues among staff outside of the NGO sector.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="section11-2055102918765413" specific-use="figshare"><title>Supplemental Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="suppl1-2055102918765413"><caption><title>Supplemental material for Attitudes of people working in mental health non-governmental organisations in Australia: A comparison with other mental health professionals</title></caption><media xlink:href="Supplemental_material.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p>Supplemental material, Supplemental_material for Attitudes of people working in mental health non-governmental organisations in Australia: A comparison with other mental health professionals by Grenville Rose, Courtney von Hippel, Loren Brener and Bill von Hippel in Health Psychology Open</p></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge the contribution of the participating NGOs.
