The effect of such a practice on recovery processes underlying protein turnover in human skeletal muscle are unknown. We determined the effect of alcohol intake on rates of myofibrillar protein synthesis (MPS) following strenuous exercise with carbohydrate (CHO) or protein ingestion.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In a randomized cross-over design, 8 physically active males completed three experimental trials comprising resistance exercise (8&#x000d7;5 reps leg extension, 80% 1 repetition maximum) followed by continuous (30 min, 63% peak power output (PPO)) and high intensity interval (10&#x000d7;30 s, 110% PPO) cycling. Immediately, and 4 h post-exercise, subjects consumed either 500 mL of whey protein (25 g; PRO), alcohol (1.5 g&#x000b7;kg body mass<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, 12&#x000b1;2 standard drinks) co-ingested with protein (ALC-PRO), or an energy-matched quantity of carbohydrate also with alcohol (25 g maltodextrin; ALC-CHO). Subjects also consumed a CHO meal (1.5 g CHO&#x000b7;kg body mass<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) 2 h post-exercise. Muscle biopsies were taken at rest, 2 and 8 h post-exercise.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Blood alcohol concentration was elevated above baseline with ALC-CHO and ALC-PRO throughout recovery (P&#x0003c;0.05). Phosphorylation of mTOR<sup>Ser2448</sup> 2 h after exercise was higher with PRO compared to ALC-PRO and ALC-CHO (P&#x0003c;0.05), while p70S6K phosphorylation was higher 2 h post-exercise with ALC-PRO and PRO compared to ALC-CHO (P&#x0003c;0.05). Rates of MPS increased above rest for all conditions (&#x0223c;29&#x02013;109%, P&#x0003c;0.05). However, compared to PRO, there was a hierarchical reduction in MPS with ALC-PRO (24%, P&#x0003c;0.05) and with ALC-CHO (37%, P&#x0003c;0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We provide novel data demonstrating that alcohol consumption reduces rates of MPS following a bout of concurrent exercise, even when co-ingested with protein.

Indeed, a number of studies have reported that athletes are more likely than the general population to drink alcohol to excess, with a large proportion (&#x0223c;50&#x02013;65%) consuming intakes above the threshold classified as hazardous drinking <xref rid="pone.0088384-Martens1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088384-OBrien2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The outcomes of binge drinking after exercise are likely to include the direct effect of alcohol on physiological processes as well as the indirect effect on the athlete's recovery due to not eating or resting adequately as a result of intoxication. Although the concurrent consumption of carbohydrate can partially offset the deleterious effects of alcohol intake on post-exercise glycogen resynthesis <xref rid="pone.0088384-Burke2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, the effect of alcohol consumption on muscle protein synthesis is unknown.</p><p>Studies by Barnes and colleagues (2010, 2011) have investigated the effects of post-exercise alcohol consumption on human muscle function and performance <xref rid="pone.0088384-Barnes1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088384-Barnes2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. However, data on the effects of alcohol intake on skeletal muscle protein synthesis is limited to work in rodents. These studies show that both acute and chronic alcohol ingestion can have a detrimental effect on cell signaling and protein synthesis in skeletal muscle <xref rid="pone.0088384-Kumar1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0088384-Lang4" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The aim of the current study was to determine the effect of alcohol intake on anabolic cell signaling and rates of myofibrillar protein synthesis (MPS) in humans during recovery from a bout of strenuous exercise approximating stresses an athlete may experience in training and performance for various team sports such as various football and rugby codes, and court sports. We hypothesized that compared to post-exercise protein intake, co-ingestion of alcohol would down-regulate translation initiation signaling and decrease rates of MPS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects</title><p>Eight healthy physically active male subjects (age 21.4&#x000b1;4.8 yr, body mass (BM) 79.3&#x000b1;11.9 kg, peak oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2peak</sub>) 48.1&#x000b1;4.8 mL&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000b7;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, leg extension one repetition maximum (1RM) 104&#x000b1;20 kg; values are mean &#x000b1; SD) who had been participating in regular exercise (3 times wk<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for &#x0003e;6 months) volunteered for this study.

No minors were involved in this study as subjects were required to be 18 years of age at the time of participation due to the legal age for alcohol consumption in Australia. All subjects were deemed healthy based on their response to a routine medical screening questionnaire.

Each experimental trial was separated by a two week recovery period, during which time subjects maintained their habitual physical activity pattern. Given the data showing little/no effect of carbohydrate ingestion on myofibrillar protein synthesis, the ALC-CHO treatment was used as an iso-energetic control. The decision not to use parallel groups was based on a within subject crossover design adding strength to the interpretation and conclusions of the study but limited the total number of treatments such that an exercise only trial was not undertaken. Finally, we based our exercise protocol incorporating the different metabolic stresses approximating those experienced in team sports due to published reports of the increased incidence of excessive alcohol consumption following performance in team/group sport <xref rid="pone.0088384-OBrien2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Preliminary Testing</title><sec id="s2d1"><title>VO<sub>2</sub>peak</title><p>VO<sub>2peak</sub> and peak power output (PPO) were determined during an incremental test to volitional fatigue on a Lode cycle ergometer (Groningen, The Netherlands).

During subsequent trials tracer infusion commenced 1 h prior to the exercise protocol. The exercise bout incorporated the concurrent stimuli of resistance, continuous and intermittent high-intensity exercise to represent the key features of team sport activities. The specific protocol involved a standardized warm-up (5 repetitions at 50% and 5 repetitions at 60% 1RM) on a leg extension machine before the resistance exercise protocol was commenced. Resistance exercise consisted of eight sets of five repetitions at &#x0223c;80% of 1RM. Each set was separated by a 3-min recovery period during which the subject remained seated. After completion of the final set, subjects rested for 5 min before commencing 30 min of continuous cycling at &#x0223c;63% PPO (&#x0223c;70% VO<sub>2peak</sub>).

Furthermore, a CHO-based meal (1.5 g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> BM) was consumed &#x0223c;2 h post-exercise, immediately after the muscle biopsy, according to recommendations for post-exercise glycogen recovery <xref rid="pone.0088384-Burke3" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Protein beverages included L-(<italic>ring</italic>-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>] phenylalanine at 4% to prevent marked disturbance in isotopic enrichment and to maintain steady state enrichment.

These outcomes were most evident (37% reduction in rates of MPS) when alcohol was consumed in the absence of post-exercise protein intake, as is likely to occur when intoxication reduces the athlete's compliance to sound recovery practices. However, a second finding was that even when protein was consumed in amounts shown to be optimally effective to stimulate MPS <xref rid="pone.0088384-Areta1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> during post-exercise recovery, the intake of alcohol reduced MPS by &#x0223c;24%, representing only a partial &#x02018;rescue&#x02019; of the anabolic response compared with protein alone.</p><p>The alcohol consumption protocol used in the current study, representing the mean intake of alcohol that has been self-reported in several studies of binge drinking practices of team athletes <xref rid="pone.0088384-Burke1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088384-OBrien1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, elicited blood alcohol concentrations that exceeded the 0.05 g&#x000b7;100 mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> legal limit for driving in Australia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088384-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Although peak post-exercise blood alcohol values were lower than we have previously reported <xref rid="pone.0088384-Burke2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, such differences can, in part, be explained by different alcohol ingestion protocols and feeding regimens. The subtle differences in blood alcohol concentration were likely a result of the different macronutrient composition consumed and the aminoacidemia in PRO and ALC-PRO was similar and significantly different to that seen with the carbohydrate treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088384-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Despite alcohol having little effect on blood amino acid profiles, myofibrillar FSR was significantly different between treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088384-g007">Figure 7</xref>).

However, this study is the first to have measured FSR after consecutive bouts of resistance, continuous and high-intensity exercise when alcohol was consumed during recovery. While several studies examining the effects of alcohol intake have been undertaken in rodents, the relative quantity of alcohol administered in these investigations is several fold higher than in the current human study <xref rid="pone.0088384-Lang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088384-Lang4" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088384-Lang5" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0088384-Vary1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.

Notwithstanding these differences, Lang et al. <xref rid="pone.0088384-Lang5" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> reported a 25% decrease in rates of muscle protein synthesis with alcohol administration in rodents, a value in close agreement with the current study. Our results show alcohol ingestion in humans suppresses the elevated rates of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle induced by exercise and protein ingestion.</p><p>The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a central node for integrating nutrient (i.e. amino acid) and exercise/contraction signal transduction <xref rid="pone.0088384-Dreyer1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088384-Zoncu1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Post-exercise phosphorylation of mTOR<sup>Ser2448</sup> was attenuated when alcohol was co-ingested with either carbohydrate or protein compared to protein ingestion alone. Interestingly, there was discordance in phosphorylation responses between mTOR and its downstream signaling targets (p70S6K and 4E-BP1). The mechanism through which alcohol may attenuate mTOR complex 1 activity is still poorly defined. Recent evidence has implicated several upstream regulatory mechanisms of mTOR signaling including the Rag family of GTPases <xref rid="pone.0088384-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088384-Sancak1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, phosphatidic acid <xref rid="pone.0088384-ONeil1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and the DNA damage response 2 (REDD2) protein <xref rid="pone.0088384-Miyazaki1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The inhibitory effects of alcohol on mTOR phosphorylation in skeletal muscle have been attributed to increases in the mRNA/protein content of the negative mTOR regulator REDD1 with acute intoxication and that alcohol may also generate greater association of mTOR with raptor to down regulate mRNA translation <xref rid="pone.0088384-Lang3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088384-Lang7" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Thus it is plausible that several mechanisms may act synergistically upstream of mTOR in response to alcohol ingestion to modulate mTOR activity. Nevertheless, our findings indicate that the observed alcohol-induced attenuation of MPS was likely mediated, at least in part, by effects on mTORC1-mediated signaling.</p><p>p70S6K enhances translation of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins and elongation factors <xref rid="pone.0088384-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> and has been proposed as a &#x02018;surrogate&#x02019; marker associated with rates of muscle protein synthesis <xref rid="pone.0088384-Baar1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0088384-Kumar2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.

We present new information in human skeletal muscle to demonstrate the exercise and nutrient-induced increase in p70S6K phosphorylation is significantly reduced with alcohol ingestion in the absence of the co-ingestion of protein. The discordant mTOR-p70S6K phosphorylation with protein only and protein feedings with alcohol is not unprecedented given we <xref rid="pone.0088384-Areta1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and others <xref rid="pone.0088384-Atherton1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> have shown that mTOR-S6K phosphorylation often parallels changes in MPS but does not always reflect either the magnitude or duration of the increased MPS signal in humans. An alternate mechanism through which alcohol may limit rates of protein synthesis is endoplasmic reticulum stress and the resultant unfolded protein response. Alcohol consumption generates oxidative stress and inflammation and the potential to disrupt endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis; a consequence of this response is to limit the rate of protein synthesis <xref rid="pone.0088384-Deldicque1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088384-FernandezSol1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>.

However, these differences may, in part, be explained by the 2.3 fold greater relative alcohol administration in rodents versus humans. Finally, it must be acknowledged that our data are potentially limited by providing only a single &#x02018;snapshot&#x02019; during recovery and the possibility exists that our muscle biopsy time-points failed to coincide with peak phosphorylation responses of signal transduction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the effect of alcohol ingestion following concurrent resistance, continuous and intermittent high-intensity exercise in human skeletal and further studies are needed to better understand the precise mechanisms through which alcohol attenuates human skeletal muscle protein synthesis.</p><p>In contrast with the changes in cell signaling, muscle mRNA responses of selected genes associated with muscle proteolysis and catabolism were largely unchanged between treatments. MuRF-1 mRNA expression was elevated 2 h following exercise but had returned to basal levels, by 8 h in all treatments. Whereas, atrogin-1 mRNA expression did not change 2 h following exercise and was significantly lower than rest and 2 h post-exercise at 8 h post-exercise in all treatments. These results contrast findings by Vary and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0088384-Vary1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> who found alcohol ingestion to increase MuRF-1 and Atrogin-1 mRNA abundance in rat skeletal muscle.

As muscle damaging exercise has previously been reported to decrease GLUT4 translocation and subsequent rates of muscle glycogen resynthesis <xref rid="pone.0088384-Asp1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, the possibility that it also may impart a negative effect on protein transporters and rates of protein synthesis cannot be discounted. However, the atrogene results of the current study indicate alcohol ingestion does not exert any additional effects on ubiquitin ligase expression after exercise in human skeletal muscle. Future studies investigating the time course of atrogene expression and direct measures of skeletal muscle proteasome activity and/or protein breakdown following alcohol ingestion in humans are warranted.</p><p>In conclusion, the current data provide the novel observation that alcohol impairs the response of MPS in exercise recovery in human skeletal muscle despite optimal nutrient provision. The quantity of alcohol consumed in the current study was based on amounts reported during binge drinking by athletes. However, published reports suggest intakes of some individuals can be significantly greater <xref rid="pone.0088384-Burke1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088384-OBrien3" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, which is of concern for many reasons related to health and safety <xref rid="pone.0088384-OBrien2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Regrettably, there has been difficulty in finding an educational message with alcohol consumption related to sports performance that has resonance with athletes. Given the need to promote protein synthesis that underpins adaptation, repair and regeneration of skeletal muscle the results of the current study provide clear evidence of impaired recovery when alcohol is consumed after concurrent (resistance, continuous and intermittent high-intensity) exercise even in the presence of optimal nutritional conditions. We propose our data is of paramount interest to athletes and coaches. Our findings provide an evidence-base for a message of moderation in alcohol intake to promote recovery after exercise with the potential to alter current sports culture and athlete practices.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0088384.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
