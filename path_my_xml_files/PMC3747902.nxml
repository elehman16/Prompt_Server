The calculated &#x003b2;-cell function index (&#x00394;<italic>I</italic>/&#x00394;<italic>G</italic> &#x000d7; MI) paralleled insulin secretion.

However, the mechanism(s) underlying the &#x0201c;additive&#x0201d; effect of M+S have yet to be established. Our findings confirm that, when used as monotherapy, both S and M reduce postprandial glycemic excursion to a comparable degree, while combination of the two promotes greater attenuation of the postprandial hyperglycemia. The postprandial effect of M monotherapy appears to be secondary to a direct suppression of endogenous (hepatic) glucose production, since neither plasma insulin nor glucagon levels changed significantly, while that of S is mediated primarily by the suppression of glucagon secretion. The direct effect of M on the liver presumably is hormone independent, whereas the reduction in EGP after S therapy most likely is secondary to alterations in the portal insulin-to-glucagon ratio resulting from the increase in plasma GLP-1. The steep slope of decline in EGP after M compared with the slower decrease in EGP after S monotherapy also suggests that different mechanisms are involved in the enhancement of EGP suppression. The marked decrease in basal EGP and the steep slope with greater suppression of EGP after combination M+S also are consistent with independent and additive effects of the two antidiabetes agents. Comparable EGP suppression has been reported in normal subjects after a glucose challenge, which also indicated that most of the glucose was disposed peripherally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>Neither plasma insulin nor ISRs were significantly enhanced after the meal with either M or S monotherapy. In contrast, M+S combination was accompanied by a clear augmentation of insulin secretion and potentiating of plasma glucagon suppression, resulting in the greatest suppression of EGP. Of note, plasma glucagon suppression after M+S therapy correlated with the quick surge (initial 120 min) in plasma bioactive GLP-1. We did not observe a significant change in postprandial insulin secretion after 6 weeks of S monotherapy despite the modest increase in plasma bioactive GLP-1 concentration. However, equivalent plasma insulin and C-peptide levels (i.e., increased &#x00394;<italic>I</italic>/&#x00394;<italic>G</italic> and &#x00394;ISR/&#x00394;<italic>G</italic>) in the face of a lower plasma glucose concentration after S (compared with P) indicates that &#x003b2;-cell function improved. These findings are consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) showing that the immediate (minutes to hours) absolute increase in plasma insulin response induced by vildagliptin dissipates overtime. Unlike insulin, suppression of plasma glucagon was detected during the initial 120 min of the MTT after treatment with S alone and the combined M+S. These observations suggest a differential sensitivity of pancreatic &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-cells to GLP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p><p>The present results demonstrate that M, S, and the combination M+S therapy did not have any effects on the <italic>R</italic><sub>a</sub> of ingested glucose in the peripheral circulation, on splanchnic glucose utilization, or on the rate of tissue glucose disposal. However, we cannot entirely rule out small differences among treatments in either splanchnic glucose uptake or tissue glucose disposal, since these could have escaped our detection. These results indicate that the reduction in EGP was the primary factor responsible for the attenuation in the postmeal plasma glucose concentration after each of the three therapeutic interventions. Thus, unlike the GLP-1 analogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) S has no effect on either gastric emptying or splanchnic glucose utilization. The failure to observe any increase peripheral glucose disposal is not surprising for two reasons: <italic>1</italic>) neither M, in the absence of weight loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), nor S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) is known to enhance muscle insulin sensitivity and <italic>2</italic>) despite the increase in plasma insulin response with the M+S treatment, any increment in insulin-stimulated glucose disposal would have been offset by the large reduction in plasma glucose concentration.</p><p>In this study, we show a two- to threefold increase in basal plasma bioactive GLP-1 concentration in T2DM patients after 6 weeks of S used in combination with M. Within 120 min after meal ingestion, bioactive GLP-1 concentration increased with S treatment, and this elevation was much greater with the combined M+S treatment, even though there was no significant rise with M treatment. This observation is consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and underscores the clinical relevance of the additive, even synergistic, effect of M when used together with S to increase plasma GLP-1 levels. However, this effect of M apparently relies on simultaneous improvement in plasma glucose concentration, perhaps leading to augmented insulin secretion and enhanced suppression of glucagon secretion. A novel finding was the fourfold increase in plasma GIP levels observed with M monotherapy. However, since basal and postmeal plasma GIP levels were comparable in all four treatment periods, the enhanced stimulation of insulin secretion and suppression of glucagon secretion in T2DM patients treated with S alone or in combination with M must have resulted from the increase in bioactive plasma GLP-1 levels. Our results are consistent with those of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) and indicate that GIP does not potentiate the antidiabetes effect of GLP-1 in T2DM patients. Consistent with this, there is no known role for GIP on glucagon suppression and the effect of GIP on insulin stimulation overlap with the GLP-1 intracellular pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>Whether the magnified GLP-1 response to a standard meal after DPP-4 treatment in combination with M is a consequence of the effect of S plus better glycemic control, superimposed on M stimulation of endogenous GLP-1 secretion, cannot be determined from our study. M, as well as some other antidiabetes agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), has been suggested to directly enhance GLP-1 release from the intestinal L cells. However, the possibility that this is a nonspecific effect related to improved glycemic control has yet to be excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Because M monotherapy was not accompanied by any significant change in plasma GLP-1 in our studies either at baseline or after the meal, our data support the notion that the magnified GLP-1 response is primarily explained by better glycemic control. These observations are of considerable clinical significance, since the combination of M with a DPP-4 inhibitor provides a unique mechanism of glucose lowering with additive effect to reduce plasma glucose concentration in T2DM patients.</p><p>In summary, the current study demonstrates that S and M monotherapy reduces glycemic excursions via independent and additive mechanisms. The inhibition of endogenous (hepatic) glucose production by M most likely resulted from a direct effect on the liver, whereas the effect of S on EGP was indirect and associated with elevated plasma GLP-1 levels with subsequent glucagon suppression. Combination M+S therapy further reduced postmeal plasma glucose concentrations subsequent to a greater increase in fasting and postmeal GLP-1 levels, accompanied by a further enhancement in insulin secretion and glucagon suppression. There were no changes in splanchnic glucose uptake, gastric emptying, or insulin-mediated glucose disposal with any treatment regimens, and the attenuation of the postprandial hyperglycemia with all therapies was entirely attributed to the reduction in EGP.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
