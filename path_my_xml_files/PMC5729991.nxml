Poor preoperative communication between patients and surgeons can lead to uninformed decisions and result in unexpected outcomes, conflict between surgeons and patients, and treatment inconsistent with patient preferences. This article describes the protocol for a multisite, cluster-randomised trial that uses a stepped wedge design to test a patient-driven question prompt list (QPL) intervention aimed to improve preoperative decision making and inform postoperative expectations.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute-funded trial will be conducted at five academic medical centres in the USA. Study participants include surgeons who routinely perform vascular or oncological surgery, their patients and families. We aim to enrol 40 surgeons and 480 patients over 24 months. Patients age 65 or older who see a study-enrolled surgeon to discuss a vascular or oncological problem that could be treated with high-risk surgery will be enrolled at their clinic visit. Together with stakeholders, we developed a QPL intervention addressing preoperative communication needs of patients considering major surgery. Guided by the theories of self-determination and relational autonomy, this intervention is designed to increase patient activation. Patients will receive the QPL brochure and a letter from their surgeon encouraging its use. Using audio recordings of the outpatient surgical consultation, patient and family member questionnaires administered at three time points and retrospective chart review, we will compare the effectiveness of the QPL intervention to usual care with respect to the following primary outcomes: patient engagement in decision making, psychological well-being and post-treatment regret for patients and families, and interpersonal and intrapersonal conflict relating to treatment decisions and treatments received.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Approvals have been granted by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Wisconsin and at each participating site, and a Certificate of Confidentiality has been obtained.

Given operative trends for patients age 65 and older,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> this number is expected to grow as the US population ages. Although major surgery has potential to prolong life and improve symptoms, it can have unwanted outcomes for older adults, including reduced quality of life,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> more hospitalisations<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> and potential suffering at the end of life.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> Furthermore, 50% of patients 65 and older have one or more chronic conditions,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> putting them at greater risk than younger patients for death and postoperative complications<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> that necessitate intensive care or lengthy hospitalisations.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> Therefore, a decision to proceed with surgery can initiate a care trajectory that is ultimately inconsistent with personal preferences and goals, for example confinement in a nursing home or prolonged life support in an intensive care unit. Patients whose postoperative expectations are not met may suffer as they try to make sense of their situation, feel a loss of control and assume self-blame.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> For these reasons, the decision-making process for older patients considering high-risk surgery is complicated, and because the consequences of these decisions also affect family members, the stakes are high.</p><p>Current communication practices inadequately support preoperative decision making about major surgery. According to the Institute of Medicine,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> most patients prefer to share in decision making; however, &#x02018;they are often not afforded the chance to participate&#x02019; (ch3, p38),<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and studies suggest that surgeons rarely employ a cooperative decision-making process.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;19</xref> Instead, surgeons rely on best&#x000a0;practices, specifically informed consent, to disclose procedural risks and help patients make choices. However, existing decision-making standards do not adequately engage patients in deliberation, and the process of informed consent fails to explain how a patient might actually experience complications, or even <italic>expected</italic> downstream outcomes, such as the need for additional invasive treatments or predictable changes in functional status.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> To make value-laden decisions, patients and families need to know what the outcomes of surgery mean <italic>for them</italic> and how surgical treatment can be understood in the context of their overall prognosis, particularly for patients with other chronic illnesses.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref> To be successful, this process requires partnership; surgeons need patients to share what matters to them, and patients need surgeons to help them compare treatment options and evaluate their effectiveness based on patients&#x02019; values and goals.</p><p>We designed a multisite, cluster-randomised trial of an intervention to improve preoperative communication between surgeons and older adults considering major vascular or oncological operations. Our study evaluates a question prompt list (QPL) intervention for use in the surgical clinic that our research group developed with input from patients, families and surgeons who have experience with high-risk surgery. The intervention aims to encourage patients and families to ask questions that allow them to compare treatment options and get information about how surgery might impact their lives. First, we discuss the rationale and theoretical foundations of the surgical QPL intervention. We then describe the research protocol together with details of study design, data collection, outcomes and analysis plan.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Current gaps in communication about high-risk surgery</title><p>To gain a better understanding of usual practice, our research group analysed over 90 preoperative conversations between surgeons and patients considering high-risk cardiovascular, oncological and neurosurgical procedures as part of a multi-institutional study.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 21 24</xref> Analysis of these conversations revealed three primary barriers to decision&#x000a0;making. One, surgeons employ a &#x02018;fix-it&#x02019; model<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> by describing the patient&#x02019;s disease as an isolated abnormality linked directly with a surgical solution. This model supports an implicit message about the &#x02018;benefits&#x02019; of surgery: the reason to operate is to fix what has been identified as broken, and the language implies the patient will return to &#x02018;normal&#x02019; after the problem has been fixed. However, this &#x02018;fix-it&#x02019; model lacks an explicit description about what surgery might mean more broadly, for example how surgery will impact the patient&#x02019;s functional independence or other health problems. Lack of context regarding their overall health state makes it challenging for patients to understand the need to deliberate about the value of surgery given their chronic health conditions and quality-of-life preferences.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Two, surgeons present their own evaluation of the trade-offs associated with the proposed intervention. Surgeons struggle to elicit patient preferences, and efforts to encourage questions are often ineffective as patients regularly respond with logistical or technical concerns, for example what time surgery will take place or whether stitches or staples will be used. The result is surgeon-generated assumptions about the value of specific outcomes and acceptability of trade-offs.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Three, informed consent requires surgeons to convey risks that are typically described as objective estimates of isolated physiological harms, for example a 45% chance of renal failure. However, this approach does not describe outcomes in a way that allows patients and families to understand what life might be like after surgery.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> These three barriers highlight the need to bridge the gap between what surgeons know and what patients understand about treatment outcomes. These findings complement work by Blazeby and colleagues who have observed that surgeons emphasise in-hospital risks and technical aspects of the procedure rather than long-term functional outcomes.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 27</xref></p><p>We also drew from our previous work using physician surveys<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28&#x02013;31</xref> and qualitative interviews with surgeons<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> to identify a fourth problem with preoperative communication. Our research group has previously described &#x02018;surgical buy-in&#x02019;, whereby surgeons operate under an assumption that the patient has agreed to both the surgical procedure as well as all postoperative care anticipated by the surgeon, including life-supporting treatments.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28 32</xref> While this implicit contract is understood by surgeons, it is not recognised by patients who may desire treatment limitations based on their evaluation of certain health outcomes.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> This disconnect can result in postoperative conflict between surgeons, patients and families<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33 34</xref> when patients or surrogates on behalf of patients request to forgo aggressive treatments which the surgeon believes the patient agreed to preoperatively.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Development of an intervention to improve preoperative communication</title><p>QPLs&#x000a0;have proven efficacy for improving patient&#x02013;doctor communication. QPL interventions can effectively change how patients and families communicate with physicians, improve patients&#x02019; and family members&#x02019; psychological outcomes, and better meet patients&#x02019; informational needs.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35&#x02013;37</xref> Effective QPL interventions require physicians to endorse and support the patient&#x02019;s use of the question list, but do not require resource-intensive adjuncts like patient navigators or patient coaching.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> For patients considering surgery<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> and those with life-limiting illness,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> QPLs effectively increase the number of questions about prognosis and facilitate better alignment between treatment expectations and likely outcomes. These interventions also produce behaviour change in physicians, including surgeons,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> so that patients receive more information about treatment alternatives and attention to personal preferences.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></p><p>We met regularly for 10 months with a dedicated group of patients and family members to design a QPL specifically targeting the preoperative decisional needs of patients considering high-risk surgery.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Our research group gathered over 300 questions from publicly available &#x02018;questions to ask your surgeon&#x02019; and focused on three patient-mediated targets identified by our patient and family advisors: &#x02018;Should I have surgery?&#x02019;, &#x02018;What should I expect if everything goes well?&#x02019;, and &#x02018;What happens if things go wrong?&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). We discarded questions that were either redundant or irrelevant to these targets and used feedback from our patient, family, surgeon and hospital stakeholders to refine the list to create a surgical QPL brochure containing 11 questions. Details of the QPL development have been previously published.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Patient and family stakeholder-proposed question prompt list&#x000a0;targets and resulting goals.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-014002f01"/></fig></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Theoretical framework underlying the QPL intervention</title><p>Based on the theories of self-determination<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> and relational autonomy<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44 45</xref> described by Elwyn&#x000a0;<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> QPLs aim to overcome structural and interactional barriers and promote patient activation, thereby increasing patient engagement in decision making. Given the transactional nature of the patient experience,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> activated patients will receive more patient-centred care and take part in more collaborative decision making, even within the same provider. By supporting patients&#x02019; need for autonomy and relatedness, interventions &#x02014; such as a QPL &#x02014; to help patients gain knowledge about treatment options offer a strategy to promote patients&#x02019; self-perceived capacity to engage in treatment decisions.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>Randomised comparative effectiveness study</title><p>Our intervention consists of the surgical QPL and a brief letter from the surgeon endorsing its use, mailed to the patient in advance of the clinic appointment. The intervention targets patients and family members in the preoperative period and seeks to impact (1) patient engagement in decision making for high-risk surgery, (2) psychological well-being and post-treatment regret for patients and family members and (3) interpersonal and intrapersonal conflict relating to treatment decisions and received treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>).

We are conducting the study in the outpatient surgical clinics at five high-volume academic medical centres across the USA: University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics (Madison, Wisconsin), University of California San Francisco (San Francisco, California), Brigham and Women&#x02019;s Hospital (Boston, Massachusetts), Rutgers New Jersey Medical School/The University Hospital (Newark, New&#x000a0;Jersey) and Oregon Health Sciences University Hospital and Clinics (Portland, Oregon). We selected these five sites to represent distinct geographical regions and demographic groups in order to capture diverse experiences with surgical decision making.</p><p>Participating surgeons from these five centres routinely perform high-risk oncological or vascular surgery. Patients and family members are invited to participate as dyads. However, patients may participate alone while family members can only enrol with a corresponding patient. We will enrol patients in each surgeon&#x02019;s clinic according to a stepped&#x000a0;wedge design implemented in six 4-month waves over a 24-month period (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>). In wave 0, all patients will receive usual care. With each subsequent wave, 8 of the 40 enrolled surgeons will cross over into the intervention group.

Eligible patients are age 65 years and older with one or more chronic health conditions who have an outpatient consultation with a study-enrolled surgeon to discuss a new surgical problem. The surgical problem must be vascular or oncological in nature and could be treated with one of the 227 ICD-9-coded procedures our research group previously defined as high risk.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> For each enrolled patient, we will approach one family member to participate who is present during the conversation with the surgeon in clinic. Eligible participants must be English-speaking or Spanish-speaking and able to converse with the surgeon without an interpreter (aside from Spanish-speaking participants who may use an interpreter), have self-reported visual acuity and literacy skills sufficient to read a newspaper, and be able to provide written informed consent. Patients who do not have a problem that can be potentially treated with surgery, for example an aneurysm that does not meet size guidelines for operative repair, will be excluded based on chart review or previsit determination by the surgeon.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Recruitment</title><p>At each study site, all eligible surgeons will receive an invitation via e-mail by the site principal investigator. Surgeons who do not opt out will be chosen first based&#x000a0;on surgical subspecialty to capture variability in high-risk procedures and second by random selection of surgeons within a given subspecialty. Surgeons will not receive incentives for participation. We aim to enrol 40 surgeons in total, with the number of surgeons selected to be approximately proportional to the surgical volume at each site.</p><p>Study staff will review the clinic schedule of each enrolled surgeon and identify eligible patients based on chart review and clinic intake forms. On the day of clinic, study staff will meet with interested patients and family members to explain the study and obtain informed consent prior to the conversation with the surgeon. Patients and family members will receive financial incentives valued at $55 for participation. To avoid over-representation of any one surgeon, after each surgeon has two patients enrolled within the 4-month wave, recruitment will cease for that surgeon&#x02019;s patients until the next wave begins. We aim to enrol a total of 480 patients across all five sites, with 12 patients per surgeon.</p><p>We will use stratified purposeful sampling to identify a subset of enrolled patients (and family members, if applicable) who underwent surgery and experienced a serious postoperative complication, as determined by chart review. Serious complications include prolonged hospitalisation (more than 8 days postoperatively), prolonged length of stay in intensive care (greater than 3 days), prolonged mechanical ventilation, myocardial infarction, major cerebral vascular accident, new-onset dialysis or death.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 38</xref> We will invite these patients and family members to participate in a face-to-face qualitative interview within 30 days after surgery. We will continue to interview patients until we reach saturation, meaning that data from subsequent transcripts become redundant with developed concepts.

On study commencement, a master&#x02019;s level statistician established a step-wise randomisation using a computer-generated randomisation schedule for the list of enrolled surgeons by site. The schedule determined the crossover wave for each surgeon and was designed to balance transitions to the intervention arm across sites in each wave according to the design in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>. Surgeon crossover will occur in one direction only, and each within-site change will happen once every 4 months during the 24-month duration of the study. A 2-week hiatus in data collection at the start of the crossover will be instituted in transitioning clinics to ensure patients in the intervention group have had the opportunity to receive the QPL and endorsement letter from the surgeon. Study staff will notify enrolled surgeons prior to the upcoming crossover as the intervention is dependent on surgeon endorsement. We expect negligible contamination between study arms as the intervention requires surgeon endorsement of the QPL. Only patients whose surgeons have crossed over into the intervention arm will receive the QPL and surgeon endorsement letter in the mail prior to consultation. Although patients in the control arm may access question lists from outside sources, our prior observational studies confirm surgeons do not routinely endorse the use of question prompts.</p><p>Whereas surgeons are not blinded to the intervention, every effort will be made to maintain blinding for patients and family members. Participants will be told the goal of the study is to evaluate communication between surgeons and patients, but they will not be informed about the distribution of the QPL. Transcriptionists and qualitative interviewers will be blinded to the intervention status of each encounter. Study staff are tasked with assuring the QPL has been sent and providing regular reminders to the surgeon to endorse the QPL with all new patients. Study staff will not know if the patient has received the QPL at the time of enrolment but will not be blinded during data collection. In an attempt to insulate study staff from group assignment during data collection, they will strictly adhere to a script and enquire about receipt of the QPL (with all patients regardless of group assignment) 1 day after enrolment following administration of the first questionnaire. Furthermore, data collected from chart abstraction will be reviewed by a blinded clinician for 10% of the sample to ensure accuracy of data entry.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Intervention</title><p>Our intervention consists of the QPL brochure and a letter from the patient&#x02019;s surgeon encouraging its use. The surgical QPL contains 11 questions to help patients and families (1) make treatment decisions in line with their values and goals, (2) anticipate and make sense of postoperative outcomes and (3) experience less postoperative conflict about treatment of serious complications. Once a surgeon has crossed over into the intervention arm, all of his or her patients with a new vascular or oncological problem will receive the QPL intervention via US mail prior to the scheduled clinic appointment. To ensure that there is sufficient time for patients to receive the QPL intervention, we will only recruit patients who have been identified as eligible at least 5 days in advance of their appointment. This timeframe will remain consistent for both control and intervention patients as those who are scheduled more urgently may be systemically different.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Data collection</title><sec id="s2f1"><title>Audio&#x000a0;recording</title><p>We plan to audio-record and transcribe verbatim one conversation between the attending surgeon, patient and accompanying family member(s).

For patients who receive surgery, questionnaires will be administered at 1&#x02013;2 weeks and 6&#x02013;8 weeks postoperatively. For those who undergo medical management or observation, questionnaires will be given at 6&#x02013;8 weeks and 12&#x02013;14 weeks following the clinic visit.

specifically they felt &#x02018;blindsided&#x02019; when surgical results did not match their expectations. The primary outcome measures to assess psychological well-being are the Measure Yourself Concerns and Wellbeing (MYCaW) and patient-reported post-treatment regret. MYCaW is a patient-reported outcome measure originally designed for patients with cancer and their family members, which we have adopted for use with patients who have vascular disease. MYCaW allows patients and family members to identify their own most pressing health concerns and rate their well-being. We will administer the MYCaW at the three time points. Patients and family members will report their initial responses to the MYCaW at the time of the first questionnaire, 24&#x02013;48 hours after the clinic visit. Participants will independently rescore their initial concerns and well-being at the two subsequent time points corresponding to the second and third questionnaires; the difference in scores describes improvement or deterioration in their well-being. To assess treatment-associated regret, we will ask patients and family members at the time of the third and final questionnaire&#x000a0;&#x02014; &#x02018;Looking back, is there anything about your treatment/your family member&#x02019;s treatment that you would do differently?&#x02019; &#x02014;&#x000a0;and transform responses into a dichotomous variable (regret, no regret) for analysis.<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> We will also analyse these responses qualitatively.</p><p>Secondary outcome measures include validated measures from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) to assess the psychological impact of illness from the patient&#x02019;s perspective.<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> Patients will receive the Psychosocial Illness Impact-Neg 4a, Psychosocial Illness Impact-Pos 4a and Anxiety 4a; family members will be asked to complete Anxiety 4a and PROMIS short form (SF) Global Health.

All models will be estimated and tested using PROC MIXED or PROC NLMIX in SAS V.9.3.</p><p>We will perform additional analyses to test and quantify whether and to what extent the effect of the QPL intervention on patient engagement outcome measures is mediated by the presence of a family member during the visit with the surgeon. Exploratory analysis of family-reported outcomes will occur independently of patient-reported outcomes. To accomplish this, we will compare the indirect effect with the total effect in joint linear structural equation models for the endpoint and the mediator, including correlated random surgeon effects for each of the mediator and endpoint parts of the models. In addition, we anticipate treatment effect could vary across subpopulations defined by the following covariates: indication for surgery, patient comorbid illness and insurance status. Therefore, we will test the effect of treatment separately in subpopulations defined by these variables.</p><p>To decrease missing data, we limited the number of questions in the follow-up questionnaires and will provide a bonus incentive for participants who complete all three questionnaires. At the time of analysis, we will develop a comprehensive description of the missingness patterns and develop a plan for imputation that leverages the available data and concentrates on the data most heavily subject to missingness. If data are missing on predictor variables of interest, values will be imputed using multiple imputation techniques (ie, chained equations imputations).<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61 62</xref> If dropout is substantial, we will again use multiple imputation, including exploiting responses from the first two time points (day of clinic visit and 24&#x02013;48 hours postvisit), to impute responses from the final two questionnaires, to maximise statistical efficiency and to&#x000a0;minimise bias.</p></sec><sec id="s2h2"><title>Sample size and power calculation</title><p>Each arm will contain 240 patients, for a total of 480 patient participants. Based on our prior work, we expect about 70%&#x02013;80% of patients will have a family member present who will participate. Therefore, we estimate 384 family members from all sites will partake, although we will enrol up to 480 family members if all patients have a family member interested in participating. Assuming all enrolled patients enrol with a family member, the maximum number of all possible participants (surgeons, patients and family members) is 1000.</p><p>For each quantitative aim, we desire a family-wise two-sided type I error rate of &#x003b1;=0.05; under a Bonferroni correction, tests will be conducted with nominal &#x003b1;=0.05/2=0.025 because there are two primary endpoints for aim 1 and aim 2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">table 2</xref>). Using patient satisfaction data at one site, we found that between-surgeon variance accounts for only 5% of the total variance. Because power in the stepped wedge design is slightly degraded with greater variance between (vs within) surgeons, we assumed a worst-case scenario between-surgeon variance of 30%. We interpreted this as the interclass correlation between multiple patients of the same surgeon at a given site and included a surgeon-level random effect in our calculation, anticipating between 5% and 30% of the total variance to be accounted for by surgeon effects (ie, interclass correlation&#x000a0;(ICC)&#x000a0;=0.05&#x02013;0.30). Extending the information-based method of computing power for a basic stepped&#x000a0;wedge design<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> to the case of our multisite stepped&#x000a0;wedge design, we custom-programmed power calculations using R V.3.2.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).</p><p>With this method, we computed power of 82% to detect small-to-medium and 93% to detect medium&#x000a0;effect sizes of Cohen&#x02019;s d<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>=0.425 and d=0.5, respectively. Assuming&#x000a0;the SD for PEPPI-5 within each treatment arm is&#x000a0;4.3,<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref> we will have 93% power to detect effects as small as 2.15 points. For the number of patient questions, we assumed a mean difference of 1.4 questions between arms.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Assuming overdispersion of two&#x000a0;relative to Poisson data, within arm SD=2.7, yielding d=1.4/2.7=0.52, which we are well&#x000a0;powered to detect. For the MYCaW well-being scale, Jolliffe <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref> found SD=1.26 at 6 weeks, and a 6-week versus baseline mean difference of 0.59. We will also have 93% power to detect an MYCaW difference as small as 0.5&#x000d7;1.26=0.63, comparable with the difference over time in Jolliffe <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref> For regret, we assume the upper bound risk of the presence of regret is 0.3,<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> yielding SD=0.46; we will have over 90% power to detect a regret risk difference of 0.23.

We have previously shown that surgeons see preoperative conversations as a significant event, a time when a two-way agreement is made whereby the surgeon commits to operating and the patient commits to endure potentially burdensome postoperative care.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> We will use this understanding of surgical buy-in to code and analyse preoperative clinic visits and postoperative interview transcripts with the goal of understanding how the contractual relationship that surgeons perceive is experienced by patients. We will explore how postoperative complications were discussed during the initial patient&#x02013;surgeon interaction with and without the QPL and whether this interaction has impact on subsequent treatment decisions, interpersonal and intrapersonal conflict.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Ethical review</title><p>All participants will provide written informed consent and may withdraw from the study at any time without affecting the medical care they receive from the clinical team. For surgeons, study participation will not affect their professional standing. Institutional review&#x000a0;board approval has been granted at each of the five sites, and a Certificate of Confidentiality has been granted in order to offer enrolled surgeons protection from legal demands, such as subpoenas and court orders for study data. Identifying information on recorded transcripts will be redacted prior to analysis, and all audio&#x000a0;recordings and hard copies of data will be destroyed after analysis is complete and manuscripts are submitted. The aims of the study meet the&#x000a0;criteria for minimal risk. We will follow accepted adverse event monitoring procedures including regular review by the Data Monitoring Committee.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Relevance and dissemination</title><p>The design of the QPL intervention addresses important gaps in preoperative communication between surgeons and older adults facing a decision about high-risk surgery. The results of this study will inform our understanding of how interventions to confront interactional barriers between doctors and patients affect patients&#x02019; capacity to participate and share in decision making. The engagement of a variety of stakeholders and incorporation of deeply held concerns of patients and families into the development of the QPL are strengths that create potential for significant impact. Furthermore, should we find the intervention superior to usual care, it is inexpensive and easily scalable to facilitate widespread dissemination in all outpatient clinics where high-risk surgery is considered. We anticipate these results will be generalisable to other surgical settings as well as encounters for patients who have been referred specifically for discussion of other types of treatment, for example in medical or radiation oncology clinics.</p><p>Efficacy, however, is contingent upon a letter of endorsement from the surgeon that accompanies the QPL brochure. Furthermore, durable changes in surgeon behaviour as a result of questions and attitudes the QPL engenders in their patients may contribute to the effectiveness of the intervention over time. As such, our dissemination strategies will be targeted primarily at surgeons. We have support of leadership at the American College of Surgeons (ACS) and anticipate dissemination through various ACS portals, including the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program and the Coalition for Quality in Geriatric Surgery, as well as distribution of the intervention and description of the implementation processes on the ACS website. In addition, based on feedback from our patient and family advisors who felt dissemination of results to patients and families is critically important, we will provide study updates and distribute study results via a study website. We plan to present study results at the annual ACS Clinical Congress and local chapter meetings. We plan to publish the main trial outcomes in a peer-reviewed journal. We will follow the CONSORT reporting standards for pragmatic<xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref> and cluster-randomised<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref> trials. Study results will be released to participating surgeons, patients, families and the general medical community.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e375" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-014002.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e376" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-014002.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><p>The authors would like to thank Betty Kaiser, PhD, RN, and Gay Thomas, MA, of the Wisconsin Network for Research Support for guidance in creating and planning the Patient and Family Advisory Council.
