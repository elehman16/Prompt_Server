the arthrogenic muscle inhibition after knee joint injury, no viable rehabilitation
protocol has been developed to accommodate this factor. In this study, transcranial
magnetic stimulation was applied as a means of dissipating arthrogenic muscle inhibition
by introducing temporary motor cortex excitation prior to the rehabilitation. [Subjects
and Methods] Twenty-four subjects who have underwent the surgery due to knee injury were
recruited, and randomly assigned to the control or the simulation groups. The levels of
electromyography signals during the maximum voluntary contraction of the quadriceps muscle
before, during, and after training designed for the quadriceps strength rehabilitation
were measured. [Results] When compared to controls, subjects who received the transcranial
magnetic stimulations showed significantly increased levels of voluntary muscle
contraction after the training. Moreover, the beneficial effect of the stimulation
increased as the rehabilitation progressed. [Conclusion] Transcranial magnetic stimulation
itself does not directly improve the symptoms related to knee injuries. However, the use
of this technique can provide a time window for effective intervention by dissipating the
unwanted effect of the arthrogenic muscle inhibition during rehabilitation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Knee joint injury</kwd><kwd>Transcranial magnetic stimulation</kwd><kwd>Rehabilitation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The knee joint is commonly injured during sports<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although injuries such as anterior cruciate ligament tears can be
effectively treated with modern medical intervention techniques, patients are often unable
to regain the level of pre-injury performance. This performance deficit is commonly seen in
patients who are recovering from traumatic knee injuries, but have ongoing deficits even
after the injured knee joint has fully recovered. Researchers often attribute quadriceps
activation failure to arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI)<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. This unconscious neural inhibition mechanism protects an injured
area from being damaged again. However, if it persists, successful rehabilitation can be
hindered, and, further, muscle atrophy and degenerative joint diseases can eventually
develop<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, we investigated
means of circumventing the influence of AMI during an intervention.</p><p>Although the problem of AMI originates in the joint reflexes, the neural consequence of AMI
is the decreased level of motor neuron activation, resulting in limited muscle contraction
ability<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. To overcome the AMI effect,
previous research attempted to modulate the motor neuron activity at the neuromuscular
junction or at a lower level of the central nervous system<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, but no viable intervention
protocol has been suggested. Therefore, researchers now suggest the possibility of
disinhibiting the neural signal at the cortical level<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Based on neuroanatomy of the corticospinal circuit, the primary
motor cortex, as the final output region of the cortical motor areas, is the prime candidate
for disinhibition of the effects of AMI<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a technique that can artificially modulate the
excitability of a given brain area by delivering a brief magnetic pulse over the scalp in a
noninvasive manner<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. When applied onto the
quadriceps area of the primary motor cortex region, the motor neuron becomes activated, and
cause a given muscle to contract. This artificial motor neuron activation has been reported
to persist following application<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Pietrosimone et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> showed a decrease
in AMI for 60 minutes following a single pulse of TMS, when applied to the primary motor
cortex.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of using TMS as a therapeutic tool
to disinhibit the AMI effect during the rehabilitation process. Thus, it is important to
acknowledge that TMS itself is not a technique that can directly influence the
rehabilitation. Rather, patients who experience knee injury could expect to experience the
maximal benefit from rehabilitation because of the AMI-free (rehabilitation) time window
introduced by the TMS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Twenty-four young males with a history of knee injury and surgery (more than 12 months
prior) were recruited as subjects (19&#x02013;30&#x02005;years old, 17 male, 7 female, mean age 28). All
subjects underwent either partial/whole meniscectomy for meniscus tear or restoration of
anterior/posterior cruciate ligament tear. Participation was restricted if there was pain in
any other body parts or any other pathological symptoms. All 24 subjects were confirmed to
display the AMI characteristic. The maximum knee extension force generated by an injured leg
should be no more than 85% of the force generated by the non-injured leg (tested prior to
the participation). All participants were informed of possible risks (acoustic artifacts,
seizure, local pain, headache, discomfort, acute psychiatric changes) from the experimental
procedures. The experience of TMS was thoroughly explained, and the participants were aware
that they could withdraw from the experiment at any point. Subjects were confirmed to be
appropriate for the experiments using the TMS technique<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>After completing the consent form, the subjects were randomly assigned to either a sham
(control) or TMS (experimental) group (12 subjects each). Electromyography (EMG) sensors
(MyoSystem 1400A, Noraxon Inc., Scottsdale, AZ, USA) were attached to the belly of the
vastus lateralis while subjects were sitting on a chair with 70&#x000b0; hip flexion and 60&#x000b0; knee
flexion. Then, voluntary maximum quadriceps contraction (MVC) was measured 3 times
(pre-test). Immediately after the pre-test, each subject&#x02019;s quadriceps muscle representation
on the motor cortex was identified by the Rapid 2 TMS system (Magstim, UK). The magnitude of
the EMG signal elicited by the TMS was monitored, and the stimulation site with the greatest
EMG signal was chosen as described by Huh et al<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Once the stimulation location was confirmed, a single pulse of TMS at maximal output (about
2 T) was delivered 3 times to the TMS group. Fake (sham) stimulation was delivered to the
control group by tilting the stimulation coil 90&#x000b0; so the effect of the stimulation pulse
would not reach the scalp; subjects were unaware of this difference.</p><p>After the TMS treatment, all subjects participated in an identical rehabilitation program;
there was no need for an individualized program as all the surgeries were performed more
than a year prior to the study. The rehabilitation protocol<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> consisted of quadriceps (knee) extension, mini-squatting using a
physioball, and four directional straight knee raises (10 minutes each). After the 10
minutes of each rehabilitation training session, the MVC measurement and TMS application
were repeated. Once this training protocol ended, a 30 minute break followed, to allow
recovery from fatigue. A licensed physical therapist (Korean Physical Therapy Association)
and a certified athletic trainer (National Athletic Trainers&#x02019; Association) were present and
gave instructions/advices throughout the training protocol. Both individuals have years of
experience working with the sport related knee injury patients, and they physically assisted
and gave verbal instruction/feedback for every participants throughout the training.</p><p>Immediately after the break, another MVC measurement (without TMS) was performed as a
retention test. The 3 EMG measurements of MVC (peak iEMG amplitude) during each data
collection were averaged as a dependent variable (micro-volt). Raw EMG signals were sampled
at 1,000&#x02005;Hz displayed by MyoResearch XP program (gain=2,000, bandwidth 10&#x02013;500&#x02005;Hz, CMRR
&#x0003e;100 db, input impedance &#x0003e;100&#x02005;M ohm) accompanying the EMG system.</p><p>With 2 groups (TMS and sham) and 5 different data collections (pre-test, after training&#x02212;1,
&#x02212;2, and &#x02212;3, and a post-test), repeated two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed.
If there was a significant effect, post-hoc comparisons were performed (corrected for
multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni adjustment). The statistical significance level
was set to 0.05. The subjects&#x02019; recruitment process and the experimental protocols followed
the Declaration of Helsinki, and were approved by the local Internal Review Board (IRB SKKU
2014-05-004-002).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table

the means and standard deviations of EMG data collected from each group throughout the
experiment. In the pre-test conditions, the EMG values measured during the MVC were similar
between the groups. However, as TMS was applied prior to training, the EMG values tended to
increase, while those of the sham group remained at the pre-test level.</p><p>The results from the statistical analyses confirmed this observation. There was no
significant test main effect (F(4, 88)=1.53, p=0.20), but the group main effect showed
significance (F(1, 22)=8.146, p=0.01). This group main effect reflected the strong influence
of TMS, as this significance was achieved in spite of the almost identical between-group
pre-test results. Importantly, there was a significant interaction between test and group
(F(4, 88)=2.648, p=0.04).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Patients recovering from knee injuries often experience frustration during rehabilitation
because of unintended obstacles such as the AMI<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although there have been numerous attempts to solve this problem
by administering interventions at peripheral nervous system or at musculoskeletal
levels<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, few studies reported success.
The purpose of this study was not to evaluate TMS as a rehabilitation technique. Rather, we
used TMS to enhance access to the planned benefit of rehabilitation training. It was
hypothesized that during a limited time period, the application of TMS may temporarily
dis-inhibit the negative effect of AMI. Thus, subjects were expected to benefit from the
previously proven effects of rehabilitation training.</p><p>The results of this study provided strong evidences for our hypothesis. Only the actual TMS
group showed the effect of rehabilitation, while the sham group had no benefit from the
training. The peak EMG amplitude of the sham group while performing the MVC was relatively
unchanged throughout the training. In fact, there was a tendency of decrease from 175.37 to
170.50 (although not significantly different). This tendency may reflect the muscular
fatigue induced by the training. In spite of this possible effect of fatigue, the amplitudes
of peak EMG signals showed increasing patterns. This was the main finding of the study
strongly supporting our hypothesis. Also, this TMS plus rehabilitation procedure seemed to
have prolonged effect. The peak EMG amplitude during the post-test showed noticeable
improvement over the training 3 test result. It is possible that the fatigue inducing
training might have diluted the training effect, but, after 30 minute break, patients in the
TMS group could show the real effects of rehabilitation without the AMI effect. The
neurological interpretation of this result would be that TMS of the primary motor cortex at
high intensity might have temporarily excited the motor neuron pool to a maximal level.
Therefore, the effect of AMI might have been dissipated while training was administered.
Although this interpretation is still speculative, the increased muscle strength was
substantial, and provides a significant reason for applying the results in practice.</p><p>While the results of this study indicate a promising role of TMS in a clinical setting,
further investigation is needed. In this study, 3 pulses of strong TMS were sufficient to
introduce the changes in training effects for 10 minutes, while previous studies showed the
sustained TMS effects for more than 30 minutes after the stimulation<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, optimal TMS parameters for the ideal
rehabilitation such as stimulation intensity and frequency should be defined. The use of EMG
signal as a dependent variable might not been the best experimental option. The EMG MVC data
are known to have session-to-session and subject-to-subject variability. Although previous
studies have similarly used MVC to investigate AMI changes<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> and we&#x02019;ve tried our best to obtain reliable EMG data, however, the
changes in AMI can be more precisely evaluated with peak-to-peak or the burst
superimposition techniques by using joint torque measurement. The availability of the
experimental techniques in our lab limited the use of any joint torque measurement
technique. On the other hand, because this study was intended to provide information
applicable to the practitioners, this limited use of data collection technique can be,
conversely, beneficial for real world application. In summary, while the neural nature of
our results indicates the need for future studies, the beneficial and promising role of TMS
for knee joint rehabilitation protocols is evident in this study.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Arnold</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Coker</surname><given-names>TP</given-names></name><name><surname>Heaton</surname><given-names>LM</given-names></name><etal>et
