Research-supported interventions include the provision of the branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), creatine monohydrate, and several other amino acids and their byproducts
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Additionally, it has been postulated that a critical period for supplementation is prior (e.g., 30&#x02013;60&#x000a0;minutes before) to the workout
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, little research have been done on the effects of multi-ingredient pre-workout supplementation on long-term changes in skeletal muscle hypertrophy, lean body mass, and performance.</p><p>Multi-ingredient performance supplements (MIPS) may be comprised of ingredients such as BCAAs, creatine, beta-alanine, agmatine sulfate, taurine, creatinol-o-phosphate, and a combination of nitrate-containing compounds purported to enhance both acute performance and long-term neuromuscular adaptations
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Each of these ingredients has been studied individually for their positive effects on human performance adaptations. For example, pure creatine monohydrate, beta-alanine, and creatinol-o-phosphate have each been shown to enhance muscle adaptations
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Lastly, the MIPS contains agmatine sulfate, pomegranate and beet root extracts, which has been shown to enhance skeletal muscle blood flow
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, information is lacking as to how resistance-training individuals will respond to the combination of these ingredients.</p><p>Therefore, the primary purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of 8&#x000a0;weeks of a MIPS in resistance-trained individuals during a periodized resistance training program on skeletal muscle hypertrophy, lean body mass, and strength relative to a placebo matched control.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Overview</title><p>Our study consisted of a randomized, double-blind, diet-controlled design, wherein a pre-workout supplemented and a placebo supplemented group were assigned to an 8-week periodized resistance training protocol.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These researchers found that a non-linear resistance-training program yielded greater results than a traditional or non-periodized program in athletes. The program was designed to train all major muscle groups using mostly compound movements for the upper and lower body (Table&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The programmed, non-linear training split was divided into hypertrophy days consisting of 8&#x02013;12 repetition maximum (RM) loads for 3 sets, with 60&#x02013;120&#x000a0;seconds rest and strength days consisting of 2 to 5 RM loads for 3 sets for all exercises except the leg press and bench press which received 5 total sets. Subjects resistance-trained on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of each week. Monday and Wednesday consisted of hypertrophy style training while Friday was dedicated to strength. Weights were progressively increased by 2&#x02013;5% when the prescribed repetitions could be completed. All training sessions were closely monitored to ensure effort and intensity were maximal each training session. A research assistant worked individually with each subject to make sure full range of motion as well as rest intervals and repetition schemes were followed.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Resistance training protocol</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left"><bold>Monday</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Wednesday</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Friday</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>hyper - leg&#x00026;chest</italic><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>hyper - back&#x00026;delts</italic><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>strength</italic><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Leg Press<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Pullups<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Leg Press<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Leg Curl<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">90&#x000b0; Bent Rows<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bench Press<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Leg Extension<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Shrugs<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Leg Extension<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Hyperextension<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Shoulder Press<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Close Grip Bench Press<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bench Press<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Lateral Raise<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dumbbell incline Bench Press<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Reverse Laterals<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Close Grip Bench Press<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bicep curls<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tricep cable extension<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Rep Scheme: 6 - 15</td><td align="left">Rep Scheme: 6 - 15</td><td align="left">Rep Scheme: 1 - 5</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Strength, lean body mass, and muscle mass testing</title><p>Strength was assessed via 1-RM testing of the leg press and bench press.

The primary findings of this research were in congruence with our hypotheses that Xpand&#x000ae; 2X supplementation can improve adaptations in skeletal muscle hypertrophy, LBM, and strength.</p><sec><title>Skeletal muscle hypertrophy and lean body mass</title><p>This MIPS contains a proprietary blend of ingredients reported previously to augment the accretion of skeletal muscle. For example, creatine monohydrate has been reported as the most effective ergogenic aid currently available regarding LBM and high-intensity exercise capacity, particularly in untrained individuals
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Creatine and its various forms have been thoroughly researched, yet to date no study has shown any form of creatine to be superior to creatine monohydrate, which was used in this study (23, 33). Supplementation with creatine can increase total resistance training volume via ATP re-synthesis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and total training volume has been closely linked with skeletal muscle accretion. Additionally, creatine supplementation has been demonstrated to increase the activation of satellite cells and myonuclei in muscle following chronic resistance training
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Moreover it is conceivable that the osmotic pressure created by creatine that increases the hydration status of cells, resulting in potentially hypertrophic effects
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This mechanism of action is what causes creatine to increase strength, but can benefit almost every body system, including the brain, bones, muscles, and liver
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Lastly, long term studies have observed that those supplementing with creatine experience 200% increases in LBM compared to placebo
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Branched chain amino acids have previously been shown as efficacious in the accretion of skeletal muscle mass
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. One BCAA of particular interest is leucine, which has been shown to increase muscle protein synthesis (MPS) without the presence of the other essential amino acids
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] Additionally, Karlsson et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] found that supplementation with BCAAs during resistance exercise results in greater phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 kinase, a rate limiting enzyme in the signaling network responsible for regulation of protein synthesis in skeletal muscles. Moreover, BCAAs seem to decrease soreness after eccentric exercise
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and, they prevent declines in both testosterone and power following an overreaching cycle
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Beta-Alanine supplementation has consistently been demonstrated to augment muscle carnosine concentrations in humans
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Harris et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] concluded that carnosine plays an essential role as an intracellular buffer within the skeletal muscle of humans. More importantly, beta-alanine supplementation has been shown to enhance physical performance during high intensity exercise bouts while also delaying the onset of neuromuscular fatigue
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>Agmatine is a derivative of the amino acid arginine. Agmatine has been studied for its impact on nitric oxide, wellbeing, and hormone status
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Agmatine has been noted to support nitric oxide (NO) production via stimulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS).
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. This process is essential for the proper functioning of the polyamine biosynthetic pathways to occur
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The body&#x02019;s organs require polyamines for their growth, renewal, and metabolism. Polyamines also have a profound stabilizing effect on a cell DNA and are essential to the healthy function of the nervous system
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Therefore, these pathways, although not fully elucidated, play an important role in normal cell homeostasis.</p><p>Lastly, Creatinol-O-Phosphate (COP) is known primarily for its abilities as an intracellular buffer. Creatinol-O-Phosphate has been shown to assist in stabilizing intracellular and extracellular pH levels, ultimately prolonging anaerobic glycolysis in the presence of lactic acid
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Creatinol-O-Phosphate has also been shown to activate satellite cells in skeletal muscle, theoretically increasing their capacity for muscle growth
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. To date this is the first study that we are aware of to analyze this specific combination of ingredients.</p></sec><sec><title>Strength</title><p>Strength is one of the most critical attributes underlying success in sport
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The collective results of the present study suggest that bench press strength following Xpand&#x000ae; 2X supplementation are optimized within the context of a periodized training split. Most of the individual ingredients found within the pre-workout matrix have been demonstrated to individually enhance a variety of strength measures. For example, creatine monohydrate has repeatedly been shown to augment strength
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In addition to creatine, this MIPS contains a number of nootropics including glucuronolactone, caffeine, and taurine, which can possibly decrease perceived exertion and augment intra-workout performance. For example, caffeine has been demonstrated to enhance strength acutely through an adenosine receptor antagonist mediated mechanism and subsequent central nervous system stimulation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>Research suggests that taurine might increase the mechanical threshold for skeletal muscle contraction, promote intracellular membrane stabilization, and increase membrane polarization
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Taurine has also been noted for its performance enhancing, antioxidant, and nerve conduction effects
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Moreover the combination of caffeine and taurine has previously been shown to augment performance to a greater degree than caffeine alone
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The collective results of our research indicate that Xpand&#x000ae; 2X (MIPS) supplementation results in significant increases in bench press strength, hypertrophy, and lean body mass in resistance-trained men. Therefore, coaches, trainers, and athletes may increase the benefits of their workouts by supplementing with MIPS prior to exercise. Future research should investigate if supplementation with MIPS would result in better adaptations than supplementation with each of the ingredients alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>RPL, JMJ, JED, EOS, SAM, and JMW declare that they have no competing interests.
