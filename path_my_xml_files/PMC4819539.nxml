Initial treatment with dual antihypertensive therapy is recommended for some patients, such as those with a markedly elevated BP or high/very high cardiovascular risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In addition, almost half of patients prescribed an antihypertensive medication discontinued the treatment by the end of 1&#x000a0;year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A single-pill combination therapy could simplify the antihypertensive regimen, particularly in patients with various comorbidities, which may improve compliance, persistence, and BP control compared with its corresponding free-drug combinations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Guidelines for the management of hypertension from the American Society of Hypertension, the International Society of Hypertension, the Korean Society of Hypertension, the Japanese Society of Hypertension, and other meta-analysis data favor the use of combinations of two antihypertensive drugs at fixed doses in a single tablet [fixed-dose combination (FDC)] because reducing the number of pills improves adherence and increases the rate of BP control, minimizing adverse effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Different FDCs of the same two or three drugs are increasingly becoming available.</p><p>Antihypertensive agents with a combination of the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) olmesartan medoxomil (OM), the calcium antagonist amlodipine (AML), and the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) are now available as an FDC tablet (OM/AML/HCTZ). The triple combination regimen with OM/AML/HCTZ, including high-dose OM 40&#x000a0;mg, was associated with significant BP reductions compared with any of the dual combination regimens at week 12 in the phase III TRINITY (triple therapy with olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine besylate, and hydrochlorothiazide in adult patients with hypertension) study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. According to the subgroup analyses of the TRINITY trial, OM/AML/HCTZ was more effective for BP reductions than each of the dual regimens, irrespective of hypertension severity, age, or sex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Other clinical studies reported that a triple combination of OM/AML/HCTZ provides effective BP reduction in patients whose BP is not controlled with a dual combination of OM/AML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, data are limited regarding the efficacy and safety of dual FDC therapy in comparison with triple FDC therapy for reducing BP in their standard or low doses, rather than the higher or maximum doses used in the clinical trials, as a first-line therapy in actual clinical practice. The issue that triple FDC therapy can be a safe alternative for patients with hypertension not controlled with a dual FDC, including thiazide, is still unresolved.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-dose triple FDC therapy with OM 20 mg, AML 5&#x000a0;mg, and HCTZ 12.5&#x000a0;mg (OM/AML/HCTZ 20/5/12.5) in Korean patients with moderate hypertension not controlled with low-dose dual FDC therapy with OM 20 mg and HCTZ 12.5 mg (OM/HCTZ 20/12.5) (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01838850).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Population</title><p>Korean men and women aged 20&#x02013;75 years who had hypertension were screened for eligibility between April 2013 and January 2014.

Seated BP and heart rate were measured, and physical examinations were performed at all study visits. Twelve-lead electrocardiographs were obtained at the screening visit and at weeks 8 and 16. Patient adherence was monitored by assessing the tablet count from drug packages returned at each visit.

For tolerability, only 8 of 340 patients (2.35&#x000a0;%) discontinued their medications.</p><p>Initiating antihypertensive therapy with a combination of two drugs is associated with a reduced risk of medication discontinuation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The other advantages of this approach are the maximized BP reduction in the patients with markedly elevated BP, rapid BP control (especially in patients at high cardiovascular risk), and minimized adverse effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Most guidelines favor the combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or ARB, and thiazide diuretic or calcium antagonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. They also recommend the use of FDCs because reducing the pill burden improves adherence and increases the BP control rate. In addition, to overcome the inconvenience and difficulty in increasing the dose of one drug in FDC therapy, different FDCs with different doses of each component are available.</p><p>When initiating a combination of two drugs, doses can be increased to achieve the BP target, or adding a third drug from different classes can be considered. A meta-analysis showed that combining two agents from any classes of antihypertensive drugs increases the BP reduction much more than increasing the dose of one drug, and the reduction in BP may be approximately fivefold greater with two agents than with doubling the dose of one agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In this study, we tried to test the efficacy and safety of &#x02018;standard or low-dose&#x02019; triple FDC (OM/AML/HCTZ 20/5/12.5) in patients with moderate hypertension not controlled with &#x02018;initial low-dose&#x02019; dual FDC therapy (OM/HCTZ 20/12.5), not with &#x02018;maximum or high doses&#x02019; as done in the TRINITY trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition, the entire TRINITY trial population only included about 2&#x000a0;% Asians, and their mean body mass index was 33 kg/m<sup>2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In contrast, our study enrolled only Koreans (all Asians) who were much smaller (mean body mass index, 26.7&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) than the westerners, which means that in real practice Asians may need lower doses of anti-hypertensive drugs than larger-sized westerners. Because FDC therapy is less expensive than the total price of each single drug and because FDC therapy as a first-line therapy is covered by health insurance, FDC therapy has a combined medical and economic advantage for patients with hypertension in South Korea.</p><p>We chose OM with HCTZ as first-line FDC therapy because FDC therapy including an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor is not available in South Korea. Second, an ARB combined with a diuretic rather than a calcium antagonist showed more clinical benefits than combined placebo or beta-blocker and diuretic in randomized controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In addition, the combination of an ARB with a diuretic has advantages because of the synergistic BP-lowering effects and because an ARB offsets the adverse effects of a diuretic on electrolyte and glucose metabolism. In this study, among 623 patients who underwent the 4-week run-in treatment with dual FDC therapy (OM/HCTZ 20/12.5), 209 achieved their BP goals (209/623, 33.6&#x000a0;%). Compared with dual FDC therapy, triple FDC therapy was associated with a significantly higher percentage of patients who achieved their BP goal when the BP was not controlled with dual FDC therapy as first-line therapy. Interestingly, among the non-responders after the 8-week double-blind treatment who were allocated to triple FDC therapy (OM/AML/HCTZ) with a double dose of ARB OM, the response rate was less than one-fifth (18.75&#x000a0;%). In contrast, among the patients who received triple FDC therapy, including the calcium antagonist (AML) switched from double FDC therapy (OM/HCTZ), about one-half (46.48&#x000a0;%) achieved their target BP. This may suggest that patients who are not responsive to dual FDC therapy, including an ARB and a thiazide, could be switched to triple FDC therapy by adding a different class of drug (a calcium antagonist) for a safe and more effective BP reduction than doubling the dose of an agent.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Study Limitations</title><p>Our study was limited by its short treatment period and relatively small cohort size. Therefore, the safety results should be interpreted with caution, and a large-scale study may be needed to determine the long-term safety and clinical outcomes of triple FDC therapy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In Korean patients with moderate hypertension not controlled with dual FDC therapy with OM/HCTZ 20/12.5 as a first-line therapy, switching to triple FDC therapy with OM/AML/HCTZ 20/5/12.5 was associated with significant BP reductions and greater achievement of BP goals, and was well tolerated. These findings may provide useful information to clinicians in choosing triple FDC therapy in Asian patients with moderate hypertension not controlled with dual FDC therapy for safe and effective BP reduction in actual clinical practice.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>The members of the Investigators are listed in Acknowledgments.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>All authors were responsible for the study design, data collection, and data interpretation.
