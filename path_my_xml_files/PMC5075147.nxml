Its clinical manifestations focus on pain and numbness of the neck and arm as well as restricted movement of the neck, which greatly affect the patient&#x02019;s life and work. The orthopedic of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory holds that the basic pathologic change in spinal degenerative diseases is the imbalance between the dynamic system and the static system of the cervical spine. Based on this theory, some Chinese physicians have developed a balance chiropractic therapy (BCT) to treat CSR, which has been clinically examined for more than 50&#x000a0;years to effectively cure CSR.

The incidence of CSR tends to increase year by year due to population aging, lifestyle changes and work or life stress. Its clinical manifestations focus on pain and numbness of the neck and arm as well as restricted movement of the neck, which greatly affect people&#x02019;s lives and work. The agents currently approved for treatment and/or prevention of CSR include operative treatment and nonoperative treatment categories (including drugs, traction, manipulation, physical therapy, functional exercise, etc.), but many studies have confirmed that nonoperative therapy has more evident effects on the optimized scheme of CSR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Among them, manipulation is the most common therapy for CSR due to its low risk, good therapeutic effect, ease of operation and its economics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, as there are many kinds of manipulations with different efficacy standards, treatment and operation standardization and evaluation mechanisms, it is not conducive to the long-term development of massage, which could result in the problem of choice and multiple choices easy to cause medical information source waste. Moreover, there are currently few randomized, parallel-controlled trials to verify its efficacy in treating CSR.</p><p>From this we have developed a balance chiropractic therapy (BCT) to treat CSR, which has been clinically examined as effective at curing CSR for more than 50&#x000a0;years, and we examine the therapeutic effect and safety of BCT to improve the syndrome experienced by CSR patients in a multicenter, randomized, parallel-controlled trial. The results of this study will provide evidence regarding the value and safety of BCT as an intervention to improve the syndrome in CSR-affected individuals. Furthermore, we speculate the mechanisms of action can be partially identified by this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This clinical trial is a multicenter, parallel-group, randomized controlled design.

Then manipulations of plucking and relaxing the tendons are applied five to seven times over the same area with a force that the patients can tolerate. Finally, rolling the region along the upper back of bladder meidian for five to seven times, (2) balancing osteopathy: firstly, with the patient adopting an upright sitting position, the practitioner holds the patient&#x02019;s occiput and jaw between his hands and pulls upward forcefully for 9&#x000a0;s and then relaxes for 3&#x000a0;s. While stretching the neck, the physician turns the patient&#x02019;s head to the front, back, left and right at an angle of roughly 45&#x000b0; three times and then obliquely wrenches the neck at the position that corresponds with the pathological features of the clinical examination and X-rays; if the lesion sites are at C1 to C3, or C4 to C6, or C7 to T1 within the cervical spine unit, the neck will be flexed at 15&#x000b0;, 0&#x000b0;, or 30 to 45&#x000b0;, respectively. The patient then repeatedly rotates their neck to left or right side to roughly 40&#x000b0; degrees on its own at the stretching state of cervical vertebra, and then rotates toward the affected side to the limit of the angle as well as bending the neck forward while the physician gives a vertical pulling and extending force to the patient&#x02019;s neck. One or more snapping sounds will be heard if the procedure has been successful, (3) balance collaterals-dredging: first, holding the participant&#x02019;s upper limb and then quickly shaking that upper limb up and down forcefully with a low-amplitude jittery motion, repeated three times. Next, for the ear-lifting method, kneading-pressing and pulling with the thumb and forefinger are then applied to the region of the upper, middle and lower three parts of the helix, respectively, for 30&#x000a0;s with a force that the patient can tolerate.

The orthopedic of TCM theory holds that both the static system (ligaments, joint capsules, etc.) and the dynamic system (muscles, intervertebral discs, small joints, etc.) are critical in maintaining normal position and function of the cervical spine. The imbalance of both static and dynamic forces can result in a loss of posterior column stability, ultimately leading to rapid degeneration of the cervical intervertebral discs and causing a series of syndromes distributing along the spinal nerve roots (such as pain, numbness of the neck, shoulder and arm, etc.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Therefore, intervention measurements are aimed at correcting the imbalance between these two systems of the cervical vertebrae and relieving the pain which greatly affects people&#x02019;s lives and work.

It is well-known that stimulating the aural helix can stimulate the corresponding meridians, so that regulating meridian <italic>qi</italic> and blood circulation, thus restoring <italic>yin-yang</italic> balance, will alleviate neck syndromes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In addition, modern medicine shows that stimulating the auricular points can offset or weaken pain through a series of reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In this study, BCT incorporates both tuina manipulation and stimulation of the auricular points.</p><p>If this study demonstrates the effectiveness and safety of BCT, significant strides would be made towards a clinically useful therapy for alleviating CSR syndrome.</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial is still recruiting at the time of submission.
