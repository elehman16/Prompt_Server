Importantly, our base-case analysis was built on the clinical assumption that patients who do not respond to ranolazine treatment (ie, continue to suffer the same degree of anginal symptoms) are taken off therapy and behave similarly to placebo patients. This responder-type analysis methodology has been utilised in other UK National Health Service/NICE cost-effectiveness models.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Of note, our analysis indicates that from a UK perspective, discontinuing therapy in patients not adequately responding to therapy is not necessary to achieve cost-effectiveness.</p><p>Importantly, the definition of response used in our analysis (requiring a decrease in symptoms as measured by improving an entire angina frequency classification) is one that is easily translatable to clinical practice by simply questioning patients if their angina frequency is daily, weekly, monthly or absent. Nonetheless, alterative responder definitions merit consideration. One of the scenario analysis we performed utilised an alternative responder definition requiring a 20-point improvement in SAQAF score.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Even with this more stringent definition of responder requiring a more robust benefit, the addition of ranolazine was still shown to be cost-effective with an ICER of &#x000a3;1692/QALY gained.</p><p>A small number of prior European economic analyses performed from the Spanish,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Italian<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and Russian perspectives<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> have also demonstrated the addition of ranolazine to SoC for the treatment of patients with chronic angina can be economically substantiated. Two of these analyses<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> reported ICERs for ranolazine of &#x0223c;&#x020ac;8500/QALY gained; well below the &#x020ac;30&#x02005;000/QALY gained willingness-to-pay threshold commonly referenced. The third, a Russian model,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> did not calculated cost/QALY gained but rather used change in angina frequency as its principal measure of effectiveness. This economic model estimated increased expenditures for medication in the ranolazine group, but reduced costs of emergency care and hospitalisations; resulting in a 20% decrease in the cost-effectives ratio for ranolazine added to SoC versus SoC alone (1641 RUB vs 1965 RUB, respectively). Our model described in this paper is novel and adds important information to the current body of literature. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the cost-effectiveness of ranolazine from the UK health system perspective, and our findings are supportive of NICE's current recommendation for ranolazine use in stable angina.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Additionally, the aforementioned models<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;22</xref> used only direct medical costs, while our model (as a sensitivity analysis) included both direct and indirect costs. The addition of indirect costs to our model yielded an even larger gap (decrease) in treatment costs with the use of ranolazine compared with SOC alone (&#x003b4;: &#x000a3;488 vs &#x000a3;110), substantiating the benefit of ranolazine from a societal perspective. Perhaps most importantly, our analysis is the only one to estimate transition probabilities and health utility scores using individual patient-level data from the randomised controlled ERICA trial.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Access to this level of data likely increases the internal validity of our model by providing more accurate estimates of transition probabilities across SAQAF health states; as well as, allowing us to map UK EQ-5D equivalent health utility values (the EQ-5D being NICE's preferred health utility measure) needed for calculating QALYs.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>There are also limitations to consider when putting the results of our model into context. First, we needed to extrapolate the results of the 7-week double-blind treatment duration of the ERICA trial<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> to a 1-year time horizon. Because the duration to which ranolazine will remain efficacious is unclear, we did not attempt to extend the model's time horizon out to longer than 1&#x02005;year, and thus this model should be considered hypothesis generating. The fact that &#x0223c;85% of patients in the Ranolazine Open Label Experience (ROLE)<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> remained on therapy and only 4.2% of 746 ranolazine-treated patients electively discontinued therapy at 1&#x02005;year suggests our 1-year time horizon may be justifiable, as does longer term follow-up data from the MERLIN trial which shows stability in SAQAF, physical limitation and quality-of-life domain scores in patients with stable coronary disease over 12&#x02005;months.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Second, our analysis evaluated the cost-effectiveness of ranolazine in those suffering weekly or daily angina. Therefore, it is unclear whether our findings would be generalisable to patients with less frequent angina symptoms (eg, monthly). This being said, the TERISA trial<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> did support ranolazine's efficacy in a population with a wider range of angina frequencies (an average weekly angina frequency between 1 and 28, and at least 1 angina episode/week). It is also important to note that we assumed UK patients as a group would have similar response to ranolazine as patients enrolled in the multinational ERICA trial. Unfortunately, data to test this assumption were not available in ERICA. Third, the dosage of ranolazine utilised in ERICA<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> (500&#x02005;mg twice daily for the first week followed by 1000&#x02005;mg twice daily thereafter) differs from the approved dose in Europe (initial dose of 375&#x02005;mg twice daily, titrated to 500&#x02005;mg twice daily after 2&#x02013;4&#x02005;weeks, and based on patient response, further titrated to a maximum dose 750&#x02005;mg twice daily).<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Importantly, data from the CARISA trial<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> demonstrated greater improvements in exercise duration and reductions in angina attacks and nitroglycerin use compared with placebo with both the 750&#x02005;mg (p&#x02264;0.03 for all end points) and 1000&#x02005;mg (p&#x02264;0.03 for all end points) twice daily doses of ranolazine at 12&#x02005;weeks; with no clinically relevant difference in efficacy between the 750 and 1000&#x02005;mg doses. For this reason, using data from the 1000&#x02005;mg twice daily arm of pivotal ERICA trial in this European model seems acceptable. Fourth, in the ERICA trial, &#x003b2;-blockers were not used to treat angina, and therefore we could not assess the cost-effectiveness of adding ranolazine to &#x003b2;-blocker therapy (which is often effective and inexpensive). Importantly, the TERISA trial provides data suggesting ranolazine remained efficacious when added to &#x0223c;90% &#x003b2;-blocker background therapy.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Despite this, additional cost-effectiveness analyses based on TERISA data would be helpful in demonstrating ranolazine's cost-effectiveness in heavily &#x003b2;-blocker-treated population (as well as in a wider range of angina symptom frequencies and patients with diabetes). Finally, our model did not directly incorporate the impact of adverse drug reactions to ranolazine. These adverse events, however, are typically not serious (eg, usually limited to dizziness, nausea and constipation), and consequently are not likely to have any significant impact on costs or QALYs.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
