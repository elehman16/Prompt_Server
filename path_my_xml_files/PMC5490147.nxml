Shivering not only causes psychological stress to the patient but also physiologically leads to an increase in oxygen consumption by 200%&#x02013;600% and increased carbon dioxide production, increased chances of myocardial ischemia, infection, bleeding, and increase in minute ventilation. It also produces hypoxemia, lactic acidosis, increased intraocular pressure, intracranial pressure and interferes with patient monitoring such as electrocardiogram (ECG), noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>).</p><p>The etiology of shivering is not clearly understood. The mechanisms chiefly responsible for shivering in patients undergoing surgery are intraoperative temperature loss, increased sympathetic tone, pain, and systemic release of pyrogens.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The best way to avoid the intraoperative and postoperative shivering induced complications is to prevent shivering. Perioperative hypothermia and shivering are usually prevented by physical methods such as surface warming and pharmacologically by drugs such as pethidine, tramadol, clonidine, and ketamine.</p><p>The neurotransmitter pathways involved in the mechanism of shivering are complex and still poorly understood. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT3]), a biologic amine found in the brain and spinal cord, plays a part in neurotransmission of shivering. Many studies explained that the serotonergic system plays an important role in the pathogenesis of perioperative shivering.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Serotonin antagonism seems to lower the human thermal set range thereby reducing metabolic cold defenses and discomfort associated with postoperative hypothermia.</p><p>Ondansetron, 5-HT3 antagonist, is a widely used antiemetic drug. It can be used safely during pregnancy and surgery. Some studies showed its anti-shivering effect following both general and regional anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] It has a potential advantage in obstetric anesthesia because of its very low incidence of sedation, hypotension, bradycardia, or risk to the neonate. The mechanism of action of ondansetron as anti-shivering is not clear, and it is proposed to act centrally at the level of the preoptic anterior hypothalamic region by inhibition of serotonin reuptake.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>On the other hand, nausea and vomiting during spinal anesthesia for cesarean section are very common and unpleasant complications. During spinal anesthesia, ondansetron has been shown to be effective in the prevention of nausea and vomiting.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Based on a previous study, we hypothesized that ondansetron can reduce postspinal shivering in pregnant women undergoing lower segment cesarean section under spinal anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The primary aim of our study is to evaluate the efficacy of ondansetron in reducing the postspinal shivering in pregnant patients undergoing elective lower segment cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. The secondary aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of ondansetron in reducing intraoperative nausea and vomiting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>After approval of our Institutional Ethical Committee and obtaining written informed consents, eighty American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical Status I and II full-term parturients, 22&#x02013;32 years old, scheduled for elective lower segment cesarean section surgery under spinal anesthesia were enrolled in this prospective, randomized study. The study was carried out in RIMS, Kadapa general hospital from March to November 2016. Patients with contraindications to spinal anesthesia, cardiopulmonary disease, psychological disorder, and thyroid disorders, patients who are likely to receive blood transfusion intraoperatively and with body temperature more than 38&#x000b0;C or &#x0003c;36.5&#x000b0;C were excluded from the study.</p><p>Eighty full-term parturients were randomized using a computer-generated randomization list [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. The randomization scheme was generated using the website randomization.com (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomization.com">http://www.randomization.com</ext-link>). Random group assigned was enclosed in a sealed envelope to ensure concealment of allocation sequence. Sealed envelope was opened by an anesthesiologist not involved in the study to prepare the drug solution in a masked 5 ml syringe according to randomization. The anesthesiologist performing the block and observing the patient were blinded to the treatment group. Data collection was done by the same anesthesiologist who was unaware of the group allocation. Patients were randomly assigned to one of the two equal groups. All patients received an intravenous bolus of the tested drug in 4 ml volume, immediately before induction of spinal anesthesia. Group O (forty patients) received 4 ml (8 mg) ondansetron while Group S (forty patients) received 4 ml of normal saline 0.9%.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT diagram showing the number of patients included and analyzed</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-11-508-g001"/></fig><p>Patients were routinely fasted and premedicated with ranitidine 150 mg orally night before surgery. On arrival to the operating room, standardized monitoring was done throughout the perioperative period. Heart rate (HR), ECG, NIBP, respiratory rate, and SpO<sub>2</sub> were recorded. Core body temperature was measured by tympanic thermometer (Thermoscan IRT 3020; Braun, Kronberg, Germany), and skin temperature was measured using skin probe. Operation theatre temperature was maintained at 24&#x000b0;C by air-conditioning.</p><p>Peripheral intravenous access was secured using an 18-gauge cannula on the dorsum of the nondominant arm. All patients were preloaded with warm Ringer's lactate solution of 10 ml/kg before spinal anesthesia. Patients received respective drugs intravenously just before initiation of spinal anesthesia. All patients were blocked in the sitting position, in which a 25-gauge Quincke needle was inserted by midline approach into the L3&#x02013;L4 or L4&#x02013;L5 interspaces and after ensuring the correct position of the needle, 12.5 mg of hyperbaric 0.5% bupivacaine was injected. Patients were immediately placed in the supine position after the block. The administration of pre- or intra-operative opioids was not permitted except injection tramadol as rescue anti-shivering drug. Supplemental oxygen (3 L/min) was applied through a nasal cannula till the end of the surgery. All patients were covered with one layer of paper surgical drapes and one layer of a cotton blanket positioned over the thighs and calves. In addition, one layer of a cotton blanket was placed over the chest and arms. No other warming devices were used.</p><p>The level of sensory block, core body temperature, shivering score, and presence or absence of nausea and vomiting during perioperative period, 1<sup>st</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> min Apgar scores were recorded. Body temperatures were monitored just before intrathecal injection and then with every 15 min intervals up to 6 h. Shivering was graded using a 5-item scale [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Grades III and IV shivering for at least 3 min were considered positive, and prophylaxis was regarded as ineffective. An intravenous bolus of tramadol 1 mg/kg was used as a rescue drug.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Five-item scale of assessing shivering</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-11-508-g002"/></table-wrap><p>The incidence of hypotension, bradycardia, nausea and vomiting were recorded. Hypotension was defined as fall in blood pressure by 20% from the baseline or an absolute mean arterial pressure (MAP) &#x0003c;60 mmHg; which was managed by increments of intravenous ephedrine 6 mg. Bradycardia was defined as a decrease in HR by 20% from the baseline value or an absolute HR &#x0003c;50 beats/min; which was managed by 0.5 mg intravenous bolus of atropine. Patients with refractory nausea or vomiting were treated with 10 mg metoclopramide intravenous as a rescue medication.</p><p>Power analysis was based on the results of a previous study conducted by Kelsaka <italic>et al</italic>., they have shown that ondansetron can reduce the incidence of postspinal shivering to 8% compared with 36% in the control group.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] A sample size was calculated based on these findings, with a value of 0.05 and power (1&#x02212; &#x003b2;) of 0.80.

In addition, the incidence of nausea and vomiting was significantly high in Group S compared to Group O. 1<sup>st</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> min Apgar scores of neonates in both groups were also not statistically significant.</p><p>It has been reported that shivering occurs in up to 40% of patients undergoing surgery under regional anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In our study, the incidence of shivering was similar (42.5% [17/40]) in the control group. During the perioperative period, core body temperature should be maintained within the limit of 36.5&#x000b0;C&#x02013;37.5&#x000b0;C because shivering is a response of hypothermia. Under regional anesthesia, shivering may also seen in normothermic patients.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] A number of factors including age, level of sensory block, type and volume of infusion solution, and temperature of the operating room are risk factors for developing hypothermia in regional anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In our study, patients between 22 and 32 years age (pregnant patients) were included, the temperature of the operating room was maintained about 24&#x000b0;C during the intraoperative period, and infusions of cold crystalloid solutions were avoided.</p><p>Ondansetron, granisetron, and dolasetron, all are 5-HT3-receptor antagonists. Recently, they have been used very effectively to decrease postspinal shivering. The mechanism of 5-HT3-receptor antagonists in preventing postspinal shivering is still not clearly understood but is thought to be related to inhibition of serotonin reuptake on the preoptic anterior hypothalamic region.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>In a double-blinded, placebo-controlled study by Powell and Buggy, two doses of ondansetron (4 mg vs. 8 mg) were compared with placebo for prevention of shivering after general anesthesia, in which 82 patients (age, 18&#x02013;60 years) were randomized into three groups.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Postanesthetic shivering was observed in 16/28 (57%) patients in Group C compared with 9/27 (33%) in Group O 4 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.13) and 4/27 (15%) patients in Group O 8 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.003).</p><p>In regional anesthesia such as spinal anesthesia, Kelsaka <italic>et al</italic>. reported the incidence of postspinal shivering in ondansetron 8 mg group was 8% compared to 36% in the control group, which was very similar to our results of 10% in the ondansetron group versus 42.5% in the control group.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In another study by Kim <italic>et al</italic>. on 52 patients who had undergone knee arthroscopy under spinal anesthesia, ramosetron, a selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist effectively prevented shivering during spinal anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] These results are corroborating with the results of our study.</p><p>In a study by Sagir <italic>et al</italic>. on 160 patients undergoing urological surgery under spinal anesthesia, the patients were randomly allocated to receive saline (Group P, <italic>n</italic> = 40), ketamine 0.5 mg/kg (Group K, <italic>n</italic> = 40), granisetron 3 mg (Group G, <italic>n</italic> = 40), or ketamine 0.25 mg/kg + granisetron 1.5 mg (Group KG, <italic>n</italic> = 40).
