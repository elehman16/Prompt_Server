WHO now recommends breastfeeding of infants born to HIV-infected mothers until 12 months of age, with either maternal highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) or peri-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in infants using nevirapine. As PEP, lamivudine showed a similar efficacy and safety as nevirapine, but with an expected lower rate of resistant HIV strains emerging in infants who fail PEP, and lower restrictions for future HIV treatment. Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) is an attractive PEP candidate with presumably higher efficacy against HIV than nevirapine or lamivudine, and a higher genetic barrier to resistance selection. It showed an acceptable safety profile for the treatment of very young HIV-infected infants. The ANRS 12174 study aims to compare the risk of HIV-1 transmission during and safety of prolonged infant PEP with LPV/r (40/10 mg twice daily if 2-4 kg and 80/20 mg twice daily if &#x0003e;4 kg) versus Lamivudine (7,5 mg twice daily if 2-4 kg, 25 mg twice daily if 4-8 kg and 50 mg twice daily if &#x0003e;8 kg) from day 7 until one week after cessation of BF (maximum 50 weeks of prophylaxis) to prevent postnatal HIV-1 acquisition between 7 days and 50 weeks of age.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The ANRS 12174 study is a multinational, randomised controlled clinical trial conducted on 1,500 mother-infant pairs in Burkina Faso, South Africa, Uganda and Zambia.

By pooling data from five observational studies, the estimated additional risk of transmission attributable to breastfeeding is 14% (95% CI: 7-22%)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In recent years, observational studies including prospective cohorts have shown that exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) is associated with a reduced risk of HIV-1 transmission as compared to mixed feeding
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Postnatal transmission of HIV-1 through breast milk remains an unsolved challenge in many resource-poor settings. In Sub-Saharan Africa, especially in the rural areas, replacement feeding has proven a problematic alternative to breastfeeding because of social, cultural, economic and hygienic constraints
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Moreover, exclusively or predominantly breastfed infants are likely to have a substantially lower risk of succumbing to common childhood infections such as diarrhoea and pneumonia
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] that also inflict a substantial nutritional insult. Therefore, strategies that both prevent MTCT and allow for optimal breastfeeding are urgently needed. One option is to reduce the infectivity of the mothers during the breastfeeding period. The recently completed &#x0201c;Kesho Bora&#x0201d; randomised controlled trial showed that HIV transmission risk using maternal HAART from 28&#x02013;36 weeks pregnancy until 6 months after birth was 4.9% (95%CI: 3.1-7.6) vs. 8.4% (95%CI:6.0-11.6) using a short course ART (standard PMTCT)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Another study in Botswana reported even lower transmission risks at 6 months using two different HAART regimens (2% and 1%)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Another option is to give infants a prophylaxis during the breastfeeding period (peri-exposure prophylaxis-PEP). The advantages of PEP compared with maternal HAART are that: ART drug prophylaxis in an uninfected child carries no risk of selection of resistant viral strains; it may be more acceptable and applicable; it carries a lower cost and it spares mothers from using HAART at a stage of disease when its benefits have not been demonstrated, thereby avoiding HAART side effects and selection of resistant viral strains.</p><p>Several studies concurred to prove the concept that PEP can prevent postnatal transmission, using either nevirapine (NVP) or lamivudine (3TC) and various durations of PEP (Table
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The risks of postnatal transmission of HIV at 6 months with PEP ranges from 1.2% using 3TC (95%CI: 0&#x02013;2.4, among infants not infected with HIV at 6 weeks) to 1.8% using NVP (among infants not infected with HIV at one week). This strategy proved very efficacious during the period of prophylaxis, but this effect faded off after drug withdrawal as the HIV exposure continued
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. All the studies used PEP for a maximum of 6 months while many HIV-infected women continued to breastfeed until 12 months.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Number of events and sample size according to potential efficacy rates in both arms</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left">&#x000a0;</th><th align="left">&#x000a0;</th><th colspan="3" align="left"><bold>HIV transmission in 3TC arm</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>0.03</italic><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>0.04</italic><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>0.05</italic><hr/></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="8" align="left" valign="top">HIV transmission in LPV/r arm</td><td rowspan="2" align="left" valign="top">0.01<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>1428 subjects</italic><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>682 subjects</italic><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>430 subjects</italic><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>27 events</italic><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>16 events</italic><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>12 events</italic><hr/></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" align="left" valign="top">0.015<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>3190 subjects</italic><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>1223 subjects</italic><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>704 subjects</italic><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>67 events</italic><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>32 events</italic><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>22 events</italic><hr/></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" align="left" valign="top">0.02<hr/></td><td rowspan="2" align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>2204 subjects</italic><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>1118 subjects</italic><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>63 events</italic><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>37 events</italic><hr/></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" align="left" valign="top">0.025</td><td rowspan="2" align="left">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="2" align="left">&#x000a0;</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>1800 subjects</italic><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>64 events</italic></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Tolerance of extended NVP was acceptable although 15% of babies experienced NVP-related side effects, while no drug-related severe adverse events were reported with 3TC
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Major concerns arose from a sub-study of SWEN in India which reported that 92% of babies infected despite NVP prophylaxis harboured viruses resistant to NVP, thus jeopardizing the use of any drug of this therapeutic class (NNRTI) for future treatment of these infants, which restricts considerably the number of ART drugs available in low-income countries. These data were expected as NVP has a low genetic barrier and is therefore very prone to select resistant strains.</p><p>Based on the results of the above studies, WHO recommends to use either maternal HAART or NVP during breastfeeding to prevent postnatal HIV transmission
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In addition, breastfeeding is recommended until 12 months to reduce the increased morbidity and mortality related to early weaning. However, the PEP strategy has never been evaluated for the whole duration of breastfeeding.</p><p>The choice of the ideal drug for PEP should result from a balance between efficacy, safety and resistance induced among infants who will fail. In this respect, we believe that 3TC is a better drug than NVP for PEP as it has a better safety profile (including clinical consequence of resistance in infected babies) and a presumably similar efficacy
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Very recent findings suggest that Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/r), with its paediatric formulation, may be a very good candidate for HIV-1 PEP. LPV/r is one of the most potent antiretroviral drugs, with a much higher anti-HIV-1 activity than 3TC or NVP
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In addition, its high genetic barrier makes the development of LPV resistant strains very unlikely. Despite these very promising features for HIV prophylaxis, LPV/r was not initially considered for PEP because no safety data were reported in young infants. However, recent data suggest a good safety profile. In the CHER trial, 252 HIV-1 infected infants aged 6 to 12 weeks (median 7.2 weeks) received a combination therapy including LPV/r (300/75 mg per m<sup>2</sup> bid until 6 months of age, then 230/57 mg per m<sup>2</sup> bid), Zidovudine and Lamivudine
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. During the 40-week follow-up, neutropaenia occurred in 10 children, anemia in three, and elevated aminotransferase levels in two. Four children switched from Zidovudine to Stavudine because of neutropaenia. LPV/r was not discontinued in any child and no severe adverse event was related to this drug.</p><p>A smaller cohort of 21 infants aged 7 to 26 weeks treated with LPV/r (300/75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> twice daily) plus 2 NRTI confirmed these encouraging findings
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Tolerance was good with six grade 3 adverse events occurring in three children possibly related to HAART: asymptomatic serum/sodium disturbances in two infants that resolved with disruption of therapy for 0&#x02013;2 weeks and did not recur thereafter, and alanine aminotransferase elevation that did not recur after treatment suspension for 3 days. Some minor cholesterol disturbances were recorded in eight infants. Finally, a pharmacokinetic and safety study among 10 perinatally infected infants aged 3 to 6 weeks was recently reported. Adverse events were limited to transient grade 3 neutropaenia in three subjects (2 likely related to NRTI drugs and 1 temporally related to high plasma levels of LPV/r and stabilised after restarting LPV/r at reduced dose (the dose we will use for our trial). However, one fatal case of overdosage was recorded in France (Lyon) where a young infant died after absorption of a 10-fold higher dose than recommended at his age (S. Blanche, personal communication). Therefore, cautions should be taken to educate mothers and avoid massive overdosage.</p><p>The same studies by Chadwick and coll. also provided pharmacological data on LPV/r in infants
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Briefly, the bioavailability of LPV/r is reduced in young infants and therefore there is a need to adapt dosing per kg throughout the first year of life. These data were confirmed by a French pharmacokinetic study among 66 neonates who received LPV/r to prevent late perinatal HIV transmission. A dosage regimen of LPV 15 mg/kg bid was recommended for this age-group to achieve therapeutic levels
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>The primary objective of the study is to compare the HIV-1 transmission risk between 7 days and 50 weeks of age when infants are given LPV/r (40/10 mg twice daily if 2-4 kg and 80/20 mg twice daily if &#x0003e;4 kg) or lamivudine (12 mg twice daily if &#x0003c;6 kg, 24 mg per day if 6.0 to 9.0 kg, and 36 mg per day if &#x02265; 9.0 kg) from day 7 until one week after cessation of BF (maximum duration of prophylaxis: 50 weeks).</p><p>Secondary objectives are i) to assess the safety of long-term infant prophylaxis with LPV/r versus lamivudine (including resistance, adverse events and infant growth) until 50 weeks, ii) HIV-1-free survival until 50 weeks and iii) to build clinical trials capacity at the four study sites.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>We designed a multicentre randomised controlled pragmatic trial.

Severe adverse events will be reported according to the sponsor guidelines. Infant feeding practices will be monitored using tools based on WHO guidelines

The intervention will be stopped in children shown to be HIV-1-infected in order to reduce the period of unnecessary exposure to LPV/r or Lamivudine mono-prophylaxis and risk of emergence of resistant viral populations to a minimum. At 50 weeks of age, a final real time DNA PCR test will be done on all babies, in order to detect late HIV-1 transmission due to prolonged or resumed BF. Child survival will be assessed at 38 weeks and at 50 weeks of age. Hospital records and verbal autopsy will be used to measure overall and cause-specific infant mortality.

Study drug bottles of LPV/r and Lamivudine will be masked by study labels.</p><p>Lopinavir/ritonavir (80/20 mg/mL) will be given to the baby twice daily as recommended in infants, with the following scheme: 40/10 mg (0.5 mL) twice daily if 2-4 kg and 80/20 mg (1 mL) twice daily if &#x0003e;4 kg. Similarly, lamivudine will be given as follows: 7,5 mg (0,75 mL) twice daily if 2-4 kg, 25 mg (2.5 mL) twice daily if 4-8 kg and 50 mg (5 mL) twice daily if &#x0003e;8 kg. These dosages were calculated on the basis of a pharmacokinetic study of LPV/r in young infants done in Paris
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. For Lamivudine, calculations were based on a pharmacokinetic study carried out by Moodley et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Infants whose mothers need and initiate HAART during the trial will be discontinued from the study medication in order to avoid excessive intake of ART in babies due to high diffusion of lamivudine in breast milk
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In addition, the maternal HAART regimen will much decrease the risk of HIV transmission through breast milk
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Study size</title><p>The primary outcome will be assessed using a superiority analysis. We expect the risk of acquiring HIV-1 infection between day 7 and 50 weeks of age to range between 3% and 5% in the lamivudine group, based on the findings of the MITRA study which reported a transmission of 1.2% (95%CI: 0 to 2.4) between 6 weeks and 6 months and association between CD4 count and risk of transmission observed in the VTS study
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This range of 3 to 5% accounts for population with CD4 count &#x0003e; 350 cells/&#x003bc;l and additional HIV transmission between day 7 and week 6, and between 6 months and 50 weeks.</p><p>Considering its higher anti-HIV-1 activity, we expect a higher efficacy of LPV/r, ranging from 1 to 2.5%, which would be considered as a clinically relevant difference compared with the lamivudine arm.</p><p>Table

Although NVP was studied more extensively than Lamivudine for PEP purposes, we decided to use the latter drug for the comparative arm as we expect a similar efficacy as NVP (according to the MITRA study) with similar adverse events but with less detrimental genetic barrier profile. Indeed, we believe that the &#x02018;cost&#x02019; of using NVP for PEP during breastfeeding (i.e. to deprive infants who will fail PEP of a major class of ART for their HIV treatment) is too high to recommend this drug for prevention of postnatal HIV transmission.</p><p>Active clinical and biologic follow up of infants and systematic report of potential effects will be organised according to GCP and GLP international guidelines for toxicity and adverse event management. Recently, breastfed infants of HAART-treated mothers have been shown to ingest sufficient amounts of ART by breastfeeding to reach plasma therapeutic levels (at least for NVP, AZT and 3TC)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Therefore, in order to avoid additional toxicity and overdosage of lamivudine or LPV/r in babies (and because maternal HAART is most likely to reduce postnatal HIV-1 transmission) our trial will recruit only babies born of mothers not eligible for HAART. Likewise, infants whose mothers need and initiate HAART during the trial will also be discontinued from the study medication. Similar to post-exposure prophylaxis, the study medication will continue one week after cessation of breastfeeding (= last exposure of HIV), after a maximum of 49 weeks of breastfeeding. This extended period of study treatment is justified as it parallels standard post-exposure prophylaxis.</p><p>This study will provide a new evidence-based intervention to support HIV-1-infected women not eligible for HAART to safely breastfeed their babies, thus counteracting the existing contradiction between optimal infant feeding and PMTCT through breast milk. Assuming a full coverage and 60% efficacy of the intervention, about 120,000 cases of post-natal HIV-1 transmission could be averted per year in Africa. In addition, a prolonged breastfeeding period of HIV-infected mothers will reduce stigmatisation of infant feeding patterns and disclosure of maternal HIV status
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], and will improve health outcomes in infants born to HIV-infected mothers. By extension, this intervention will also contribute to promote breastfeeding in the communities beyond HIV-infected women
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Optimised breastfeeding promotion has the potential of annually averting 1.3 million child deaths globally, if universally implemented.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>TT and PV designed the study.
