ablative lasers remove it, making them theoretically more effective.</p></sec><sec><title>OBJECTIVES</title><p>To evaluate the clinical and histological alterations induced by fractional
photothermolysis for treating photoaging, comparing the possible equivalence of
multiple sessions of 1540nm Erbium, to one session of 2940nm Erbium.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS</title><p>Eighteen patients (mean age 55.9) completed the treatment with three sessions of
1540nm fractional Erbium laser on one side of the face (50 mJ/mB, 15ms, 2 passes),
and one session of 2940nm on the other side (5mJ/mB, 0.25ms, 2 passes). Biopsies
were performed before and 3 months after treatment. Clinical, histological and
morphometric evaluations were carried out.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>All patients presented clinical improvement with no statistically significant
difference (p&#x0003e; 0.05) between the treated sides. Histopathology revealed a new
organization of collagen and elastic fibers, accompanied by edema, which was more
evident with the 2940nm laser. This finding was confirmed by morphometry, which
showed a decrease in collagen density for both treatments, with a statistical
significance for the 2940nm laser (p &#x0003e; 0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Three 1540nm sessions were clinically equivalent to one 2940nm session. The edema
probably contributed to the positive results after three months, togheter with the
new collagen and elastic fibers organization. The greater edema after the 2940nm
session indicates that dermal remodeling takes longer than with 1540nm. It is
possible that this histological superiority relates to a more prolonged effect,
but a cohort longer than three months is needed to confirm that supposition.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Collagen</kwd><kwd>Elastin</kwd><kwd>Lasers</kwd><kwd>Skin aging</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In his book "War of the Worlds", George Wells, the famous English science fiction
writer, described ray guns that would bring a new concept to people's minds. They were
laser prototypes, mentioned before the description of atomical structure by Bohr in 1932
and before the foundations of quantum physics by Einstein in 1972.<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>
On that account, the form of light termed "laser" (light amplification stimulated by the
emission of radiation), thus appears as a sign of technology and the future prior to its
use in specific situations.</p><p>In 1959, Maiman developed the first laser machine, and in 1965 Goldman used a laser in
Dermatology for the first time, to remove tattoos.<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Lasers became popular in
skin treatment in the 1980s, following the description of selective photothermolysis by
Anderson and Parish. They soon began to be used in skin rejuvenation.<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>The first lasers used in hotorejuvenation were the ablative CO<sub>2</sub> and Erbium
types.<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Despite the good results, their use had limitations, the
most significant of which were the side effects associated with the long post-operative
period, which was necessary to allow resumption of social activities.<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>Mainstein's description of fractional photothermolysis in 2004 raised the possibility of
treating photoaging with less risk and reduced downtime.<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The fractioning of the laser beams allowed for
preservation of areas of healthy skin, which accelerated the healing process.</p><p>The first fractional lasers were non-ablative, reaching the dermis but leaving the
epidermis untouched. Despite presenting a safer profile, preliminary results were poorer
than those of first-generation CO<sub>2</sub> and Erbium lasers. In 2007, Hantash and
colleagues described ablative fractional lasers, which in theory were more effective in
dermal remodeling than non-ablative lasers.<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The combination of dermal and epidermal ablation seemed to foster
a more robust healing and fibroplasia process, which resulted from greater damage to the
skin than that caused by the non-ablative laser.<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Although the results for the methods were not exactly
the same, notable improvements in the photoaged skin are described for both methods,
following a single session.<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Due to the lesser amount of tissue
damage caused, several nonablative laser sessions are needed to for a comparison in
efficacy to a single session of the ablative laser.<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>Most clinical trials demonstrate the efficacy of the methods from an isolated and
subjective point of view; few comparisons have been published.<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> In a 2008 clinical trial that treated 10
patients with fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser on one side of the face and a 1550nm
Erbium laser on the other, Weiss and others concluded in their subjective analysis that
there was a 75% improvement using fractional CO<sub>2</sub> and a 25% improvement using
the fractional non-ablative laser.<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>
In 2011, Byung and others performed the same comparison in the treatment of wrinkles in
four patients and yielded more significant results using fractional
CO<sub>2</sub>.<sup><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> In both cases,
only a single session of each treatment was performed and, as previously described, many
sessions of the non-ablative method are necessary to treat moderate to severe photoaged
skin, compared with the ablative method. In 2012, Wattanakrai, Pootongkam and
Rojhirunsakool compared the methods in periorbital wrinkles of 22 patients, and
suggested that they were equivalent.<sup><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>
Parameters were similar to those we proposed in our study but no histologic observation
was performed. Again in 2012, Bas and colleagues published the first histological
comparison between these methods.<sup><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>
The main finding was the induction of fibrosis, similar to scar formation in some
patients in the group treated with fractional ablative photothermolysis - which was not
described in the group treated with non-ablative fractional laser therapy. However, the
study was on the treatment of pigmented lesions, without a pre-treatment biopsy, and
photoaging was not the target of observation.</p><p>Since we thus believe that the differentiation between methods on the treatment of
photoaged skin still needs to be scientifically explored, we proposed a prospective,
randomized clinical trial comparing 2940nm with 1540nm Erbium. The idea was to compare
objectively the effect of multiple fractional nonablative sessions to a single
fractional ablative session, observing whether, for the parameters used, the clinical
differences between the interventions were relevant and correlated with microscopic
changes, which were measured using histology and morphometric quantification of collagen
and elastic fibers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>The study is interventionist, of the before/after type, on the clinical and
histological modifications inducted by the use of fractional Erbium laser in 30
female patients presenting clinical photoaging of the skin. Patients received
fractional non-ablative Erbium (1540nm) on one side of the face, and fractional
ablative Erbium (2940 nm) on the other. The sides on which each treatment was applied
were randomly chosen for each patient. Histologic studies examined the epidermis and
dermis, with a focus on the collagen and elastic systems. The sample size was chosen
according to gender and age homogeneity within the group, while the number of 30
patients was considered adequate for the study's objectives. The project was approved
by the HUCFF and <italic>Santa Casa da Miseric&#x000f3;rdia do Rio do Janeiro</italic> ethics
committee, with the respective protocol numbers of 025/09 and 035/09. All patients
signed a free and clarified consent term, with detailed information about the
research.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion Criteria</title><p>Post-menopausal female patients (n = 30, aged 5063), with Fitzpatrick skin types I to
IV and Glogau classification II and III with photodamaged skin (clinically
represented by hyperpigmentation, wrinkles, alterations in the skin texture and
sagging) were selected.</p></sec><sec><title>Exclusion Criteria</title><p>Exclusion criteria included women who had used hormone therapy in the previous six
months or who had received oral or topical treatment for photoaging in the previous
six months. Patients with diseases that compromise the skin's structure (e.g.
collagen diseases) or who had photosensitivity or severe comorbidities were also
excluded. Inflammatory (e.g. rosacea) or infectious (e.g. herpes simplex) skin
diseases with signs of activity were also considered exclusionary criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment</title><p>The study compared treatments applied on either side of the face. The patient
received fractional non-ablative Erbium (1540 nm) on one side, and frac-tional
ablative Erbium (2940 nm) on the other. The sides on which each treatment was applied
were randomly chosen for each patient. A single physician evaluator carried out all
treatments. Parameters such as fluency, pulse duration, number of passes, lateral and
column overlap was the same for all patients. In both methods, these parameters were
the minimum recommended for treatment by the protocol manufacturer. The purpose of
using minimum recommended levels was to allow the establishment of reasonably
equivalent and comparable parameters, which would not favor either of the methods.
Three 1540nm and one 2940nm sessions were performed, based not only on the minimum
number for treatment mentioned by the manufacturer, but also on the literature, which
sets out the need for multiple fractional non-ablative sessions, compared with the
number of fractional ablative sessions, in the treatment of photoaging.<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Thus, the study started with the 1540 nm laser; patients only
received the 2940nm laser on the other side of the face during the third session
(<xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table 1</xref>). Topical (25mg/g lidocaine + 25
mg/g prilocaine cream) and sublingual (ketorolac tromethamine 10mg tablet)
anesthetics were applied in all sessions, 30 and 15 minutes before treatment,
respectively. Patients were instructed not to use any topical medication throughout
the study, apart from sunscreen (F30).</p><table-wrap id="t01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>TABLE 1</label><caption><p>Treatment parameters used in the study</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr align="left"><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">laser</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">tip</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">fluency</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">pulse</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">number of passes</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">overlap</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">sessions</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1540nm</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10mm</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">50mJ/Mb</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">15ms</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">50%</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2940nm</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10mm</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5mJ/Mb</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.25ms</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">50%</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Clinical Evaluation</title><p>Individual forms, for taking notes during appointments, were filled in with
information on patients and the assessments of medical researchers. Patients were
instructed not to use any topical medication - except for SPF 30 sunscreen - during
the course of the study. Throughout the research period, patients were seen at the
Cosmetic Dermatology outpatient service of the <italic>Santa Casa de Miseric&#x000f3;rdia do
Rio do Janeiro</italic>. A photographic study was carried out by the medical
researcher using a Sony Cyber-shot 10.0 megapixel camera during and after the
interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Improvement Scale:</title><p>The degree of improvement was measured by two independent evaluators (i.e. not
involved in the study). A Likert-scale assessment was performed for each side
treated, separately, after one and after three months following the end of treatment.
Patients also performed this same analysis. The evaluation considered four criteria:
color (improvement of the rankness), texture (decreased roughness), wrinkles (better
if more superficial), firmness (lifting effect).</p><p>Questionnaires based on the Likert scale are commonly used for psychometric
analyses.<sup><xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>-<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Psychometry is the area of psychology related to
exact sciences that gathers technics able to measure objectively the impression of
the individuals analyzed. That scale was also used by Ciocon H et al. in a clinical,
comparative analysis of different lasers, consisting of a split-face study and, for
this reason, we drew on the method to measure the clinical improvement of our
patients.<sup><xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> The Likert scale
is symmetric and bipolar, based on a central and neutral point. It presents 5
propositions, and the person enquired is asked to select one. Answers are graded,
using scores from 0 to 4. In our analysis, "moderate" was considered the neutral
point; "no improvement" and "minimal" formed the negative pole; and "considerable"
and "great improvement" represented the positive pole (0no improvement, 1- minimal
improvement, 2- moderate improvement, 3- considerable improvement, 4great
improvement). With the scale based on intervals (0 to 4), we analyzed the mean for
the answers in each criterion (n1+n2+...+n18/18), and for each treatment (1540 nm=x,
2940nm =x'). The difference between the mean values (x-x') for each criteria was
considered relevant when the p- value, calculated via the t-student test with Excel
(Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA), was under 0.05.</p></sec><sec><title>Side Effects</title><p>Side effects (pain; edema; erythema; and desquamation) were evaluated through a
visual numeric scale. Pain was assessed by the patients immediately after the
procedure, while the other effects were analyzed by two independent physicians, four
days after the interventions. The visual numeric scale is a gauging and
unidirectional instrument of measurement, commonly used in pain analysis, and it has
also been described previously in clinical trials for measuring other side effects
related to photoaging treatments.<sup><xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>
Therefore, it was the measurement method chosen for our study. On this scale, the
grade of intensity varies from 0 to 10 (0- absent; 1 to 3- light; 4 to 7- mild; &#x0003e;
7 severe). We analyzed the mean value for the answers presented for each collateral
effect and each of the methods (1540nm=x, 2940nm=x'). The difference between the mean
values (x-x') with respect to each side effect was considered relevant, when the
pvalue, calculated trough the t-student test with Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond,
WA), was under 0.05.</p></sec><sec><title>Histological Evaluation:</title><p>The physician filled in a form with the morphological and morphometrical results.
Biopsy specimens were taken before and after three months, following the end of the
treatments, from both sides of each patient's face. Fragments were obtained from the
preauricular region, respecting a distance of 1cm. The procedure was performed with a
4mm punch, while the suture was carried out with 5.0 mononylon (one point). The skin
fragments were forwarded for histopathological processing within a maximum period of
12 hours. The material was fixed in 10% tamponated formol, included in paraffin and
submitted to the usual processing routine. In addition to ordinary staining,
hematoxilina-eosina (HE) and special stainings, were also performed to assess the
collagen (picrosirius), and elastic (orceina), systems. Furthermore, during the pre-
and post- treatment biopsies, morphometric studies were conducted in order to
quantify fiber density. Routine and special stains were performed at the pathology
department of the HUCFF. Skin features were compared before and after the treatment.
The study was blind with respect to the sides treated.</p></sec><sec><title>Epdermis</title><p>The epidermis was evaluated using hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. Alterations found
in the epidermal cones and Malpighian layer in the posttreatment period were
analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Collagen System</title><p>Using HE and picrosirius staining, the degree of elastosis at the dermal-epidermal
junction (Grenz zone) and on the papillary dermis, was evaluated.</p><p>The elastosis at the dermal-epidermal junction was defined by the presence of
hialinyzed and disorganized collagen fibers; and on the papillary dermis, it was
characterized by basophilic material spread diffusely in the high dermis, nodules or
a band. Changes to the patterns previously observed were described.</p></sec><sec><title>Elastic System</title><p>Fibers were evaluated using orcein staining, and attention was paid to the action of
radiation, alterations on the superficial plexus (oxitalanic and elauninic),
including the diminished density of the fibers or their absence. On the papillary
dermis, elastic fibers were considered altered if they were thick and twisty, rather
than the normal straight and elongated appearance. Changes to the patterns previously
observed were described.</p></sec><sec><title>Morphometry</title><p>A morphometric analysis was performed to quantify the densities of the collagen and
elastic systems before and after treatment. For this analysis, digital images were
obtained from picrosirius and orceinstained sections (JPEG format, 36-bit color, 1280
x 1024 pixels) using an LC Evolution camera (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD,
USA) and an Olympus BX51 microscope. The images were analyzed using Image Pro Plus
software version 1.7 (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA), and grouped by
shade in order to measure the collagen and elastic fibers before and after treatment.
The histogram resulting from this grouping was assessed and the results of the
selected pixels were expressed as a percentage of the image's total &#x000e1;rea.<sup><xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>-<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Differences in the amount of collagen and elastin before and
after treatment were tested using the student's t-test, and relevant statistical
differences corresponded to p&#x0003c;0.05. The study was blind with respect to the sides
treated.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Clinical evaluation</title><p>Only 18 patients completed the study (mean age 55.9). Eight patients left the study
after the first 1540 nm session, complaining of severe pain, and four left after the

degree of improvement after the first and third months of treatment. The second

elastic system for both treatments. These structures followed a pattern very similar
to that of normal oxitalanic and elauninic fibers. The oxytalanic-smile fibers were
straight and isolated on the dermal-epidermal junction, perpendicular to its axis,
while elauninic-simile fibers were close and parallel to the dermal-epidermal

variables measured in the clinical analysis (color, texture, wrinkles, and
firmness).<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> In our
analysis, three fractional non-ablative sessions were clinically equal to one fractional
ablative session.</p><p>Regarding the side effects analyzed, based on the literature, we acknowledge that the
healing process for the 1540nm Erbium laser was faster than for the 2940nm device, which
presented less intense erythema, edema, and desquamation - in some cases resembling
treatment with traditional Erbium and CO<sub>2</sub> lasers. However, it is important to
note that three 1540nm sessions were necessary to obtain the same results as one 2940nm
session, which entails undesired effects on three occasions, though they are less
intense. The fact that 12 patients left the study due to severe pain suggests that the
anesthesia used was insufficient. This was confirmed by the patients who completed the
study, whose assessment of the pain threshold indicated difficulties in exposure to the
treatments, despite the sublingual analgesia and topical anesthesia. Other anesthetic
options are described in the literature: the use of air-cooling systems during the
procedure; and nerve blocks (in particular supraorbital, infraorbital, and mental), 15
minutes before the sessions.<sup><xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>-<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Nevertheless, in contrast with this
study's findings, many clinical trials with fractional lasers concur that pre-treatment
topical anesthetics are sufficient to perform the procedure.<sup><xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>-<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup></p><p>Our study was not limited to a clinical comparison between methods. Since we regard
subjective analysis as insufficient, histological and morphometrical studies were
conducted, geared towards a more objective study. Findings were consistent with the
histological effects from fractional ablative and non-ablative photothermolysis,
described separately in studies regarding the epidermis and collagen.<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>-<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Although it is
non-ablative, according to histological studies, the 1540 nm laser was able to alter the
epidermis as much as the 2940 nm ablative laser. Further, the hialinyzed collagen
present in the Grenz zone, linked to photoaging, was replaced by fibers arranged
differently from what had been previously observed. This occurred with both treatments,
suggesting neocollagenesis. Rarely studied in previous histopathological analyses, there
are few references to the effects of lasers on the architecture of the elastic system.
The analysis of those fibers in serial biopsies during the three months after fractional
non-ablative photothermolysis in 12 patients did not demonstrate any changes in the
post-treatment arrangement.<sup><xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Another
analysis that used serial biopsies during a year of fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser use
was consistent with the present study, demonstrating a new arrangement of elastic fibers
after three months, as well as an increased expression of elastin for up to one year
after treatment.<sup><xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> No long-term
comparative analysis involving elastic fibers and fractional photothermolysis was found.
Nevertheless, the new fiber arrangement observed in this study suggests reconstitution
of the superficial elastic system, similar in both treatments tested.</p><p>All previous reports on neocollagenesis induced by the methods studied were qualitative,
whereas we conducted morphmetrical studies on collagen and elastic systems. Despite the
great resemblance between the alterations induced by both methods, the quantitative
analysis confirmed the only relevant difference in the subjective analysis of the
slides: the greater edema on the dermis induced by the 2940nm laser, compared with that
provoked by the 1540nm laser. The edema, characterized histopathologically by the
greater space between the collagen fibers, was corroborated by morphometric data, which
indicated diminished density of collagen fibers, after both methods, though it was only
statistically relevant for the 2940nm laser. The elastic fibers that appeared denser,
suggetsing superficial reconstruction, in a similar manner to the histopathology, in
both methods, showed an increased density that was only statistically relevant in cases
following 1540nm treatment, which also corroborated the greater edema found in cases
treated with the 2940nm laser.</p><p>Studies on photoaging show that collagen degeneration due to radiation, correlates
directly with the level of hydration of the dermis, which is generally smaller the more
fibroblasts decrease.<sup><xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>-<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> Hence, we correlated the edema and
dermal remodeling as being directly proportional. It was inferred that the 2940nm laser
showed, on a histological level, a greater capacity for transformation, as it provoked
greater edema than the 1540nm laser. Unlike the studies conducted to date, we thus
inferred that in a period of three months, the edema joins the neocolagenesis and
neoelastogenesis in the positive effects on wrinkles and firmness.<sup><xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> None of the
histological studies with fractional lasers conducted to date mention edema after three
months. This alteration is mentioned as a histopathological finding that has an acute
influence on the healing process, instigated by the therapy under analysis, with
complete resolution after seven days, concentrated mainly on the basal layer, rather
than the papillary dermis.<sup><xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> The best characterization for this finding, which represented a
shortcoming for the study, involves analysis of other elements from the extracellular
matrix, possibly glicosaminoglicans, seen via alcian blue staining, which has not been
carried out thus far. Another limitation of this study is the dropout rate, which
reduced the number of patients analyzed by 40%. Furthermore, the lack of long-term
follow-up (6-12 months) makes it impossible to draw conclusions about the actual
relevance of the interventions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, both methods proved to be effective from a clinical perspective, inducing
histological changes in the dermal pattern previously seen, though these alterations
occurred within a threemonth period and only studies lasting 6-12 months can provide
conclusions on the actual impact of this treatment on the group examined. Both were
considered equally painful, but the 1540nm laser entailed fewer collateral effects. The
high dropout rate observed throughout the treatment, due to unbearable pain, casts doubt
over the actual worth of the treatment and the anesthetic method applied. Although
ablative treatment was considered more effective from a histological perspective, three
1540nm sessions were clinically equivalent to one 2940nm session, in the age group
examined. It is possible that the histological superiority is correlated with more
prolonged effects, though a cohort longer than three months would be needed to confirm
that supposition.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>Conflict of interest: None</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>Financial funding: None</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>How to cite this article: Borges J, Cuzzi T, Mandarim-de-Lacerda CA, Manela-Azulay M.
