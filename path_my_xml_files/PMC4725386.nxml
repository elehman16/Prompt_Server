While most patients recover after a short but often debilitating illness, a proportion progress to severe disease, characterized by endothelial dysfunction and plasma leakage that may result in hypovolemic shock [<xref rid="CIV949C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Other potentially severe complications include bleeding and liver/organ involvement [<xref rid="CIV949C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Myalgia and arthralgia are prominent symptoms associated with dengue, and rhabdomyolysis is also occasionally reported [<xref rid="CIV949C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. No vaccine or effective therapeutic is available as yet, and health systems in endemic areas are frequently overwhelmed with patients during the dengue season [<xref rid="CIV949C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. There is a need for a therapeutic that can shorten the duration and severity of symptoms.</p><p>The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, also known as statins, have beneficial effects beyond their lipid-lowering properties, including effects on endothelial function [<xref rid="CIV949C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIV949C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These effects are mediated through effects on the mevalonate pathway, resulting in reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines, thereby controlling leukocyte migration to areas of endothelial inflammation [<xref rid="CIV949C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Statins may improve endothelial function by modulating the production of reactive oxygen species [<xref rid="CIV949C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Endothelial dysfunction is recognized as an important factor in atherosclerosis pathogenesis [<xref rid="CIV949C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and these effects, together with the lipid-lowering properties, likely explain the benefits of statin use in cardiovascular disease. There is overlap between the inflammatory processes seen in atherosclerosis and sepsis, and observational studies have suggested that statin therapy may be associated with improved outcomes in inflammatory conditions [<xref rid="CIV949C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIV949C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Statins are being investigated as adjunctive therapy for a variety of conditions such as sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome in which endothelial dysfunction is thought to play a role. To date their adjunctive role has not been substantiated [<xref rid="CIV949C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIV949C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Although the mechanisms underlying the endothelial dysfunction seen in severe dengue remain incompletely understood, we hypothesized that the endothelial stabilizing effects of statins could favorably modulate dengue vasculopathy. In addition, in vitro work has shown that lovastatin reduces dengue virion assembly, raising the possibility that statins may have antiviral properties [<xref rid="CIV949C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIV949C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Although statins have a good safety profile, given the recognized association between statin use and hepatic and muscle dysfunction [<xref rid="CIV949C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="CIV949C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], both well-recognized features of dengue, our primary objective was to assess the safety of lovastatin in dengue patients. In addition, we investigated the effects of lovastatin on a variety of clinical and virological parameters.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Design and Participants</title><p>We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-escalating trial of lovastatin for adult dengue patients at 2 centers in Vietnam (Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City; Tien Giang Hospital, My Tho City) [<xref rid="CIV949C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In phase 1, we assessed 40 mg lovastatin vs placebo in 30 patients, followed, after satisfactory safety review, by 80 mg lovastatin vs placebo in 300 patients in phase 2.</p><p>Ethical approval was obtained from the institutional review boards (IRBs) of the Hospital for Tropical Diseases and the Vietnam Ministry of Health, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and the Oxford University Tropical Research Ethics Committee. The trial was registered with the ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN03147572).</p><p>The trial protocol has been published elsewhere [<xref rid="CIV949C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In brief, patients aged &#x02265;18 years, presenting within 72 hours of fever onset with an illness consistent with dengue, in whom a rapid test for dengue nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) was positive (NS1 Ag-STRIP, Bio-Rad) were eligible for inclusion providing they gave written informed consent. Exclusions included an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level &#x0003e;150 U/L, a creatine kinase (CK) level &#x0003e;1000 U/L, a platelet count &#x0003c;50 cells &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L, pregnancy or lactation, or a history of cirrhosis or myopathy. Patients were excluded if they were currently taking statins or any medication contraindicated with statins.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Randomization and Masking</title><p>We randomly assigned enrolled patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive lovastatin or placebo once daily for 5 days. Randomization was stratified by ward of recruitment, using block randomization (block sizes of 4 or 6). The Vietnamese company DOMESCO provided lovastatin and visually matched placebo without charge. Only the clinical trials pharmacist had access to the randomization list; she prepackaged bottles containing 6 doses of either lovastatin or visually matched placebo. All other study staff were blinded to treatment allocation until after completion of the study and database locking. Each enrolled patient was assigned the next available study code that corresponded to a prepackaged bottle of study drug. Clinical data were captured on structured case report forms that were entered into a secure Web-based database.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study Procedures</title><p>Participants were identified on the dengue wards and among patients attending outpatients who agreed to be hospitalized. Screening was streamlined to ensure completion within 4 hours. Participants received the first dose of study drug as soon as possible after randomization, with subsequent doses given once daily in the morning. Standardized clinical information was recorded daily throughout the disease course. Study physicians were responsible for all clinical management decisions with the following caveats: If the ALT level exceeded 250 U/L, the CK level exceeded 1000 U/L, or the platelet count fell below 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L, the study drug was stopped. Adverse events (AEs) and details of severity and likely relatedness to the study drug were recorded in the case report form. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported to the relevant IRBs and to an independent data and safety monitoring committee (DSMB).</p><p>Hematocrit, platelet, and total cholesterol measurements were performed at enrollment (study day 1), then daily to study day 6, and at the follow-up visit 4 weeks after enrollment. Renal and liver function tests, electrolytes, and coagulation profiles were carried out on study days 1, 3, 5, and at follow-up. A 2-dimensional ultrasound scan was performed on illness day 6 to quantify the presence of plasma leak. Quality of life was measured using a visual analogue scale daily.</p><p>Serological and virological tests were used to confirm the dengue diagnosis and identify the infecting serotype, as outlined in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/cid/civ949/-/DC1">Supplementary Text 1</ext-link>. Viremia was quantified on the daily plasma samples using a serotype-specific, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay [<xref rid="CIV949C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>The DSMB provided study oversight. Safety reviews were performed at the end of the first phase, and after the 30th and 100th patients were recruited in phase 2.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Outcomes</title><p>This was an exploratory study focusing on safety, with the primary outcome defined as a comparison of the proportion of patients with any AE, and with any SAEs, between the treatment arms. The cutoffs described above for worsening hepatitis (ALT &#x0003e;250 U/L) and myositis (CK &#x0003e;1000 U/L) defined certain prespecified adverse events, but we also graded all laboratory abnormalities as grade 1&#x02013;4 following the established Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events system. Secondary outcomes, as detailed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/cid/civ949/-/DC1">Supplementary Text 1</ext-link>, were as follows: (1) disease progression as defined by admission to intensive care unit, development of severe dengue (shock, severe bleeding, or neurological involvement), or death; (2) fever clearance time; (3) the area under the log<sub>10</sub>-transformed plasma viremia curve between days 3 and 6 of illness; and (4) the lowest quality of life score between days 2 and 6 of the study. Additional exploratory outcomes, intended primarily to evaluate vascular leakage severity and other characteristic features of dengue, are also described in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/cid/civ949/-/DC1">Supplementary Text 1</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The planned sample size of 300 patients in phase 2 was based on medical and feasibility considerations as well as power considerations for key endpoints. In a previous dengue trial performed by our group, approximately 10% and 30% of participants experienced at least 1 SAE or AE, respectively [<xref rid="CIV949C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The planned sample size guaranteed a power of 80% to detect an increase of 12% in the SAE frequency or 16% in the AE frequency. More extensive power considerations are discussed in the published protocol [<xref rid="CIV949C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Cohort 1 was analyzed descriptively. The main analysis population included all patients in cohort 2 following the intention-to-treat principle, with the principal analyses defined a priori in a written analysis plan. The proportion of patients with AEs was compared between the treatment arms using Fisher exact test, while the predefined secondary endpoints were compared based on linear regression for continuous endpoints, logistic regression for binary endpoints, and Cox regression for time-to-event endpoints. The main explanatory variable in the regression models was the treatment assignment, and all analyses were adjusted for day of illness at recruitment. Comparisons of laboratory markers were additionally adjusted for the predose enrollment value, and also for serotype and immune status for plasma viremia comparisons.</p><p>All analyses were performed with the statistical software R version 3.1.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Patients were recruited into phase 1 in November and December 2012 (the trial profile is shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/cid/civ949/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1</ext-link>). The baseline characteristics were similar in the 2 study groups; illness duration and AE rates were also comparable, and all AEs resolved fully (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/cid/civ949/-/DC1">Supplementary Tables 1 and 2</ext-link>).</p><p>Following the initial safety review by the DSMB, phase 2 ran from April 2013 to January 2015. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="CIV949F1">1</xref> shows the trial profile.

Treatment was stopped prematurely in 17 placebo and 19 lovastatin recipients. Eleven patients in the placebo arm developed laboratory abnormalities on study day 3 where the protocol mandated cessation of the study drug: 10 with ALT elevations &#x0003e;250 U/L and 1 with a CK elevation &#x0003e;1000 U/L. Twelve patients in the lovastatin arm had ALT elevations &#x0003e;250 U/L that required the drug to be stopped. These abnormalities were not associated with clinical deterioration. The study physicians elected to stop the study drug in 3 other cases (1 placebo, 2 lovastatin) due to aspartate aminotransferase elevations, although the ALT levels did not meet the stopping criteria.

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Vietnamese adults with dengue, we found that lovastatin was safe and well tolerated. Specifically, we found no evidence of AEs on hepatic or muscle dysfunction, both characteristic features of acute dengue as well as recognized complications of statin therapy. However, we also found no evidence of a beneficial effect on any clinical or virological endpoints.</p><p>Although our study did not include pharmacokinetic analysis, we used 80 mg lovastatin daily, and it is reasonable to assume that therapeutic concentrations were achieved as evidenced by the significantly greater reduction in cholesterol in the lovastatin group. The rates of clinical and laboratory AEs were similar between the treatment arms. Rates of SAEs were also similar, and in all cases these events were classified as serious due to prolonged hospitalization for laboratory monitoring rather than on the basis of clinical deterioration. Biochemical abnormalities were observed frequently in both treatment arms, and were no more prevalent in the lovastatin arm.</p><p>Progression to severe dengue occurred infrequently in the study population (1%) and there was no difference in the rate of disease progression between the study groups. In view of the small number of events, it is possible that the study missed a small beneficial effect. The frequency of dengue shock syndrome is higher in children and, hence, children are the preferred patient population for investigation of drugs with endothelial stabilizing properties [<xref rid="CIV949C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, since we observed no differences in the magnitude of hemoconcentration or in the presence of effusions on ultrasound between the study groups in this adult trial, we do not consider there to be a compelling case for a trial of statin therapy in children at present. We also found no other evidence of an anti-inflammatory effect; in particular, fever clearance times were unaffected by statin therapy.</p><p>Another limitation of our study is that we obtained sparse data on DENV-2 and DENV-3 due to the dominance of DENV-1 and DENV-4 during the study. Although in vitro laboratory studies have suggested that statins may reduce dengue virion assembly, we found no evidence of an antiviral effect [<xref rid="CIV949C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It is possible that the effects of statins may differ between the serotypes and it is interesting to note that the work that suggested a potential antiviral effect used DENV-2 [<xref rid="CIV949C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIV949C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>As in other recent trials of antiviral and immunomodulatory agents for dengue [<xref rid="CIV949C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="CIV949C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIV949C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], we administered the study drug within 72 hours of illness onset. It is possible that even initiating a therapeutic within this timeframe is too late to modulate the disease pathways. Peak viremia typically occurs earlier in the illness [<xref rid="CIV949C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In addition, there is evidence that endothelial dysfunction is established by 72 hours [<xref rid="CIV949C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. To favorably modulate outcome, earlier intervention may be necessary, which is a significant hurdle in many endemic regions as patients rarely present to healthcare so early. It also raises the question of whether therapeutic development should focus more on identifying chemoprophylactic agents that could be used in those at most risk of severe disease, and also on optimizing supportive care for those who do develop severe disease. The ability to distinguish patients at risk of severe disease early in the course of illness could lead to a more targeted clinical trial approach. The use of dengue human infection models may also allow streamlining of potential therapeutic candidates [<xref rid="CIV949C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Following the initial hope raised by observational studies suggesting that prior statin therapy might improve outcomes in a variety of inflammatory conditions, several prospective trials investigating statins as adjunctive therapy have recently been published [<xref rid="CIV949C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIV949C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="CIV949C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; similar to our study findings, none of these trials showed a beneficial role for de novo statin therapy. Despite these negative results, this &#x0201c;discovery-in-practice&#x0201d; approach remains important given the high preclinical failure rate observed with traditional drug discovery. A dengue therapeutic or chemoprophylactic agent remains a desirable component of a dengue control package and, given the ongoing expansion of dengue's geographic footprint, both drug development approaches need to be explored.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that lovastatin therapy is safe in adult patients with dengue, although we did not demonstrate a clinical or virological benefit. Although the study findings do not endorse adjunctive statin therapy for dengue, the data provide reassurance to clinicians about the safety of continuing statin therapy in patients who develop dengue. Early diagnosis and recognition of severe features, together with good supportive care, remain central to effective clinical management.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/cid/civ949/-/DC1">Supplementary materials</ext-link> are available at (<uri xlink:href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org">http://cid.oxfordjournals.org</uri>).
