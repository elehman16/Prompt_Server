The duration of the intervention is one school term (&#x02248;4.5&#x02005;months). The primary outcome is the difference between the intervention and the control group in the change in 24&#x02005;h urinary sodium and the secondary outcome is the difference between the intervention and control group in the change of blood pressure.

This approach reaches a wide range of the population from children to adults and could have a greater impact.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Although the study will be carried out in China, the method could be adapted by many other low-income and middle-income countries where the majority of salt in the diet is added by consumers.</p></list-item></list></sec></boxed-text><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD; ie, strokes, heart attacks and heart failure) is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Approximately 80% of CVD deaths occur in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> Raised blood pressure (BP) is a major cause of CVD, accounting for 62% of strokes and 49% of coronary heart disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> Dietary salt intake is the major factor that increases BP and is largely responsible for the rise in BP with age.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> There is compelling evidence in adults that a modest reduction in salt intake lowers BP and reduces cardiovascular risk.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4 R5 R6 R7">4&#x02013;7</xref> Indeed, salt reduction is one of the most cost-effective measures to prevent CVD in high-income as well as LMICs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8 R9 R10">8&#x02013;10</xref></p><p>Although CVD events occur most frequently in middle- and older-age adults and the prevalence of overt hypertension is very low in children, the origins of hypertension and CVD occur in childhood.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> Accordingly, the greatest long-term potential to reduce these conditions is to initiate prevention activities in youth. Such a public&#x000a0;health strategy aimed at preventing or slowing the progression of rising BP altogether would have enormous benefits.</p><p>Several lines of evidence from animal experiments, epidemiological studies and controlled trials demonstrate that salt intake plays an important role in regulating BP in children.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> A meta-analysis of 10 trials in individuals aged 8&#x02013;16&#x02005;years showed that a modest reduction in salt intake for an average duration of 4&#x02005;weeks reduced BP by 1.2/1.3&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg (p&#x0003c;0.001).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> A lower salt diet, if continued, may lessen the subsequent rise in BP with age, which would have major public&#x000a0;health implications in terms of preventing the development of hypertension and CVD later in life. Additionally, recent studies have shown that, in children and adolescents, salt intake is a major determinant of sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption which in turn increases childhood obesity&#x02014;an independent risk factor for raised BP as well as CVD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></p><p>The current salt intake in children in most countries around the world is very high as it is in adults.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> However, there is no strategy on how to keep children on a lower salt intake and there is little data available to formulate the policy and engage key stakeholders. The School-EduSalt (<italic>School</italic>-based <italic>Edu</italic>cation Programme to Reduce <italic>Salt</italic>) study aims to determine whether the school environment can act as a vehicle to lower the salt intake in children and their families. The study will be carried out in Changzhi, Shanxi province in northern China.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Why is this research needed in China?</title><p>China presents a huge opportunity to achieve major health gains from salt reduction because (1) salt intake is very high with an average intake of 14&#x02005;g/day in men and 12&#x02005;g/day in women as measured by 24&#x02005;h urinary sodium excretion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>; (2) the prevalence of hypertension and stroke, both of which are directly related to salt intake, are among the highest in the world. Approximately 177 million people had hypertension in 2002 and raised BP attributed to 2.33 million CVD deaths in 2005.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> These figures are projected to increase rapidly due to the fast economic and epidemiological transition occurring in China; (3) healthcare resources are limited. A reduction in salt intake is highly cost-effective<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>; (4) the major sources of salt in the Chinese diet are salt added by individuals during cooking and in sauces. Therefore, an important strategy to reduce population salt intake is to encourage individuals to reduce the amount of salt used during their own food preparations; (5) salt intake in children is also high. A study in 1986 indicated that salt intake in teenagers was around 10&#x02005;g/day in rural China<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>; (6) China has a one-child policy and the &#x02018;little emperors&#x02019;, as they are often called, have a special power in the family. This provides an excellent opportunity for children to deliver the salt awareness education to and also make a significant impact on their families and (7) school children in China are in a unique position for the proposed research to be carried out because they are more disciplined, cooperative and most likely to comply with the study protocol. Research undertaken in such an environment could provide definitive evidence which would drive the widespread uptake of the intervention strategy nationally as well as internationally.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Addressing system barriers</title><p>In China and many other LMICs, health services are less developed. The healthcare system is very much oriented towards hospital-based care and treatment for individuals who already have medical conditions. Such a system has little capacity for hypertension prevention and control because (1) hypertension is a &#x02018;silent killer&#x02019; and 75% of the Chinese hypertensive individuals are not aware that they have raised BP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> and (2) the majority of the population in China and other LMICs cannot afford life-long BP treatments. While it is important to make health services more affordable and accessible, a strategy targeted at the whole population will have a greater potential. In the School-EduSalt study, we will develop a new approach, that is, through the primary school education system rather than the healthcare system to prevent hypertension. This approach has the following advantages:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Because universal primary education is a common goal in most national education policies, the School-EduSalt approach is likely to have a greater impact compared with the &#x02018;usual&#x02019; healthcare system, which in many LMICs focuses on treatment only.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The School-EduSalt method prevents hypertension from its root, that is, childhood. Therefore, the long-term benefits will be greater than targeting adults alone.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The School-EduSalt approach reaches a wide range of the population from children to adults. Such an approach will have an impact on hypertension prevention and control in the short as well as long term.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Salt substitution versus salt reduction</title><p>In China and many other LMICs, where the majority of dietary salt comes from salt added by consumers themselves, an important public&#x000a0;health approach is to replace the usual salt (ie, sodium chloride) with a salt substitute (ie, low in sodium and high in potassium). Previous studies have shown that such an approach lowers BP and reduces CVD mortality.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> However, it has been realised that salt substitution alone is unlikely to bring the population salt intake down to the recommended level of 6&#x02005;g/day. This is because only &#x02248;30% of the sodium chloride can be replaced with potassium chloride due to the metallic and bitter taste of potassium chloride. In the China Salt Substitute Study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> which is the largest study using a salt substitute, only 25% of sodium chloride was replaced with potassium chloride. In China, salt intake is very high with an average of 12&#x02013;14&#x02005;g/day<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>; in some rural areas of northern China, salt intake can be as high as 18&#x02005;g/day. In order to achieve a substantial reduction in salt intake, salt substitution as well as reduction in the amount of salt used during food preparations is required, and the latter plays a crucial role.</p><p>The School-EduSalt study is to develop a new method to reduce salt intake in children and their families. During the study, we will not provide salt substitute to the participants; however, those in the intervention group will be given the information about the salt substitute and they could purchase it themselves if they wish.</p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>Methods of measuring salt intake</title><p>Several methods have been used in previous studies to assess dietary intake of salt in children as well as adults. These include dietary methods (ie, dietary record, dietary recall, Food Frequency Questionnaires), and urine collections (ie, spot urine, overnight urine and 24&#x02005;h urine).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> Most of these methods are unreliable in estimating salt intake. The dietary methods are well known to underestimate the actual amount of salt consumed, particularly as they do not include the salt added during cooking or at the table. In China, the majority of salt in the diet is added by consumers during cooking or in sauces; therefore, dietary methods are of little use under such circumstances. Among the urine collection methods, 24&#x02005;h urine collection is the most reliable method for estimating salt intake and overnight urine collection is not as accurate as the 24&#x02005;h urine collection, due to the diurnal variation in sodium excretion. Spot urinary sodium has been shown to have a poor agreement with the 24&#x02005;h urinary sodium.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> In our study, we will use 24&#x02005;h urinary sodium to assess salt intake throughout the study. The baseline 24&#x02005;h urinary sodium could provide valuable data on the current salt intake in children and adults.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study hypothesis</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Children's salt intake can be reduced through an education programme.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Children, if taught properly, can deliver the salt reduction message home to their families, therefore the whole family's salt intake can be reduced.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Aim and objectives</title><p>The overall aim of the School-EduSalt study was to develop an innovative, feasible, affordable and sustainable education programme for school children to reduce the dietary intake of salt for children as well as their families. This programme will ultimately prevent or slow the rising BP that accompanies aging and thereby preventing the development of hypertension and CVD. There are four specific objectives:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To develop an education programme for school children to reduce their salt intake.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To empower children to educate their family members, particularly the person who does the cooking, on reducing the amount of salt used at home.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To test whether the education programme can lower salt intake in children and their families by carrying out a cluster randomised controlled trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To implement the education programme nationwide by incorporating it into the national school curriculum, although subsequent funding will be sought for the widespread implementation.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study design</title><p>The study is designed as a cluster randomised controlled trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2013003388F1">figure 1</xref>). A total of 28 primary schools in urban Changzhi will be recruited into the study. The reason for excluding rural schools is to avoid contamination from school meals because some children in rural schools have lunch and dinner at school due to the long distance of their home from school, whereas in urban schools most children have lunch as well as dinner at home.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2013003388F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Summary of the <italic>School</italic>-based <italic>Edu</italic>cation Programme to Reduce <italic>Salt</italic> trial design.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2013003388f01"/></fig><p>Following baseline assessments, schools will be randomised to either the intervention or control group. The salt reduction education programme will be implemented in the intervention group. The duration of the intervention is one school term (&#x02248;4.5&#x02005;months).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Participants and recruitment</title><p>In primary schools in Changzhi, there are six grades in total, with age ranging from 7 to 12&#x02005;years. For practical reasons, the School-EduSalt study will be carried out in grade 5 children (age &#x02248;11&#x02005;years). It is considered that younger children may not be able to deliver the salt awareness education to their families and children in grade 6 are usually very busy with their final year examinations before entering high schools.</p><p>In total, there are 36 primary schools in urban Changzhi, among which three are special Muslim schools and will be excluded. Among the remaining 33 schools, we will recruit 28 schools whose headteachers agreed to take part in the study. To recruit schools, we will first contact the local education authority (ie, Changzhi Education Bureau) to gain their opinion, support and approval. The Changzhi Education Bureau will then send a letter to the headteachers of the schools encouraging them to take part in this project. Our research team members will then contact the headteachers asking for their participation in the study.</p><p>In most schools, there are more than one class in grade 5. In such schools, one class will be selected. We will discuss with the headteacher to choose a class whose teacher in charge is willing to collaborate with the researchers. From each class, we will randomly select 10 children for evaluation. Therefore, a total of 280 children from 28 schools will be recruited into the study for evaluation. Additionally, adult family members will be invited to take part in the study. We will recruit two adult members from each child's family, for example, grandparents, parents, uncles and aunties, who live and have meals at the child's home.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Inclusion/exclusion criteria</title><p>All children in grade 5 are eligible for the study; however, children who do not have lunch or dinner at their own home or who live far from the school (&#x0003e;3&#x02005;km) will be excluded. All adult family members who share the same meals with the child are eligible for the study. If more than two adults in one family agree to take part in the study, we will select two of them (ie, one man and one woman) in the order of grandparents, parents, uncles and aunties.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Randomisation procedures</title><p>Randomisation will be stratified by the level of schools (ie, belonging to city or district government) and the size of class. Among the schools in urban Changzhi, the size of the class varies from 13 children/class to &#x02248;80 children/class. Usually, a larger class size indicates that the school is at the upper level of the league table&#x000a0;in terms of examination results. Therefore, parents are more likely to send their child to such schools. Randomisation will be carried out using a computer-generated random number system by a researcher who is not involved in the study and is blind to the identity of the schools.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Intervention description</title><p>Our target is to lower salt intake by a minimum of 20% for children as well as their families. The intervention will be delivered to the whole class in spite of only 10 children being selected for evaluation. The salt reduction education includes two main components.</p><p><italic>Classroom component:</italic> Children will be educated at 2-week intervals throughout the study. Education curriculum and materials will be developed around the following &#x02018;key messages&#x02019;: (1) harms of salt&#x02014;&#x02018;More salt, less health; less salt, more health&#x02019;; (2) recommended salt intake&#x02014;&#x02019;Less than 6&#x02005;g/day&#x02019; and (3) methods of reducing salt intake&#x02014;&#x02018;Add less salt in cooking and eat less pickles&#x02019;. Our slogan is &#x02018;Small hands leading big hands, together let&#x02019;s reduce salt&#x02019;.</p><p>Lessons will support other classroom disciplines and activities, and resources provided will be mapped to complement activities in the curriculum, in particular, health education lessons. Materials will be designed to provide a low-cost and sustainable intervention that could ultimately be used as a resource for teachers in the future. The material will consist of lesson plans, activity worksheets and homework assignments. Other teaching methods to engage students will include demonstrations, food-preparation activities, case studies and group projects. Programme materials will be developed around cartoon characters. Role plays and student presentations will be some of the activities included. Children will be encouraged to express their own ideas and initiatives on how to cut down the amount of salt. They will be invited to design their own programmes for their family. Essay competitions on salt or drawing competitions are other ways to actively involve children. Each lesson will build on what has been taught in the previous lessons to ensure that there is a clear progression in learning and understanding.</p><p>School teachers will be involved in all activities. They will coordinate all events and check students&#x02019; homework. Posters will be put up in the classroom.</p><p><italic>Family component:</italic> Children will be empowered to persuade their family members, particularly the person who does the cooking and prepares food, to reduce the amount of salt used at home. Additionally, there needs to be a significant reduction in the amount of soy sauce and bean paste used, as well as a reduction in the consumption of pickles, salted eggs, salted peanuts, etc. Garlic, ginger and herbs will be recommended for enhancing food flavour. We will recommend replacing pickles with fresh vegetables, and replacing salted eggs and peanuts with unsalted ones. We will encourage participants to replace the usual salt with a mineral salt which is low in sodium and high in potassium. However, the important message is to reduce the total amount of salt used even with a salt substitute.</p><p>In view of the fact that the prevalence of stroke is very high in northern China and many people have witnessed the debilitating impact of a stroke on individuals and their families, our education materials will emphasise the effect of salt on stroke. For parents and grandparents, we will use their special love towards the only child in the family to persuade them to reduce the amount of salt used at home. The key message is &#x02018;Do you know children who have high salt intake are more likely to develop hypertension and stroke when they grow up?&#x02019;</p><p>To engage the family, some school activities will be organised with the family as a unit. Additionally, parents will be provided with educational materials in the form of a newsletter on a bi-weekly basis. The newsletter will cover topics such as salt and its effect on BP and CVD (particularly stroke), the major sources of salt in the diet and cooking with reduced salt. The newsletter will also have a question and answer column and a family quiz. Homework set for the students will be related to the newsletter.</p><sec id="s2g1"><title>Salt reduction target&#x02014;minimum reduction 20%</title><p>To reduce salt intake from the current level of 12&#x02013;14&#x02005;g/day<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> to the recommended 6&#x02005;g/day, it is essential to implement a step-wise reduction in the amount of salt used, that is, 10&#x02013;20% reduction and repeated at 1-year to 2-year intervals.

The approach of using the primary school education system rather than the healthcare system has the potential to achieve the greatest long-term benefit as it prevents hypertension from its roots (ie, starting from childhood). Although the study will be carried out in China, the method could be adapted by many other LMICs where the majority of salt in the diet is added by consumers. A modest reduction in salt intake across the whole population even by a small amount could have major beneficial effects on health along with major cost-savings.</p><p>It is important that the reduction in salt intake achieved during the trial is sustained over the years after the study. Furthermore, our ultimate aim is to incorporate the education programme into the national school curriculum which all schools will follow. A key to success for such a large-scale implementation is to monitor the progress. Repeated measurements of 24&#x02005;h urinary sodium at 3-year to 4-year interval are essential to this process. Further funding will be sought for the widespread implementation and for the monitoring programme.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e335" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-003388.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We acknowledge the independent supervision provided by the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) which is comprised of the independent Chairman (Peter Sever) and members (Francesco Cappuccio, Kiang Liu, Dong Zhao) and three investigators (Feng He, Yangfeng Wu and Graham MacGregor).</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> FJH, YW and GAM conceived the project and designed the study.
