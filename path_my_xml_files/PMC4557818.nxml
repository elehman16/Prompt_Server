The rationale for monitoring fidelity is to address the methodological strategies used to monitor and enhance reliability and validity of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Moreover, fidelity speaks to the degree of integrity of an intervention. Ensuring treatment fidelity gives researchers more confidence in their results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and increases credibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], particularly in trials conducted in community settings where there are diverse settings, therapists, and patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Lack of fidelity refers to any gap between the intervention as it was planned and the intervention as it was actually implemented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. If a treatment was not given completely as designed and statistical effects of the treatment are non-significant, then the treatment may be discarded prematurely. Indeed, higher treatment fidelity has been linked to improved outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. If significant effects were found, but fidelity was not monitored, then it is unclear whether the difference was due to the intervention itself or to something else [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Fidelity measures can be monitored and included in statistical analysis (e.g., the number of times an individual subject was reached on the phone to assess the implementation of a phone intervention) and therefore increase knowledge about how the components of an intervention influence the outcome. Finally, the assessment of treatment fidelity serves to identify barriers to implementation that need to be addressed and modified in order to ensure that the intervention has a greater chance of sustainability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The five main components of fidelity monitoring are well established and include study <italic>design, training, delivery, receipt, and enactment</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Study <italic>design</italic> monitoring includes consideration on whether or not the intervention is sufficiently <italic>differentiated</italic> from the control group (avoidance of cross-contamination). Standardized <italic>trainings</italic> of providers/interventionists support standardized treatment delivery. In addition, monitoring and maintaining provider skills over time is a necessity. Treatment <italic>delivery</italic> measures whether or not the treatment was delivered as intended. Treatment <italic>receipt</italic> measures whether or not the participant understands the intervention and indicates confidence and ability to apply the skills learned in the intervention. Treatment <italic>enactment</italic> measures whether or not the participant participated in the intervention.</p><p>While many studies have been published on the importance of fidelity monitoring and some have published results from their own studies, no papers that we know of have published approaches to fidelity monitoring across several smoking cessation studies. Hence, this paper will describe the methods of fidelity monitoring and provide fidelity data across seven studies that were funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to disseminate unique smoking cessation interventions to hospitalized smokers. Since fidelity influences both the degree to which changes can be attributed to the intervention (internal validity), and the ability to replicate and disseminate the intervention (external validity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], the assessment of treatment fidelity across the seven studies may be useful to researchers conducting smoking cessation and other behavioral intervention trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Collectively called the Consortium of Hospitals Advancing Research on Tobacco (CHART), these studies conducted between 2010 and 2014 recruited over 9500 inpatient cigarette smokers to test the effectiveness of these unique smoking cessation interventions. The protocols of these seven studies have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and outcome papers will follow. All of the CHART studies implemented the components of smoking cessation interventions shown to be efficacious in Cochrane Collaborative Reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] including medication and behavioral counseling and follow-up calls. Although usual care varied across the seven studies, all of the CHART studies compared their unique treatment arm(s) to usual care and used common core measures at the baseline and 6-month follow-up. However, each study was unique in how fidelity was monitored. A brief overview of each study design follows.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>University of Michigan Medical Center (UMMC)</title><p>The Tobacco Tactics study used a quasi-experimental design in five Michigan Trinity Health System Hospitals. Nurses in three experimental hospitals were taught to conduct the in-hospital, face-to-face Tobacco Tactics intervention in a 1-h educational session using the Tobacco Tactics toolkit. Nurses in the other two hospitals continued usual care (brief advice and brochure). Nurses and inpatient smokers (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1528) regardless of motivation to quit in both the experimental and control sites were surveyed pre- and post-implementation of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>University of California, San Diego (UCSD)</title><p>In this 2 by 2 factorial randomized controlled trial (RCT), 1270 inpatient smokers motivated to quit from three healthcare systems (a total of 5 hospitals) in San Diego and Davis, CA were randomized to one of four conditions: 1) usual care; 2) nicotine patches provided at the time of discharge; 3) telephone counseling after discharge and; 4) nicotine patches at discharge plus telephone counseling after discharge. Six standard counseling sessions were proactively provided by the state quitline post discharge.

Counselors provided brief cessation advice to all patients and provided them with a standard smoking cessation booklet. In the warm hand-off intervention condition, patients received an abbreviated bedside intervention and the counselor called the quit line and transferred the call to the patient&#x02019;s bedside hospital phone or mobile phone before leaving. In the control condition, fax-referral patients received the usual care cessation counseling and were fax referred to the quitline. Outcome data collected from the state quit line provider, Alere Well Being (AWB), included enrollment and number of calls completed out of a total of 5 intervention calls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>New York University (NYU)</title><p>This RCT compared two methods of smoking cessation delivered to all inpatient smokers regardless of motivation to quit discharged from two urban public hospitals in New York City (Bellevue and the Manhattan VA): 1) seven sessions of proactive telephone counseling delivered by study staff; or 2) referral to the New York State Quitline via fax or online referral (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;805).

Among the 597 study participants who were randomized to the AR&#x02009;+&#x02009;IVR group, nearly all participants received nicotine withdrawal counseling, discussed tobacco use and quit history, were assessed for medication contraindications, discussed available quit services, and were provided printed quit materials (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). Patients randomized to the AR&#x02009;+&#x02009;IVR group were offered a referral to centralized counseling services or a faxed referral to the quitline. Overall, 57&#x000a0;% accepted AR, 43&#x000a0;% accepted discharge medications, and 28&#x000a0;% accepted both. In one hospital, patients were less likely to accept the AR than another hospital, but more likely to accept medications and both counseling and medications (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001). Patients&#x02019; primary care providers were notified 76&#x000a0;% of the time, with nearly all providers notified in one hospital and less than half notified in another. About half of the intervention recipients completed call 1, and completion rates fell for each subsequent call.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH)</title><p>Treatment <italic>delivery</italic> and <italic>enactment</italic> were both monitored by tracking acceptance and participation in treatment components among 529 intervention participants (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>). In terms of treatment <italic>delivery</italic>, all 529 participants received one month of free medication at the time of hospital discharge, although only 51&#x000a0;% requested the 2nd month of medication (1st refill) and only 19&#x000a0;% requested the 3rd (2nd refill). All were enrolled into the TelASK IVR database and were called after hospital discharge and almost 9 out of 10 (88&#x000a0;%) accepted at least 1 IVR call. Success of transfer from the IVR call to counseling was also monitored. In the first two months of the study, 33&#x000a0;% of calls were dropped, in part due to participants hanging up prior to transfer completion. After adjustment that included reduced wait time and a recorded message to remain on the line, the IVR-to-counselor successful transfer rate increased and held steady reflecting a successful transfer in 83&#x000a0;% of patients requesting transfer to AWI. In terms of treatment <italic>enactment</italic>, about one-third of those who accepted at least one TelASK IVR call enrolled in telephone counseling through AWI, with 20&#x000a0;% completing all 5 outgoing counselor calls.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec19"><title><italic>Study design</italic> and <italic>training</italic></title><p>There was little reported cross-contamination among the study arms. Quasi-experimental studies, such as the UMMC study can prevent intervention drift as they allow for greater separation of groups or treatment <italic>differentiation</italic>. UCSD and KU had fidelity measures of the usual care arm, which can measure treatment <italic>differentiation</italic> between arms. <italic>Training</italic> was universally applied across all of the studies and can be enhanced by developing manuals and/or toolkits for providers and patients as was done in the UMMC and NYU studies. <italic>Training</italic> enhances standardization across intervention activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and reduces the risk of variation in strength and elements of intervention provided. <italic>Training</italic> increases competence, self-efficacy, and confidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Delivery/Receipt/ Enactment</title><p>Once <italic>training</italic> is complete, continued monitoring is necessary. Four of the studies (UMMC, KU, and NYU, KPCHR) used a checklist to monitor interventionists, but the items varied widely. The KU checklist (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) was largely based on specific components of their unique intervention. The UMMC checklist (see <xref rid="Sec23" ref-type="sec">Appendix&#x000a0;1</xref>) was based on Joint Commission (JC) standards for inpatient smoking cessation interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and this approach can directly translate into quality assurance. The KPCHR checklist (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>) was designed to capture key elements of the US Public Health Service [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and JC standards for smoking cessation. The NYU checklist (see <xref rid="Sec25" ref-type="sec">Appendix&#x000a0;2</xref>) was based largely on the relationship the counselor built with the patient, which is important as differences in warmth and ease, interactional style, and therapist empathy and self- efficacy can represent serious threats to fidelity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p><italic>Delivery</italic> of medications ranged from 31 to 100&#x000a0;% across the studies, with higher levels coming from those studies that gave away free medications (UCSD and MGH) and lower levels coming from those studies that sought to obtain prescriptions for the patient in real world systems (NYU). <italic>Delivery</italic> of counseling was highest among those studies that used automated systems (websites and IVR systems) such as UAB, KPCHR, and MGH, but this did not automatically translate into treatment <italic>receipt and enactment</italic>. In the KU study, warm hand-off versus fax referral did increase enrollment in the quitline. In the UAB study most participants in the intervention arm accessed the website, but only about one-quarter participated in email communication.</p><p>Some studies measured treatment <italic>enactment</italic> in two ways showing concurrence or discordance between the two measures. In the NYU study, patient reports of participating in phone calls were only slightly lower than those reported by counselors. In the UAB study, the website reported fewer logins than a subset of patients self-reported, perhaps due to social desirability or recall bias, as patients were surveyed 6&#x000a0;months after discharge. Automated systems, such as the IVR, telephone, and website systems used in the KU, UAB, KPCHR, and MGH studies provide easily available fidelity data. Yet, automated data may not identify qualitative issues identified in observations of and surveys/interviews with interventionists and patients as done in the UMMC, KU, NYU, KPCHR, and other similar studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Unlike data from automated systems, qualitative data can provide rich information about barriers and facilitators to implementation.</p><p>In summary, all sites monitored their intervention and study fidelity, in particular how they differentiated between study arms, what training was provided and who engaged in it, what was delivered and to whom/how much, and to a lesser extent, intervention receipt and enactment by participants. Using these 5-categories as a guide, the studies all achieved monitoring of each aspect, to greater and lesser degrees as fit their programs. These examples may help other researchers in developing their own fidelity monitoring plans by identifying similar structural components and the methods for those components described herein.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Challenges of fidelity monitoring</title><p>Recording treatment sessions and then having two observers rate fidelity is considered the gold standard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], but can be very time consuming and costly, especially in dissemination trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Some might argue that fidelity monitoring fundamentally changes the intervention itself in that the fidelity assurance process serves as a reminder that would otherwise not exist. If the fidelity assessment must be viewed as part of the intervention, the validity of the intervention is challenged when it is conducted without fidelity checks once the research has been concluded and the intervention continues to be usual care.</p><p>Rigid application of treatment protocols may impede treatment delivery. The therapists may feel &#x0201c;locked in&#x0201d; or resistant to &#x0201c;cookbook&#x0201d; approach. Fidelity arguably does not allow the provider to tailor the intervention to the patient&#x02019;s needs. For example, treatment fidelity may interfere with sound clinical judgment when shorter sessions or cultural adaptations to a treatment protocol are warranted. It may be a challenge to implement rigid protocols for smoking cessation in busy inpatient settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>While modifying an intervention presents a challenge to fidelity measurement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], a realistic and sustainable intervention may need to allow for adaptation and modification. Some studies make adaptability under certain circumstances a requirement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. While some researchers question that adaptations retain efficacy/effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], fidelity checks can be used to empower the stakeholders to actively participate in the process of adaptation. Finding the optimal balance between fidelity and adaptation requires a treatment design that allows for modifications and also calls for competence among interventionists to make appropriate treatment decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Despite the challenges of measuring fidelity, the seven CHART studies used a variety of methods to enhance fidelity with the goal of ensuring the accurate delivery of smoking interventions with consideration for feasibility and sustainability. The examples provided can be used to guide future studies. Some of the strategies to address fidelity may be more adaptable to certain types of trials and matching monitoring methods to study design and program deliverables will facilitate appropriate fidelity tracking. For example, direct observation may work best in RCTs where there are few interventionists, whereas direct observation is more difficult in large implementation trials that could instead use provider surveys. Researchers may determine which of the studies described is similar to their own and consider measuring fidelity in similar ways. The strengths, limitations, potential need for adaptation, and costs of fidelity monitoring need to be taken into consideration when designing and implementing clinical trials.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec23"><title>Appendix 1</title><sec id="Sec24"><title>(UMMC): Fidelity Nurse Interview Guide</title><p><bold>DURING HOSPITAL STAY:</bold></p><p><bold>Patient was asked about tobacco use.</bold></p><p><bold>Smoking status was documented.</bold></p><p>For patients, who are current tobacco users OR quit within the last 12&#x000a0;months:</p><p><bold>PATIENT WAS OFFERED COUNSELING DURING HOSPITAL STAY.</bold></p><p>Quit Smoking brochure was provided.</p><p><bold>PATIENT RECIEVED COUNSELING.</bold></p><p>Behavioral coments:</p><p>Advised the patient to set a quit date, ideally within 2&#x000a0;weeks</p><p>Advised the patient to remove all tobacco products from home and at work.</p><p>Discussed potential challenges to quitting, staying off tobacco, and planning ahead on how to deal with the challenges.</p><p>Provided the patient with strong messages of support and encouragement,</p><p>Stop Smoking videotape was provided.</p><p>Tobacco Tactics workbook was provided.</p><p><bold>Information about FDA-approved cessation medication was provided.</bold></p><p><bold>AT DISCHARGE:</bold></p><p><bold>Patient was offered referral to outpatient counseling.</bold></p><p><bold>Patient recieved referral to outpatient counseling.</bold></p><p><bold>Patient was offered prescription for FDA-approved cessation medication.</bold></p><p><bold>Patient received prescription for FDA-approved cessation medication.</bold></p><p><bold>Bolded items are Joint Commision standards.</bold></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Appendix 2</title><p><table-wrap id="Tab8"><label>Table 8</label><caption><p>(NYU): fidelity counseling audio review form</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2"/><th>Date:</th><th colspan="3">Study ID#:</th></tr><tr><th colspan="4">TTS:</th></tr><tr><th rowspan="3"/><th>Fidelity Rater:</th><th colspan="3">Length of session: minutes</th></tr><tr><th colspan="4">Counseling Session:</th></tr><tr><th colspan="4">1&#x02009;=&#x02009;1st call&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003;2&#x02009;=&#x02009;Counseling&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003;3&#x02009;=&#x02009;Post-Quit</th></tr><tr><th>DOMAINS</th><th>N/A</th><th>Did not do</th><th>OK</th><th>Did well</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1.
