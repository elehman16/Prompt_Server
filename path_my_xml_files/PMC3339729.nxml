Ethical clearance was obtained from the Institutional Ethical Committee. Seventy four patients undergoing tooth extraction were recruited according to the inclusion and exclusion criterion. They were divided into six groups, i.e., to receive tramadol, ketorolac, or placebo pre or postoperatively. Patients with history of acid&#x02013;peptic diseases, hemorrhagic diathesis, known hypersensitivity of NSAIDs or tramadol, and epileptic patients were excluded. A total of 74 patients were recruited during the study, 25 each in the tramadol and ketorolac groups and 24 in the placebo group.</p><p>Both the investigator and patient were blind. Random allocation of groups was done using computer-generated random numbers. Each drug was coded and packed into identical appearing packets, with only the patient number and whether to be given pre- or postoperatively indicated on the label. Drugs were given by the dental surgeon per orally (PO) as per <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Analgesic drugs administration protocol</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOACP-28-221-g001"/></table-wrap><p>A verbal rating scale (VRS) was chosen to grade pain for this study because it is very reliable and easy to administer. The first assessment of the pain intensity/relief was done half an hour after the end of the procedure. The 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, and 4<sup>th</sup> assessments done at 2, 4, and 6 h postextraction. We devised a modified VRS for grading pain, taking into consideration the use of a rescue analgesic (ibuprofen 400 mg), and it is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Modified verbal rating scale used</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOACP-28-221-g002"/></table-wrap><p>As placebo is included in this study, it was ethically incorrect not to include the rescue analgesic. Ibuprofen is NSAID with good anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity. It is one of the most commonly used analgesics for dental pain. Therefore, we included ibuprofen as the rescue analgesic in our study. Patients from placebo group were given rescue analgesic when pain becomes intolerant.</p><p>Pain scores of patients receiving same drug preoperatively or postoperatively as well as other drug groups were compared using Mann-Whitney's U test. Age of patients, the amount of rescue medication taken, and time after extraction when rescue medication was taken were compared by ANOVA followed by post-hoc Dunnett's T3 test. Number of males and females in different groups were compared by Chi-square test, <italic>P</italic> value. Adverse effects were compared using Chi-square test or Fischer's exact test as appropriate.

The mean age of the patients in the study was 31.57 years, ranging from 18&#x02013;65 years, with 92% of the patients in the 25&#x02013;45 year age group. Prior to surgery local anesthetic (2% lignocaine) was injected to all patients. The mean dose of the local anesthetic was 2.4 ml ranging from 2 to 8 ml. All except three patients (4%) had antibiotic coverage prior to surgery. The mean duration of the procedure was 15.93 min, ranging from 2 to 70 min. For 59 patients (78%) it took less than 20 min for the completion of the procedure. For two patients (1.5%), it took 70 min. The indications for the third molar extractions were impacted teeth, infected teeth, or both. One patient had a tongue ulcer for which the extraction was indicated. Of the 74 patients, 51 patients (69%) had impacted teeth, 7 patients (9.5%) had infected teeth, and 16 patients (21.5%) had both. All except three (4%) were lower molar extractions. All the six patients group were similar in terms of gender distribution, average age, the amount of local anesthetic administered, the antibiotic coverage given, the position of the molar extracted, and the duration of the procedure.</p><p>The results of the analysis of the primary end point namely mean pain scores show that the analgesics (ketorolac and tramadol) were more efficacious in reducing the pain as compared to placebo [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Mean combined pain score for tramadol plus ketorolac versus placebo at 30 min was 1.261 and 1.312, respectively, and at 6 h was 2.132 and 2.884, respectively. When the pain scores of analgesic group were compared against those of the placebo group separately, the analgesic group was found to have lower maximum pain scores at each time point as compared to placebo, indicating that the analgesics were superior to placebo in producing pain relief.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Change in mean pain scores (preoperative and the postoperative group combined) for Tramadol, Ketorolac and Placebo over the 6 hour study period.

When tramadol was compared with placebo (both preoperative and postoperative), the analgesic group needed less rescue drug than the placebo group. The average time taken by the patient from the start of the procedure to the time when pain was severe enough for the patient to feel the need to self administer the rescue analgesic was more in the tramadol than in the placebo group, which indicates that more prolonged pain relief was seen in the analgesic group as compared to those receiving placebo (meantime for rescue analgesic in the tramadol and ketorolac group &#x02013; 366 min, in the placebo group &#x02013; 240 min [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>].

Two patients in the ketorolac group and one patient in the tramadol group felt nausea/vomiting. One patient in the placebo group complained of tingling sensation. Comparison of adverse effect reportage of tramadol versus placebo groups showed that tramadol was significantly more likely to produce adverse effects compared to placebo.

It is routinely treated with NSAIDs for 2&#x02013;3 days. NSAID's are known to produce side effects such as gastric irritation leading to ulceration and bleeding disorders. Despite the inflammatory component, one of the drugs used in this study was a non-NSAID, so that the side effects produced by the anti-inflammatory analgesics could be avoided. The analgesic efficacy of non-NSAIDs versus NSAID's to placebo was compared in this study. We also attempted to compare the adverse effects of non-NSAID and NSAID with placebo, when given as single dose. Another aspect, which was looked at in this study, was pre-empting the expected pain by preoperative administration versus countering pain after it sets in by postoperative administration.</p><p>This study has succeeded in demonstrating the analgesic efficacy of single oral doses of either tramadol or ketorolac for impacted third molar extraction with an acceptable incidence and severity of side effects, over the first 6 h following extraction. There was no significant difference between the analgesic efficacy of tramadol and ketorolac. The pre- and postoperative administration of ketorolac was found to be equally effective in controlling dental pain. Tramadol was found to be more effective postoperatively than preoperatively.</p><p>We looked at whether there is any need for analgesics for postextraction pain as the patient is already receiving a local anesthetic prior to surgery and found that a significant proportion of patients do experience pain severe enough to require analgesics. Single dose of either tramadol or ketorolac was more efficient than placebo in relieving pain, over the first 6 h. Other studies corroborate this finding.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Keeping the concept of pre-emptive analgesia in mind, we expected preoperative administration of analgesics to be more efficacious in relieving the pain than postoperative administration. Our results show that postoperative administration of tramadol appears to be more efficacious than preoperative administration in terms of pain relief. Analgesic effect of tramadol begins within 1 h and reaches a peak in approximately 2&#x02013;3 h.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] It is likely that the postextraction pain reaches a peak in the first 2&#x02013;4 h.</p><p>Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of most administered drugs are time dependent. Opioid activity of tramadol is due to both low-affinity binding of the parent compound and higher affinity binding of the O-demethylated metabolite to opioid receptors. As it is extensively metabolized by a number of pathways, the bioavailability of the active metabolite is high. It has a quick onset of action. The analgesic effect of tramadol begins within 1 h and reaches a peak in approximately 2&#x02013;3 h. Though tramadol was given preoperatively with the idea of preempting the expected pain, it appears that it was given too early to be of any benefit and the peak analgesic effect and the time of maximum pain after tooth extraction may not have coincided with each other.</p><p>Even though the preoperative administration of ketorolac was found to be effective, it was not significantly better than postoperative administration. Ketorolac inhibits the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase, thereby inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins, which is a mediator of inflammation and pain. It is a potent NSAID with a plasma half-life of approximately 4.5&#x02013;5.5 h.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] The dose of ketorolac (20 mg) administered in this study was possibly not enough to preempt the pain produce by third molar extraction or that the time of administration was too close to the extraction for the drug to produce any effect. Third molar extraction produces a fair amount of injury to the surrounding tissue, leading to release of arachidonic acid, which is converted into prostaglandin by cyclo-oxygenase. Inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase even before the release of arachidonic acid from injured tissue ensures that the synthesis of prostaglandins is blocked and pain and inflammation is preempted. Sufficient residual pain remains despite adequate local anesthesia.</p><p>Tramadol being an Opioid and norepinephrine modulator, more central nervous system-related side effects as expected was found as six patients is tramadol group had CNS-related side effects and none in placebo group reported. Comparison of tramadol and ketorolac did not show any significant difference in side effect reportage; however, the organ system affected differed in each case. Ketorolac has been reported to produce nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, peptic ulceration, and prolongation of bleeding time, whereas tramadol effects on the gastrointestinal tract are fairly minor and its CNS effects are more prominent. Some of the reported side effects include anxiety, confusion, euphoria, sleep disorders, visual disturbance, and dependence.</p><p>Pain assessment using a VRS was appropriate for this study. Some studies assessed the utility of 10 indices (including the verbal rating scale) in the subjective experience of acute pain.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] The results indicated that each of the measures of pain intensity is adequately valid. In other studies,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] it has been observed that pain intensity is a relatively easy dimension of pain experience for patients to report, most self-report measures of pain intensity are strongly related to one another, and so can probably be used interchangeably in many situations.</p><p>As telephonic interviews were needed for the assessment of postoperative pain, patient not accessible by telephone were not included in the study. The fact that this was a single-dose study and pain was assessed only over the first 6 h was another limitation. Ideally, the duration of a study for assessing the analgesic efficacy of drugs is postextraction pain, which should be for a period of 2&#x02013;3 days, with multiple dosing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study demonstrated that postoperative administration of tramadol is equally effective as traditional NSAID's in relieving pain in the first 6 h after molar extraction, and therefore, it can be tried in patients who are intolerant to NSAIDs. A firm conclusion regarding the time of intervention (i.e., pre and postextraction) for optimal pain control is a point for clarification and needs further analysis.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sharav</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Wall</surname><given-names>PD</given-names></name><name><surname>Melzack</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Oral facial pain</article-title><source>Text Book of Pain</source><year>1999</year><edition>2nd ed</edition><publisher-loc>New York</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Churchill Livingston</publisher-name><fpage>712</fpage><lpage>3</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Alling</surname><given-names>CC</given-names><suffix>3rd</suffix></name><name><surname>Alling</surname><given-names>RD</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Alling</surname><given-names>CC</given-names><suffix>3rd</suffix></name><name><surname>Helfrick</surname><given-names>JF</given-names></name><name><surname>Alling</surname><given-names>RD</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Indications for management of impacted teeth</article-title><source>Impacted teeth</source><year>1993</year><publisher-loc>Philadelphia</publisher-loc><publisher-name>W.
