society. Sixty to eighty percent of the population experience low back pain at least once in
their lifetime and most of them are treated successfully. However, 5 to 15% of patients
suffer continuous pain without full relief from treatment. Low back pain refers to all kinds
of pain occurring in the lumbar region, and those in their 20s to 50s suffer the most from
low back pain, and it persists for a long time with those who are aged<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The most important symptom of low back pain patients is pain. Pain is a complex and
multi-faceted phenomenon which is a unique individual experience that is difficult for
patients to explain or describe, and therefore it is not easy for others to recognize,
understand, or correct. Pain is defined as responses which protect the body from painful
sensations, harmful stimuli that inform about damage to the tissues, or imminent tissue
damage or harm. For lumbar pain patients, the management of pain is considered more
important than other elements and is the purpose for treatment<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The causes of low back pain are diverse. It is affected by many aspects in the physical,
social, and psychological domains. It may be caused by lesions or trauma of the spinal cord
or the area around it, degenerative changes in an intervertebral disc, abnormality in the
internal organs, or psychoneural problems. The symptoms of low back pain include sensory
anomaly, radiating pain in the lower extremities, pain during rest or exercise, a decrease
in muscle strength or range of motion, and asymmetry between the left and the right
sides<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, the transversus
abdominis and multifidus muscles of chronic low back pain patients are activated later than
those of healthy people, have slower response speeds, and undergo more serious atrophy than
other muscles. Atrophy of the trunk muscles, such as the internal oblique, external oblique,
transversus abdominis, and multifidus, makes the lumbar spine and the pelvis unstable and is
known to be a major cause of chronic pain<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Lumbar stabilization exercises increase the stability of the spine and pelvis during
functional positions and movements, restore the adjustment ability of the muscles as well as
movement and balance, and improves the trunk and the deep muscles, promoting health, and is
used in rehabilitation exercises for patients and training exercises for athletes<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, lumbar stabilization exercises
need a visit to a hospital and the instruction and assistance of a therapist, and it is
difficult for patients to conduct stabilization exercises themselves. In order to address
these limitations, patients&#x02019; use of assistive devices during ordinary life is currently on
the rise.</p><p>The use of an assistive device is an essential element of a disabled person&#x02019;s activities of
daily living and social activities, and is a crucial means of maintaining the disabled
person&#x02019;s physical functions<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. For low back
pain patients, assistive devices that provide stability to the lumbar region by pressing the
lumbar spine and the pelvic area are widely used. However, lumbar assistive devices are
mostly worn over clothing and are visible to others, which most patients do not like, and
wearing an assistive device incorrectly for a long time may lead to little or no use of the
muscles around the lumbar spine, leading to muscle atrophy. Accordingly, this study examined
the effect on low back pain patients&#x02019; pain and functionality of a lumbar stabilization
exercise performed with an oral assistive device, which can replace a lumbar assistive
device.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The subjects of this study were patients who had been diagnosed with chronic pain and had
been hospitalized or had visited a hospital for physical therapy. They were able to answer
the questionnaire and understood the purpose of this study. The total number of subjects
was 24. The experimental group (n=12) performed a stabilization exercise using an oral
assistive device after conventional physical therapy. The control group (n=12) received
conventional physical therapy: a hot pack for 20 minutes, ultrasound treatment for 5
minutes, and low frequency TENS treatment for 20 minutes. The experimental group performed
exercise using an assistive device 3 times per week for 4 weeks, a total of 12 times.
Evaluations of the patients&#x02019; pain and functionality were conducted prior to the experiment
and after the last exercise session.</p><p>Patients with the following conditions were excluded: acute and sub-acute states of low
back pain within three months after low back pain occurrence; hypertension; angina
pectoris; neurological diseases, such as stroke or Parkinson&#x02019;s disease; cognitive or
psychiatric disorders; spinal fractures or tumors; knee arthritis surgery and complex
diseases other than low back pain. All the subjects understood the purpose of this study
and provided their written informed consent prior to their participation, in accordance
with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics of subjects (Mean&#x000b1;SD)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experimental group<break/>(n=12)</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group<break/>(n=12)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (yrs)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">58.2&#x000b1;5.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">59.6&#x000b1;6.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">154.5&#x000b1;8.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">153.3&#x000b1;9.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">53.9&#x000b1;5.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">54.3&#x000b1;5.5</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In order to objectively measure pain in this study, a visual analog scale (VAS) was used.
The reliability of the VAS has been reported to be 0.89. The VAS was made from a scale
with a height of 5&#x02005;mm and a length of 100&#x02005;mm. Zero on the scale indicates a pain-free
condition, and the most severe pain imaginable is scored as 100. In order to evaluate the
subjects&#x02019; functional aspects while living with low back pain, the Oswestry Disability
Index (ODI) was used. The ODI is composed of 10 items related to each activity of daily
living and its reliability has been reported to be 0.92. It consists of six rating levels
from zero to five points, and the total score is divided by the number of items answered
and multiplied by 100. The lower the score, the smaller the functional disability of the
lumbar region.</p><p>The subjects performed a stabilization exercise using an oral assistive device
(Selfface22, G&#x00026;G Beauty+, Korea). To use Selfface22, the subjects were asked to lock
their fingers together naturally, and the hand whose thumb was located above the other
thumb was identified. When the left thumb was above, the letters A and B on the product
were positioned on the left side and the subjects held it in their mouths. When the right
hand was above, the alphabet of the product A and B were situated on the right side and
the subject held it with the mouth. The locations of the lips and mouth were corrected for
the precise application of Selfface22 according to the location of the thumb.</p><p>The subjects lay in a supine position, with Selfface22 in the mouth. The upper teeth were
fixed with the fingers and the product was softly bitten with the lower teeth. Pressing
their lips together and closing their mouths, the subjects gripped the Selfface22 and were
instructed to block the hole in the middle of the product with their tongues and suck it.
The subjects sucked it as hard as possible and held their breath for 10 seconds, breathed
out, and rested for 10 seconds. In addition, in order to promote thoracic respiration,
when they sucked the product as hard as possible, they were instructed to suck the product
while raising their chests upward. The patients performed 30 trials, with 10 trials in one
set, resting for three minutes between each set. To ensure the proper use of the
Selfface22 and the stabilization exercise, the exercise was conducted under the
supervision of the therapist for the first week. When a subject incorrectly performed the
exercise or compensation in another area occurred, instruction and retraining were given.
Subjects who complained of dizziness because of a rise in blood pressure rested for 10
minutes and then continued performing the exercise.</p><p>For the data analysis, descriptive statistics were used to examine the general
characteristics of the subjects and their values are expressed as means&#x000b1;standard
deviation. The paired t-test was conducted in order to compare the pre- and post-test
results of each group. The independent t-test was carried out on the differences between
the pre-test values and the post-test values in order to compare the treatment effects
between the groups. The statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 20.0, and
significance was accepted for values of p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There was a statistically significant difference in the VAS of the experimental group

upright and is the most common cause of labor loss among the chronic diseases. Excessive
mechanical burden on the spinal structure acts as an essential cause of low back pain. As a
result, many symptoms occur, including weakened muscle strength, imbalances in muscle
strength, articular instability, pain, decreases in the ability to perform activities of
daily living, and gait disorder. Low back pain triggers psychological problems, such as
anxiety, depression, and lack of confidence, and may also cause alcohol or drug dependency,
as well as physical symptoms resulting from a decrease in the ability to remain active due
to muscle atrophy while avoiding physical activities<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>During the acute and sub-acute phases of low back pain, surgical operations and drug
treatments are effective at alleviating pain, but in the case of chronic low back pain,
these methods temporarily alleviate pain but do not resolve the fundamental causes.
Therefore, exercise therapy to strengthen the muscles and ligaments around the lumbosacral
area is largely used. The purposes of exercise therapy for low back pain include
strengthening weakened muscles, correcting asymmetric muscle strength imbalance, extending
shortened muscles or ligaments, decreasing increased lumbar lordosis, and increasing the
flexibility of the stiffened lumbar region<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Many diverse exercise therapies are used to treat low back pain.
Among them, exercise therapy to alleviate low back pain, pelvic inclination exercises,
muscle strengthening exercises, flexibility improving exercises, endurance increasing
exercises, and lumbar region stabilization exercises are important<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For the treatment of low back pain, in general, an appropriate assistive device should be
worn during exercise treatment to maintain the body&#x02019;s flexibility and muscle strength. At
present, in the clinical field, spinal assistive devices are used to improve pelvic
stability and the ability to perform activities of daily living. A spinal assistive device
diffuses the weight of the upper body concentrated on the lumbar region, decreases low back
pain, and reduces segmentation movement and the degree of lordosis, thereby stabilizing the
lumbosacral area<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study examined the effects of a stabilization exercise using an oral assistive device
on low back pain patients&#x02019; pain and functionality. After the stabilization exercise using
the assistive device, the experimental group&#x02019;s VAS and ODI showed statistically significant
improvements compared to before the experiment: the pain and disability indexes
significantly decreased after the intervention due to improvements in stability and balance
ability mediated by better alignment of the lumbar region and the subjects&#x02019; coordination
ability as a result of using the oral assistive device. Zissimopoulos et al. examined the
effects of an assistive device on the balance of chronic stroke patients and found a
statistically significant improvement in the experimental group&#x02019;s balance ability due to the
use of an assistive device<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, there were treatment-related statistically significant differences in
VAS and ODI between the experimental group and the control group, and the changes in VAS and
ODI were significantly greater in the experimental group, which conducted a stabilization
exercise with the assistive device, than in the control group. In other words, a
stabilization exercise using an assistive device after ordinary physical therapy in the
rehabilitation of low back pain patients decreased subjects&#x02019; pain and increased their
functional activities.</p><p>This study involved a small number of subjects and its intervention period of four weeks
was short. In addition, this study did not classify patients according to the causes of low
back pain; therefore, it is difficult to generalize its results. Further, during the
intervention period, drug therapy and injection therapy for pain and inflammation treatment
were not controlled. In a future study, the author is planning to compare different
treatment methods and experimental results after classifying the patients according to the
causes of low back pain or the stages of low back pain, and a long-term intervention
period.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the 2015 Gimcheon University Research Grant.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Balagu&#x000e9;</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Mannion</surname><given-names>AF</given-names></name><name><surname>Pellis&#x000e9;</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Non-specific low back pain</article-title>.
