The principles, hypothesis, and method of treatment have changed considerably. In recent times, treatment of edentulism with implant therapy has undergone a sea of changes in its various phases. Included among these are single stage and immediate loading implants placed with the flapless surgical approach.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Immediate occlusal loading refers to full functional occlusal loading of an implant within 2 weeks of placement.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Nonfunctional immediate restoration refers to implant prostheses placed within 2 weeks of implant placement with no direct functional occlusal loading.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Thus, fewer surgeries are necessary, and the risk of morbidity is lower. The patient will be able to obtain an acceptable esthetic result during the entire treatment period, and functional rehabilitation is improved.</p><p>The concept of functional loading is against the hypothesis that functional loads on to the implants during the initial healing period may cause failure due to fibrous ankylosis.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] It was also felt that micromovement on to the implants will disturb the osseointegration of implants.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] However, research has shown that immediate loading has given the same results as delayed loading.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Despite its frequent use, minimal data are available on the long-term clinical success rate of immediate functional loading (IFL) and immediate non-functional loading (INFL) of implants. Recent studies have shown that nonfunctional immediate loading can yield predictable results.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] However, there are very few studies supporting functional loading, especially in posterior mandible.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Numerous factors, such as the surgical, host related, occlusal factors, and implant design and characteristics, play a role in the success of implant placement. Of the factors related to the surgical technique, the establishment of primary stability has been described as the single most important variable for success of immediately loaded implants.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The transmission of micromotion to an implant body after placement can result in the crestal bone loss and failure of osseointegration. It has been shown that micromotion must be limited to &#x0003c;100 nm to achieve implant-to-bone contact.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>In view of the above considerations, the aim of this study was formulated to compare the changes in the crestal bone levels and implant stability following implant prosthesis placement with IFL and INFL techniques.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The study followed a double-blinded, randomization pattern using the fair coin tossing method after obtaining ethical clearance from the institutional review board. Twenty patients aged 25-45 years, with the need for single bilateral implant placement in the mandibular posterior region [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>], sufficient alveolar bone volume at the implant site (i.e., &#x0003e;5.5 mm width labiolingually and &#x0003e;12 mm height), with type I-III bone quality and ASA Classification P1 (normal, healthy patient) were included in the study from August 2007 to November 2008. Patients with insufficient bone quantity, severe intermaxillary skeletal discrepancy, severe clenching habit, bruxism or other parafunctional habits, and patients who had already received or lost implants in the potential implantation site, drugs or alcohol abusers, smokers, pregnant or lactating women, patients who had undergone radiotherapy for malignancies of the head and neck region, patients undergoing chemotherapy, patients with systemic disorders including diabetes, hypertension, bleeding disorders, metabolic bone disorders, liver disease and renal diseases, immuno-compromised patients including those infected with HIV were excluded from the study. The study used a split mouth design wherein contralateral sites with single missing mandibular molars were randomly assigned to either of the groups, i.e., IFL and INFL groups using a fair coin tossing method.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Preoperative panoramic radiograph showing bilateral missing single posterior teeth</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="DRJ-11-585-g001"/></fig><p>Blood analyses were done for each patient to assess the health status. Diagnostic impressions &#x02014; two of the concerned arch (mandibular arch in this study) and one of the opposing arch &#x02014; were made in irreversible hydrocolloid (Aquasil Soft putty/Regular set, DENTSPLY DE TREY GmbH, Germany) using perforated stock impression trays. The impressions were poured in the type III dental stone. The interocclusal relationship was registered using modelling wax reinforced with zinc-oxide eugenol impression paste. This record was used to mount one set of casts on a mean value articulator. A diagnostic wax-up was done on the mounted cast. The site of implant placement was marked on the diagnostic cast in relation to the central fossa of the waxed-up tooth.</p><p>Bone mapping was carried out to assess the soft tissue thickness, measure the bone width, and evaluate the ridge contour. The area was anesthetized by local infiltration using 2% lignocaine with adrenaline. Bone meter was selected as an aid for bone mapping. Panoramic radiographs and digital periapical radiographs were used to assess the available bone dimensions. The magnification error was corrected by taking the radiographs with known dimensions of orthodontic wires. The site for flapless placement of fixture was selected based on the following criteria:[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>
<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>Bone width of at least 4.5 mm must be available without undercuts of more than 15&#x000b0;.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Keratinized tissue of at least 5 mm must be present.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>A surgical stent was fabricated on the diagnostic wax-up using clear autopolymerizing acrylic resin (DPI-RR Cold Cure, DPI, India) to locate the site of implant placement intraorally during surgery. Single-stage, single-piece threaded titanium root form endosseous implants (varying from 8 to 11.5 mm in length and 4.2 and 5 mm in diameter) were selected based on the available dimensions. Implants (Adin dental implants, Afula) were carefully placed in the prepared sites [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>] using the routine protocol with all the surgical precautions to avoid implant complications. Primary stability was checked with oblique pressure applied on the abutment using fingertips. A digital radiograph was obtained to confirm the complete placement of the implants and to check its parallelism with adjacent teeth [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>].</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Bilateral single mandibular posterior implants in place &#x02014; intraorally</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="DRJ-11-585-g002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Panoramic radiograph showing single mandibular posterior implants in parallelism to the adjacent natural teeth</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="DRJ-11-585-g003"/></fig><p>Immediately after surgery, impressions were made using irreversible hydrocolloid and temporary restorations were fabricated using autopolymerizing acrylic resin (DPI-RR Cold Cure, DPI, India). The restorations were trimmed, polished, and were tried in patient mouth. Occlusal contacts were adjusted in the patient's mouth. Implants for the different loading protocols were selected randomly. For the non-functional group, the restorations were given in infraocclusion both in centric and eccentric relations [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>]. For the functional group, restorations were given with centric occlusal contacts [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>] without any eccentric occlusal contacts. The final impression was made in polyvinylsiloxane using the double mix technique with a stock tray. Both casts were mounted on the articulator using a wax interocclusal record reinforced with zinc-oxide eugenol paste. The restorations were fabricated in metal&#x02013;ceramic and the occlusion followed was implant protective occlusion, i.e., light contact in centric and eccentric positions under normal biting force and uniform contact with adjacent teeth in centric and eccentric positions under heavy biting force. The provisional and definitive restorations were cemented using IRM zinc-oxide cement [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>]. Postoperatively, the patients were advised to continue routine oral hygiene procedures. Patients were advised to eat soft diet and to avoid placing hard food in the area of provisional crown for 6 weeks. Patients were seen at regular 2-week intervals after the surgical procedure for the first month and followed by monthly visits for 6 months. Occlusion was verified at every appointment.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Nonfunctional restoration in infraocclusion both in centric and eccentric relations</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="DRJ-11-585-g004"/></fig><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Functional restoration with centric occlusal contacts</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="DRJ-11-585-g005"/></fig><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Provisional restorations cemented</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="DRJ-11-585-g006"/></fig><p>After the implants were placed, a series of digital radiographs were obtained at 0, 1, 3, and 6 months duration to study the changes in the amount of crestal bone level. The distance from the finish line of the abutment to the crest of the bone where it contacted the implant was measured both mesially and distally [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>]. The finish line of the abutment portion was taken as the reference point in this study. The distance from the finish line to the apex of the implant was also measured, which was then used to divide the known original length of the implant from the finish line to the apex to calculate the magnification factor. The magnification factor was then multiplied to the measured distance on mesial and distal sides of implant to derive the original distance.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Radiographic measurement of crestal bone loss on mesial and distal surfaces of implants</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="DRJ-11-585-g007"/></fig><p>Implant stability quotient (ISQ) values were measured with an Osstell&#x000ae; (Integration Diagnostics AB, Gothenburg, Sweden) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>].

Subsequently, ISQ values were registered in the distance.</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Measurement of ISQ values with the Ostell apparatus</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="DRJ-11-585-g008"/></fig><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The measurement values were subjected to statistical analysis using the independent <italic>t</italic>-test and paired <italic>t</italic>-test for any significant difference between the two parameters (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, statistically significant).

The evaluation of the crestal bone height in the vicinity of the placed implant radiographically does help the implantologist to determine the prognosis of the treatment. The literature does establish the relationships between:</p><p>

</p><p>Excessive stress placed on implant immediately does cause more bone loss because the crestal height comes to fall in the pathological overload zone. Hence, occlusal overload will influence the crestal bone loss.</p><p>Zhou <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] found that the Resonance Frequency Analysis(RFA)value increased with the bone-to-implant contact during the healing phase and correlated with the histomorphometric data. It is concluded, therefore, that RFA may be a reliable biomechanical technique that can monitor the osseointergration and helps to identify the nature of osseointegration.</p><p>In this study, there was no statistical significance in mean ISQ values between the IFL and INFL groups by evaluating 6-month implant stability with RFA using the Osstell device. This is in accordance with the study conducted by Lindheboom <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] However, the two groups have shown a decrease in the ISQ values from the day of surgery to the first month. This is attributed to the bone remodelling that occurs around implants during this phase. However, the ISQ value has increased from the first month and has almost reached to the original values by the end of sixth month. This increase in ISQ values is due to osseointergration of implants to the adjacent bone.</p><p>Both IFL and INFL implants showed similar radiographic results in our study. Mean bone loss was not statistically significant between the two groups. There was no significant difference in the crestal bone loss between the IFL and INFL groups. This is in accordance with the study conducted by Lindheboom <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] However, in each group, there was statistically significant amount of bone loss from the first month to third and sixth months although this had no clinical significance. This increase in the amount of bone loss is due to the bone remodelling and this rate of bone loss decreases as the time progresses. The amount of bone loss was lower than that found in the study of Norton,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] in which he describes a mean bone loss of 0.40 mm after a period of 15.7 to 27 months. However, in that study, only immediate temporization and not immediate functional loading were studied.</p><p>There was no loss of implants in either IFL or INFL groups. However, due to the small sample size in our study, no definite conclusions on implant survival can be drawn.</p><p>In this study, there were no lateral forces on the implants due to the lack of eccentric contacts. The presence of centric contacts in the IFL group will transmit axial stresses on to the implants. The lack of any significant crestal bone loss between the IFL and INFL groups can be due to the absence of nonaxial forces in either group. The lack of significant difference in ISQ values can be due to the presence of forces within the physiologic range.</p><p>The idea behind the concept of keeping temporary restoration out of occlusion was to control the load on the single tooth unit to allow undisturbed healing. The role of tongue pressure and periosteal musculature may be an under estimated factor in immediately provisionalized, but nonloaded implants. Moreover, occlusion might not be the only determinant of implant success because there was no statistical significant difference between IFL implants and INFL group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Within the limits of this study, the preliminary data indicate that immediate loading of implants under functional occlusal loading have good stability and an equivalent success rate as compared to nonfunctional loading under the absence of eccentric forces. Thus, it owes an improvement in the masticatory function and a better patient acceptance. However, further studies under the presence of eccentric forces need to be evaluated.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hahn</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Single-stage, immediate loading, and flapless surgery</article-title><source>J Oral Implantol</source><year>2000</year><volume>26</volume><fpage>193</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11831320</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Misch</surname><given-names>CE</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>HL</given-names></name><name><surname>Misch</surname><given-names>CM</given-names></name><name><surname>Sharawy</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Lemons</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Judy</surname><given-names>KW</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Rationale for the application of immediate load in implant dentistry: Part 1</article-title><source>Implant Dent</source><year>2004</year><volume>13</volume><fpage>207</fpage><lpage>17</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15359155</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Adell</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Lekholm</surname><given-names>U</given-names></name><name><surname>Rockler</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Branemark</surname><given-names>PI</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A 15-year study of osseointegrated implants in the treatment of the edentulous jaw</article-title><source>Int J Oral Surg</source><year>1981</year><volume>10</volume><fpage>387</fpage><lpage>416</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">6809663</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brunski</surname><given-names>JB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Avoid pitfalls of overloading and micromotion of intraosseous implants</article-title><source>Dent Implantol Update</source><year>1993</year><volume>4</volume><fpage>77</fpage><lpage>81</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7919404</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Esposito</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Grusovin</surname><given-names>MG</given-names></name><name><surname>Polyzos</surname><given-names>IP</given-names></name><name><surname>Felice</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Worthington</surname><given-names>HV</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Timing of implant placement after tooth extraction: Immediate, immediate-delayed or delayed implants?
