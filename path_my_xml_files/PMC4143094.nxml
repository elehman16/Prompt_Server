While Western guidelines recommend i.v. 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and folic acid (leucovorin, LV) or capecitabine combined with oxaliplatin (FOLFOX or CapeOX) as the first choice for adjuvant chemotherapy in stage III colon cancer [<xref rid="MDU232C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MDU232C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], fluoropyrimidine alone remains one of the options [<xref rid="MDU232C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="MDU232C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>In Japan, oral fluoropyrimidine derivatives have been preferred because of their convenience, leading to the development of several oral fluoropyrimidine derivatives with different properties. Tegafur&#x02013;uracil (UFT, Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) is a combination drug comprising tegafur, a prodrug of 5-FU, and uracil, an inhibitor of the 5-FU-degrading enzyme, dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), in a molar ratio of 1 : 4. Both the NSABP C-06 trial conducted in the United States [<xref rid="MDU232C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and the JCOG0205 study conducted in Japan [<xref rid="MDU232C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] demonstrated the noninferiority of UFT/LV to i.v. 5-FU/LV as adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III disease. UFT/LV is one of the commonly used regimens in adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III patients in Japan.</p><p>S-1 (Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd) is another oral fluoropyrimidine approved in Japan for various cancers including colorectal cancer, and for gastric cancers in a total of 38 countries (Asia and Europe). It combines tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil in a molar ratio of 1 : 0.4 : 1. Gimeracil, a DPD inhibitor, is &#x0223c;180-fold more potent than uracil. Oteracil inhibits the conversion of 5-FU to active metabolites in the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in reduction of the gastrointestinal toxicity [<xref rid="MDU232C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Phase III studies have demonstrated that combination with S-1 and other cytotoxic agents, such as cisplatin in advanced gastric cancer and irinotecan and oxaliplatin in advanced colorectal cancer, is noninferior to conventional 5-FU-based regimens [<xref rid="MDU232C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="MDU232C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Regarding adjuvant chemotherapy, postoperative S-1 treatment significantly improved survival in patients with gastric cancer and pancreatic cancer [<xref rid="MDU232C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="MDU232C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Additionally, S-1 has some potential advantages including lower drug cost compared with UFT/LV, and reported lower frequency of hand&#x02013;foot syndrome (HFS) compared with capecitabine [<xref rid="MDU232C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, the efficacy of S-1 as adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer has not been established.</p><p>We therefore conducted an open-label, multicenter, randomized, controlled noninferiority study, ACTS-CC, to evaluate the noninferiority of S-1 to UFT/LV and thereby confirm the usefulness of S-1 in the adjuvant setting for stage III colon cancer. The results of safety analysis have been previously reported [<xref rid="MDU232C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This paper focuses on disease-free survival (DFS) as the primary end point.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="mdu232_s2"><title>patients and methods</title><sec id="mdu232_s2a"><title>patients</title><p>This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Japanese Ethical Guidelines for Clinical Research, and was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of each participating institute.

The surveillance schedule included serum tumor marker test every 3 months for 3 years and then every 6 months for up to 5 years; chest and abdominal computed tomography every 6 months for 5 years; and colonoscopy at 1, 3, and 5 years after surgery. Recurrence was confirmed on the basis of imaging studies.</p><p>DFS was defined as the time from randomization to recurrence, other malignancies, or death, whichever occurred first. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from randomization to death from any cause.</p></sec><sec id="mdu232_s2e"><title>statistical design and analysis</title><p>The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate the noninferiority of S-1 to UFT/LV in terms of DFS. Based on the results reported by the Japanese clinical trial and cancer registry [<xref rid="MDU232C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="MDU232C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the 3-year DFS rate was assumed to be 75.0% in both groups. The steering committee deemed that a 6% lower 3-year DFS rate for S-1 than for UFT/LV would be clinically acceptable as the lower limit for noninferiority; this corresponded to a hazard ratio (HR) noninferiority margin of 1.29. With a type 1 error of &#x02264;5% in the one-sided test and a power of &#x02265;80%, considering an accrual period of 15 months, the required number of DFS events and patients was estimated to be 381 and 1436 per study, respectively [<xref rid="MDU232C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A target sample size of 1480 was determined in consideration of a 3% drop-out rate.</p><p>Primary analysis was carried out using a data cutoff at 3 years after enrollment of the last patient (data cutoff date: 5 October 2012). Primary comparisons were based on the intention-to-treat principle, with data of the full analysis set. DFS curves were estimated using the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method, and the noninferiority log-rank test with stratification by LN metastasis (N1/N2) was carried out with a one-sided significance level of 0.05 [<xref rid="MDU232C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The HR for DFS and its confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a stratified Cox proportional hazard model with LN metastasis (N1/N2) as stratification factor. In addition, the HR adjusted with key baseline factors using a multivariate Cox regression model was also estimated. Subgroup analysis was carried out using a Cox proportional hazard model with baseline patient characteristics, treatment groups, and these corresponding interaction terms. Secondarily, OS was analyzed in the same manner as DFS. With a median follow-up of 3 years, it was too early to compare OS, and only descriptive analysis of OS is presented in this paper. Updated survival data will be open in 2015. Data were analyzed using the SAS version 9.3 software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) and R version 2.13.0 software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="mdu232_s3"><title>results</title><sec id="mdu232_s3a"><title>patient characteristics</title><p>From April 2008 to June 2009, 1535 patients were enrolled from 358 hospitals in Japan.

As we previously reported [<xref rid="MDU232C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], though the profile of toxicities differed, no significant difference was observed in terms of safety and feasibility between S-1 and UFT/LV.</p><p>Additionally, S-1 has several potential advantages over UFT/LV. First, the drug cost in Japan for 6 months of S-1 treatment is half that of UFT/LV treatment. Given its noninferiority in DFS, S-1 could be a welcome development from the both patients' and payers' perspective. An associated cost-effectiveness analysis is being conducted.</p><p>Second, S-1 may be more convenient to administer than UFT/LV. Although no definite difference in treatment compliance between the groups was observed over the relatively short treatment period (&#x0223c;6 months) [<xref rid="MDU232C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], many physicians think that patients regard the complex UFT/LV treatment schedule (every 8 h, avoiding 1 h before or after meals) as an obstacle, and the simpler S-1 treatment schedule (twice daily after meals) to be preferable.</p><p>Furthermore, when comparing S-1 with another oral fluoropyrimidine, capecitabine, the incidence of HFS must be taken into consideration. HFS is a common AE in capecitabine treatment, which often interferes with the patients' daily living; the X-ACT study showed that 60% patients treated with capecitabine experienced HFS, and 17% experienced &#x02265;grade 3 [<xref rid="MDU232C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In our study, S-1 rarely caused HFS (incidence, 1.3%) [<xref rid="MDU232C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; this can be a notable advantage of S-1 over capecitabine. A phase III study comparing S-1 and capecitabine as adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III colon cancer is currently in progress in Japan (UMIN-CTR: UMIN000003272).</p><p>Personalization of adjuvant chemotherapy is an important issue to be resolved. We have focused on the differences in the mechanism of action between S-1 and UFT/LV or capecitabine, and associated translational researches investigating the tumor mRNA expressions and DNA copy numbers of 5-FU-related enzymes are being conducted.</p><p>On the basis of their reported superiority in DFS with a constant HR of 0.8 compared with 5-FU/LV [<xref rid="MDU232C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="MDU232C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], oxaliplatin-containing regimens have been adopted as standard adjuvant chemotherapy in the United States and Europe since the mid-2000s. While oxaliplatin is an efficacious agent, its expected benefit may not be the same in all patients. de Gramont et al. indicated that stage III consists of subgroups of patients with various prognoses, and the expected benefits of oxaliplatin could vary according to stage subgroups [<xref rid="MDU232C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The prognosis of stage IIIA patients in this study was favorable; their 3-year DFS rate was 88%, and it was similar to that (84.3%) of the stage II subgroup of the 5-FU/LV group in the MOSAIC study which did not recommend FOLFOX for stage II patients [<xref rid="MDU232C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Similarly, when the HR for DFS with adding oxaliplatin is estimated to be 0.8 as reported [<xref rid="MDU232C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="MDU232C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], the expected gain in 3-year DFS rate by adding oxaliplatin in these patients would be as small as 2%&#x02013;3%. On the other hand, in the MOSAIC study, 15% patients received FOLFOX experienced some form of peripheral sensory neuropathy even at 4 years later [<xref rid="MDU232C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Considering the expected benefits and the possible risks of increased toxicity and medical costs, oral fluoropyrimidine alone can be a considerable option for stage IIIA patients. In contrast, the prognosis of stage IIIC patients is poor. Oxaliplatin can be required for these &#x02018;high-risk stage III&#x02019; patients.</p><p>Increasing numbers of elderly cancer patients is a common tendency among the developed nations. Patients aged &#x02265;70 occupy 35% of our study population and 60% of colon cancer patients in the Japanese nationwide cancer registry [<xref rid="MDU232C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Recent subgroup analysis showed marginal survival benefit from oxaliplatin as adjuvant treatment of patients aged &#x02265;70, whereas oral fluoropyrimidines retained their efficacy [<xref rid="MDU232C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="MDU232C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, oral fluoropyrimidines may play an important role in adjuvant chemotherapy for elderly patients. Age subgroup analyses are currently in progress.</p><p>In conclusion, adjuvant chemotherapy using S-1 for stage III colon cancer was demonstrated to be noninferior in DFS compared with UFT/LV. This study has presented S-1 as a new adjuvant treatment option that offers a lower drug cost and more convenient administration than UFT/LV and a lower incidence of HFS than capecitabine.</p></sec><sec id="mdu232_s5"><title>funding</title><p>This work was supported by the <funding-source>Foundation for Biomedical Research and Innovation</funding-source>, <funding-source>Translational Research Informatics Center</funding-source>, under the funding contract with <funding-source>Taiho Pharmaceutical Co.
