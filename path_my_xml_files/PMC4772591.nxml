Although cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is recommended for depression and may be beneficial in depressed people with cancer, its use for depression in those with advanced disease for whom cure is not likely has not been explored.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>People aged 18&#x000a0;years and above with advanced cancer attending General Practitioner (GP), oncology or hospice outpatients from centres across England will be screened to establish a DSM-IV diagnosis of depression. Self-referral is also accepted. Eligible consenters will be randomised to a single blind, multicentre, randomised controlled trial of the addition to treatment as usual (TAU) of up to 12 one-hour weekly sessions of manualised CBT versus TAU alone. Sessions are delivered in primary care through Increasing Access to Psychological Care (IAPT) service, and the manual includes a focus on issues for people approaching the end of life. The main outcome is the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Subsidiary measures include the Patient Health Questionnaire, quality of life measure EQ-5D, Satisfaction with care, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-Performance Status and a modified Client Service Receipt Inventory. At 90&#x000a0;% power, we require 240 participants to enter the trial. Data will be analysed using multi-level (hierarchical) models for data collected at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24&#x000a0;weeks. Cost effectiveness analysis will incorporate costs related to the intervention to compare overall healthcare costs and QALYs between the treatment arms. We will conduct qualitative interviews after final follow-up on patient and therapist perspectives of the therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial will provide data on the clinical and cost effectiveness of CBT for people with advanced cancer and depression. We shall gain an understanding of the feasibility of delivering care to this group through IAPT.

It undermines the quality of life for individuals and those close to them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], may reduce adherence to medication, and may prolong episodes of hospitalisation and increase healthcare costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Untreated depression is an independent predictor of early death in those with advanced cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>The prevalence of depression in people with cancer is around 10&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and in advanced cancer may be as high as 21&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It is possible to treat depression effectively in the general population using antidepressant medication and psychological treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, it is not known whether these approaches are beneficial in those people with cancer who experience depression or those whose low mood exceeds what might be expected in the face of life-limiting illness. A recent systematic review of randomized controlled trials of the efficacy of any treatment intended to reduce depression in adults with diagnoses of both cancer and depression found that only seven relatively small trials have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>A meta-analysis in 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] suggested that CBT may be a promising approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], although a recent systematic review of interventions for depression in cancer, patients of which are a poor prognostic group, did not generate any well-designed trials where a CBT intervention was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Indeed, all currently published trials in this field having methodological limitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The use of specially trained nurses to use CBT skills in palliative care has not been shown to alleviate depressive symptoms in cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Whilst some benefit may exist for nurse-led problem solving therapy and behavioural activation for depression in advanced cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], the effectiveness of CBT remains to be evaluated. Evidence exists from qualitative studies with people receiving hospice care that CBT is acceptable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], but no studies have explored the therapists&#x02019; experience of delivering CBT in this context.</p><p>The overall economic cost of depression in England was estimated at &#x000a3;9 billion in 2000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The costs associated with providing standard therapy through IAPT for depression and anxiety is estimated at &#x000a3;750 per patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Estimated savings are around &#x000a3;1,200 in the first 2&#x000a0;years for the additional GDP produced per person as a consequence of treatment and &#x000a3;300 in NHS costs. The costs attributed to a reduction in suffering, which are measured by the change in quality-adjusted life years, is estimated at &#x000a3;3,300 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Choosing a value of a unit reduction on the BDI-II of greater than &#x000a3;115 as acceptable, CBT is likely to be cost-effective for treating depression in older people in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In a recent UK RCT, the economic evaluation of CBT as an adjunct to care as usual showed that the intervention was cost-effective over 12&#x000a0;months, based on the threshold of &#x000a3;20,000 per QALY used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>A review of the cost-effectiveness of CBT could not draw firm conclusions from the limited data available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Although economic evidence did provide tentative support for the hypothesis that CBT was more efficient than usual care and suggested a modest cost-effective advantage in favour of CBT, none of the reviewed RCTs were in advanced cancer cohorts.</p><p>In this paper, we describe the protocol for a national, single-blind, two-arm, randomised controlled trial of up to 12 sessions of CBT offered in addition to usual care through the UK Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) service available through primary care, versus usual care alone, for people with advanced cancer who have a DSM-IV diagnosis of depression. We include a nested qualitative component to explore, after final follow-up, the experience of therapy from the perspectives of both participants and therapists. Our data will increase our understanding of the feasibility of delivering this service through IAPT in primary care. Our trial was funded in response to a call from the UK National Institute for Clinical and Care Excellence (NICE) to assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of CBT for depression in this context. Our results will also inform policy-makers advising the London Cancer Alliance and IAPT itself on the suitability of using IAPT for treating those facing cancer long-term or in the advanced stages.</p><p>A favourable opinion for the conduct of the study was granted by the London-Camberwell St. Giles NRES committee, Central London REC3 ref 11/LO/0376.

Primary care recruitment will take place through General Practitioner (GP) cancer/palliative care registers through the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Primary Care Research Network (PCRN). Participating practices are drawn from the PCRN in areas in which co-applicants are based and where IAPT services are well established and available across the UK.

The researcher remains with the patient until additional help is available.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Participant randomisation</title><p>Participants will be randomised to one of two conditions: treatment as usual (TAU) or treatment as usual plus CBT. Randomisation will occur after patients have been assessed to meet the eligibility criteria, have consented to participate and baseline measures have been collected. The trial administrator will send participant details to PRIMENT Clinical Trials Unit (a UKCRC registered CTU) where randomisation will occur using Sealed Envelope, a web-based system. Antidepressants are a predictor of outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In cancer, tricyclic antidepressants may be preferentially prescribed over SSRIs because they have fewer relevant side effects, such as nausea, and may be used for both mood and, in lower doses, for pain. Indeed even low doses of tricyclics may be effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. We will therefore stratify our randomisation according to whether or not participants are in receipt of an antidepressant, irrespective of dose.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Masking</title><p>Remaining blind to the treatment group will not be possible for patients or therapists. The researchers and PCRN assessors will be blinded and will be asked to guess group allocation (TAU alone, TAU plus CBT, do not know) at 12&#x000a0;weeks (post-intervention) and 24&#x000a0;weeks (follow-up). Unmasking for those conducting the analysis will not occur until the databases are closed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Recruitment methods and procedures</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>From outpatient oncology clinics</title><p>NCRN support staff working with UCL researchers will facilitate recruitment from oncology outpatient clinics. Patient GP addresses will be checked to determine that they are eligible to be referred to an IAPT service before they are approached. Either support staff or UCL researchers will then screen suitable patients for depression using the PHQ-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] which includes the first two questions of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], a valid screening measure for depression routinely used in general practice.</p><p>Patients who score 3 or more, will be provided with a pre-screening information pack and asked if they would be willing to be assessed for the study. If they score 3 or more but do not wish to participate, their permission will be sought for their GP or oncology team to be informed that they may be depressed. If they agree in principle to take part, a researcher will undertake a further assessment, using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) to establish a DSM IV diagnosis of depressive disorder. Screening will be conducted in a place and manner to maximise the privacy of the patient, in an assessment room where this is possible, within the constraints of the clinical environment of each screening centre.</p><p>If a DSM IV diagnosis of depression is confirmed, the patient will be given an information pack. The patient will then be given at least 48&#x000a0;hours to decide if they wish to participate in the study before giving written consent for participation. For those who consent to take part, the researcher will then conduct baseline assessments and pass the participant&#x02019;s details to an independent trial administrator, who will arrange randomisation through PRIMENT Clinical Trials Unit. The study administrator will inform the participant by telephone of their group allocation. For those people randomised to the treatment arm, the administrator will liaise with IAPT to set up the therapeutic sessions. Both administrator and PRIMENT are situated separately from the trial research team to maximise masking of trial arm allocation from the researchers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>From GP lists, the PCRN staff</title><p>The researcher and PCRN staff will liaise with practice managers and ask them to identify people from their databases who may be eligible for screening. By mutual agreement according to availability at any practice, either the PCRN staff or the researcher will then contact people by telephone or face to face in practices to explore whether they are willing to answer the two PHQ screening questions for depression. The PCRN staff and/or researchers will then follow the same recruitment procedure described above.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Self-referral</title><p>With the permission of clinical leads in each service, posters and leaflets about the study will be placed in approved oncology clinics and GP practices. The leaflet contains the PHQ-2 for people themselves to conduct a quick assessment of their mood, suggesting to people with a score of 3 or more, that they may have depression and that they should either (a) approach the clinical team within the site or (b) contact the study team directly using the reply slip attached to the leaflet. The process of recruitment will then be the same as that outlined above.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Description of the Interventions</title><sec id="Sec18"><title>TAU</title><p>All participants will receive TAU from all clinicians involved in their care. This consists of routine support such as appointments with GPs, clinical nurse specialists, oncologists and palliative care clinicians. Participants&#x02019; physical health and medications will be reviewed and treatment modified according to symptoms such as pain. Psychotropic medication will be prescribed as necessary by either the GP or oncologist. In line with NICE guidance, specific psychological support may be available for those who present with psychological needs at any time, and study participants will not be exempt from receiving external psychological support. We will discourage specific psychological interventions aimed at treating symptoms of depression (for example, CBT or Interpersonal Psychotherapy), but ultimately we cannot interfere with usual care. We will record the numbers of people receiving any psychological therapy during the trial, although the numbers are likely to be small [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>In cancer, tricyclic antidepressants may be preferentially prescribed over SSRIs because they may be helpful in the management of pain and are less associated with commonly experienced nausea and gastrointestinal problems. Determining the therapeutic dose of antidepressant is complex and even low doses of tricyclic antidepressants may be effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. We cannot stipulate that post-randomisation anti-depressant medication cannot be used or that the dose should be fixed. Withholding a recognised treatment for depression would be unethical and would not reflect treatment as usual.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (in addition to Treatment As Usual)</title><p>The CBT will be delivered through &#x02018;improving access to psychological therapies&#x02019; (IAPT) and wellbeing centres. IAPT/wellbeing centres train, supervise and supply therapists to treat people in primary care with mental health problems. For the purpose of the study, only step 3 and step 4 (high intensity) therapists will be used. They will be given a day&#x02019;s training by the CanTalk team (SM, MS and KM), so their existing CBT skills can be adapted to use a specially developed treatment manual for people with advanced cancer. The manual details modifications in the structure of therapy and its content; in particular, it takes into account physical health problems, existential issues and communication with loved ones.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Structure of CBT sessions</title><p>NICE recommends 16 to 20 sessions of CBT to treat severe depression in secondary care. Experience shows that in primary care, considerably fewer sessions are taken up. People with advanced cancer may have difficulty coping with longer therapy as their health may be deteriorating. Our intervention will consist of up to 12 sessions of individual CBT delivered face to face or on the telephone over 3&#x000a0;months. Twice weekly sessions may be offered for the first 2&#x000a0;weeks, weekly sessions for weeks 3 to 9 and then 2 sessions in weeks 10 to 12. The timing of the sessions will need to be flexible and pragmatic to fit in with the existing commitments of the IAPT service.</p><p>In order to facilitate engagement for those who may not be able to attend sessions face to face, telephone CBT may be offered, providing at least three sessions of face-to-face therapy have already been received. Telephone CBT is already used by IAPT therapists. Moorey, Serfaty, and Mannix will teach CBT therapists how to adapt their CBT techniques for telephone counselling using similar methods to Tutty et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Content of CBT sessions, guided by a written manual</title><p>IAPT guidelines recommend that patients with moderate to severe depression and complex needs receive high intensity (step 3) work. This is consistent with the level 4 psychological interventions recommended by NICE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] for people with cancer. The CBT intervention will use a flexible approach, adapted for use with people with advanced illness, who face a poor prognosis. The manual was developed by Moorey, Mannix and Serfaty, in which therapists adapted their work to patients with advanced cancer. The key shift is to identifying whether thinking and behaviour are &#x02018;helpful&#x02019; or &#x02018;unhelpful&#x02019; rather than a reality-testing approach, enabling patients to adopt adaptive strategies to cope with adverse and often unpredictable health circumstances.</p><p>The intervention will broadly cover the following:</p><p>In <italic>session 1</italic>, an assessment of problems, psychoeducation about depressive disorder and an introduction to the cognitive model will be undertaken. A simple cross-sectional formulation of current emotional distress will be established, and the triggers to emotional distress and how to manage them will be identified, with steps towards one of the patient&#x02019;s goals. A list of enjoyable activities will be instigated, and unhelpful thinking styles will be identified using specific examples from recent events. <italic>Session 2</italic> will aim to help patients develop an understanding of their problems within a cognitive behavioural framework and begin the process of therapy, using cross-sectional formulation. This will include a discussion of past strengths and coping abilities. Behavioural activation techniques will be used within the constraints of the person&#x02019;s physical illness. <italic>Session 3</italic> will review the formulation, identifying any new insights/changes. Guided discovery, through a deeper discussion of the patient&#x02019;s thoughts/beliefs around their illness and their resilience, will help them to apply their resilience under current circumstances. A start will be made on identifying &#x02018;helpful&#x02019; versus &#x02018;unhelpful&#x02019; thinking and behaviours. <italic>Sessions 4 to 5</italic> will help the patient apply new learning to current difficulties, recent success experiences will be reformulated, and helpful changes will be identified. Guided discovery will be used to help the person notice successful experiences and build resilience. The triggers to emotional distress and strategies for responding will be explored. These will include thought testing and in-session experimentation with allowing intrusive thoughts to pass. <italic>Session 6-7</italic> will focus on thought testing and finding &#x02018;helpful&#x02019; alternative thoughts. This will be done within sessions, supplemented by homework completed by the patient between sessions, where logs of patient mood and associated thoughts and behaviours are reviewed. Thoughts and behaviours will then be challenged, and more helpful alternatives considered. Examples of recent success experiences will be added to successes lists and exploration of these for their associated &#x02018;helpful&#x02019; thoughts.&#x02019; <italic>Session 8</italic> will focus on problem solving and worry time. Confirmation will be made that thought testing/&#x02018;helpful&#x02019; thoughts concept has been understood. Examples of realistic concerns will be identified to generate a &#x02018;problems to address&#x02019; list. An example of one problem will be taken to illustrate the problem-solving approach. The concept of &#x02018;worry time&#x02019; will be introduced. <italic>Session 9</italic> will consolidate CBT strategies, reviewing and prioritising a problem list. Planning on how to tackle harder problems will be undertaken, identifying unhelpful thoughts and behaviours with consideration of the pros and cons of potential solutions and the commitment to this process. A review of the use of worry management strategies will also be done. <italic>Session 10</italic> will consist of a review of the person&#x02019;s perceived progress, including successes and difficulties. <italic>Session 11</italic> will consist of relapse prevention. This will include reviewing presenting difficulties, the progress and personal achievement made, personal resilience and successes, and the development of a relapse prevention checklist. <italic>Session 12</italic> will consist of future planning, reviewing a relapse-prevention checklist, making concrete plans for action if emotional distress recurs or unhelpful behaviours/thinking return. In addition, therapists will be taught on materials contained in three sections in the Manual&#x02019;s appendix, so, if relevant, these may be addressed with participants. These will include, first, covering existential issues in addition to addressing fears about the mode of dying, fears about the effect of death on others, and fears about what happens after death; second, applying CBT in shorter sessions when health is poor, how to deal with fatigue and coping with loss of function; and third, facilitating communication with partner, families and carers. This will include identifying differing assumptions about attitudes to cancer and illness-related behaviour.</p><p>In addition telephone CBT will be implemented. Recent evidence suggests that the use of telephone CBT in the treatment of depression is both clinically and cost effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. We will therefore use this approach where necessary with people who may not be able to continue to attend face-to-face CBT sessions. We anticipate that this situation may arise for some people whose physical condition deteriorates as their cancer progresses. This will improve engagement and minimise attrition.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Therapist experience and characteristics</title><p>All therapists who work on this trial will be high-intensity therapists.

We have powered the study to enable detection of a difference in BDI-II of six points (standard deviation 12) between the TAU and CBT groups measured at 12&#x000a0;weeks, assuming a treatment effect of three points after 6&#x000a0;weeks, and a sustained six-point difference after 18 and 24&#x000a0;weeks (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). We have been cautious in assuming a sustained rather than an increasing treatment effect after 12&#x000a0;weeks. Follow-up at 12&#x000a0;weeks post-baseline in other trials ranges from 44&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] to over 75&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Although our client group may be in the last year of life, we do not plan to recruit people who are about to die. We will assume a 70&#x000a0;% follow-up rate after 6&#x000a0;weeks, decreasing to 65&#x000a0;% at 12&#x000a0;weeks and 60&#x000a0;% after 24&#x000a0;weeks (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).</p><p>The BDI-II manual reports that the correlation between BDI-II values from sessions 1&#x000a0;week apart is 0.93 (Beck and Steer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]). To estimate the correlation between measurements 6&#x000a0;weeks apart, the simplest assumption possible is that future values will depend only on the most recent past, and not on any history prior to that (in technical terms, this is called an &#x02018;autoregressive process of order 1&#x02019;). Then, the correlation between measurements will decay at a constant rate of 0.93 per week, and our best estimate of the correlation between BDI-II measures taken 6&#x000a0;weeks apart is 0.93<sup>6</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.65.</p><p>Assuming the attrition rates and correlation reported above, the sample size required to detect an overall difference between the groups, at 90&#x000a0;% power and 5&#x000a0;% significance is 109 participants per trial arm (using a multi-level model adjusting for baseline BDI-II). To account for clustering by therapist, the sample size needs to be inflated by a factor of 1.10. (1&#x02009;+&#x02009;(average cluster size -1)&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;intra-class correlation coefficient).

Descriptive results (mean and SD) for demographic and pre and post-treatment BDI-II scores at each follow-up period will be presented by treatment group. Analyses will be on an intention-to-treat basis using multi-level (hierarchical) models. The levels of hierarchy in the data are as follows: first level - repeated measures, second level - participants, and third level - therapist. The primary analysis will test for an overall treatment effect on an intention-to-treat basis using BDI-II over the four follow-ups, controlling for baseline BDI-II score and other baseline confounders, including antidepressant dose. A secondary analysis will also look at the effect of treatment separately at each time point, by including a treatment-time interaction in the multi-level model. A complier average causal effect (CACE) analysis will be performed to take into account the possible lack of adherence to CBT. Analyses will be performed using the current version of STATA (version 13) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].</p><p>Antidepressants will be monitored in order to compare their use between groups to check that they are similar. This will be done by recording all antidepressants prescribed during the trial (name, dose and frequency). This will include SSRIs and other antidepressants such as tricyclics, which are often used in small doses for symptom control in end-of-life care.

It is therefore unlikely that hospital utilisation for physical reasons will differ significantly between the two arms, and this is therefore not being recorded to minimise patient burden. We will, however, record the number of contacts with community services, including mental health, especially as these are most likely to be influenced by our intervention. Therefore, the CSRI will be modified to collect data on community health services only. Resource utilisation will be multiplied by unit costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] to estimate individual-level care-package costs for each patient at baseline and over the trial period. Costs related to the intervention will be included. We will calculate mean cost of CBT per participant, the incremental health and social care cost, the incremental QALY gain and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Results will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. Using multivariate regression methods, we will explore differences in costs and outcomes between treatment groups. We shall adjust for need-related factors, including functionality (assessed using BDI-II).</p><p>Bootstrapped incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and acceptability curves will be estimated in order to relate differences in costs and outcomes between the groups. Capturing benefits over a patient&#x02019;s lifetime is an important issue, given outcome data will be missing at the end of the trial. We will use assumption-based modelling techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] to explore the cost-effectiveness of the intervention using a lifetime horizon. In order to assess the key thresholds at which the intervention would be cost-effective, threshold analysis, for example, may be used as one method of framing assumptions around transition probabilities. The reliability of the model will depend on the quality and extent of missing data from the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec50"><title>Qualitative data</title><p>We will use purposive sampling and write to 20 participants in the trial who received CBT at the end of their follow-up period to invite them to take part in qualitative interviews to explore their experience of the trial and their therapy. We will also interview 12 therapists to explore their experience of delivering therapy to this population. Semi-structured, one-to-one interviews will be conducted using a topic guide either in the participants&#x02019; homes or in the department where the research is taking place. All interviews will be audio recorded for transcription at a later date. Data will be analysed using thematic content analysis. Findings from these data will be used to generate recommendations on what may be improved in the delivery of CBT to people with advanced cancer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec51"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>This trial has been approved by the London-Camberwell St. Giles Research Ethics Committee, part of the NHS Health Research Authority (reference 11/LO/0376). The trial will be conducted in compliance to the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed written consent will be obtained from all participants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec52" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial will provide robust evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of individual cognitive behaviour therapy for treating people with advanced cancer and depressive disorder. Cancer will affect one in three of the UK population during their lifetime, and it remains one of the commonest causes of death. In caring for people with advanced cancer, much effort may be expended on addressing treatments for physical problems including the management of symptoms such as pain, nausea and fatigue that are common as health deteriorates. Good supportive care at this time should include accurate assessments of mental health, and diagnosis and treatment for depression when necessary. If found to be effective, use of talking therapies may enhance the experience not only of those people facing advanced cancer but also those close to them.</p><p>This trial will generate data to aid our understanding of the feasibility of delivering CBT to a population with deteriorating physical health in the community through the existing network of IAPT therapists. We shall gain information on the interfaces between oncology services in secondary care, CBT in primary care and the hospice in the third sector. Some day care services provided through hospices have the capacity to offer talking therapies within current models of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Evidence from this trial may inform the likely benefits of strengthening these services within palliative care, as well as assess whether augmenting usual care with CBT is cost-effective based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence threshold.</p><p>Analyses of the content of therapy sessions will enhance our understanding of the issues of importance to people with advanced cancer who experience depression. Our data may reveal domains of worry and psychological need in those facing the approach of death with which we are not yet familiar. Such new knowledge may enable the development of recommendations and guidance for therapists providing CBT in this context, and for the wider clinical community caring for people with cancer for whom cure is not likely.</p><sec id="Sec53"><title>Trial status</title><p>Participant recruitment began on 19 September 2012 and is ongoing.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CBT</term><def><p>Cognitive Behavioural Therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IAPT</term><def><p>Improving Access to Psychological Therapies</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NIHR</term><def><p>National Institute for Health Research</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCRN</term><def><p>Primary Care Research Network</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>MS, Chief Investigator on the CanTAlk study, contributed towards the initial project idea, application and protocol and prepared, reviewed and commented on drafts of this manuscript.
