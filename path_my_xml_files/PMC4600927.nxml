However, its cardioprotection on patients is inconsistent. Similarly, the beneficial effect of tight glycemic control during cardiac surgery in patients has recently been questioned. We postulated that low glucose (LG) may promote ROS formation through enhancing fatty acid (FA) oxidation and unmask propofol cardioprotection during IRI. Rat hearts were isolated and randomly assigned to be perfused with Krebs-Henseleit solution with glucose at 5.5&#x02009;mM (LG) or 8&#x02009;mM (G) in the absence or presence of propofol (5&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL) or propofol plus trimetazidine (TMZ). Hearts were subjected to 35 minutes of ischemia followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion. Myocardial infarct size (IS) and cardiac CK-MB were significantly higher in LG than in G group (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), associated with reduced left ventricular developed pressure and increases in postischemic cardiac contracture. Cardiac 15-F2t-isoprostane was higher, accompanied with higher cardiac lipid transporter CD36 protein expression in LG. Propofol reduced IS, improved cardiac function, and reduced CD36 in G but not in LG. TMZ facilitated propofol cardioprotection in LG. Therefore, isolated heart with low glucose lost sensitivity to propofol treatment through enhancing FA oxidation and TMZ supplementation restored the sensitivity to propofol.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Ischemic heart disease is a major cause of mortality, and the global incidence is rising rapidly. Essentially it is a reduction of heart blood flow usually secondary to atherosclerosis which then reduces the delivery of oxygen and nutrients. Rupture of vulnerable arterial plaques and subsequent thrombosis results in myocardial infarction (MI) and this is one of the commonest perioperative complications after noncardiac surgery [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], especially in patients with diabetes [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In nonoperative settings, reperfusion therapies currently remain the mainstay therapy for the ischemia results from coronary occlusion. Reperfusion strategies, such as thrombolysis, angioplasty, and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), when applied expeditiously, and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) can restore coronary flow and limit myocardial infarct size (IS), and reperfusion per se can paradoxically trigger irreversible tissue injury, namely, ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) which is regarded as an important contributor to the unsuccessful recovery after reperfusion therapy [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production during reperfusion and the subsequently increased oxidative damage are regarded as a pivotal factor contributing to the pathogenesis of IRI [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>To date, a large body of the literature supports the concept that disturbances in cardiac energy metabolism have been involved in exaggerating IRI, in contrast to normal heart where fatty acid and glucose metabolism, specifically fatty acid (FA) oxidation and glucose oxidation, are tightly regulated [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Administering a high level of FA in healthy hearts can inhibit glucose oxidation and exacerbate IRI [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. During ischemia, glucose becomes the preferred cardiac energy substrate, as it requires less oxygen for oxidation than an equimolar amount of carbon derived from FA. The metabolic shift between FA oxidation and glucose oxidation has been proposed to be the key contributor in the pathogenesis of impaired cardiac function in ischemic reperfused hearts [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and a recent study further demonstrates that the fatty acid transporter, FAT/CD36, plays critical roles in coordinating changes in cardiac substrate metabolism during ischemia and reperfusion [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Clinical data shows that patients with diabetes are more frequently encountered in ischemic heart disease and more vulnerable to IRI than nondiabetics and hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress may further exacerbate IRI [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In addition, cardiac energy metabolism in diabetic hearts is altered where glucose utilization is impaired which causes a switch to predominantly using FA for energy supply [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This metabolic maladaptation, resulting from elevated plasma free fatty acids, excessive FA accumulation, and increment of mitochondrial uncoupling and free radical accumulation, will provide feedback to inhibit glucose uptake, which is detrimental to the ischemic myocardium and amplifies deleterious effects [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and might be the fundamental mechanism governing the increased vulnerability of the diabetic heart to IRI. In line with this mechanism, switching the energy supply preference away from FA oxidation and subsequently to greater glucose oxidation has been reported to be cardioprotective in lessening myocardial IRI [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Accumulating evidence supports that administration of insulin to maintain blood glucose at a level below 215&#x02009;mg/dL can improve long-term survival in diabetic patients suffering from acute myocardial infarction [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Consistent with this finding, tight glycemic control with glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) solution that normalized serum glucose concentration from 125 to 200&#x02009;mg/dL has been shown to significantly decrease the morbidity in diabetic patients undergoing CABG surgery [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Further lowing blood glucose values to no higher than 110&#x02009;mg/dL with intensive insulin therapy has also been found to be beneficial among critically ill patients [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, the beneficial effects of tight glycemic control during cardiac surgery in patients remain questioned and controversial as conflicting reports have emerged. In contrast to aforementioned studies, other researches demonstrated that intensive blood glucose control has no effect on reducing mortality in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and significantly increased the risk of intraoperative hypoglycaemia without clear postoperative benefit in patients undergoing cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. So far, to our knowledge, there is no direct evidence to explore the effects and mechanism of tight glycemic control during myocardial IRI.</p><p>Propofol, a commonly used intravenous anesthetic, has antioxidant property, which enhances the capacity of endogenous cardiac antioxidant to inhibit ROS-mediated lipid peroxidation [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and attenuates postischemic myocardial cellular injury and oxidative stress in patients undergoing cardiac surgery [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and in rat hearts subjected to global myocardial IRI [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, controversy about propofol cardioprotection persists. For example, propofol failed to attenuate ROS production during ischemia reperfusion in the isolated rat heart [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The precise reasons for different outcomes are as yet unknown. Furthermore, a study shows that propofol cardioprotection was abrogated in diabetic condition [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, study regarding the effectiveness of propofol at different glucose concentrations in combating myocardial IRI has not been elucidated. In particular, studies addressing whether or not the cardioprotective effect of propofol is related to FA oxidation and lipid peroxidation production are lacking. To examine this, we use low glucose concentration at 5.5&#x02009;mM (which is equal to 100&#x02009;mg/dL) to mimic tight glycemic control condition [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and 8&#x02009;mM as normal glucose (which is about the normal high postmeal glucose level) in isolated ischemic perfused rat heart model to explore the impact of glucose concentration on propofol cardioprotection against myocardial IRI, and we incorporated the use of trimetazidine (TMZ), a partial FA oxidation inhibitor to explore the effect and mechanism of inhibiting FA metabolism in attenuating postischemic oxidative stress and myocardial IRI at varying glucose concentrations and its potential impact on propofol cardioprotection.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Experimental Protocol</title><p>Hearts were randomly assigned to one of the six experimental groups (<italic>n</italic> = 7 per group): low glucose concentration at 5.5&#x02009;mM (LG), LG plus propofol (5&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL) (LG+P), LG plus propofol together with the partial FA oxidation inhibitor trimetazidine (TMZ) (1&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M) (LG+P+TMZ), glucose concentration at 8&#x02009;mM (G), G plus propofol (G+P), and G plus propofol together with TMZ (G+P+TMZ). The propofol concentration of 5&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL was chosen based on our previous finding that propofol used at this concentration can confer cardioprotection in the isolated ischemic reperfused rat hearts [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. After 20 minutes of stabilization (baseline, BS20), the heart was subjected to 35&#x02009;min global ischemia by turning off the perfusion and followed by 60&#x02009;min reperfusion using Langendorff-perfused system. The study drugs propofol and TMZ were perfused through the aorta via a minipump. The LV pressure signal was recorded using a PowerLab data acquisition system and processed to yield left ventricle developed pressure (LVDP) calculated from left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and LV peak systolic pressure (LVSP) (LVDP = LVSP &#x02212; LVEDP). Coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) was measured via a side arm of the perfusion cannula connected to a pressure transducer as described [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Effluent samples during baseline, ischemia, and reperfusion were collected at different time points for analysis for creatine kinase MB (CK-MB), endothelin-1 (ET-1), and free 15-F2t-isoprostane (15-F2t-IsoP) concentration described as below. Heart tissue protein expression of CD36, a cardiac lipid transporter, was measured by Western blotting.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2.

</title><p>Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250 &#x000b1; 10&#x02009;g) were used at approximately 6 weeks of age from the Laboratory Animal Service Centres, the University of Hong Kong and Wuhan University, China. Rats were housed and given free access to standard food and water according to the principles of Animal Care of the University of Hong Kong. Experiments were approved by the Committee on Use of Live Animals in Teaching and Research (CULATR). Rats were anaesthetized by injection of intraperitoneal pentobarbital sodium (65&#x02009;mg/kg). Median thoracotomy was performed and hearts were quickly excised and immersed in ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit (KH) solution. Hearts were gently squeezed to remove residual blood to prevent clot formation. Then, hearts were cannulated via the aorta and perfused as nonworking &#x0201c;Langendorff&#x0201d; method. The perfusate at a constant flow rate of 10&#x02009;mL/min which was KH solution that contained (in mM) NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 24, NaCl 118, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1.2, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1.25, KCl 4.63, KH<sub>2</sub> PO<sub>4</sub> 1.17, and glucose 5.5 or 8 was previously equilibrated with a mixture of 95% O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37&#x000b0;C using a thermostatically controlled water circulating system. The heart was kept warm in a chamber with circulating water controlled at 37&#x000b0;C. A water-filled balloon was then inserted into the left ventricle through the mitral valve and connected to a pressure transducer for the determination of LV pressure. The balloon was inflated to a diastolic pressure of ~5&#x02013;10&#x02009;mmHg.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>2.3.

Then tissues were fixed overnight in 10% formalin. The infarcted areas (white) and viable areas (red) for each slice were traced and digitized using a computerized planimetry technique (SigmaScan 4.0, Systat Software Inc., Richmond, CA).

Propofol treatment alone significantly reduced postischemic 15-F2t-IsoP at Re-1 in the G group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, G+P versus G), while propofol in combination with TMZ did not further decrease the level of 15-F2t-IsoP (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.1, G+P+TMZ versus G+P).</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(b)</xref>, during reperfusion at Re-60, cardiac CD36 protein expression was higher in the LG group than in the G group; propofol plus TMZ but not propofol alone reduced postischemic cardiac CD36 protein expression in the LG group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05, LG+P versus LG; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, LG+P+TMZ versus LG).

Discussion</title><p>We have shown in this study that postischemic myocardial IS and cardiac CK-MB release were significantly greater in low glucose group than in glucose group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), which was associated with reduced LVDP and an increase in postischemic cardiac contracture reflected as enhanced LVEDP and increases in ET-1 release and CPP as compared to glucose group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Also postischemic cardiac 15-F2t-isoprostane, a specific index of ROS-induced oxidative stress, was higher in low glucose group that was associated with higher cardiac lipid transporter CD36 protein expression than that in glucose group. Propofol significantly reduced IS and improved cardiac function and reduced cardiac ET-1 and CPP as well as CD36 in glucose group but not in low glucose group, indicating that enhancement of ROS induced oxidative stress by low glucose plays a key role in compromising propofol cardioprotection. Further, both hemodynamic and biochemical findings signaled a remarkably attenuated myocardial injury and enhanced cardiac function recovery by TMZ treatment in the LG+P+TMZ group as compared to the LG group and the LG+P group. Together, these results for the first time demonstrated that low glucose concentration as seen during tight glycaemic control may not only promote postischemic myocardial ROS formation through enhancing FA oxidation and exacerbating myocardial IRI but also play a critical role in unmasking propofol cardioprotection against IRI.</p><p>15-F2t-IsoP, one of the most abundant F2t-isoprostanes, was firstly reported by Morrow and colleagues in 1990 [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], which is produced<italic> in vivo</italic> and has been intensively used as a sensitive and reliable marker of oxidative stress [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Thus, measurement of 15-F2t-IsoP concentration should potentially allow for exploration of the role of ROS in the pathophysiology of myocardial ischemic diseases. Our previous study has demonstrated that 15-F2t-IsoP per se can exacerbate myocardial IRI evidenced as elevated CK-MB release, increased IS, and concomitant cardiac dysfunction [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In the same study, 15-F2t-IsoP, applied before or present in high concentration during ischemia, can lead to an increase in effluent ET-1 concentration during reperfusion in the isolated rat heart [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. ET-1 has been known as one of the most potent vasoconstrictors and postulated to be attributable to the progression of myocardial IRI [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We also have found that 15-F2t-IsoP generation during myocardial ischemia reperfusion in an isolated rat heart model can be inhibited by treatment with 2,6-diisopropylphenol (propofol), which led to improved postischemic cardiac functional recovery [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Another study done by our group has also determined that antioxidant therapy with Salvia miltiorrhiza during cardiac surgery significantly reduces the lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde levels in the plasma with concomitant reductions in ET-1 concentrations and improved postoperative cardiac function in patients [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Despite these findings of 15-F2t-IsoP in myocardial diseases, no evidence exists to show propofol treatment effects on the alterations of both 15-F2t-IsoP and ET-1 concentrations during myocardial IRI under the context of different concentrations of glucose. The current study extended previous study and observed a significant reduction in ET-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(a)</xref>) and 15-F2t-IsoP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(a)</xref>) concentration in propofol treatment groups under glucose condition but not under low glucose condition. It is plausible that antioxidant therapy with propofol may have reduced ET-1 release during myocardial ischemia reperfusion through attenuating ROS induced oxidative stress reflected as reduced 15-F2t-IsoP production under normal glucose condition. However, under low glucose condition, the potentially increased FA metabolism subsequent to increased CD36 expression may result in increased oxidative stress which compromised propofol cardioprotection through its antioxidant property. During reperfusion, the significant increase in cardiac ET-1 release occurred early at 1&#x02009;min after reperfusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(a)</xref>), which proceeded the changes in CPP which did not significantly increase at Re-1&#x02009;min (data not shown) until after 10&#x02009;min of reperfusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(b)</xref>). This suggests that postischemic ET-1 release is, at least in part, responsible for the increase in CPP.</p><p>The significant increases of 15-F2t-IsoP in all experimental groups at early reperfusion (1&#x02009;min) as compared to that at baseline indicate increased oxidative stress during early reperfusion. However, at the end of reperfusion (60&#x02009;min), 15-F2t-IsoP concentration decreased to the same level as that at baseline which was consistent with our previous study which showed that 15-F2t-IsoP level was continuously increased during ischemia and early reperfusion but decayed quickly after about 30&#x02009;min during reperfusion in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In contrast, ET-1 levels remained elevated at least 24 hours after cardiopulmonary bypass in patients [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The postischemic myocardial IS was assessed 60&#x02009;min after reperfusion with concomitant measures of LV diastolic performance [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It should be noted that although Langendorff method is an ideal experimental model utilized to assess cardiac function and metabolism<italic> ex vivo</italic>, the measurement of right ventricular function which contributed to overall cardiac function is not assessed that causes some limitations in this study.</p><p>In this study, we detected that isolated rat hearts perfused with low glucose were more vulnerable to myocardial injury. Low glucose exhibited a significant myocardial injury evidenced by dramatically increased IS, CK-MB, and cardiac dysfunction compared to glucose group and this was tightly associated with increased 15-F2t-IsoP production and higher cardiac CD36 protein expression. CD36 is a transmembrane sarcolemmal protein considered as a major mediator of FA transport and participated in enhancing cardiomyocyte FA uptake and subsequently regulating FA oxidation rates in the hearts. There is a growing body of evidence finding that CD36 overexpression can facilitate FA oxidation whereas CD36 ablation can lead to reduced FA uptake and FA oxidation rates which is compensated by increased glucose oxidation and consequently prevent IRI [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Our data found that ROS production, reflected as 15-F2t-IsoP generation, was significantly increased in rat heart with low glucose and associated with increased CD36 expression indicating that low glucose concentration at 5.5&#x02009;mM may result in increased FA oxidation and subsequently lead to lipid peroxidation production and render the heart susceptible to myocardial IRI. The fact that cardiac contractile dysfunction reflected as increased LVEDP and decreased LVDP was accompanied by increased CD36 level is in line with the viewpoint of Ussher and Lopaschuk [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] which suggests that accelerated FA oxidation can strongly affect perioperative cardiac function recovery. The translocation of CD36 can be regulated by both glucose metabolism and cardiac contraction and the dramatic reduction of CD36 after perfusion in propofol and TMZ treated group may be due to rapid redistribution from the functional lipid raft to nonfunctional nonraft membrane as suggested [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], but further in depth mechanistic study in this regard is merited.</p><p>Propofol has chemical structural similarity to that of the phenol-based free radical scavenger vitamin E and possessed antioxidant property [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Propofol at the concentrations 2&#x02013;4&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL failed to achieve cardioprotective effect on coronary surgery patients [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, propofol, when infused in high doses, may potentially impair the metabolic functions of blood vessels and muscles of various organs and subsequently lead to apparent heart failure, renal failure, and metabolic acidosis, which is known as propofol infusion syndrome [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In our study, propofol applied at 5&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL displayed a reduction of contracture development evidenced by increased LVDP function while decreased LVEDP confirmed that propofol can improve postischemic myocardial functional recovery. Our finding is in line with findings by others who showed that propofol attenuated contracture development through significantly facilitating energy metabolic recovery which may provide tolerance to lethal cardiac IRI [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>Another important finding of this study is the correlation between different glucose concentrations and propofol cardioprotection against IRI. To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the cardioprotective effect of propofol on isolated hearts perfused with low glucose (5.5&#x02009;mM) and normal glucose (8&#x02009;mM) concentration. Propofol under glucose 8&#x02009;mM showed a robust myocardial protection effect. Whereas its cardioprotective effects vanished, the hearts were perfused at low glucose at 5.5&#x02009;mM. Propofol had no significant effect on ameliorating myocardial injury between the LG and LG+P groups indicating that the abolishment of cardioprotective effect with propofol may be a result of low glucose induced enhancement of ROS production due to the increase of FA oxidation which exceeded propofol's antioxidant capacity. Our finding differs from that of Wang et al. [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] as they also showed that hearts exposed to propofol can increase glucose oxidation and markedly decrease FA oxidation. This discrepancy may be partially due to the fact that FA oxidation increased by low glucose surpasses the decrease by propofol. However, the exact mechanism is unclear and deserves further study.</p><p>Our finding that low glucose concentration-mediated cancellation of propofol cardioprotection can be restored by the addition of the partial FA oxidation inhibitor TMZ with concomitant reduction of postischemic oxidative stress provides indirect evidence that low concentration glucose may induce increased FA oxidation and exacerbate oxidative stress during myocardial IRI. Further, we showed that the protective effect of TMZ on postischemic myocardial damage and function recovery was more evident in low glucose group than in normal glucose group.</p><p>Propofol has been studied extensively for its cardioprotective effect [<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. However, that propofol treatment against IRI by modulating FA oxidation using TMZ has not been reported. The contribution of TMZ in propofol-mediated cardiomyocytes protection is addressed for the first time by using Langendorff perfused model. TMZ, a partial FA oxidation inhibitor, is well established to have efficient effect against ischemic damage as a result of increased glucose oxidation through selectively suppressing key enzyme of FA oxidation [<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and be regarded as an effective adjunctive treatment against global ischemia reperfusion [<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The present study showed that TMZ supplementation restored isolated heart with low glucose concentration sensitivity to propofol cardioprotection by decreases in myocardial IS and 15-F2t-IsoP generation and enhancement in cardiac function which is aligned with studies from Lopaschuk et al. [<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and Fragasso et al. [<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] as they also found that TMZ can improve functional recovery and diminish injury to ischemic myocardium. The novel finding that suppressing FA oxidation by TMZ facilitated propofol cardioprotection under low glucose may provide a potential direction on clinical therapies to combat global myocardial ischemia. The findings of the current study combined with our previous work on the cardioprotection effect of propofol suggest that a combined strategy with propofol and FA oxidation antagonism designed to specifically inhibit FA oxidation could pave the way for a therapeutic approach for amelioration of cardiac injury.</p><p>The current experiment data presented herein supporting the hypothesis that low glucose concentration induced the formation of myocardial ROS through enhancing FA oxidation may represent the major mechanism by which propofol lost its cardioprotective effect against IRI. This may provide a mechanism whereby the effectiveness of propofol cardioprotection in patients is not consistent. Our study suggests a novel therapy against myocardial IRI under low glucose that single therapy could not achieve satisfied cardioprotection but the combination use of propofol and TMZ can get better recovery. The future work will have to be performed to fully characterize the relationship of low glucose concentration and propofol cardioprotection in the pathogenesis of IRI and TMZ applied as anti-ischemic agent requires further evaluation in the laboratory and clinical setting.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In summary, isolated rat hearts with low glucose concentration at 5.5&#x02009;mM lost sensitivity to propofol treatment through enhancing FA oxidation and oxidative stress and TMZ supplementation restored the sensitivity of isolated rat hearts to propofol that was concomitant with diminished myocardial IS, CK-MB release, ET-1, and 15-F2t-IsoP concentration as well as improved cardiac function.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) Grant (81401574 HL).</p></ack><sec><title>Disclosure</title><p>This research was presented in part at the Experimental Biology 2013 Conference at Boston, USA, April 2013, and published in part in abstract form in The FASEB Journal, 2013, 27:lb620.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conflict"><title>Conflict of Interests</title><p>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' Contribution</title><p>Xinhua Yao and Yalan Li contributed equally to this study.</p></sec><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mangano</surname><given-names>D.
