During surgery, the hypothermia pattern occurs as a rapid initial reduction of the core body temperature followed by a slow linear decline and eventually remains constant.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>The mechanism of reducing the core body temperature by anesthetics, vasodilatation, is a reduction of metabolic rate to 20-30%. The core body temperature includes the temperature of the head, body and limbs is 2-4&#x000b0;C lower than the core body temperature that is due to the tonic Thermoregulatory vasoconstriction in the environment, but anesthesia destroys the vasoconstriction and causes to transfer the heat to the environment. After the initial redistribution, the reduction of core body temperature becomes slow and it linearly decreases for 2-4 h that is due to losing heat more than producing metabolic heat.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Finally, plateau, which is created 4-3 h after the anesthesia onset is obtained that caused peripheral thermoregulatory vasoconstriction, which has been stimulated by the temperature of 33-35&#x000b0;C.</p><p>Hypothermia with inhaled anesthetics is created more than intravenous anesthetic drugs and it has been recommended monitoring temperature in patients undergoing surgery over 30 min and trying to keep the temperature higher than 36&#x000b0;.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Post-operative shivering differs between 5% and 65% depending upon the kind of general or regional anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The hypothermia complication includes coagulation disorder, increasing bleeding, requirement to allogeneic transfusion to 20%, wound infection by stimulating vasoconstriction, tissue hypoxia, delayed wound healing, increasing the length of hospitalization to 20%, the risk of myocardial ischemia during surgery, reducing the drugs metabolism and increasing the recovery period through this reduction.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Shivering complication includes an unpleasant feeling which can cause stress in patient, strain and pressure on the wound place and increase pain, body metabolism rate and as a result raises the oxygen consumption to 400% and sometimes up to 600% that leads to arterial hypoxemia raise in carbon dioxide production and lactic acidosis and increasing catecholamines in circulating blood.

The objective population consisted of patients with 18 to 70 years old and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I, II, under surgery by general anesthesia that took more than an hour and at most 2.5 h and those without renal or liver disease and lack of chronic use of acetaminophen, NSAID and opium drugs. Furthermore, patients needing a blood transfusion and receiving non-crystalloid fluids and having any sensitivity to paracetamol excluded from this study. Using the formula of estimating the sample size, the required sample size was determined (based of 5% alpha (1-Z1) and 20% beta (1-Z2) to compare two means with 32 individuals in each group of the patients were normotherm and have no fever with core temperature of 36.5 &#x000b1; 0.8 and peripheral temperature of 36.9 &#x000b1; 0.7. <italic>T</italic>-test showed that there was no difference in these factors (<italic>P</italic> = 0.013). The significant level was 0.05.</p><p>Patients with inclusion criteria were computerized randomly divided into two 32 populated groups that anesthesia technique and therapy fluid were similar in both groups. All patients have been kept NPO for 8 h and during this time, therapy fluid was performed according to 1, 2, 4 principle from 1.3 to 2.3 serums. Patients underwent routine monitoring. Before starting induction, during 20-min, patients in the intervention group were infused by 100 cc of normal saline with 1 g Paracetamol and patients in the control group were infused by 100 cc of normal saline and the peripheral temperature was measured before induction by the probe connected to monitoring in the operation room and the core temperature by tympanic thermometer. Then, the induction was conducted through 5-7 mg/kg sodium thiopental, 2 &#x003bc;g/kg Fentanyl and 0.6 mg/kg Atracurium and patients were intubated and the core and peripheral temperature were measured. Continuing anesthesia was done by 1-1.2% Isoflurane and 50%N2O and the core and peripheral temperature was taken every 10 min until &#x000bd; h and then every &#x000bd; h until the end of surgery during anesthesia. Atracurium was replicated if it was necessary. 0.1 mg/kg Morphine was given to patients at the beginning of operation and the temperature of the operation room was maintained between 22&#x000b0;C to 26&#x000b0;C and fluids injecting in patients were Crystalloids of isothermal with environment. During the surgery, all patients were covered by a cloth layer over the chest and legs areas. At the end of the operation, the patient was reversed by 0.02 mg/kg atropine and 0.04 mg/kg neostigmine, covered by a layer of a cotton blanket and transferred to the recovery room. The temperature of the recovery room was the same for all patients and no heating device was separately used. If the core temperature reached below 36&#x000b0;, hypothermia has been considered and at the same time with measuring the core and peripheral temperature, the score of shivering, nausea, pain, sedation vomiting incidence and drug complications was measured as entered in the recovery room and then every 10 min to an hour. Shivering grades was measured by crossly and Mahajan: 0 :No shivering, 1, piloerection or peripheral vasoconstriction but no visible shivering, 2 muscular activity in only one muscle group, 3 muscular activity in more than one muscle group, but not generalized shivering, 4 shivering involving the whole body.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In all patients, the basic value of parameters including the systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, pulse rate (PR), and oxygen saturation (O<sub>2</sub> sat) was recorded from the time of entering in recovery every 10 min to an hour. All patients received routine post-operative nursing care. In case of the incidence of hypotension (reduction in systolic pressure below 100 mmHg or 25% decrease in systolic pressure to base pressure of patient), it was treated by 10 cc/kg Lactate Ringer and 5 mg intravenous ephedrine and if PR reduced below 55 beats, 0.01 mg/kg intravenous Atropine would be injected to the patient and if it was necessary, it would be repeated with the maximum of 0.04 mg/kg.</p><p>Shivering with a score of 3 or 4 or taking more than 15 min and nausea and vomiting were treated by Pethidine 25 mg and intravenous Ondansetron 4 mg, respectively. Pain was measured with visual analog scale and if patient had score 3 and higher was treated by 25 mg of intravenous Pethidine. After full awakening, the patient was extubated and the extubation time (from discontinuing anesthetic drugs until extubation of the trachea) and stay in the recovery room were also recorded. Furthermore, the duration of anesthesia, extubation time and discharge time from recovery were recorded according to discharge criteria of Aldrete score:[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Score assigned a number of 0, 1, or 2 to five variables: Activity, respiration, circulation, consciousness and color. A score of 9 out of 10 was considered adequate for discharge from the PACU. To ensure the double-blindness of this study, only the injector person knew about the type of the drug and the person collecting data didn't know anything about the type of injected drug. In addition to the mentioned data, demographic information and total required parameters were recorded in the questionnaire prepared in advance.

In this study, two groups of 32 patients each candidate for upper limb surgery under general anesthesia, were studied. The two groups in terms of basic and demographic variables of age, sex, ASA, weight, fluid volume, operation time and length of stay in the recovery we&#x02019;re not significantly different. The confounding effect of these factors in this study was neutralized and the observed differences are likely due to the taken drug. Furthermore, given the obtained results, patient vital variables did not differ in terms of blood pressure and blood oxygen saturation. In other words, during anesthesia and recovery duration, taking Apotel had not adverse effect on the blood pressure of patients; however, changes in heart rate was significantly different in both groups and during this time, patients receiving Apotel had lower heart rate that the finding is likely due to reducing the pain intensity due to Apotel.</p><p>According to the results obtained from our study, patients receiving Apotel had lower core and peripheral temperatures than the control group which is consistent with the findings of other studies. In Stevonst <italic>et al</italic>. study on pediatric cardiac surgery, the prescription of 650 mg acetaminophen in normothermic individuals had significant effects on the core body temperature or starting Hypothermia.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Furthermore, in J van study conducted on stroke patients, daily using 6000 mg of Paracetamol has significantly reduced the body temperature after ischemic stroke while in Scotte study on stroke patients receiving 3900 mg of Paracetamol, Hypothermia had become more severe.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>The incidence of shivering in recovery room was another factor evaluated in the present study and during the patient stay in the recovery room, 43.8% of patients in the control group and 15.6% of patients receiving Apotel suffered from shivering and using Apotel could reduce the chance of incidence at the amount of 4.1 times due to Apotel effect on hypothalamus and the core body temperature that its mechanism is in hyperthermia by affecting on the synthesis of Prostaglandin.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>According to the results obtained from our study, patients receiving Apotel had less post-operative pain intensity than the control group and their score exiting from recovery was higher and also Apotel significantly affected post-operative pain, the score of recovery discharging, shortening the duration of stay in recovery and lowering extubation time. According to the results obtained from our study, patients receiving Apotel had less post-operative pain intensity than the control group and their score exiting from recovery was higher and also Apotel significantly affected post-operative pain, the score of recovery discharging, shortening the duration of stay in recovery and lowering extubation time. Hence, considering the beneficial effects and complications of Apotel, which mainly include reducing post-operative shivering and pain, using this drug as a pre-drug is recommended for patients under surgery with general anesthesia.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold>
