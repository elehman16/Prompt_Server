This situation, commonly referred to as immuno-virological discordance, mainly associated with a low CD4+ nadir, may lead to an increased risk of progression to AIDS defining illness and death [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. </p><p>It has been demonstrated that a lack of CD4 cells recovery and disease progression may be due to a persistent immune activation [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Several attempts of HAART intensification have been carried out to enhance the CD4 count recovery and the viral replication control. Some studies, like SILCAAT and ESPRIT, demonstrated that the use of interleukin IL-2 in association with antiretroviral therapy yielded no clinical benefit despite a substantial and sustained increase in the CD4+ cell count [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Abacavir, tenofovir, efavirenz and more recently raltegravir have been used as intensification drugs associated with HAART with no significant impact on the CD4+ cells rise [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. </p><p>One of the last antiretrovirals launched in the clinical arena was maraviroc (MVC), a CCR5 antagonist, that has been shown to have anti-inflammatory activity. The drug could have a potential role in the down-regulation of HIV-associated chronic inflammation by blocking the recirculation and trafficking of macrophages and monocyte-derived dendritic cells [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Few studies have been performed with MVC used as an intensification drug in patients with an insufficient immune response notwithstanding virological successes [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and few observations could be done due to the small number of enrolled patients. Here we present a multi-centric randomised trial involving 97 immunological non responder (INR) patients, where MVC was administered in 47 patients as intensification treatment with the aim of increasing their CD4 count and eventually improving their immune competence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080157.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080157.s002">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><p>Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The study was performed in accordance with The International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines and applicable local regulatory requirements and laws.</p><sec id="s2.1"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a multi-centric, randomized, parallel, open label, phase 4 superiority trial. The study was designed with a 48 week treatment period; enrollment started in April, 2009 and study completion was in April, 2011. One hundred and two HIV-1-infected adult patients were enrolled in 20 clinical centers coordinated by the Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences &#x0201c;Luigi Sacco&#x0201d;, Infectious Diseases Unit, University of Milan, Italy. Clinical trial identification n. NCT00884858 (registered on ClinicalTrials.gov).</p><p>At the screening visit, safety laboratory tests were conducted and previous antiretroviral treatment was assessed. Individual patients data and samples were collected and processed by each of the 20 participating clinical centers. At the time of randomization, eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive MVC for intensification of the current HAART regimen or HAART alone. The trial required a centre-stratified block-permuted randomization. The random allocation sequence was generated by the statistician. Study participants were enrolled by the physicians at the clinical centers and study participants were assigned to interventions by the coordinating center. MVC dose was decided according to the pharmaceutical company&#x02019;s indications based on drug-drug interactions with other antiretrovirals. Plasma HIV-RNA was amplified with Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor Kit v1.5 and quantified by ultrasensitive real time PCR; this was performed at the Tor Vergata University I.D. research laboratory. </p><p>Plasma and PBMCs samples were collected at screening, baseline, week 12, week 24 and week 48. Cell viability after thawing was assessed measuring 7AAD (Becton Dickinson) by flow cytometry (FC500 cytometer, Beckman Coulter). Only cells with viability &#x0003e;70% were used for the subsequent analyses. T-cells and PBMCs were drawn at the same time of day in all patients, in order to reduce the effect of diurnal variation. Tropism test was performed on PBMCs at screening on the available samples. For sequencing the HIV-1 gp120 V3 domain, HIV-1 DNA was extracted from 200 &#x003bc;L of PBMCs using a QIAamp DNA Minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), following the manufacturer's instructions. The HIV-1 <italic>env</italic> fragment including the V3 region was amplified by PCR using gp-120 primers and the Trugene core reagents kit (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc., Deerfield, IL, USA) [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Tropism testing was performed in single and FPR cut-off was 20%. This analysis was performed at the Luigi Sacco virology laboratory.</p></sec><sec id="s2.2"><title>Study population</title><p>All the enrolled patients were at least 18 years-old, HIV-1 infected adults with a CD4+ count <underline>&#x0003c;</underline>200/&#x000b5;L and/or CD4+ recovery &#x02264;25% and HIV-RNA constantly &#x0003c;50 cp/mL who had been experiencing a HAART regimen for at least one year.</p></sec><sec id="s2.3"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The central ethical approval, as communicated to the Italian Ministry of Health was provided by the Comitato Etico per la Sperimentazione Clinica (IRB) at &#x0201c;Luigi Sacco&#x0201d; Hospital, Milan, Italy.

A complete list of the IRBs is available as a supporting information file.</p></sec><sec id="s2.4"><title>Efficacy analyses</title><p>The study&#x02019;s primary endpoint involved the evaluation of the CD4+ cell count change from baseline to week 12 and week 48. In particular we established a simple endpoint that was the achievement of a CD4+ count &#x0003e; 200 cells/&#x000b5;L at two different measurements, and a composite endpoint including the achievement of a CD4 count&#x0003e; 200 cells/&#x000b5;L and a CD4+ cells recovery &#x0003e;25%. The endpoints were defined completely satisfied when HIV-RNA remained constantly &#x0003c;50 copies/mL over time.</p></sec><sec id="s2.5"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Lymphocyte surface phenotypes were evaluated by flow cytometry on frozen PBMCs (FC500; Beckman Coulter, Hialeah, FL), with the following fluorochrome-labelled antibodies: CD4-PE-Cy7, CD8-PE-Cy5, CD38-PE, HLA-DR-FITC, CD127-PE (Instrumentation Laboratory, Milan, Italy), CD45RA-FITC, CD62L-PE, Ki67-FITC, 7-AAD (Becton Dickinson Italia, Milan, Italy). We measured activation (HLA-DR/CD38) proliferation (Ki67), differentiation (CD127) and maturation (CD45RA/CD62L) on CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. The following combinations were used: CD4/CD8/CD38/HLA-DR, CD8/CD4/Ki67, CD8/CD4/CD127 and CD8/CD4/CD45RA/CD62L. All immunological analyses were performed in the Laboratory at the Clinic of Infectious Diseases, University of Milano, San Paolo &#x0201c;Hospital&#x0201d;. The laboratory is fully equipped with all the reagents and supplies required for processing and studying PBMCs and plasma samples. </p></sec><sec id="s2.6"><title>ELISA assays</title><p>Plasma levels of Interleukin (IL)-7 were quantified by commercially available ELISA (R&#x00026;D System, Minneapolis, MN), according to manufacturer's instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s2.7"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>We hypothesized 5% of &#x0201c;responder&#x0201d; patients in the control arm and &#x003b4; = 20% in the immunological response between the 2 arms favoring the maraviroc arm (responder patients in the maraviroc arm = 25%) at week 48. For this superiority study we set the power as 1-&#x003b2;=80% with one-side &#x003b1;=0.05, thus 50 patients per arm were necessary, after considering protocol and screening violations and subjects lost to follow-up. Comparison of CD4+ and CD8+ count between the study arms A and B and at the different time-points were assessed by t-test for independent and dependent samples respectively in an intention to treat (ITT) analysis. Statistical evaluation of simple and composite endpoints was analyzed by binary logistic regression models for the odds ratio estimation and the related 95% confidence intervals. Odds ratios of the MVC arm was also controlled in the regression models for CD4+ counts at baseline, due to unbalancing though not statistically significant, of this parameter in the two study arms. Statistical significance level was estimated by Wald test and was set at .05 for all of the analyses. In the per-protocol (PP) analysis, patients who dropped the study or switched treatment were included until their last observation in the randomization arm. Baseline characteristics were collected and analyzed through chi-square, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test and Mann Whitney U non-parametric test.</p><p>Immunological parameters at baseline (T0), after 12 (w12) and 48 weeks (w48) of MVC intensification were analyzed with GraphPad 5 PRISM software (version 5). All continuous variables were presented as median and interquartile ranges (25<sup>th</sup>-75<sup>th</sup> percentile). The Mann Whitney U test was used for the comparison of immunological parameters (CD127, CD45RA, Ki67, HLA-DR, CD38 on CD4 and CD8 and plasma IL-7) between the 2 groups (<named-content content-type="gene">ARM A</named-content>

In particular we didn&#x02019;t observe any particular differences between arm A and B at week 12 and 48 with the exception of a slight increase of the CD4+ cells count in arm A at week 12 which was not confirmed at week 48. A CD4+ T-cells recovery at the early stage of MVC intensification was reported in other studies.</p><p>Massanella et al [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] demonstrated that na&#x000ef;ve HIV- infected patients got a significant CD4+ count gain at week 12 when HAART was intensified with MVC. This trend was not confirmed at week 48. Cossarini et al [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] demonstrated a significant increase of CD4+ cells in multi-experienced patients who intensified HAART with MVC versus those on HAART +darunavir/ritonavir. </p><p>A temporary increase of the CD4+ cells during the first period of MVC intake could be explained by a possible reduction of activated CCR5+ T-cells as a result of the CCR5 co-receptor blockage associated with viral suppression. This situation can promote a temporary CD4+ cell release from the lymphoid reservoir to plasma by a type of &#x0201c;redistribution&#x0201d; phenomenon. Another explanation could be that MVC blockage of the co-receptor can lead to a longer survival of CD4+ cells by modulating the apoptotic process or some other unknown mechanism as shown in a study lead by Wilkin et al. [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] </p><p>HIV-RNA ultrasensitive quantification didn&#x02019;t seem to be influenced by MVC intake over-time. A significant decrease of HIV-RNA was seen at W48 in ARM B; although the sample of patients was limited compared to the entire study cohort. This data may be explained by improving adherence within the control group after the enrollment period of the study. </p><p>Some interesting results among the immunological markers should be cautiously interpreted due to inflation of type I errors caused by multiplicity. </p><p>We didn&#x02019;t find any change of na&#x000ef;ve (CD45RA+) and memory (CD45RA-) CD4+ cells. Differently an increase of activation markers expression on CD4+ T-cells, HLA-DR and CD38, was seen at week 12 and better at week 48 (p=0.047). This finding confirmed what Hunt et al [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] had already demonstrated. In their study a population of &#x0201c;immunological non-responders&#x0201d; that intensified a HAART regimen with MVC showed an increase of the cellular activation both in the CD4+ and CD8+ cells of peripheral blood and more significantly in gut mucosa samples.</p><p>They also observed an increased expression of CCR5 on CD4+ and CD8+ cells suggesting that compensatory increases in CCR5 ligands might activate macrophages and that T cells through alternative chemokine receptors should be further explored. Hunt and colleagues studied the effect of MVC on MIP1&#x003b2; and evidenced an increase in its level over-time which returned to baseline upon MVC cessation [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>We found a significant increase of CD8&#x000f7; cells in the intensification arm at week 12(p= 0.009) and week 48 (p=0.025). Immunological analyses performed on CD8 didn&#x02019;t show any particular change in the na&#x000ef;ve and memory CD8+ cells. The analysis of cellular activation of these cells through evaluation of HLA-DR and CD38 showed an increased expression of these markers in arm A at week 12 but not at week 48. Our observation was concordant with what Hunt et al had described. A more powerful action of MVC on CD8+ cells can be justified by a higher presence of CCR5 coreceptor on CD8+ than on CD4+ cells [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Blockage of CD8+ cells migration from peripheral blood to the tissues would allow their pool expansion. This had been observed in our study at week 12 and week 48. This conclusion has not been supported by other studies where a reduction of CD8+cells activation and loss of monocytes were seen in a population using MVC as intensification [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] or as a component of HAART [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A further consideration on the increase in CD8+ lymphocytes is that their redistribution could indeed represent an improvement of the immune system without mirroring an increased viral production. We did not observe any change of the proliferation marker Ki67+ at week 48, although a significant increase of this marker was unexpectedly seen at week 12 in arm B (p=.048). One limitation of the results for this parameter was the small size of the samples available for T-cell proliferation measurements; further analyses should be performed to confirm these preliminary data.</p><p>An increase of IL-7 level in arm A could suggest an effect of MVC in maintaining T-lymphocyte homeostasis through T-lymphocyte production in a milieu of stable turnover of peripheral T-cells, as evidenced by the absence of Ki67+ change over time, although Bonferroni analysis did not confirm a significant difference between the 2 arms. Whether or not raised IL-7 translates into increased <italic>de novo</italic> T-cell production [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] is not clear from our data, as we didn&#x02019;t evaluate thymic output.</p><p>We also found an increased expression of IL-7 receptor on CD4+ cells in MVC-receiving patients; the finding of an inverse trend on CD8+ cells suggest diverse IL-7R regulation on circulating CD4+ and CD8+ upon MVC administration. This different behavior of IL-7R on CD8+ may be caused by a possible down-regulation of cell-surface receptor expression in the presence of raised levels of plasma IL-7. Further studies are warranted to better unravel the diverse regulation of IL-7/IL-7R axis upon MVC administration and by investigating the effect of MVC on IL-7R expression inducers and inhibitors [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>MVC intensification of HAART did not show a significant efficacy in satisfying both the simple and composite endpoints with the intention to treat analysis adjusted with the CD4+ cells at baseline, although a trend towards the achievement of the simple endpoint was seen at week 48 in the on treatment analysis (p=0.076). The estimates of odds ratios resulted quite identical also when applying LOCF methods in the ITT analysis (data not shown). Of note, the subjects in the control arm achieved a CD4+ response higher than expected when the study was designed. Nevertheless, an interesting observation came up when we stratified the analysis according to patients with CD4+ cell count less than 200 cells/&#x000b5;L at baseline: we found the statistical significant achievement of simple and composite endpoints (p=0.048, OR 3.93, 95% confidence interval from 1.01 to 15.28).</p><p>Other studies tried to evaluate the immune system response to a HAART intensification with MVC in immunological non-responder patients [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. All of these studies did not have a control arm, exhibited discordant results in increasing CD4+ cell counts, and had an observation period shorter than our study.</p><p>In our study, MVC was discontinued in 2/47 subjects and demonstrated a satisfactory control of viral replication: virological failures were seen equally in arms A and B.</p><p>There are several limitations to this study. This was a randomized trial which did not imply a placebo drug intake in the control arm. Changes in the immune response in arm A could have been influenced by a sort of &#x0201c;placebo effect&#x0201d; due to the consciousness of taking a forth drug in the regimen. Immunophenotyping analyses were performed on cryo-preserved PBMCs: the freezing process may have damaged the expression of cell surface proteins. Data on CD8 subsets would be interesting; unfortunately central <italic>vs</italic> effector memory CD8 phenotyping could not be addressed because there was no remaining biological material at the time when the original samples were taken. A number of confounding factors, such as different sample processing, shipping conditions, samples storage and lab blood tests data collected from several centers could have interfered with the quality of results. Moreover, 20% of our patients discontinued the study for several reasons and this could have impaired the final results of the protocol.</p><p>Although CD4+ T-cell counts improved in the MVC intensification arm, the primary end-points were not satisfied in this population of immunological non responders. MVC showed to be efficient in increasing the CD8+ cell count; this might mean a better recovery of the cell-mediated immunity and therefore a reduction of AIDS and non-AIDS related events. Further analyses are needed to confirm this last hypothesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0080157.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
