are a result of advancements of industrial society, and a lack of exercise. Excessively
sedentary lifestyles cause weakening of the abdominal muscles and poor posture, as well as
physical imbalance. Spinal deformity due to these factors can cause serious health problems
and low back pain<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular,
excessive biomechanical burdens due to a sedentary lifestyle can induce weakening of
abdominal muscles, general muscle weakening, instability of spinal joints, pain in the
lumbar spine, reduced endurance, and restriction of flexibility and joint range of motion
(ROM)<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Abnormal posture can cause various problems, including flat-back syndrome, cervical
kyphosis, and local organ ailments, such as uterine prolapse and gastric herniation<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. One of the main deep muscles for lumbar
stability is the transversus abdominis<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. A
number of studies have reported the importance of the transversus abdominis, which
contributes significantly to lumbar stability and posture<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>To improve reduced lumbar stability caused by modern sedentary lifestyles, running in place
while contracting the transverse abdominis and the multifidus through abdominal drawing-in
has been recommended. Exercises similar to running in place, such as plyometrics<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, circuit training<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, and core stability exercises<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, have been proposed. These exercises improve trunk muscle strength
and flexibility because they strengthen the core muscles that together maintain lumbar
stability<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. A number of studies on
postural improvement can be found in the literature. These include lumbo-pelvic
stabilization and postural improvement through bridge exercises<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> and various mat exercises<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, lumbar stabilization improvement through running in place<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, and gait improvement<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>However, plyometrics, circuit training, core stability exercises, bridge exercises, and mat
exercises require systematic programs under the supervision of experts, as well as equipment
and appropriate locations for the exercises. Because of these drawbacks, typical students
and workers cannot employ such exercises for the purpose of postural correction. In
contrast, running in place can conveniently be done regardless of time and location.
Although studies on running in place have been conducted to report on lumbar stability
improvement, none have been conducted on running in place to verify postural
improvements.</p><p>Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effects or running in place, which can be done
regardless of time and place and without the aid of tools or equipment, for six weeks on
postural changes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study choose 30 university students and randomly divided them into a training group (2
males and 13 females) that participated in running in place and a control group (2 males and
13 females) that did not run in place. The selection criteria were as follows: no structural
abnormality of the spine before participation in the experiment, no pain in the spine (such
as low back pain), no medication, no neurological diseases, no drinking before the
experiment, and not overweight. Those who performed weight training, which can affect
posture, and those who performed regular exercise were excluded from the experiment. This
study was approved by university&#x02019;s institutional review board and the subjects were safely
protected during all of the processes of the experiment. All of the subjects understood the
purpose of this study and provided written informed consent prior to participation in the
study in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. The mean age,
height, and weight of the training group were 22.6&#x000b1;0.3&#x02005;years, 161.5&#x000b1;3.1&#x02005;cm, and 56.3&#x000b1;6.5&#x02005;kg
respectively. The mean age, height, and weight of the control group were 21.8&#x000b1;0.6&#x02005;years,
162.5&#x000b1;5.3&#x02005;cm, and 56.2&#x000b1;5.3&#x02005;kg respectively. Analysis of gender was done by &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>
test, and analysis of age, height, and weight was done by independent t-test. In the
analysis, no statistically significant difference was found (p&#x0003e;0.05), so that no issues
were found to be homogeneous between the two groups.</p><p>To maintain correct posture while running in place, a 30 &#x000d7; 30-cm square mark was placed on
the floor and the subjects were positioned in its center. The subjects kept their waists
straight and looked to the front by pulling in the chin, thereby maintaining the neutral
position of the cervical spine. They contracted the transverse abdominis and multifidus
muscles through abdominal drawing-in in order to maintain a neutral position of the waist
and pelvis and ran in place in the limited square space without wobbling to the front, back,
right, or left. To apply the principle of incremental loads and an appropriate
exercise-strength setup, only two sets were performed during the first and second weeks out
of a total of six weeks, and three sets were performed during the third to sixth weeks. Each
set consisted of 20 running units followed by a 15-sec rest, 20 running units followed by a
15-sec rest, 30 running units followed by a 20-sec rest, 30 running units followed by a
20-sec rest, and then 30 running units. A 3-min rest was given between sets. One running
unit was defined as the feet touching the ground one after the other. The speed of running
in place was set to 17 running units per 10 sec<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. A 5-min warm-up was conducted before the main exercise began and
light stretching was conducted as a cooldown after the main exercise for 5&#x02005;min, resulting in
30&#x02005;min of exercise three times a week for six weeks. The subjects in the control group
performed their normal daily routines without any particular exercise and were subjected to
two sets of measurements.</p><p>To measure posture, BackMapper (ABW, Frickenhausen, Germany), a three-dimensional-image
spine diagnostic system, was used. This equipment can measure the shape and location of the
spine, and the degree of twist in the pelvis relatively precisely, by viewing the spine from
the front, back, lower, and upper sides, as well as in the sagittal plane. It can also
analyze trunk inclination (TIN) in the sagittal plane, trunk imbalance (TIM) in the coronal
plane, pelvic position (PPO), pelvic torsion (PTO), pelvic rotation (PRO) in the horizontal
plane, and position of the scapulae (PSA) by showing the muscles, fat distribution, position
of the skeleton, and various other factors.</p><p>The measured data were analyzed with the SPSS 12.0 KO statistical program, and the
collected data are presented as means and standard deviations. The paired t-test was used as
a significance test in each group before and after the experiments, and an independent
t-test was used as a significance test for between-group differences. The significance
level, &#x003b1;, was set at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Comparison of the results between the training group and the control group before and after

functions but also posture and outer appearance<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effect of running in
place on postural correction for normal adults. Running in place can reduce muscle fatigue
and put loads on various muscles, thereby improving aerobic exercise ability and muscle
strength at the same time, as well as strengthening the trunk and abdominal muscles that
contribute to lumbar stabilization<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
addition, it can improve trunk muscle strength and flexibility and changes in posture by
improving gait and lumbar stability due to the dynamic motion of the lower and upper body.
Exercises similar to running in place, such as Pilates, core stabilization exercises,
plyometrics, and circuit training have been previously studied. Endleman reported that
performance of intensive Pilates that focused on the core by 18 healthy adult females and
eight adult males for six months resulted in a significant difference in the transversus
abdominis after measuring its muscle thickness and in the internal oblique abdominis,
thereby proving the positive effect of core training on abdominal strength and trunk
stabilization<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Brill proposed that
core stabilization exercises can maintain spinal balance based on contraction of the
transverse abdominis, thereby increasing lumbar muscle strength and stability<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Myer proved that plyometrics and core
stabilization exercises were effective in controlling the nerve roots and muscle power by
having female high school athletes perform such exercises three times a week for seven
weeks<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In a study on postural changes, Cho placed 15 female university students into a pelvic
adjustment group and 15 female university students into a stretching group and then
performed pelvic adjustment through the Gonstead technique, which had a positive effect on
postural changes<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a study on running
in place, Cho and Jun divided 30 participants into a training group and a control group,
each containing 15 subjects; the training group performed running in place for six weeks and
the results showed improved dynamic lumbar stability<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Cho reported that running in place can improve step length
difference, swing phase difference, single support difference, and step time difference<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Comparison of the results of the training group and the control group before and after the
experiment in the present study showed that the training group had statistically significant
changes in TIN, TIM, PPO, PTO, and PSA, while the control group had no statistically
significant changes in any items. These results showed that running in place can improve
mobility of the waist and pelvis, which are related to posture. They also showed that
positive changes in posture can occur as a result of running in place, accompanied by
dynamic movements in the upper and lower extremities, in a square-shape space with no
wobbling while maintaining muscle contraction of the transversus abdominis and applying the
abdominal drawing-in method. Although various exercise methods for postural correction have
been proposed previously, the methods required systematic programs under the supervision of
experts, as well as equipment and appropriate locations for the exercises. Therefore, we
expect that running in place can be utilized as an exercise for postural correction by
students or workers in the clinical field who are restricted by time and place.</p><p>This research was supported by Korea Nazarene University Research Grants in 2015.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by Korea Nazarene University Research Grants in 2015.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Bae</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name><name><surname>Jang</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>SH</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>A comparison study on the change in lumbar lordosis when
