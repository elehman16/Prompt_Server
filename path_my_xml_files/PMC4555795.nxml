Despite one's best efforts, mechanical aids fail to adequately remove plaque biofilm, for which chemical plaque control is often recommended as an adjunct to mechanical plaque control to help maintain gingival health.</p><p>A number of chemical agents like phenolic compounds, bis-biguanides, pyrimidines, quaternary ammonium compounds, oxygenating agents, halogens, heavy metal salts which have antiseptic or antimicrobial action have been used, with variable success, to inhibit plaque formation and the development of gingivitis.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Chlorhexidine (CHX) is the most studied and effective antiseptic for plaque inhibition and prevention of gingivitis when used twice daily as mouth rinse.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] CHX besides its side effects including: Brown discoloration of the teeth, some restorative materials and mucosa; bitter taste and a slight increase in supragingival calculus formation is known as &#x0201c;Gold Standard&#x0201d; of antimicrobial rinses because of broad-spectrum activity and substantivity of 8&#x02013;12 h.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>In order to overcome such side effects the World Health Organization advice researchers to investigate the possible use of natural products such as herb and plant extracts. A number of clinical studies have shown the effects of using mouthwashes extracted from herbs such as <italic>Myrtus communis</italic>, <italic>Qureucus infectoria</italic>, <italic>Capparis spinosa</italic>, and Cinnamon in the prevention of dental plaque accumulation and subsequent gingival inflammation.</p><p>There is the minimum evidence that proves the efficacy of herbal mouth rinses and their ability to control plaque-induced gingivitis. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical changes after the usage of herbal oral rinse and 0.12% CHX.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This randomized controlled clinical trial was carried out in the Department of Periodontology and Implantology, M A Rangoonwala College of Dental Sciences and Research Center, Pune.</p><p>The study population consisted of 152 individuals, who were systemically healthy, between 20 and 50 years of age and with moderate to severe plaque-induced gingivitis were enrolled in the study. They were equally distributed in the test (<italic>n</italic> = 76) and the control group (<italic>n</italic> = 76). Participants were excluded from the study if they suffered from nonplaque induced gingivitis or periodontitis, history of antibiotic use and use of any form of herbal products in the last 90 days, need for antibiotic premedication, patients using mouth rinse within the last 3 months, pregnant women, habit of smoking or any form of smokeless tobacco and with systemic diseases.

Oral hygiene instructions were given to all the participants at the baseline. The selected individuals underwent scaling following the baseline measurements. All the patients in Group I and Group II were instructed to use the assigned mouth rinse 15 ml twice daily for 30 s in conjunction to their normal oral hygiene routine. Participants from both the groups were advised to use the Colgate<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> medium bristle toothbrush and Colgate Total<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> toothpaste.</p><p>Patients were recalled at weekly interval to check for the oral hygiene and the oral hygiene was reinforced in noncompliant patients.

Research by Kaim <italic>et al.</italic> suggests that there are certain ingredients in herbal oral rinses that exhibit evidence of anti-inflammatory and anti-fungal therapeutics effects.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] <italic>S. persica</italic> (Meswak) prevents dental plaque accumulation and subsequent gingival inflammation. It is a medicinal plant that has been used by many people in Africa, South America, Middle East and Asia. <italic>S. persica</italic> contains a number of identified antimicrobials and prophylactic components including fluorides, alkaloids, sulfur compounds and volatile oils such as benzyl isothiocyanate. They alter the characteristics of the early plaque settlers <italic>Streptococcus sanguinis</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus mitis</italic> and <italic>Actinomyces</italic> species and make them less adherent. This could account for a significant reduction in the binding capacity by the extracts. The anionic components <italic>S. persica</italic> has an antimicrobial activity against <italic>Streptococcus aureus</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus fecalis</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas Aeruginosa</italic>, and <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. In this regards, Almas <italic>et al.</italic> compared antimicrobial activity of eight commercially available mouth rinses and 50% Miswak extract against seven microorganisms. They found that mouth rinses containing CHX had the maximum antibacterial activity while Miswak extract had low antibacterial activity.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Hydrochavicol in <italic>P. betle</italic> inhibits expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;, disrupts the permeability barrier of the microbial membrane of <italic>S. mutans</italic> and <italic>Actinomyces</italic> species and also has an astringent action. Gallic acid in bibhitika has an astringent action. Methyl salicylate in Gandharpura taila, cineole in Ela, thymol in Yavani and menthol in Peppermint satva impart a fragrant and refreshing effect. Additional research conducted by Scherer <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that herbal oral rinse reduced gingival bleeding after 3 months of use as compared to placebo.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Chlorhexidine is effective against an array of microorganisms including Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, fungi, yeast and viruses. It is bacteriostatic at low concentration and bactericidal at high concentrations. The ability of an oral rinse to be retained in the oral cavity and maintain potency over an extended length of time has been debated. Lang stated the substantivity of an antimicrobial agent needs sufficient contact time with a microorganism in order to inhibit or kill it.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] CHX, with a substantivity of 12 h is considered to be highly effective; whereas, the substantivity of herbal mouth rinse is unknown.</p><p>Hence, in the present study, comparison was made between herbal oral rinse (Hiora<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) and 0.12% CHX (Peridex<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) to see their effectiveness. In this study, there was a statistically significant reduction in the proportion of gingival index scores and plaque index scores in the CHX group. These results correlate with studies done by Southern <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and Malhotra <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] However, in a study done by Chatterjee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] herbal oral rinse is equally effective in reducing periodontal indices as CHX. However, there is not enough statistically significant evidence to suggest that herbal oral rinse had a greater effect in reducing gingival index scores. With the proliferation of herbal oral care products, it is important for clinicians to make evidence-based decisions when making product recommendations.</p><p>Research needs to be conducted to determine the substantivity of herbal mouth rinse as well as to determine its antimicrobial effects on gingivitis, plaque biofilm accumulation, and related bacteria. Suggestions for future studies include: (1) Expand study population to include broader disease status, and varied age group (2) extend study to 6 months (3) add stains and calculus indices.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Within the limitations of the study when herbal oral rinse was compared to 0.12% CHX, 0.12% CHX mouth rinse effectively reduced the clinical symptoms of plaque-induced gingivitis, and had a statistically significant effect on the reduction of plaque scores.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><p>Our heartfelt thanks to teaching and non-teaching staff of the Department of Periodontics, M A Rangoonwala College of Dental Sciences and Research Centre, Pune for all the help and facilities provided for this study.
