However, effective haemoglobin (Hb) maintenance can be challenging with epoetin alfa and epoetin beta administered at extended intervals. C.E.R.A., a continuous erythropoietin receptor activator, has a unique pharmacologic profile and long half-life (&#x0223c;130 h), allowing administration at extended intervals. Phase III results have demonstrated that C.E.R.A. administered once every 4 weeks effectively maintains stable Hb levels in patients with CKD on dialysis.</p><p><bold>Methods.</bold> STRIATA (Stabilizing haemoglobin TaRgets in dialysis following IV C.E.R.A. Treatment for Anaemia) was a multicentre, open-label randomized phase III study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous C.E.R.A. administered once every 2 weeks (Q2W) for Hb maintenance following direct conversion from darbepoetin alfa (DA). Adult patients on dialysis receiving stable intravenous DA once weekly (QW) or Q2W were randomized (1:1) to continue their current DA regimen (<italic>n</italic> = 156) or receive intravenous C.E.R.A. Q2W (<italic>n</italic> = 157) for 52 weeks. Doses were adjusted to maintain Hb levels within &#x000b1; 1.0 g/dl of baseline and between 10.0 and 13.5 g/dl. The primary endpoint was the mean Hb change between baseline and the evaluation period (weeks 29&#x02013;36).</p><p><bold>Results.</bold> Most patients (&#x0003e;80%) received DA QW before randomization. The mean (95% CI) difference between C.E.R.A. and DA in the primary endpoint was 0.18 g/dl (&#x02212;0.05, 0.41), within a pre-defined non-inferiority limit. C.E.R.A. was clinically non-inferior to DA (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) in maintaining Hb levels. Both treatments were well tolerated.</p><p><bold>Conclusions.</bold> Stable Hb levels were successfully maintained in patients on haemodialysis directly converted to Q2W intravenous C.E.R.A. from DA.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>anaemia</kwd><kwd>C.E.R.A.</kwd><kwd>darbepoetin alfa</kwd><kwd>dialysis</kwd><kwd>haemoglobin</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Anaemia secondary to chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with increased hospitalization and decreased survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1 R2">1,2</xref>], increased burden of cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3 R4">3,4</xref>] and reduced quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5 R6">5,6</xref>]. Despite improvements, large observational studies such as the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS) indicate that anaemia remains prevalent in patients receiving dialysis; therefore, there is a need to increase the proportions of patients achieving guideline haemoglobin (Hb) targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. With the growing prevalence of CKD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8 R9">8,9</xref>], new approaches are required to improve the efficiency of anaemia management without increasing the workload of healthcare staff.</p><p>Extended administration intervals represent an opportunity to simplify treatment and improve the efficiency of anaemia management. For example, the preliminary results of a recent observational study indicated that extending the administration interval from three times weekly to once weekly (QW) was associated with substantial time savings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. It was estimated that 350 h of physician/nurse time per year could be saved in a centre with 50 dialysis patients. Extended administration intervals may also offer benefits for patients with CKD. If administration intervals could be successfully extended beyond QW for all patients, the resulting time savings could enable healthcare providers to spend more time focusing on other aspects of CKD management, including patient education, and to address other modifiable risk factors, such as hypertension and mineral balance.</p><p>C.E.R.A., a continuous erythropoietin receptor activator, is indicated in the European Union for once-monthly maintenance of Hb levels in patients with CKD. C.E.R.A. has different receptor binding characteristics to established erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11 R12">11,12</xref>] and a long half-life of &#x0223c;130 h following intravenous and subcutaneous administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. In phase II and phase III studies in patients with CKD on dialysis, C.E.R.A. effectively maintained stable Hb levels when administered once every 4 weeks (Q4W) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14 R15 R16">14&#x02013;16</xref>].</p><p>STRIATA (Stabilizing haemoglobin TaRgets in dialysis following IV C.E.R.A.

During the safety observation period, doses were adjusted to maintain the Hb levels within 11&#x02013;13 g/dl. It should be noted that the target Hb ranges chosen for this study were agreed by consensus of the Steering Committee based on contemporary anaemia treatment guidelines; the study was completed before the publication of the CHOIR study which prompted safety concerns regarding the maintenance of Hb levels &#x0003e;13 g/dl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>].</p><p>Dose adjustments were permitted for safety at any point during the study. Unless safety concerns dictated otherwise, dose adjustments were performed at the next scheduled dosing day so that the administration interval remained unchanged throughout the study.

Dose adjustments for DA were performed according to its approved labelling (i.e. 25% dose increase or decrease based on the Hb value), but maintaining the target Hb and the interval between dose adjustments the same as for C.E.R.A.

Additional efficacy parameters included mean Hb over time, mean Hb by study period, intrapatient Hb variability (mean within-patient standard deviations for Hb) during the dose titration, evaluation and safety observation periods and the number of patients requiring dose adjustments. Safety parameters included adverse event (AE) reporting, vital signs, laboratory haematology and blood chemistry (including iron), immunogenicity testing and electrocardiograms.</p></sec><sec id="S2-5"><title>Assessments</title><p>Patients were assessed weekly during the screening/ baseline, dose-titration and evaluation periods, and every other week during the safety observation period.

Q2W was non-inferior to DA (primary efficacy parameter). This assumes a true difference between the C.E.R.A. and DA groups not greater than 0.3&#x000a0;g/dl, a common standard deviation for both groups of 1.0&#x000a0;g/dl and a drop-out/major protocol violation rate of 20%.</p><p>Non-inferiority was tested by calculating the difference in the primary efficacy parameter (mean Hb change between baseline and the evaluation period) for patients randomized to treatment with C.E.R.A. and DA. Two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for this difference were calculated by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), using treatment group as the independent variable and adjusting for covariates that might influence Hb response (baseline Hb and geographic region). Non-inferiority of C.E.R.A. versus DA could be concluded if the lower limit of the 95% CI was &#x02265;&#x02212;0.75 g/dl. In setting the &#x02212;0.75 g/dl Hb threshold for the lower limit of the 95% CI (around the mean group difference), it was expected that the observed mean difference between the groups would be markedly &#x0003c;0.75 g/dl (according to the anticipated level of variability) and at a level not regarded as being clinically significant.</p><p>The primary efficacy analysis was conducted on the per-protocol (PP) population (patients without major protocol violations or withdrawal) and was confirmed on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (all randomized patients).</p><p>Secondary and additional efficacy analyses were performed on the ITT population and summarized using descriptive methods. The last observation carried forward approach was used for missing data. In the case of RBC transfusions, the Hb value measured before the transfusion was used. Safety assessments, which included AE reporting, laboratory assessments of iron parameters and blood chemistry and monitoring of vital signs, were examined in the safety population (all patients who received at least one dose of study medication and had a safety follow-up assessment), and group summary statistics were calculated.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S3"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3-1"><title>Patients</title><p>Patients were recruited from 48 centres in 12 countries in Europe, Australia and Canada.

In addition, the results confirm that the simple dosing conversion scheme based on previous DA dose was effective in providing stable Hb maintenance for patients converting from DA to Q2W C.E.R.A. Patients in STRIATA successfully maintained mean Hb levels within the 10.0&#x02013;13.5 g/dl target range, with the primary efficacy analysis demonstrating non-inferiority of C.E.R.A. relative to DA (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) for Hb maintenance in patients receiving dialysis.</p><p>Important features of this study are the randomized, parallel-group design and the inclusion of patients with considerable co-morbidities, which can be considered representative of the general dialysis population. The study design was conceived and developed with the intention of testing the hypothesis that intravenous C.E.R.A. is non-inferior to intravenous DA for Hb maintenance in patients on dialysis. The study recruited patients who had undergone previous anaemia treatment to Hb levels within the target ranges recommended by contemporary guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17 R18">17,18</xref>], and the aim was to maintain Hb levels within similar target ranges following randomization.</p><p>Since the completion of STRIATA, new evidence has become available which has prompted safety concerns over the targeting of Hb levels &#x0003e;13 g/dl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19 R20">19,20</xref>]. While no correlations between Hb concentrations and safety outcomes were observed in STRIATA, the study was not designed to address such questions. The results from STRIATA suggest that Q2W intravenous C.E.R.A. can maintain Hb levels within a specified target range as effectively as intravenous DA.</p><p>During the evaluation period, Hb was maintained within &#x000b1;1 g/dl of baseline in approximately two-thirds of patients, and intrapatient Hb variability, a measure of individual stability of Hb levels, was comparable between treatment groups during the titration, evaluation and safety observation periods. It is noteworthy that while patients in the reference group, who had previously been maintained on DA, continued to be successfully maintained, those patients randomized to C.E.R.A. also maintained stable Hb levels despite the change in therapy and, in most patients, treatment interval.</p><p>RBC transfusions, which were assessed as a secondary efficacy parameter, were low and similar across treatment groups supporting the non-inferiority result obtained in the primary efficacy analysis. The observed transfusion rates of 10&#x02013;12% are consistent with those reported by other investigators in a similar patient population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. C.E.R.A. was generally well tolerated, with a similar safety profile to that of DA. Most AEs were considered to be unrelated to study medication and were consistent with common AEs associated with this patient population. Considered together, these findings indicate that Q2W intravenous C.E.R.A. offers comparable Hb control with similar safety and tolerability to the comparator DA.</p><p>Anaemia is a common complication of CKD, and despite advances in care since the introduction of the first ESAs, further improvements in the proportions of patients achieving and maintaining guideline targets for Hb concentration are still possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Moreover, within the context of clinical practice, there is a need to optimize the efficiency of anaemia management to ensure that nephrology clinics can continue to provide effective care for a growing patient population. One approach to realizing such efficiency is to reduce the administration frequency of ESAs. Preclinical and pharmacokinetic studies indicate that the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of C.E.R.A. may enable administration at extended intervals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12 R13">12,13</xref>]. This hypothesis is supported by the results from STRIATA, as well as other phase III [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15 R16">15,16</xref>] and phase II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>] clinical studies, in which intravenous and subcutaneous C.E.R.A. effectively maintained Hb levels in patients with CKD on dialysis when administered Q4W.</p><p>In summary, results from STRIATA confirm that stable Hb levels can be maintained with comparable variability in patients with CKD on haemodialysis who convert to intravenous C.E.R.A. Q2W from intravenous DA QW or Q2W. The time savings estimated to arise from reductions in administration frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] could represent an important benefit in clinical practice, facilitating greater efficiency of anaemia management and enabling healthcare providers to devote more time to other aspects of patient care. Although the debate surrounding optimal Hb targets is ongoing and further evolution of anaemia treatment guidelines is anticipated, the findings from STRIATA should offer confidence that intravenous C.E.R.A. can maintain stable Hb levels within a pre-specified target range.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app><title>Appendix</title><p>STRIATA study investigators: P.
