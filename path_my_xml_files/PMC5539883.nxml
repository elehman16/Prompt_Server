The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) recently published a multimorbidity guideline that advises providing an individualised medication review for all people prescribed 15 or more repeat medicines. This study incorporates this guideline and aims to assess the effectiveness of a complex intervention designed to support general practitioners (GPs) to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing and consider deprescribing in older people with multimorbidity and significant polypharmacy in Irish primary care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This study is a cluster randomised controlled trial, involving 30 general practices and 450 patients throughout Ireland. Practices will be eligible to participate if they have at least 300 patients aged 65&#x000a0;years and over on their patient panel and if they use either one of the two predominant practice management software systems in use in Ireland. Using a software patient finder tool, practices will identify and recruit patients aged 65&#x000a0;years and over, who are prescribed at least 15 repeat medicines. Once baseline data collection is complete, practices will be randomised using minimisation by an independent third party to either intervention or control. Given the nature of the intervention, it is not possible to blind participants or study personnel. GPs in intervention practices will receive login details to a website where they will access training videos and a template for conducting an individualised structured medication review, which they will undertake with each of their included patients. Control practices will deliver usual care over the 6-month study period. Primary outcome measures pertain to the individual patient level and are the proportion of patients with any PIP and the number of repeat medicines.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">Disease-specific approaches in multimorbidity may be inappropriate and result in fragmented and poorly co-ordinated care. This pragmatic study is evaluating a complex intervention that is relevant across multiple conditions and addresses potential concerns around medicines safety in this vulnerable group of patients. The potential for system-wide implementation will be explored with a parallel mixed methods process evaluation.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">

There is a growing consensus that the current single disease model of healthcare, which arose out of specialisation, may not be appropriate when managing these patients and may result in fragmented care and significant treatment burden for patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Providing optimal care for these patients is challenging, considering their heterogeneity and the lack of evidence for the effectiveness of many treatments, due to exclusion of these patients from randomised controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A systematic review looking at interventions to improve outcomes in patients with multimorbidity concluded that targeting risk factors or specific functional difficulties may be most effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The recently published National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline, &#x0201c;Multimorbidity: assessment, prioritisation and management of care for people with commonly occurring multimorbidity&#x0201d; identifies the link between complex multimorbidity and polypharmacy and advises targeting patients who are prescribed &#x02265;15 repeat medicines and providing a tailored or individualised structured medication review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">In line with rising levels of multimorbidity, the prevalence of significant polypharmacy is steadily rising. Recent longitudinal analysis indicates that approximately 5% of Irish people aged over 65&#x000a0;years are prescribed 15 or more repeat medicines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Polypharmacy is associated with a multitude of adverse outcomes including adverse drug reactions (ADRs), medication errors, reduced adherence, increased cost and increased morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. ADRs are a significant burden to the health system and it is estimated that over 10% of emergency hospital admissions in older patients may be ADR-related [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. ADRs have also been described as the &#x0201c;great mimic of systemic disease&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and often result in a prescribing cascade, where more medication is used to treat the side effects of another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In patients with multimorbidity, polypharmacy may often be appropriate, however, it is the strongest risk factor for potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP), a term used to describe suboptimal prescribing practices where the risks of treatment usually outweigh the benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Various tools have been developed to both tackle and measure PIP, including explicit measures of appropriateness such as the United States (US) Beers criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and the European Screening Tool for Older People&#x02019;s potentially inappropriate Prescriptions (STOPP) criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Explicit measures of medication appropriateness have been demonstrated to be effective at improving prescribing and have the advantage of being relatively reproducible, reliable and easy to apply to large numbers of people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]; however, they do not account for individual patient characteristics and preferences. Implicit measures such the Medication Appropriateness Index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] involve clinician judgement and do account for patient characteristics, however, they are time-consuming and complex to apply, and generally involve a detailed assessment of the effectiveness and appropriateness of each prescribed medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Several systematic reviews have assessed various approaches, including the use of explicit and implicit measures of appropriateness, to tackling inappropriate polypharmacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] with the over-riding conclusion that inappropriate polypharmacy is amenable to change but that a multifaceted approach is likely to be more effective.</p><p id="Par24">Improvements in computerised clinical decision support systems, where individual patient data are inputted into a computer program, sorted and matched using algorithms generated from a prior knowledge base resulting in patient-specific recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], may ultimately prove effective in optimising medication for this complex group of patients. An on-going European Union (EU) funded project is developing a highly powered and efficient software engine that will be able to individually screen the medication of older patients with multimorbidity and provide recommendations on optimal drug therapy and ADR risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Similarly Young et al. in New Zealand are validating and piloting a set of prescribing decision tools that will be embedded in practice management software (PMS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, before such technology is demonstrated to be safe, effective and feasible in daily practice, it is important to continue to develop effective and pragmatic interventions that can assist GPs in caring and prescribing for these complex patients. We also argue that software-driven recommendations need to be accompanied by an assessment of patients&#x02019; treatment priorities.</p><p id="Par25">Despite recommendations advising tailoring care to patient priorities, there is very little in the literature on how to best assess and record patient priorities. A systematic review identified only one such tool that has been used and validated in patients with multimorbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. A research group in Spain have recently published a protocol for a RCT which will examine the effect of an individualised medication review using a tool designed to aid the physician in prioritising the patient&#x02019;s problems on medication appropriateness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, the effectiveness, feasibility and potential for negative effects of using these tools in practice have not been established.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Rationale for SPPiRE trial</title><p id="Par26">Our research group previously demonstrated that an intervention comprising academic detailing and a web-based prescribing support was effective in reducing potentially inappropriate prescribing in older patients in Irish primary care, primarily through the reduction of prescribing of proton pump inhibitors at maximal dose (OPTI-SCRIPT trial) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Supporting prescribing in older patients with multimorbidity and significant polypharmacy (SPPiRE) is a cluster RCT that will assess the effectiveness of an intervention designed to reduce both PIP and polypharmacy. The SPPiRE intervention evolved based on the OPTI-SCRIPT trial results and process evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], emerging evidence in relation to multimorbidity and polypharmacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and the NICE multimorbidity guideline described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In line with the Medical Research Council&#x02019;s Framework on developing and evaluating complex interventions, the OPTI-SCRIPT intervention and trial were adapted to develop the SPPiRE study (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The MRC Framework describes an iterative process where piloting work, process and outcome evaluations and other bodies of emerging evidence feed back into the original intervention design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The target population and individual components of the intervention have been amended (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Our proposed SPPiRE intervention will also assess the effect on patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) of treatment burden and quality of life and undertake a parallel qualitative evaluation, which will provide important evidence on the patient experience.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Development and evaluation of SPPiRE, adapted from MRC framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

</p><p id="Par27">Medication appropriateness will be examined using explicit criteria and a tailored approach, where individual patient priorities are addressed. Tailoring care in this way minimises the harms of overtreatment by prioritising treatments that are most important to the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Explicit criteria have been selected using the updated STOPP 2 criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and monitoring criteria developed and validated by the Data-driven Quality Improvement in Primary care (DQIP) research group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], with a focus on drug classes that are frequently implicated in preventable drug-related morbidity (PDRM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and criteria that were more relevant for older people in Irish primary care (listed in Tables <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, and <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>) during the development of our previous OPTI-SCRIPT intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The tool will support GPs to identify PIPs for individual patients and then suggest potential treatment alternatives in the context of patient priorities identified during the process. As described previously, several tools have recently been developed to assess patient priorities, however, given uncertainty of the effectiveness of these tools, we have opted to prompt the GP to ask about and record individual priorities during the medication review rather than trying to operationalise this process. The implementation and effect of this novel aspect of the intervention will be further explored in the parallel mixed methods process evaluation.

This tool was piloted by three GPs in three practices, as at the time of the pilot it was only available in one of the two predominant PMS systems used in Ireland. A repeat medicine was defined as any item that has an Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) code, is currently being prescribed to the patient and is classified in the PMS as a &#x0201c;repeat&#x0201d; as opposed to &#x0201c;acute&#x0201d; item.

Each GP watched the SPPiRE training videos and invited either one or two identified patients for a medication review.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Results</title><p id="Par43">The feasibility of the finder tool and intervention were assessed through GP feedback and analysis of use of the online material. Overall, the intervention was well received by the GPs and their patients many of whom reported feeling reassured that their medicines were being reviewed and rationalised. There was a large variation between practices in the proportion of those aged &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years detected by the finder tool (1.9&#x02013;17%) which may be partially explained by differences between practices in how prescription lists are kept up to date and socio-demographic differences, both of which will be identified by the practice profile questionnaire at baseline for the main trial. Due to lack of universal registration of private patients in Irish general practice, practices use varying approaches to count their private patient panel. The differences in the finder tool detection rate may also reflect an inaccurate denominator, where private patients aged &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years are over counted for example visitors and those who have moved.</p><p id="Par44">Of the 10 patients who underwent the medication review, they were prescribed an average of 17.5 medicines (SD +/&#x02212;3.41) and this reduced to 16.8 (SD +/&#x02212;3.94) immediately post-intervention. All of the included patients had at least 1 PIP, with a mean of 1.8 per patient. The most common PIP identified were the use of a &#x0201c;proton pump inhibitor for uncomplicated PUD/erosive peptic oesophagitis at full therapeutic dose for &#x02265;8&#x000a0;weeks&#x0201d; (39%) and the use of a &#x0201c;benzodiazepine or Z drug for longer than 4&#x000a0;weeks&#x0201d; (39%). When the higher prevalence, lower risk proton pump inhibitor PIP was excluded, 90% of patients had at least 1 PIP and the mean number of PIP per patient was 1.1. Identified instances of PIP were acted on in 44% of cases and 45% when the proton pump inhibitor PIP was excluded. The most commonly reported patient treatment priorities were treating pain, followed by fatigue and reducing the number of repeat medicines.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Intervention modification</title><p id="Par45">Based on the results described above, minor modifications were made to the training videos and the medication review template to make instruction more explicit and reduce repetition (summarised in Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). The finder tool was modified to only include items with a unique ATC code to prevent different doses of the same drug being counted twice. The need for the GP to manually screen the generated list was evident, and guidance on how to best do this was developed. The review also took longer to implement than anticipated, on average about 40&#x000a0;min and a recommendation to allow for this amount time was added to the demonstration video and support materials.<table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>SPPiRE Pilot Results</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Pilot Component</th><th>Problem</th><th>Change</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Finder tool</td><td>Over identification of patients</td><td>&#x02022; Include only items with unique ATC code<break/>&#x02022; Include only items listed as &#x0201c;current&#x0201d;</td></tr><tr><td>Educational videos</td><td>Not fully watched by all GPs due to time constraint</td><td>&#x02022; Content condensed<break/>&#x02022; Focus on demonstrating review process</td></tr><tr><td>Web-guided medication review</td><td>Not fully completed by all GPs</td><td>&#x02022; Website layout modified<break/>&#x02022; Instructions more explicit<break/>&#x02022; Recommendation to allow for more time</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>

The primary analysis will be carried out using multilevel modelling. The primary outcome measure, proportion of patients with or without a PIP, will be a binary outcome measure and will be compared between treatment arms using random effects logistic regression with individuals as the unit of analysis and the practice included as the random effect.</p><p id="Par95">The second primary outcome measure, number of repeat medications, will be assessed using a random effect Poisson regression with the individual as the unit of analysis and the practice included as the random effect to control for the effects of clustering. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) will be presented. All analysis will be conducted under the intention-to-treat principle as this is a pragmatic trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Sample size</title><p id="Par96">Sample size for the primary outcome (proportion with PIP) is based on a prevalence of approximately 40% for PIP in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. To reduce this to 20% requires a sample size of 240 patients. The sample size also needs to be adjusted to reflect the assumption that individual outcomes are not independent of each other, as participants in the same cluster may respond in the same way. Hence, an intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.025 will be used. This was also used in the OPTI-SCRIPT study and was based on an observational study of an elderly cohort in the HRB Centre for Primary Care Research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. This gives a design effect size of 1.35, thus inflating the sample to 324 patients from 22 practices. An equal cluster size of 15 patients per practice has been assumed.</p><p id="Par97">All the patients in this study will be selected on the basis of receiving 15 or more repeat medicines on their prescription. Existing data from the Irish national prescribing database (HSE-PCRS) highlights that in those aged 65&#x000a0;years and over on 15 or more repeat medicines, the mean number of medicines is 17.4 (SD 2.69) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A meta-analysis of deprescribing trials reported a difference between treatment groups of 0.4 medicines where the mean number of medicines was 7.4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. We are targeting patients on at least 15 repeat medicines and for primary outcome, number of repeat medications, will test for a mean difference of one medicine between the intervention and control group and this would require a sample size of 306 patients. This is inflated by the design effect size outlined above (1.35) to give a sample of 413 patients from 28 practices.</p><p id="Par98">Factoring in a loss to follow-up of approximately 10% (for primary outcomes, based on chart data) and using the higher numbers required to demonstrate a significant reduction in mean number of repeat medicines, a total of 30 GP practices and 450 patients will be required.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Process evaluation</title><p id="Par99">SPPiRE is a complex intervention as there are several different interacting components and a degree of flexibility or tailoring to the local environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The aim of the process evaluation will be to explore the effect of the intervention and how it was implemented. It will combine both quantitative and qualitative data and follow a framework specific for cluster RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Study population</title><p id="Par100">All participating practices and a purposive sample of patients will be invited to participate by letter and follow-up telephone call.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Process evaluation data collection</title><p id="Par101">Quantitative data will be compiled from a number of sources including completed questionnaires, researcher logs and evaluation forms and website usage data. Qualitative data will be collected from patients and GPs and other practice staff using semi-structured interviews. The number of interviews needed to reach data saturation (where no new themes emerge) will be considered alongside feasibility issues (resources and timing), but a sample of 15&#x02013;20 is proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p id="Par102">These interviews will be conducted either in person or via telephone. Telephone interviewing is generally used where time or costs are issues, and evidence suggests there is little difference in the answers obtained this way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].

</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Process evaluation data analysis</title><p id="Par109">Quantitative data will be summarised using descriptive statistics. All interviews will be transcribed verbatim and broad themes and sub-themes identified using thematic analysis. NVivo 10 (QSR International) will be used to assist with organising the data for analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Economic evaluation</title><p id="Par110">The health economic analysis will consist of a trial-based economic evaluation of the proposed intervention and will incorporate both cost effectiveness analysis and cost utility analysis. The evaluation will be undertaken in a manner consistent with guidelines issued by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) in Ireland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Evidence collected on resource use, costs and health outcome measures will provide the basis for the evaluation over the trial follow-up period. With respect to costing, a publicly funded health service perspective will be adopted. That is, resource use associated with delivery of the proposed intervention will be measured and costed, as will other health service resource use by patients over the course of the trial. As detailed above, significant attention will be paid to collecting relevant data on health outcomes alongside the trial for the purposes of the clinical effectiveness analysis. For the cost effectiveness analysis, effectiveness will be evaluated on the basis of the number of PIPs averted. For the cost utility analysis, effectiveness will be evaluated in terms of quality adjusted life years (QALYs), which will be estimated based on responses to the EuroQol EQ-5D-5L instrument [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. An incremental analysis will be undertaken to provide information on the marginal costs and effects of the intervention relative to the control through the calculation of incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The statistical analysis will be conducted in accordance with current guidelines for economic evaluation alongside cluster RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. That is, we will adopt multilevel statistical techniques which recognise both the clustering and correlation in the cost and effect data. Uncertainty in the economic analysis will be addressed by estimating cost effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs), which link the probability of treatment being cost effective to a range of potential threshold values (&#x003bb;) that a health system may be willing to pay.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Data management and protection</title><p id="Par111">All patients will provide informed consent and will be known to the research team by study ID only. The patient&#x02019;s GP remains responsible for all treatment decisions made. Informed consent will be sought from all GPs participating in the study. All data collected, including interview transcripts for the process evaluation, will be stored on a secure, password protected network drive.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Monitoring and participant safety</title><p id="Par112">A Trial Steering Committee (TSC) comprising an independent chair and two other independent members, one of whom is a lay member representing the patient and public perspective, has been established and will oversee the progress of the trial and adherence to the study protocol. It was agreed by the TSC that given the low risk nature of the trial, lack of interim data and relatively short term follow-up, that there is no need for the establishment of a Data Monitoring Committee.</p><p id="Par113">A formal process has been developed to capture any potential adverse events related to discontinuing medication. Recruited practices will be instructed in the practice recruitment leaflet on how to report any suspected adverse effects from deprescribing. Any adverse events will also be captured by a chart review at follow-up data collection. An assessment on likely causality will then be made using an adapted drug withdrawal probability scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Patient-reported ADWEs will also be collected as a secondary outcome measures in the follow-up patient questionnaire, 6&#x000a0;months after intervention completion. Any patient safety concerns arising during the course of the trial, including at baseline data collection, will be brought to the attention of the Trial Steering Committee.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par114">Polypharmacy is frequently cited as an area of major concern by patients with multimorbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The most appropriate course of action when deciding whether to continue to prescribe is often not readily apparent but should include some assessment of the relative harms and benefits of treatment, in the context of the patient&#x02019;s priorities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. We propose that an individualised structured medication review, where deprescribing is considered alongside prescribing, and where there is active engagement with patients on their views on treatment is essential to tackling polypharmacy and inappropriate prescribing.</p><p id="Par115">The SPPiRE intervention provides structure and assistance in performing medication reviews by aiding GPs in identifying PIP, suggesting alternatives and encouraging care to be tailored to individual patient priorities. Strengths of this study include the pragmatic study design, incorporation of clinical guidelines and the fact that the intervention can be delivered by the patient&#x02019;s GP. Currently, there is no provision under the GP reimbursement scheme in Ireland for a medication review for older patients and the potential and costs of a system-wide implementation of the SPPiRE intervention in Irish primary care will be explored in the process and economic evaluations.</p><p id="Par116">Limitations of the study include the possibility of contamination of the control group where GPs also identify patients on 15 or more medicines using the patient finder tool and may treat these patients differently or provide more consideration than usual when renewing prescriptions. This will be explored in the process evaluation. Patients will also be encouraged to think about their treatment burden and attitudes towards deprescribing when completing baseline questionnaires and may be influenced to discuss their medications with their GP. Secondly, given the nature of the intervention it is not possible to blind patients, GPs or study personnel to the intervention. This has been addressed somewhat by using robust, objective primary outcome measures where there is little room for subjective opinion (number of repeat medicines and number of patients with any pre-defined PIP).</p><p id="Par117">In summary, this study will provide evidence on the effectiveness and acceptability of a complex intervention designed to support GPs improve prescribing and reduce polypharmacy for older patients with multimorbidity and significant polypharmacy in Irish primary care.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ADR</term><def><p id="Par6">Adverse drug reaction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ATC</term><def><p id="Par7">Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CONSORT</term><def><p id="Par8">Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EU</term><def><p id="Par9">European Union</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GP</term><def><p id="Par10">General practitioner</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MAI</term><def><p id="Par11">Medication appropriateness index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MRC</term><def><p id="Par12">Medical Research Council</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NICE</term><def><p id="Par13">National Institute for Clinical Excellence,</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCRS</term><def><p id="Par14">Primary Care Reimbursement Service</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PDRM</term><def><p id="Par15">Preventable drug related morbidity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PIP</term><def><p id="Par16">Potentially inappropriate prescribing</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PMS</term><def><p id="Par17">Practice management software</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PROM</term><def><p id="Par18">Patient reported outcome measure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p id="Par19">Randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>STOPP</term><def><p id="Par20">European Screening Tool for Older Person&#x02019;s Prescriptions</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par118">This research is funded by the Health Research Board (HRB) Primary Care Clinical Trials Network (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://primarycaretrials.ie">http://primarycaretrials.ie</ext-link>/).
