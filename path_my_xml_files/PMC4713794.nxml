of the head and neck<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among them, the
deep cervical flexors (longus colli, longus capitis) are known to provide the cervical
spine&#x02019;s segmental stability, and postural stability is realized through neuromuscular
control in the cervical region due to the distribution of multiple position
proprioceptors<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, for
providing the cervical region&#x02019;s functional motions and stability, the deep cervical flexors
should first be contracted, thereby creating cervical stability; then, the functional
motions should be realized.</p><p>However, patients with chronic neck pain show a weakening of their deep cervical flexors,
as well as compensatory hypertension of the superficial flexors<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. This weakening of the deep cervical flexors causes a
reduction in the intrinsic proprioceptors of the postural senses in the muscles, and it
lowers the ability to control posture through interactions between the vestibular and visual
systems<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Therefore, exercises that can help strengthen the deep cervical flexors have been applied
in various manners<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In particular, deep cervical flexor training (DCFT), which retrains the deep
cervical flexors, is drawing attention. In a previous study, the test group that performed
DCFT showed increases in the range of motion and the cross-section of the longus colli when
compared to the control group<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another
study applied DCFT in patients with chronic neck pain for six weeks and observed an overall
statistically significant decrease in the neck disability index (NDI)<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In DCFT, each patient is instructed to flatten the cervical
spine in the supine position without moving the head and to pull in the chin<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, no specific instructions were
given regarding the direction of the patient&#x02019;s gaze or regarding whether to open or close
the mouth.</p><p>However, individuals can activate different cervical muscles depending on their eye
direction. In addition, the coordination of the head, neck, and eye increases the level of
sensitivity to postural changes, thereby enhancing postural stability and enabling selective
exercises<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, during DCFT,
the activation of the cervical muscles and changes in the thicknesses of the muscles are
likely to show differences according to an individual&#x02019;s eye direction. However, relevant
studies are scarce. Giannakopoulos<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> and
other researchers measured the activation of the longus colli using electromyography (EMG).
However, as the longus colli is located in the deep part of the anterior cervical region,
activation cannot easily be measured using surface EMG. Moreover, invasive electrical
stimulation can cause abnormal muscular tension in sensitive cervical muscles. This makes it
difficult to derive accurate research results. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to
compare changes in the thicknesses of the cervical flexors according to eye coordination
during DCFT using ultrasonic waves.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>After the purpose of this study was explained, the subjects agreed to participate and
submitted a written consent form. Twenty male and female adults were randomly selected. The
selection criterion included those who had not experienced cervical pain, headache, or
dizziness within the last six months. The study was approved by the institutional review
board (IRB) of the Catholic University of Busan.</p><p>The researcher taught the subjects how to perform DCFT and then provided them with a
five-minute break.</p><p>In the experiment, the subjects were instructed to lie down on the bed in the supine
position and then bend their hip and knee joints at 90&#x000b0;. The researcher placed a pressure
biofeedback unit (PBU) between the surface and the curve formed in the back of the subject&#x02019;s
neck and maintained 20 mmHg of pressure while performed DCFT to prevent excessive
contractions of the sternocleidomastoid and anterior scalenus. The subjects were asked to
look straight ahead and to pull in the chin. In this position, the researcher measured the
thicknesses of the longus colli and the sternocleidomastoid located in the subject&#x02019;s
anterior cervical region using ultrasonic waves (SonoAce X4, Medison, Korea). After this
process, while the subject performed DCFT in the same manner, he or she was instructed to
look straight ahead at the start and, following a verbal comment signaling the start of the
training, to look at the end of the jaw and follow the direction in which the jaw was moving
(inferior medial portion). During this process, the thicknesses of the respective muscles
were measured using the same method. Regarding the location that was measured using
ultrasonic waves, the researcher perceived the thyroid cartilage by touch, which was located
in the anterior cervical region, indicated the area was 2&#x02005;cm down from the cartilage using a
marker, and measured the right side of the area using a 7.5 MH linear transducer in B-mode.
The transducer was contacted vertically based on the axis of ordinates. After measuring
cross-sectional images, the longest among the anterior and posterior lengths was selected
for use<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The subjects had to maintain
the chin-in motion for 10 seconds, and they were provided with a one-minute break after each
motion to prevent muscle fatigue<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Each measurement was taken three times alternately and the average was used for statistical
analysis. SPSS 19.0 was used for data processing, and the general characteristics of the
subjects were obtained by applying descriptive statistics. Paired t-tests were performed to
identify differences in the thicknesses of the longus colli and the sternocleidomastoid
depending on the application of eye coordination.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>General characteristics of the subjects are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Characteristics of the subjects (<italic>N</italic>=20)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variables</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (M/F)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16/4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (yrs)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.5&#x000b1;1.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">174.2&#x000b1;5.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> 69.7&#x000b1;7.8</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>.</p><p>Changes in the thicknesses of the longus colli and sternocleidomastoid were compared when

coordination.</p><p>The longus colli showed a statistically significant increase in its thickness when DCFT was
combined with eye coordination; however, the sternocleidomastoid did not exhibit a
statistically significant difference according to eye coordination. The coordination of head
and eye movements delivers information on vision and posture regarding the tecleus
reticularis gigantocellularis (NRG) in the subcortical region, and it delivers postural
information from the NRG to motorneurons in the cervical spinal cord. In doing so, the
coordination derives postural stability by properly controlling the level of tension in the
cervical muscles<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular,
proprioceptors in the deep cervical flexors and eye movement muscles keep the head position
in the space, and they control postural balance through real-time sensitive responses to
postural changes. For this reason, the coordination of the eye and of the neck muscles is
likely to have strong correlations. In addition, during eye tracking, in which the eye
follows the direction in which the head moves, the central mesencephalic reticular formation
(cMRF) within the subcortical region is first activated, and then information is again
delivered from the cMRF to the brain stem&#x02019;s eye movement control part, the occulari system,
and the NRG&#x02019;s head movement center. Therefore, the cMRF&#x02019;s preceding activation was reported
to play an essential role in eye-head movement coordination<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, therefore, eye tracking during DCFT
simultaneously delivered postural information to the NRG and cMRF through the vestibular and
visual systems. This may have induced increases in the contraction of the longus colli by
intensifying eye cognition.</p><p>However, the sternocleidomastoid did not show statistically significant differences after
the application of eye coordination. By nature, DCFT selectively strengthens the deep
cervical flexors while minimizing the activation of the superficial cervical flexors.
Therefore, the thickness of this muscle may not have shown differences according to eye
coordination. Bolton<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> reported in his
study that complicated reflexive activities occur as the vestibular and visual systems and
the cervical spine interact to process afferent postural information for postural
control.</p><p>Moreover, Treleaven<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> stated that
patients with neck pain have trouble in sensory-motor control, and they need head&#x02013;eye
movement control to resolve this problem.</p><p>Given that the results of the present study also showed correlations between the eyes and
the cervical flexors, DCFT combined with eye coordination is likely to be effective in
enhancing the contraction of the deep cervical flexors.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Falla</surname><given-names>DL</given-names></name><name><surname>Jull</surname><given-names>GA</given-names></name><name><surname>Hodges</surname><given-names>PW</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Patients with neck pain demonstrate reduced
