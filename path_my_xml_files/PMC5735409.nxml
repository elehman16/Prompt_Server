Guidelines recommend routine HIV testing in primary care, but evidence on implementing testing is lacking. In a previous study, the Rapid HIV Assessment 2 (RHIVA2) cluster randomised controlled trial, we showed that providing training and rapid point-of-care HIV testing at general practice registration (RHIVA2 intervention) in Hackney led to cost-effective, increased and earlier diagnosis of HIV. However, interventions effective in a trial context may be less so when implemented in routine practice. We describe the protocol for an MRC phase IV implementation programme, evaluating the impact of rolling out the RHIVA2 intervention in a post-trial setting. We will use a longitudinal study to examine if the post-trial implementation in Hackney practices is effective and cost-effective, and a cross-sectional study to compare Hackney with two adjacent boroughs providing usual primary care (Newham) and an enhanced service promoting HIV testing in primary care (Tower Hamlets).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>Service evaluation using interrupted time series and cost-effectiveness analyses. We will include all general practices in three contiguous high HIV prevalence East London boroughs. All adults aged 16 and above registered with the practices will be included. The interventions to be examined are: a post-trial RHIVA2 implementation programme (including practice-based education and training, external quality assurance, incentive payments for rapid HIV testing and incorporation of rapid HIV testing in the sexual health Local Enhanced Service) in Hackney; the general practice sexual health Network Improved Service in Tower Hamlets and usual care in Newham. Coprimary outcomes are rates of HIV testing and new HIV diagnoses.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The chair of the Camden and Islington NHS Research Ethics Committee, London, has endorsed this programme as an evaluation of routine care. Study results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and reported to commissioners.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>HIV testing</kwd><kwd>HIV screening</kwd><kwd>HIV diagnosis</kwd><kwd>implementation</kwd><kwd>interrupted time series</kwd><kwd>cost-effectiveness</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The study will use existing trial data preceding the implementation programme in addition to post-trial data, collected using similar methods to those used in the trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Fully anonymised general practice data from all participating boroughs will be remotely extracted using a single general practice computer system (Egton Medical Information Systems, EMIS).</p></list-item><list-item><p>A large dataset with at least 12 time points before and at least 29 time points after the intervention implementation will provide precise estimation of the effects of intervention using interrupted time series analysis.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Differences in HIV testing protocols, data quality and extraction between Hackney, and Tower Hamlets and Newham; and previous interventions such as rapid HIV testing pilots in a small number of Newham practices, may affect comparability between boroughs.

The cost of HIV care for the National Health Service (NHS) (without considering the cost of treating comorbidities) in 2013 was estimated to be &#x000a3;750&#x02009;million (&#x000a3;1billion with social care included).<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Late diagnosis of HIV increases morbidity and mortality, and is associated with unwitting onward transmission. To reduce the pool of undiagnosed infection in the population, the British HIV Association (BHIVA) and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended expansion of routine HIV testing from sexual health and antenatal clinics to non-traditional settings including general practices located in high HIV prevalence areas (two or more people diagnosed with HIV/1000 adult population).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;8</xref> In the Framework for Sexual Health Improvement in England (2013), the UK Department of Health additionally set out recommendations for the commissioning of HIV testing in high prevalence areas across all healthcare settings, including general practice.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> However, the decision to implement these recommendations lies with the 74 local authorities in England and the respective clinical commissioning groups (CCGs). Although National Policy for HIV screening in antenatal settings has proven highly effective, guidance for screening in general practice is lacking. Indeed, it was hoped that recommending routine HIV testing would suffice to enhance awareness of HIV among general practitioners (GPs) and become standard in this setting.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Pilot studies have demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of routine HIV testing among patients and healthcare professionals.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> Despite this, a recent systematic review identified low uptake of routine HIV testing in non-traditional UK settings including general practice following the BHIVA 2008 guidelines.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>In a large-scale pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial (Rapid HIV Assessment 2 (RHIVA2)) in the London borough of Hackney, we showed that rapid HIV testing offered at general practice registration was effective and safe, and delivered increased and earlier HIV diagnosis.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Furthermore, a recent health economics analysis of the RHIVA2 trial demonstrated that HIV screening in primary care in high HIV prevalence areas is cost-effective.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Following completion of this trial, we implemented HIV testing into routine care across all Hackney practices using a theory-based programme<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;18</xref> comprising an adaptation of the RHIVA2 intervention, including a practice-based education programme, a borough-wide audit of HIV care, and the introduction of payments for routine HIV testing as part of an updated general practice sexual health Local Enhanced Service (LES).<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>We will evaluate both the RHIVA2 trial and post-trial implementation programme through an MRC phase IV implementation study.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The study will also compare the impact of RHIVA2 implementation in Hackney practices with two neighbouring boroughs; Tower Hamlets that offers a general practice sexual health Network Improved Service (NIS) promoting routine HIV testing; and Newham offering usual primary care without incentivised HIV testing.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> summarises the timelines of HIV-related interventions in these three boroughs.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Sexual health service provision in East London general practice.

Mixed Poisson regression will allow for the clustered nature of the data, that is, allowing each practice to have a different intercept (baseline HIV testing rate).

We will also repeat the analysis using Newham practices (which received no intervention) as a further comparator.</p><p>The date of intervention will be defined as the date of the first RHIVA2 training session.

We will also compare the RHIVA2 implementation in Hackney with the introduction of the sexual health NIS in Tower Hamlets.</p><p>We will conduct similar analysis to the above, with the endpoint of HIV diagnosis, rather than testing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Cost-effectiveness analysis</title><p>Cost-effectiveness analyses for the longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses described above will build on a cost-effectiveness model developed for the RHIVA2 trial.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> To assess value for money, we will identify the difference in costs and the difference in benefits of implementing the RHIVA2 intervention and we aim to distinguish between two different analyses. First, we will evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the RHIVA2 implementation using the same &#x02018;comparator&#x02019; defined in the longitudinal analysis, that is, practices which did not receive the RHIVA2 intervention at any stage will be considered the &#x02018;absence of the intervention&#x02019;.</p><p>Second, we will build a cost-effectiveness comparison between different forms of HIV screening in East London, formally comparing the RHIVA2 implementation (conducted in Hackney) with the sexual health NIS (Tower Hamlets) and usual care (Newham). Once again, all three different approaches will be compared with practices, which did not receive the RHIVA2 intervention at any stage, as these are considered the &#x02018;absence of the intervention&#x02019;. Given that the same control group of practices in Hackney will serve as reference, this second analysis will formally compare the different approaches from different boroughs, considering no intervention in Hackney as a reference.</p><p>Three main cost categories will be explored: (1) the extra start-up cost of RHIVA2 implementation (specifically the cost for RHIVA2 staff time, including follow-up activities; cost of training; cost of training materials and cost of incentives to practices); (2) the extra recurrent cost for performing rapid HIV testing and (3) additional costs associated with reactive rapid HIV test results.</p><p>Benefits of the RHIVA2 programme will include health outcomes for patients, specifically deaths averted, secondary HIV infections averted and quality-adjusted life years; these are a function of the uptake of screening and screening positivity, which will be quantified directly by the analyses.</p><p>This study is a service evaluation which does not require registration as a trial.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Ethical aspects</title><p>The programme described is an evaluation of routine care. Its status as such has been endorsed by the chair of the Camden and Islington NHS Research Ethics Committee London. The committee&#x02019;s view is that the work does not require NHS ethics approval. The programme will be implemented in partnership with the local providers and commissioners and involve the analysis of existing routine data. This also applies to data on delayed diagnosis of HIV (CD4 count), and demographics reported in the RHIVA2 trial, which is routinely collected as part of a national audit (BHIVA National Audit 2010) and has been included in Public Health Outcomes Framework (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phoutcomes.info">http://www.phoutcomes.info</ext-link>). We will inform the research ethics committee, the CCG and Public Health about any important changes to the protocol.</p><p>This service evaluation is to answer the question: what standard does this service achieve? It involves routine implementation of an intervention outside of the research context. The actual management options are those of the clinician and patient only. There is no random allocation to intervention and control groups. No individual consent is required from newly diagnosed patients.</p><p>In addition to CD4 count and viral load, the following additional data will be obtained by the clinical leads of specialist departments in an anonymised fashion and stored in accordance with good clinical practice:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Most likely mode of HIV acquisition</p></list-item><list-item><p>Sexual orientation</p></list-item><list-item><p>Soundex code</p></list-item><list-item><p>Ethnicity</p></list-item><list-item><p>Gender</p></list-item><list-item><p>Age at diagnosis.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The MRC Framework for complex interventions<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> clearly describes the need for implementation studies that test the effectiveness of interventions found to be promising in phase III randomised controlled trials. Successful translation of such interventions into routine care cannot be assumed; trials take place in tightly controlled conditions that aim to limit bias, with selected (often motivated) participants, while implementation programmes (usually) aim much more broadly to include all potential participants.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Trial interventions will often need to be augmented by a distinct implementation package. Their success will be affected by multiple factors including, but not limited to contextual factors such as, differences in setting, population, organisation of healthcare systems, competing initiatives and financial aspects (including availability of incentives). Evaluations of implementation of trials into routine care are frequently not carried out, and if they are, are often poorly reported.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Such evaluations are highly unlikely to involve randomised designs, and are more likely to be observational, including the use of service evaluations. Designs are often constrained by health systems and data availability, but need to be as robust as possible. New reporting guidelines have recently been published that highlight the need for evaluation of implementation and aim to improve their reporting, such that they can be more easily accessed in the literature and serve to guide others in designing the most effective implementation programmes.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>Recent NICE guidelines recommend expanded HIV testing in primary care,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;8</xref> but little information is available about how to operationalise testing, especially in the context of current resource constraints in primary care. It is, therefore, vital that innovative and effective ways are found to implement testing. The strengths of the proposed work include the availability of existing trial data preceding the implementation programme, the capacity to collect data longitudinally using similar methods to those used in the trial, and the use by general practices across all three participating boroughs of a single GP computer system supplier Egton Medical Information Systems, data from which can be remotely and electronically (with full anonymisation) searched and collated by the research team (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.blizard.qmul.ac.uk/ceg-home.html">http://www.blizard.qmul.ac.uk/ceg-home.html</ext-link>), confirmation of HIV test results for all study practices at the same tertiary care laboratory (Barts Health NHS Trust) and external data validation by Public Health England. This approach provides a unique capability, allowing comparative data on three separate approaches to HIV testing and diagnosis to be accurately gathered and analysed.</p><p>Due to difference in data extraction between Hackney and Tower Hamlets and Newham, respectively, there may be a small chance of differential reporting bias between these boroughs. In contrast to the Department of Sexual Health at Homerton University Hospital (Hackney), which is able to track any patient lost to follow up using a monthly list of HIV positives provided by the laboratory, no such fail-safe procedure exists in Tower Hamlets or Newham. However, in these latter boroughs all data for HIV positive test results are available on the general practice computer system via an electronic laboratory link, almost eliminating the chance of missing data. We are currently conducting an audit of outcomes from people newly diagnosed with HIV in Tower Hamlets and Newham general practices to extract this data for the study period specified.</p><p>We cannot exclude occurrence of any cluster or crossover effects, although we would expect for this to be minimal given that we detected a more than fourfold increase in HIV testing rates between the RHIVA2 trial intervention and control practices. In contrast to the network structure in Tower Hamlets, Hackney practices, which were randomly allocated to the trial arms, may have informally worked collaboratively through geographical proximity. Due to this potential clustering effect, inference of generalisability of RHIVA2 findings in other boroughs should, therefore, be treated with caution. Furthermore, an audit of new diagnosis and safe coprescribing was also conducted by our team across 31 of the 44 Hackney practices during the implementation phase&#x0201a; potentially causing contamination of control practices. However, the number of both trial intervention (n=13) and control (n=15) practices was comparable, suggesting equal exposure to this audit across both arms.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Although public health teams informally collaborate across Northeast London, crossover between boroughs is unlikely given that services are developed and budgeted separately. Our analysis will adjust for any potential contamination using various vertical and horizontal controls both within Hackney, as well as between boroughs using Newham, which has been devoid of any local service HIV promotional intervention, as control.</p><p>Moreover, the RHIVA2 trial and post-trial implementation will not be grouped as the same intervention. We will only use the post-trial implementation practices in the main analysis and only consider the trial intervention practices for the assessment of sustainability. Therefore, the sustainability analysis will have to be interpreted with caution with regards to the sustainability of the post-trial intervention, as the intervention in trial conditions might be different to that outside of trial conditions.</p><p>We may not be able to account for missing data such as from patients lost to follow-up after diagnosis in general practice, or from rapid testing pilots conducted in a small number of Newham practices during the study period.</p><p>Finally, the RHIVA2 trial intervention was adapted for the implementation phase (1) to expand promotion of routine offer of HIV testing from new registration checks to include sexual health and contraception appointments and (2) to enhance screening through additional use of venous blood sampling. This protocol adaptation was made to meet the needs of the local population through increasing access to testing, reflecting the complexities of translating a research intervention into clinical practice after completion of the research.</p><p>The results of the proposed analysis are likely to be of considerable interest to commissioners, particularly given that late diagnosis of HIV is a UK Public Health Outcomes Framework priority,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and that cost-effectiveness of HIV testing is complex, and becoming cost-effective in trial-based models only after a period of time has elapsed to counter the additional significant costs of early treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e384" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-018163.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e385" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-018163.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> WL, LB, CN, ECB, SM, CE, JA, JF and CG significantly contributed to designing the study and drafted the protocol.
