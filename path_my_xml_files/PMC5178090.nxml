This study aims to demonstrate a resistance exercise protocol that individuals will perform during the work schedule, and to evaluate the effectiveness of this exercises program for fatigue control.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This is a cluster randomized controlled trial with two arms and is assessor blinded. A total of 352 workers of both sexes, aged 18&#x02013;65 years, from a medium-sized dairy plant were enrolled in this study. Participants will be recruited from 13 production sectors according to the eligibility criteria and will be randomized by clusters to either the Progressive Resistance Exercise (PRE) intervention group or the Compensatory Workplace Exercise (CWE) comparative group. A resistance exercise program will be implemented for both groups. The groups will receive instructions on self-management, breaks, adjustments to workstations, and the benefits of physical exercise. The PRE group will perform resistance exercises with gradual loads in an exercise room, and the CWE group will perform exercise at their workstations using elastic bands. The exercise sessions will be held 3 times a week for 20&#x000a0;min. The primary outcome measures will be symptoms of physical and mental fatigue, and muscular fatigue based on a one-repetition maximum (1RM). The secondary outcome measures will be level of physical activity, musculoskeletal symptoms, physical condition, perceived exposure, and productivity. The workers will be assessed at baseline and after a 4-month program. A linear mixed model will be applied on an intention-to-treat basis.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This intervention is expected to reduce symptoms of fatigue in the workers. The exercise program is indicating in the workplace, although there are few studies describing the effects of exercise on the control of fatigue in the workplace. Emphasis will be placed on adherence to the program, which may result in significant and clinically important reductions in fatigue. It is also expected that the findings of this study will contribute significantly to the decision-making capacity of professionals working in the field of occupational health.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>U.S. National Institutes of Health, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02172053">NCT02172053</ext-link>.

It is complex and multidimensional and varies in intensity depending on the imposed overload [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Workplace fatigue is a common complaint that requires attention due to its high prevalence and its association with serious dysfunctions among workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It affects physical and mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], increasing the chance of accidents and musculoskeletal complaints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and reducing performance and productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>The symptoms of fatigue are due to individual characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] as well as to work factors involving physical and mental demands, such as lack of planning with regard to work activities, rosters, and work shifts; environmental conditions; and standing for long periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Factors related to fatigue outside the workplace are sedentary behavior, lifestyle, and unhealthy diet, all of which build up over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Fatigue can be mental, due to prolonged periods of high cognitive demands along with the physical activity imposed by the daily load of highly physical jobs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Acute fatigue is a normal phenomenon in healthy workers and it is reversed after a period of rest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]; however, chronic fatigue is more severe and often cannot be reversed simply by reducing workloads or resting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The effects of fatigue on worker health and job performance can be short term or long term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The short-term effects are reduced attention span, poor decision-making, reduced alertness, and poor control of emotions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Fatigue can also increase the rate of mistakes, reduce reaction times, and elevate the likelihood of accidents and injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The long-term effects are heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, gastrointestinal disorders, sleep loss, depression, and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Fatigue contributes to the occurrence of musculoskeletal disorders, which represent a major problem for the health of workers worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Workplace characteristics, repetitive tasks, static contractions, and inadequate posture are associated with the majority of structural disorders and the development of fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Various organizational aspects of work have been associated with a variety of adverse health effects, especially occupational disorders such as fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Thus, it becomes crucial to adopt measures for evaluating and managing these organic dysfunctions manifested as the development of fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Exercise programs have been widely used for fatigue management and pain relief, and to improve muscle strength, flexibility, and cardiovascular conditioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Exercise has been shown to have highly beneficial effects on physical and mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], promoting significant changes to lifestyle and wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It has a great impact on the health of all individuals, reducing mortality rates and increasing life expectancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], as well as improving function in the musculoskeletal, blood, cardiopulmonary, immune, and nervous systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, it can reduce many of the risk factors for non-communicable chronic diseases (hypertension, cholesterol levels, diabetes), as well as percentage of body fat and body mass index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Exercise at the workplace has positive effects on the health of workers and is most effective when done in a group because there is more motivation thus increasing adherence to the program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. There is strong evidence of the effectiveness of strength training at the workplace for reducing musculoskeletal complaints in specific regions of the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A variety of strength training protocols are described in the literature, including protocols to decrease pain in the cervical, lumbar, and shoulder areas; low-intensity training; high-intensity training with concentric contractions; high-intensity training with isometric contractions; and highly intensive training (HIT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, there is consensus that resistance exercises are more effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and 20-min training sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] 3 times a week for periods of 10&#x000a0;weeks or more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] reduce musculoskeletal complaints in the workplace. The protocol of heavy resistance exercise at the workplace includes exercise with higher intensity in eccentric and concentric contractions, using dumbbells, elastic bands, and exercises against gravity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The effectiveness of medium- and long-term progressive resistance exercise programs with progressive loads for muscle strength gain and fatigue reduction has already been shown in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], with most studies being cross-sectional in nature. In contrast, the small number of longitudinal studies that describe the benefits of resistance training for fatigue management in the workplace hinders decision-making regarding interventions for this population. Therefore, the advantage of this study is its randomized clinical trial design in the occupational context, with control of all of the variables that simulate the gym environment.</p><p>The hypothesis investigated in this study is that the physical load, high work demand, and absence of breaks imposed on production workers can contribute to an increase in the need for recovery due to increased symptoms of fatigue. It is understood that improving the workers&#x02019; physical conditioning is essential to managing the symptoms of fatigue at the workplace. To achieve that, resistance training with progressive loads is the most effective program.</p><p>Thus, our objective in this study is demonstrate a resistance exercise protocol to be performed at the workplace during the work schedule, and to describe the procedure that will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of this program in fatigue management for industrial workers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design, approval, and registration</title><p>This is a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) two-arm (parallel group) with double blinded (investigator and assessor).

</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>The dairy plant has 600 employees among its administrative and production sectors. The study will focus on the production sector, which enrolled 352 workers. The inclusion criteria will be as follows: permanent employment status, fixed work shifts, agreement to participate, and signing the informed consent form. The exclusion criteria will be temporary employment status, vacation, or sick leave to ensure group comparability, the feasibility of the interventions, and blinding.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Randomization</title><p>Prior to clustering according to exposure level, 13 of the plant&#x02019;s production sectors will be included in the study: Boilers, Processing, Receiving/Cooling/Standardization, Milk, Butter, Cheese, Milk Caramel, Yoghurt, UHT Plant, Milk Powder, Stock, and Warehouse. Allocation will be performed on Research Randomizer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.randomizer.org/">https://www.randomizer.org/</ext-link>) by a researcher not involved with the data collection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Blinding</title><p>Due to the nature of the intervention, it is not possible to blind the workers and physical therapists who carry out the interventions. However, the researchers who will conduct the interviews and assessments will be blinded (double blinded). After the assessment, the blinding will be tested by having the researchers guess the type of intervention the worker received: Progressive Resistance Exercise (PRE) intervention group or the Compensatory Workplace Exercise (CWE) and write it down.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Intervention protocols</title><p>Workers from both groups will receive initial instructions on health management (impact of fatigue, management of work demands, rest breaks, set up of workstations) and the importance of exercise to promote health and lifestyle changes. After the implementation of the exercise programs, these guidelines will be reinforced daily throughout the intervention period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Progressive Resistance Exercise (PRE) - intervention group</title><p>Workers allocated to this training program will perform light warm-up and stretching exercises followed by specific training with resistance and strength exercises. The training program of the PRE group will focus on muscle resistance, starting at 30% of the one-repetition maximum (1RM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The speed of the exercise will be moderate to allow control of the angle of movement. Load increase will be progressive according to each worker&#x02019;s adaptability and physiological characteristics. Training will follow the principles of resistance training, starting with the adaptation to load phase (microcycle) and progressing to the load incorporation phase (mesocycle) and the training phase (macrocycle) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The following muscle groups will be trained: elbow flexors, elbow extensors, trunk flexors, trunk extensors, knee flexors, knee extensors, thigh adductors, thigh abductors, and ankle dorsal and plantar flexors.</p><p>All exercises will be carried out in 3 sets of 10 repetitions with a 30-s interval between sets.

The protocol includes training of the following muscle groups: elbow flexors, elbow extensors, trunk flexors, trunk extensors, knee flexors, knee extensors, thigh adductors, thigh abductors, and ankle dorsal and plantar flexors. All exercises will be carried out in 3 sets of 10 repetitions with a 30-s interval between sets.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Supervision and training schedule</title><p>Interventions will take place over a period of 4 months, beginning in August 2016. The outcomes will be assessed at baseline, and there will be a follow-up at the end of the intervention. Both groups of participants will train for 20&#x000a0;min, 3 times a week on alternate days. All interventions will be carried out during working hours at the workplace, totaling 1 h per week. All exercise protocols developed for this study are shown in <xref rid="Sec28" ref-type="sec">Appendix I</xref>.</p><p>Ten experts will be involved in the research and will receive 12&#x000a0;h of training on the protocol and objectives of the study, regardless of their role (assessors, instructors, or lecturers).

The QEC assesses the following work-related biomechanical risk factors and exposure levels: frequency of movements and postures involving the spine and upper limbs; amount of weight handled; task completion time; manual strength; visual demand of the task; use of vibrating tools; work pace; and stress level. The total score of the instrument varies from 46 to 269 points, and the risk of exposure is classified into 4 categories: low (46&#x02013;84 points), moderate (106&#x02013;138 points), high (168&#x02013;198 points), and very high (187&#x02013;242 points) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].

This apparatus features rulers that measure the fat in the skinfolds at different sites (triceps, biceps, pectoralis, subscapularis, midaxillary, suprailiac, abdomen, thigh, and calf). With these measurements, the professional can make a precise assessment of body composition and monitor the patient accordingly.</p></list-item><list-item><p>One-Repetition Maximum (1RM) - this test evaluates muscle strength. It measures the maximum amount of weight that an individual can lift in a single repetition.

This question is one of the items on the WHO Health and Work Performance Questionnaire (HPQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and asks the respondent to assign a score (0&#x02013;10) to their work productivity over the previous 3 months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size calculation is based on the difference detected in the Need for Recovery Scale (Br-NFR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], that is, 20%.

A researcher will receive the encoded data and perform the statistical analysis. All data will be entered into the database twice, and the coding will be blinded. Descriptive statistics (frequencies, means, standard deviation, standard error, confidence interval) will be used to analyze the sociodemographic characteristics of the participants. The Shapiro-Wilk test will be used to assess the normality of the data. The chi-square test will be used to evaluate assessor blinding through a comparison between randomization codes and the assessors&#x02019; guesses. The difference between the groups and their respective confidence intervals will be calculated using a mixed linear model. The significance level will be 5%. The statistical program SPSS Statistics 24.0 will be used for all analyses, which will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>This study follows all ethical considerations set out in the Declaration of Helsinki. The study will present moderate risk because the participants will be exposed to muscular resistance exercises. This exposure will occur during the maximum load assessment to determine the training load percentage. The participants may experience changes in blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate, according to their fitness level. To manage the risks, the research team will be ready to assist them should they perceive any changes and will refer them to the company&#x02019;s medical department for attention if necessary. If the medical department subsequently releases the participant, he or she will be included in his or her allocated exercise program. All risks will be minimized by respecting the individual needs of each worker and always measuring their vital signs. The study results shall remain private and confidential. There are no conflicts of interest on the part of the authors and/or the company.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study was designed to investigate the effectiveness of a resistance-training program for a group of workers at a medium-sized dairy plant to manage the symptoms of fatigue. Despite being a highly relevant topic, few studies have assessed the effect of resistance training at the workplace. We expect that this intervention with resistance training will have high adherence by the workers and will reduce the occurrence of fatigue symptoms. The program will bring many benefits to the participants, including health maintenance, reduced perception of fatigue, reversal of fatigue, reduction in complaints and pain, improved quality of life, higher productivity, improved mental health, and positive changes in lifestyle. We also expect that the results of this study will contribute significantly to the decision-making capacity of professionals working in the field of occupational health. We believe that both exercise protocols can be effective for fatigue reduction; however, we hypothesize that the PRE intervention protocol will be more effective.</p><sec id="Sec27"><title>Trial status</title><p>Ongoing.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec28"><title>Appendix I</title><sec id="Sec29"><title>Resistance Exercise Protocol for Industrial Workers</title><sec id="Sec30"><title>Warm-Up stretches: intervention and comparative groups</title><p>Pre-intervention stretching to warm-up and prepare for exercise.</p><p>Stretching will involve cervical, upper/lower limb, and trunk muscles.</p><p>Seven warm-up/stretching exercises (two repetitions of 20&#x000a0;s each) for each muscle group, with attention to proper postural biomechanics and diaphragmatic breathing during stretching.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Starting movements</title><p>
