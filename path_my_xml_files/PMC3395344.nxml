The study was not designed to assess the efficacy of regadenoson for MPI in subjects with asthma or COPD; thus, subjects did not undergo imaging studies following administration of study drug.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</title><p>Subjects with asthma and/or COPD were eligible for enrollment if they were &#x02265;18 years of age. In order to represent patients who were likely candidates for MPI procedures, subjects were to have ongoing coronary artery disease, or have at least two of the following risk factors for coronary artery disease: type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, current or history of cigarette smoking (minimum 10 pack years exposure), or obesity (body mass index [BMI] &#x0003e;30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Asthmatic subjects were to have reasonably well-controlled asthma (as demonstrated by an FEV<sub>1</sub> &#x02265;60% predicted) with the frequency and severity of their symptoms having remained unchanged within 30 days prior to study drug administration. COPD was defined by an FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio &#x0003c;0.70.</p><p>Subjects were to be excluded if they had participated in another drug study or received an investigational drug within 30 days prior to screening. Subjects were not included if they had a history of additional clinically significant illnesses, medical conditions, or laboratory abnormalities within 2&#x000a0;weeks prior to screening that, in the investigator&#x02019;s opinion, would hinder study procedures or confuse the interpretation of data. Furthermore, subjects with a history of second- or third-degree heart block or sinus node dysfunction (unless the subject had a functioning pacemaker), symptomatic hypotension, or who had a respiratory infection within 2&#x000a0;weeks or surgery within 3&#x000a0;months prior to randomization, were excluded.</p><p>Subjects were required to have a stable medication regime for a minimum of 30&#x000a0;days prior to study drug administration, without an exacerbation of their asthma or COPD during this same period. Subjects must not have started on a course of oral or injectable corticosteroids, inhaled steroid combination with a long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonist (oral or inhaled) or anticholinergic, or had undergone a change in dose of such medications &#x02264;30 days prior to study drug administration. Subjects must not have started or changed the dose of any leukotriene antagonists, mast cell stabilizers (cromones), or 5-lipoxygenase antagonists &#x02264;7 days prior to study drug administration. Subjects were not to have an allergy or intolerance to aminophylline or regadenoson or any of its excipients.</p><p>Female subjects who were pregnant or had a positive pregnancy test within 24&#x000a0;hours prior to randomization, lactating, or of childbearing potential and refused to use a medically acceptable form of contraception until the follow-up visit was complete were also excluded.</p><p>Written informed consent and privacy language was obtained from all subjects or legally authorized representatives prior to any study-related procedures, in accordance with the respective Instructional Review Boards or Ethics Committees and appropriate Federal regulations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Concomitant Medications</title><p>Subjects had to abstain from any intake of methylxanthine-containing foods and beverages within 12&#x000a0;hours prior to study drug administration until the follow-up visit. In addition, all subjects had to abstain from theophylline for 12&#x000a0;hours prior to the Day 1 visit. When possible, dipyridamole was withheld for at least 2 days prior to study drug administration. Subjects were not allowed to alter their concomitant medications from study drug administration until the follow-up visit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Randomization and Blinding</title><p>The study was a double-blind, randomized, parallel group study stratified by the underlying condition of asthma or COPD. Subjects who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomized into the study using a 2:1 (regadenoson/placebo) computer-generated randomization schedule by stratum (asthma or COPD). The randomization schedule was generated by Astellas. Study drug assignment was to be revealed only for reasons relating to the safety of the subject, when knowledge of the assigned drug was needed to make critical therapeutic decisions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Drug Administration</title><p>Subjects were to abstain from eating and drinking for 30&#x000a0;minutes prior to and 30 minutes post-study drug administration, and were to abstain from smoking for 3 hours prior and 8 hours post-study drug administration. Subjects received either a 0.4&#x000a0;mg/5&#x000a0;mL (0.08&#x000a0;mg/mL) intravenous bolus injection of regadenoson or matching placebo, administered over approximately 10&#x000a0;seconds, followed by a 5-mL 0.9% saline flush. Subjects were placed in either a reclining or a supine position prior to dosing and remained in that position for the first 2&#x000a0;hours (except during spirometry measurements). The protocol did not require physicians to administer short-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonists (bronchodilators) prior to the administration of regadenoson, although subjects were instructed to continue their normal prescribed respiratory medications prior to study drug administration. After study drug administration, short-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonists were used for mild-to-moderate respiratory or cardiac symptoms, followed by intravenous aminophylline if the short-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonist did not successfully treat the symptoms. Aminophylline was used as the primary treatment for any severe and/or persistent respiratory or cardiac symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Safety Assessments</title><p>The majority of adverse events for regadenoson occur during the 2-hour period after administration; thus, the primary safety objective selected for this study was to determine the percentage of subjects with a &#x0003e;15% decrease in FEV<sub>1</sub> from baseline to the 2-hour post-baseline assessment. A &#x0003e;15% decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> from baseline was chosen as a clinically meaningful indication of airway obstruction. Used in the diagnosis of asthma, a &#x0003e;15% decrease in FEV<sub>1</sub> in an exercise challenge test is diagnostic of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref> Although, changes in respiratory function may be expected to occur before 2 hours post-baseline, subjects with a &#x0003e;15% reduction in FEV<sub>1</sub> from baseline to this assessment would represent those with significant, persistent respiratory function changes. FEV<sub>1</sub> measurements were obtained at 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 8 hours, and 24 hours (follow-up visit) post-study drug administration. The effect of baseline asthma and COPD severity on FEV<sub>1</sub> decreases was also investigated. Asthma severity was assessed jointly by the Astellas Medical Director and an external asthma expert (Dr Bruce M. Prenner, Allergy Associates Medical Group, Inc.) using a modified version of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Expert Panel Report 3 stepwise approach for managing asthma, based on the type and dose of asthma medication (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref> In the event of a difference of opinion between the parties, the classification of the asthma expert was utilized. COPD severity was assessed by the investigator at each study site using the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria, based on lung function parameters (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref> Oxygen saturation was measured continuously by pulse oximetry from baseline through the 2-hour post-baseline assessment; measurements at 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, and 30 minutes, and 1 and 2 hours post-baseline were analyzed.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Asthma and COPD severity criteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left"><italic>Asthma</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Modified version of National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute criteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Step 1: Inhaled short-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonist when needed</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Step 2: Low-dose inhaled corticosteroid OR cromolyn, leukotriene receptor antagonist, nedocromil, or theophylline</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Step 3: Low-dose inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonist OR medium-dose inhaled corticosteroid OR low-dose inhaled corticosteroid, and either leukotriene receptor antagonist, theophylline, or zileuton</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Step 4: Medium-dose inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonist, OR medium-dose inhaled corticosteroid and either leukotriene receptor antagonist, theophylline, or zileuton</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Step 5: High-dose inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonist</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Step 6: High-dose inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonist and oral steroids</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>COPD</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left">GOLD criteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Stage I (mild): FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC&#x000a0;&#x0003c;0.70, FEV<sub>1</sub>&#x000a0;&#x02265;80% predicted</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Stage II (moderate): FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC &#x0003c;0.70, 50%&#x02264;FEV<sub>1</sub>&#x0003c;80% predicted</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Stage III (severe): FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC&#x000a0;&#x0003c;0.70, 30%&#x02264;FEV<sub>1</sub>&#x0003c;50% predicted</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Stage IV (very severe): FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC&#x000a0;&#x0003c;0.70, FEV<sub>1</sub>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;30% predicted or FEV<sub>1</sub>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;50% predicted plus chronic respiratory failure</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>COPD</italic>, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; <italic>FEV</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub><italic>,</italic> forced expiratory volume in 1&#x000a0;second; <italic>FVC</italic>, forced vital capacity.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>Other safety assessments included the incidence of selected respiratory adverse events (defined prior to unblinding as dyspnea, wheezing, obstructive airways disorder, exertional dyspnea, and tachypnea [MedDRA version 11.1 preferred terms]) up to 24 hours post-regadenoson administration, and the use of short-acting bronchodilators in response to these events.

Changes in oxygen saturation from baseline to any post-baseline assessment did not demonstrate statistically significant decreases in the regadenoson group compared with the placebo group in either the asthma or COPD stratum, with the exception of the 30-minute post-baseline measurement in the COPD stratum (&#x02212;0.8% in the regadenoson group vs 0% in the placebo group). The greatest individual decreases in oxygen saturation in the regadenoson group were &#x02212;12.4% (97.9% to 85.5%) and &#x02212;12.7% (98.2% to 85.5%) in the asthma and COPD strata, respectively; both lowest measurements were recorded at the 30-minute post-dose assessment (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). The subjects with the greatest individual decreases in oxygen saturation and the aforementioned subjects with the greatest individual decreases in FEV<sub>1</sub> were not the same subjects. The greatest individual decreases in oxygen saturation in the regadenoson group were less than the corresponding decreases observed in the placebo group (&#x02212;15.2%, 5 minutes post-dose and &#x02212;14.4%, 3 to 7 hours post-dose for the asthma and COPD strata, respectively) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>).</p><p>Two subjects in the placebo group (one with COPD and one with asthma) and two subjects in the regadenoson group (both with COPD) had both a decrease in FEV<sub>1</sub> &#x0003e;15% from baseline and a potentially meaningful decrease in oxygen saturation (to &#x0003c;92% of baseline level). One of the subjects who received regadenoson (COPD stratum) had a &#x0003e;15% FEV<sub>1</sub> decrease and oxygen saturation drop at 15 minutes and 2 hours post-baseline whereas all the other concurrent falls were at 2 hours post-baseline.</p><p>Of the identified selected respiratory adverse events (defined prior to unblinding as dyspnea, wheezing, obstructive airways disorder, exertional dyspnea, and tachypnea), dyspnea occurred most frequently, with a higher incidence (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.0001) in the regadenoson group than the placebo group in both the asthma (10.7% [38/356] vs 1.1% [2/176]) and COPD strata (18.0% [57/316] vs 2.6% [4/151]). In the asthma stratum, wheezing occurred in 3.1% (11/356) of the regadenoson group and 1.1% (2/176) of the placebo group, and obstructive airways disorder (reported as airway constriction) was reported in one regadenoson group subject. In the COPD stratum, all other selected respiratory adverse events occurred in &#x0003c;1% of subjects. In subjects with a &#x0003e;15% decrease in FEV<sub>1</sub> from baseline to the 2-hour post-baseline assessment, no subjects who received placebo in either disease stratum or any subject in the asthma stratum reported a selected respiratory adverse event up to 1 day post-study drug administration. In the COPD stratum, two subjects with a &#x0003e;15% decrease in FEV<sub>1</sub> from baseline to the 2-hour post-baseline assessment who received regadenoson reported dyspnea within 2&#x000a0;hours of study drug administration and two subjects reported dyspnea within 1 day of study drug administration. One subject in the COPD stratum with a &#x0003e;15% decrease in FEV<sub>1</sub> from baseline to the 2-hour post-baseline assessment who received regadenoson reported wheezing within 1 day of study drug administration.

Adverse events that occurred with an incidence rate of &#x0003e;10% among subjects who received regadenoson were headache (97 subjects, 27.2%), dizziness (69, 19.4%), chest discomfort (44, 12.4%), nausea (43, 12.1%), and dyspnea (38, 10.7%) in the asthma stratum (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;356), and headache (62, 19.6%), dyspnea (57, 18.0%), dizziness (45, 14.2%), flushing (37, 11.7%), and chest discomfort (35, 11.1%) in the COPD stratum (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;316); all these events were statistically significantly more frequent in subjects who received regadenoson than placebo. One serious adverse event was reported during the study in an asthmatic subject who received regadenoson (complete atrioventricular block; subject recovered). This event was considered by the investigator as probably related to regadenoson. Three serious adverse events were reported during the study in COPD subjects who received regadenoson; bradycardia was deemed probably related, ECG change (T wave abnormality with possible anterior ischemia) was deemed possibly related, and nephrolithiasis was not considered to be related to regadenoson by the investigators. Two further serious adverse events (rectal hemorrhage and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) were experienced by subjects who received regadenoson after the follow-up visit, neither of which was considered to be related to regadenoson.</p><p>Two regadenoson subjects in the COPD stratum received aminophylline for treatment of adverse events; one subject experienced bradycardia, which was treated with aminophylline 75&#x000a0;mg (intravenous), and one subject experienced dyspnea, which was treated with aminophylline 50&#x000a0;mg (intravenous).</p><p>The percentage of subjects with a heart rate &#x0003e;100&#x000a0;bpm at any assessment up to 1 hour post-study drug administration was greater in the regadenoson group than in the placebo group in both the asthma stratum (16.4% [58/354] vs 0.6% [1/173], respectively) and the COPD stratum (11.1% [35/315] vs 0.7% [1/149], respectively). Furthermore, from examination of ECGs, mean increases in heart rate from baseline to 5 minutes post-dose were greater in subjects who received regadenoson than placebo in the asthma stratum (17.2 vs 0.3&#x000a0;bpm, respectively) and the COPD stratum (14.5 vs &#x02212;0.3&#x000a0;bpm, respectively). The differences between the regadenoson and the placebo groups are consistent with the cardiovascular effects expected for regadenoson,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref> and lessened at each post-baseline assessment in both disease strata. At any of the intervals assessed, the percentage of subjects with an ECG abnormality was similar in the regadenoson and the placebo groups for both disease strata.</p><p>Systolic blood pressure of &#x02265;180&#x000a0;mm&#x000a0;Hg with at least a 20&#x000a0;mm&#x000a0;Hg increase from baseline at any assessment up to 1 hour post-study drug administration was also observed more frequently in subjects in the COPD stratum who received regadenoson than those who received placebo (2.8% [9/316] vs 0.7% [1/151], respectively). No other significant differences were observed between the regadenoson and the placebo groups with regard to heart rate or blood pressure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Regadenoson was not statistically significantly different from placebo with respect to the percentage of subjects experiencing a &#x0003e;15% decrease in FEV<sub>1</sub> from baseline to 2 hours post-baseline, or at any assessment up to the follow-up visit (24 hours post-baseline) in either the asthma or the COPD stratum. The number of subjects with a concurrent &#x0003e;15% decrease in FEV<sub>1</sub> and drop in oxygen saturation to &#x0003c;92% of the baseline value was the same in the regadenoson and placebo groups (two subjects in each).

The GOLD COPD guidelines include categorization of severity based on post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> and the NHLBI asthma criteria are based on the type and dose of asthma medication. Asthma is a dynamic disease, with patients experiencing fluctuations in symptom frequency and severity, such that the treatment that a patient is receiving (on which the NHLBI asthma criteria are based) may, and will, vary over time. In order to optimally assess asthma severity, interpretation of the patient&#x02019;s treatment history in the period preceding the study is needed. In this study, that history involved the 30&#x000a0;days preceding administration of study drug. Furthermore, in accordance with the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the study, subjects were not randomized if they changed their asthma treatment regimen or experienced an exacerbation due to their asthma. It is, therefore, thought that the asthma and the COPD criteria employed in this study are a realistic proxy of disease severity.</p><p>Although the subjects in this study had a wide range of asthma and COPD severity, their underlying disease was required by the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the study to be stable. Thus, the results of this study cannot be extrapolated for subjects who have acute exacerbation of their underlying illness necessitating a change in their treatment regimen. Nonetheless, we believe that this study achieved the aim of evaluating the safety of regadenoson in subjects with a wide range of severity of asthma or COPD. Furthermore, consistent with accepted guidelines, the respiratory condition of patients with asthma or COPD should be as stable as possible prior to MPI with any pharmacologic stress agent.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></p><p>The overall incidence of selected respiratory adverse events was statistically significantly higher in the regadenoson group compared with placebo in both the asthma and the COPD strata, but this did not result in a greater use of short-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonists at the time of these selected respiratory adverse events.

Although no such severe reactions occurred during this study, this does not exclude the possibility of these occurring when adenosine receptor agonists are used in the clinical setting.
