By tradition, colloids have been used to obtain fast circulatory stabilisation, but there are only few trials with patient-centred outcome measures on fluid resuscitation of septic patients. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends either colloids or crystalloids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], but high molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch (HES) may cause acute kidney failure (AKF) in patients with severe sepsis as observed in a recent meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The three largest trials in this analysis studied HES 200/0.6 (MW in kDa/substitution ratio - hydroxyethyl groups per glucose), but found divergent results with respect to kidney failure with this formulation of starch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. All these trials had methodological weaknesses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and two large cohort studies in ICU patients also showed divergent results with respect to the risk of adverse renal effects of starch treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>If HES contributes to AKF in severe sepsis, this is of importance as AKF is an independent risk factor for death in these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, if AKF progresses to end-stage kidney disease, prolonged renal replacement therapy will inflict burden to patients and society.</p><p>High molecular weight HES also causes coagulopathy and bleeding and increases the rate of transfusion during major surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], but effects in ICU patients are largely unstudied.</p><p>Two Cochrane meta-analyses have been published on colloid use in critically ill patients in general. One compared colloids with crystalloids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], but there were few trials on HES. Therefore, reliable conclusions cannot be drawn. The other analysis included a comparison between albumin and high molecular weight HES. In this, a relative risk reduction (RRR) greater than 20% could be rejected, but the 14% RRR observed in this analysis with the use of HES could not be rejected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. As the effects of albumin and crystalloids are likely to be equal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], an alternative hypothesis may be that high molecular weight HES reduces the risk of death by 10 - 20% compared to crystalloids.</p><p>However the high molecular weight HES is hardly ever used in Scandinavian ICUs, where HES 130/0.4 is the preferred colloid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and 1<sup>st </sup>choice fluid for patients with severe sepsis (preliminary data from the SAFE TRIP study, S Finfer, personal communication) and septic shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>At present there are very limited data on the effects of HES 130/0.4 in septic patients. A single trial has been published, in which 20 patients were randomised to fluid resuscitation with either HES 130/0.4 or albumin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. On the other hand, the effects of HES 130/0.4 on coagulation and bleeding may be less pronounced than those observed with HES 200/0.6 at least in the perioperative setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Taken together, two hypotheses can be put forward. Resuscitation with high molecular weight HES may cause AKF in patients with severe sepsis, or may improve survival by up to 20% when compared to crystalloids. In any case, the low molecular weight HES 130/0.4, which is in wide clinical use, is largely unstudied in septic patients. Therefore, there is an urgent need for trials on HES 130/0.4 in patients with severe sepsis.</p><sec><title>Aims</title><p>To assess the effects of HES 130/0.4 compared with a balanced crystalloid solution on mortality and end-stage kidney failure on day 90 in patients with severe sepsis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>Multicentre, randomised, double-blinded trial with concealed allocation of septic patients 1:1 to fluid resuscitation using 6% HES 130/0.4 in Ringer's acetate (Tetraspan, B Braun Medical AG, Melsungen, Germany) or Ringer's acetate (Sterofundin, B Braun Medical) stratified by the presence of shock or not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], haematological malignancy or not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and inclusion in a university hospital or not.</p><sec><title>Tetraspan</title><p>Tetraspan contains hydroxyethylated starch 60 mg 130/0.42 per ml and the isotonic electrolyte solution of sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, sodium acetate and malic acid.

The maximum dose of HES 130/0.4 recommended by the manufacturers is 50 ml/kg ideal BW/24 hours. The maximum dose of trial fluid will be 33 ml/kg ideal BW/24 hours as a recent retrospective study indicated that a dose of HES 130/0.4 above this might increase the risk of kidney failure in septic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. After that unmasked treatment with Ringer's acetate will be given to all patients (see the trial fluid chart generated by the eCRF, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

Outcome differences between therapies for severe sepsis will, therefore, have major impact on global health and healthcare costs.</p><p>Currently, three other RCTs are assessing the effects of HES 130/0.4 in sepsis:</p><p>BASES is a single centre study expected to include 250 patients with severe sepsis. The primary outcome measure is ICU length of stay, but mortality and the frequency of renal replacement therapy is also recorded (clinicaltrial.gov identifier: NCT00273728). Recruitment is expected to be completed in May 2010 (M Siegemund, personal communication).</p><p>CRYSTMAS is a multicentre study expected to include 200 patients with severe sepsis. The primary outcome measure is amount of fluid required to achieve initial haemodynamic stabilisation and amount of enteral calories given in the 7 days after stabilisation, but markers of organ failure will also be recorded. Recruitment has been stopped in March 2010 (clinicaltrial.gov identifier: NCT00464204).</p><p>CHEST is an Australian/New Zealand multicentre RCT comparing HES 130/0.4 and saline in 7,000 hypovolaemic ICU patients (clinicaltrial.gov identifier: NCT00935168). The primary outcome measure is 90-day mortality and subgroup analysis of patients with severe sepsis is planned (J Myburgh, personal communication). We collaborate with the investigators and plan a common individual patient data meta-analysis combining our data with those of their patients with severe sepsis (1,000 expected). Thus inclusion and exclusion criteria and outcome measures of the two trials have been harmonised to prepare for the common analysis.</p><p>Even though none of the trials alone may be definitive in answering the questions regarding safety and efficacy of HES 130/0.4 in patients with severe sepsis, the results will form the basis for meta-analysis of data from more than 2,000 septic patients.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The 6S trial will provide important safety and efficacy data on the use of HES 130/0.4 in patients with severe sepsis.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>All authors made substantive contributions to the 6S trial as trial site investigators and revised and gave final approval of the manuscript.
