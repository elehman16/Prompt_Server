HIAT consisting of 3 sets of 3-min cycling at 80~90% VO<sub>2max</sub> with a 2-min active rest at 50% VO<sub>2max</sub> between sets; and CAT consisting of 40 min of cycling at 60~65% VO<sub>2max</sub>. During each session, resting VO<sub>2</sub>, exercise VO<sub>2</sub>, and a 180-min post-exercise VO<sub>2</sub> were measured. The net exercise VO<sub>2</sub> during the SIT, HIAT, and CAT averaged 14.7 &#x000b1; 1.5, 31.8 &#x000b1; 4.1, and 71.1 &#x000b1; 10.0 L, and the EPOCs averaged 6.8 &#x000b1; 4.0, 4.5 &#x000b1; 3.3, and 2.9 &#x000b1; 2.8 L, respectively. The EPOC with SIT was greater than with CAT (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) and HIAT (<italic>P</italic> = 0.12). Correlation coefficients obtained between subjects&#x02019; VO<sub>2max</sub> and the ratio of EPOC to net exercise VO<sub>2</sub> for SIT, HIAT, and CAT were &#x02212;0.61 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.06), -0.79 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01), and &#x02212;0.42 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.23), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our data suggest that cardiorespiratory fitness level correlates negatively with the magnitude of EPOC, especially when performing aerobic-type interval training.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Aerobic fitness</kwd><kwd>Maximal oxygen consumption</kwd><kwd>Cycling</kwd><kwd>Energy expenditure</kwd><kwd>Exercise physiology</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Findings</title><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>A review paper regarding excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) found that trained and conditioned individuals had a more rapid return from post-exercise metabolism to resting levels after exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], whereas, another review paper found that training level had minimal influence on EPOC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Thus, the association between fitness level and EPOC is still controversial, and both review papers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] indicate further study should be conducted to confirm the association between fitness level and EPOC for more strenuous exercise bouts, such as levels greater than 80% maximal oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2max</sub>).</p><p>We have been developing two types of original exercise training protocols at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) which are better suited to astronauts during long-term spaceflight: sprint interval training (SIT) and high-intensity interval aerobic training (HIAT). In a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], we compared total energy expenditure (EE), including EPOC, induced by the two protocols with the total EE of traditional, continuous aerobic training (CAT). The study showed that exercise intensity had a noticeable effect on the EPOC. That is, although the SIT was the shortest duration among our three protocols, and the net exercise EE of the SIT (77 kcal) was only 20% of the EE of CAT (350 kcal) and 50% of the EE of HIAT (161 kcal), SIT&#x02019;s EPOC during the 180-min post-exercise period was the greatest among the three protocols. In this short report, we examine associations between a subject&#x02019;s cardiorespiratory fitness level and EPOC using our three exercise protocols.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Detailed descriptions of the study protocol have been published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Briefly, our ten male subjects&#x02019; average values in age, height, body weight, body mass index and VO<sub>2max</sub> were 24.0 &#x000b1; 3.3 (range: 20&#x02013;31) years, 170.8 &#x000b1; 5.0 (162.1 - 175.6) cm, 61.9 &#x000b1; 5.7 (54.6 - 69.7) kg, 21.2 &#x000b1; 1.7 (18.4 - 23.3) kg&#x000b7;m<sup>-2</sup>, and 3.18 &#x000b1; 0.45 (2.34 - 3.75) L&#x000b7;min<sup>-1</sup> (or 52.0 &#x000b1; 9.2 (36.2 - 61.4) ml&#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup>&#x000b7;min<sup>-1</sup>), respectively. The aim and design of this study were explained to every subject before each gave their written, informed consent. This study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines proposed in the Declaration of Helsinki. The Ethical Committee of both JAXA (reference number: 32-2-7) and University of Tsukuba (22&#x02013;283) reviewed and approved the study protocol.</p><p>The subjects completed three experimental sessions separated by approximately 1 week. During each session, the subjects performed one of three exercise trials, i.e., SIT, HIAT, or CAT. The detailed protocols of the three cycling exercises are shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S1. All aspects of the experimental session remained the same during all three sessions except the actual exercise technique. The three sessions were implemented in random order.</p><p>On each session day, the subjects arrived at our laboratory at approximately 7:15 am. They were asked to minimize any physical activity (walking etc.) while en route from their home to the laboratory. Six subjects drove their own cars to the laboratory, and 4 subjects were picked up at their homes and driven to the building by a research assistant because they did not have their own cars. At 7:45 am, a subject would seat himself in a comfortable armchair and remain in a resting (seated) position without movement until 8:20 am. From 8:05 to 8:20 am (15 minutes), the subject was connected to a face mask of the indirect calorimeter for baseline data collection. Average VO<sub>2</sub> data during the final 10 minutes were used as the baseline value. After the baseline measurements, we disconnected the face mask and allowed the subject to take a drink of water before riding on the cycling ergometer (75XL &#x00428;, Konami, Tokyo, Japan) for the exercise phase. After the water, he was reconnected to the indirect calorimeter and started pedaling the ergometer at 8:25 am.</p><p>After the exercise phase, the subject returned to the resting position immediately but stayed connected to the indirect calorimeter for 10 minutes to measure immediate post-exercise VO<sub>2</sub>. After 10 minutes, we removed the face mask but the subject remained in the resting position for another 170 minutes. During the post-exercise phase, the subject remained in the resting position immobile. Ten minutes of VO<sub>2</sub> measurements were started at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 minutes post exercise. For each measurement session, average VO<sub>2</sub> data during the final 5 minutes was used.</p><p>All gas exchange measurements were measured using the mixing chamber method with an open-circuit computerized indirect calorimeter (AE-310S, Minato Medical Science, Osaka, Japan). The ventilatory volume, VO<sub>2</sub>, and VCO<sub>2</sub> were calculated every 15 seconds. The gas analyzer was calibrated before each trial. Coefficient of variation (CV) from the mean for the three resting VO<sub>2</sub> measurements in the 10 subjects was 4.3%.</p><p>To measure each subject&#x02019;s VO<sub>2max</sub>, we used the criteria described by Tanaka et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] Briefly, after a 2-min warm up at 15 Watt (W), the subjects began the actual exercise protocol at a 30 W level. The workload was increased every minute by 15 W until volitional exhaustion. We determined the highest oxygen uptake achieved over 30 seconds as the VO<sub>2max</sub>.</p><p>To determine each subject&#x02019;s exercise intensity during the exercise session, we used the VO<sub>2max</sub> measurement data (i.e., values per minute for workload and VO<sub>2</sub>) and calculated a simple linear regression equation for each subject: Y&#x02009;=&#x02009;<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>x&#x02009;+&#x02009;c, with Y = workload (W), x = VO<sub>2</sub> (ml), and &#x000df; and c as constants. Subsequently, percentage VO<sub>2max</sub> data (ml) (e.g., 120% VO<sub>2max</sub> for SIT) were applied to the equation, whereupon each subject&#x02019;s exercise intensity (workload (W)) was determined.</p><p>To determine net exercise VO<sub>2</sub> and EPOC, the area under the curve (AUC) for each phase was calculated for each subject using a statistical-software package (SAS version 9.2, SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA). As for the SIT and HIAT, periods of active rest were included in the calculation of the net exercise VO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>To analyze differences among the three sessions, we used one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and applied Tukey-Kramer&#x02019;s post hoc test when the difference was significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) according to the results of ANOVA. We assessed the relationship between two measurement values with Pearson&#x02019;s product moment correlation. We used SAS, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA) to analyze the data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The net VO<sub>2</sub> incurred with the HIAT (31.8 &#x000b1; 4.1 L) was significantly lower than during the CAT (71.1 &#x000b1; 10.0 L), but it was significantly greater than the net VO<sub>2</sub> incurred during the SIT (14.7 &#x000b1; 1.5 L). The EPOC was significantly greater with the SIT (6.8 &#x000b1; 4.0 L) than with the CAT (2.9 &#x000b1; 2.8 L), and it also tended to be greater than with the HIAT (4.5 &#x000b1; 3.3 L) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.12).

The ratio of EPOC to net exercise VO<sub>2</sub> during the SIT (<italic>r</italic> = &#x02212;0.61, <italic>P</italic> = 0.06) and the HIAT (<italic>r</italic> = &#x02212;0.79, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) correlated inversely with VO<sub>2max</sub>, whereas, we observed no significant correlation between these two variables for the CAT (<italic>r</italic> = &#x02212;0.42, <italic>P</italic> = 0.23). As for the correlation between absolute EPOC value and VO<sub>2max</sub>, we observed a significant correlation for the HIAT (<italic>r</italic> = &#x02212;0.67, <italic>P</italic> = 0.03), but no significant correlation for the SIT (<italic>r</italic> = &#x02212;0.47, <italic>P</italic> = 0.17) and CAT (<italic>r</italic> = &#x02212;0.34, <italic>P</italic> = 0.34).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Ohkawara et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] showed a significant negative correlation between a subject&#x02019;s fitness level and the EPOC under normal living conditions in a metabolic chamber. The significant correlation was observed not on a day with moderate-intensity physical activity but on a day with vigorous-intensity physical activity. Also, Singh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] recently showed that VO<sub>2</sub> decline during the first minute of recovery after maximum exercise was faster in children with a higher VO<sub>2max</sub>. Our experimental results with a single bout of exercise were consistent with those studies&#x02019; results. That is, in the present study, while the ratio of EPOC to net exercise VO<sub>2</sub> correlated inversely with VO<sub>2max</sub>, we observed this significant association when subjects performed a high-intensity interval exercise, especially an aerobic-type interval protocol (the HIAT), but not when they performed a moderate-intensity continuous protocol (the CAT). Although several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] reported that training level did not significantly impact EPOC, the exercise intensities (30~70% VO<sub>2max</sub>) used in those previous studies were relatively low compared to our interval exercise protocols.</p><p>While the precise mechanism of EPOC remains unclear, physiological adaptation associated with improved fitness levels has been considered a factor potentially influencing EPOC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. For example, an enhanced lactate metabolism with elevated body temperature partly accounts for EPOC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Trained individuals have better thermoregulatory capacities than untrained individuals because physical training enhances the sweating mechanism at a given level of the central sweating drive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Therefore, elevated body temperature in untrained individuals could last longer than in trained individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Moreover, subjects with lower VO<sub>2max</sub> might produce more lactate than those with higher VO<sub>2max</sub> especially during strenuous exercise. An enhanced lactate metabolism requires oxygen consumption for recovery. Thus, fitness level may contribute to the magnitude of EPOC.</p><p>In conclusion, we revealed that cardiorespiratory fitness level correlates inversely with the magnitude of EPOC, especially when performing an aerobic-type interval exercise.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>The contributions of each author were as follows: TM and KO contributed to manuscript writing, developing study concept and design, data acquisition, and data analysis; SS contributed to manuscript revisions, data acquisition, and data analysis; NS contributed to manuscript revisions and data acquisition; SY and HO contributed to manuscript revisions and developing study concept and design; KT and CM represented the University of Tsukuba and JAXA, respectively, in this joint research project and contributed to manuscript revisions, developing study concept and design, and data acquisition.
