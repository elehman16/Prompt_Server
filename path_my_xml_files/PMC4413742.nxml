Consent packs with information regarding the study were distributed by the doctors to potential study candidates. Once informed consent was obtained, the doctors would access the Study Pack, which contained all the equipment for the procedure including preallocated needle size, thus ensuring allocation concealment. The blinding process required patients to wear opaque glasses or close their eyes during the arterial puncture. A standardised data form was used to record all data collected during the procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="EMERMED2014203600F1">figure 1</xref>). The primary outcome was the 10&#x02005;cm hatched visualised analogue scale to record pain associated with the procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="EMERMED2014203600F2">figure 2</xref>). A successful outcome was defined by collection of 0.5&#x02005;mL arterial blood sample confirmed on analysis. A failed attempt was defined as &#x0003c;0.5&#x02005;mL collection (inadequate sample volume), or a sample deemed venous on the blood gas analysis or more than three attempts were made by two proceduralists.

There were no major complications noted during the study, although the minor complication rate was significantly higher than the 2&#x02013;13% rate previously published in the limited literature<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The discrepancies between the literature complication rates and the study group rates may have been related to the differences in technique and site of procedure performed. Nevertheless, the most common complication reported was haematoma of the puncture site, and this was more prominent in the 23G needle group (17.5%).</p><p>We found that there was no significant difference in the difficulty score between needle groups and no significant difference in reported difficulty scores if operators did not use their preferred needle size. This suggests that the 23G and 25G needles can be interchanged and users can readily adapt to either.</p><p>Even though the randomisation was computer generated, there was a discrepancy noted between the 23G group of 63 patients and the 25G group of 56 patients. Contributing to this was the fact that five patients in the 25G study group and two in the 23G group were not included in the final analysis due to incomplete data. In the majority of cases, this was due to an incomplete pain or difficulty score.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations</title><p>This was a single institution study conducted in one public hospital emergency department in the metropolitan area employing one particular brand and type of needle and thus might not be generalisable to all emergency departments. It is a proof-of-concept approach to the question of whether two different gauge needles would affect the pain experienced by patients undergoing an ABG analysis. The manufacturer use of colour coding for their needle size meant that this was only a single-blinded randomised control trial, which may have led to operator variability. Also, the data presented and predominantly analysed was the first pain and difficulty score due to the limited number of second and third attempts. There were assumptions made that patients were physically blinded, although this could not have been audited. Finally, while patients and operators were asked to draw a single line on the VAS for pain and difficulty, there were 50 patient forms and 58 operator forms where the number was circled instead. This may have implications regarding results analysis due to discrepancies with the methodology. Definitions were not provided regarding the meaning of complications, and therefore, the results regarding this aspect need to be interpreted with care. The use of local anaesthetic prior to arterial puncture, the possible alternative of venous blood gas sampling and the use of other size/length needles are beyond the scope of this study.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the medical statistician Karen Blyth for her help in data analysis.
