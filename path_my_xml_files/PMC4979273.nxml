NSAID's act primarily through the inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase enzymes (COX enzymes 1 and 2), and in turn, COX-2 inhibition prevents prostaglandin formation ultimately preventing inflammation and sensitization of peripheral nocireceptors.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Preemptive analgesia has been defined as an anti-nociceptive treatment that prevents altered processing of afferent input amplifying postoperative pain.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Since endodontic patients come to the office already in pain, a more clinically relevant term to use would be pretreatment analgesia.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] This technique may decrease the establishment of central sensitization, a mechanism whereby spinal neurons increase their responsiveness to peripheral nociceptive input.</p><p>NSAID's are one of the most frequently advised analgesic. Their popularity is attributed to their over-the-counter availability, efficacy in relieving pain and fever, and low side effect profile at therapeutic doses.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Piroxicam, a nonselective NSAID may be useful in pain control. Half-life of which is 50 h. Injection of this anti-inflammatory agent directly into the site of inflammation is effective.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Very few studies have evaluated the efficacy of various modes of delivery of Piroxicam in the management of postendodontic. Hence, this study aimed at establishing the effectiveness of pretreatment Piroxicam in management of postendodontic pain and compare the efficacy of two modes of delivery of pretreatment Piroxicam; oral and intraligamentary for management of pain after single visit endodontics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Sixty-six patients were selected from the outpatient clinic of the Department of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics, M S Ramaiah Dental College, Bengaluru. The research protocol was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Institution. A sample size of twenty two subjects in each group was advocated. Subjects were randomly divided into three groups by allocation concealment method.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Group I &#x02013; control group, Group II &#x02013; oral Piroxicam group, and Group III &#x02013; intraligamentary Piroxicam group. Inclusion criteria was healthy persons, 18&#x02013;65 years of age reporting with pain in first or second premolar of either jaw. Teeth diagnosed as symptomatic irreversible pulpitis with no recent history of any antibiotic or analgesic taken were included in the study. Teeth that could be treated endodontically in one visit was also a criteria. Patients with known hypersensitivity to Piroxicam, pregnancy or lactation, history of asthma or allergy to anti-inflammatory drugs, and history of stomach and intestinal disorders were excluded.</p><p>An informed consent was taken from the patient before starting the procedure after which a visual analog scale (VAS) standard tool for rating pain was explained and given to them and they were asked to self-assess their pain preoperatively. In Group I, patients were anesthetized with standard injections (block and/or infiltration) with 1.8 mL of 2% lidocaine containing 1:80,000 epinephrine. After eliciting the established onset of local anesthesia, root canal treatment of teeth was carried following a standard protocol. Patients in Group II were given two dispersible tablets of Piroxicam 20 mg (DolonexDT<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Pfizer, India) each &#x000bd; h before the procedure and were treated similar to Group I patients. For patients in Group III (intraligamentary Piroxicam) Piroxicam cartridges were prepared prior to the study, by removing the rubber plungers from the standard anesthetic cartridges, which were emptied, washed with distilled water and then autoclaved. The method of preparation of the Piroxicam cartridges was identical to the method as set out in Elsharrawy's article on supplemental intraligamentary injection of fentanyl and mepivacaine.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Empty sterile anesthetic cartridges of lidocane were filled with Piroxicam (20 mg/mL) solution from the commercially available vials (Dolonex<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Pfizer, India). These cartridges were loaded into the Midwest Comfort Control<sup>&#x02122;</sup> Syringe (Dentsply International, York, PA, USA), and the flow rate was adjusted for the intraligamentary injection (0.07 mL/s) as per manufacturers' instructions. Patients tooth was anesthetized with standard injections (block and/or infiltration) with 1.8 mL of 2% lidocaine containing 1:80,000 epinephrine. After eliciting the established onset of local anesthesia, patients received supplemental intraligamentary injection of 0.4 mL of 20 mg/mL Piroxicam as an active drug. 0.2 mL on either side, i.e. mesiobuccal and distobuccal line-angles of the tooth. Root canal treatment of teeth was carried out under the same protocol as in Group I.</p><p>After completion of the endodontic treatment, the patients were asked to self-assess the severity of pain experienced by them at 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h following the completion of treatment and mark the appropriate score according to the VAS scale in the evaluation form. All patients were given a rescue pill (acetaminophen 750 mg) in case of pain, and they were asked to mark their score in the evaluation form before consuming the pill.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed with the use of the nonparametric tests such as the Mann&#x02013;Whitney U-test and the Kruksal&#x02013;Wallis test by using SPSS software (version15, SPSS Inc, Chicago). <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 were used to indicate significant differences.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> depicts the evaluation of the pain scores within each of the Groups.

Posttreatment pain in endodontics has been reported to occur in 25&#x02013;40% of all endodontic patients.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Most of the investigators have found that there is a strong relationship between preoperative and postoperative pain.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Patients in the control group experienced reduction in pain 4 h postoperatively as compared to their preoperative pain. This could be due to the 'Floor Effect' commonly attributed to the endodontic treatment rendered. However, at other postoperative intervals, i.e., at 8, 12, 24, and 48 h, it was observed that patients experienced a gradual increase in their pain. We observed that patients experience pain up to 48 h, i.e., the period of observation of the study; after single visit endodontic therapy. This observation is in accordance with various studies that state; patients with pretreatment pain frequently experience posttreatment.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Irritation of periradicular tissues during root canal therapy causes an acute inflammatory reaction and results in pain and/or swelling.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Many endogenous chemical mediators, particularly prostaglandins, have been associated with inflammation and its related pain. In this study, NSAIDs were selected for several reasons. First, they inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins. Prostaglandin suppression is particularly important because it lowers the pain threshold (i.e., produces allodynia) and sensitizes nociceptors to other pain mediators.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Second, although prostaglandins are only one of many pronociceptive inflammatory mediators, it is important to realize that their tissue levels are associated with patient reports of pain,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] suggesting that NSAIDs may be key drugs for pain abatement. Third, NSAIDs are widely available without prescription, and some studies suggest that NSAIDs are effective in managing endodontic pain.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>This study aims at evaluating a NSAID for the management of postendodontic pain, in which 40 mg of oral Piroxicam was given to the patient half an hour before initiating the treatment as prescribed by various authors as the permissible dose for managing acute pain. About 0.4 mL of intraligamentary Piroxicam was given in accordance with Adnan Atebai's study.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Results showed that the variables such as age, sex, tooth type were not statistically different in all the three groups.</p><p>Both oral and intraligamentary Piroxicam did minimize the postendodontic pain experienced by all the patients in Group II and III at all the time intervals, i.e., 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h postoperatively as compared to patients in the Group I (control group) (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>The difference in amount of alleviation of pain achieved in patients by oral and intraligamentary Piroxicam; Group II and III at 4 and 8 h postoperatively was not very pronounced (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.448), but at intervals 12, 24, and 48 h postoperatively, intraligamentary Piroxicam proved to be efficacious in abating the pain in patients belonging to Group III as compared to that of patients in Group II where the pain initially seemed to dwindle but during later postoperative hours, the pain escalated gradually and this difference between Group II and III was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Piroxicam's half-life of 50 h could favorably overcome the intense pain up to 48 h following the treatment.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>Oral Piroxicam alleviated the patient's postendodontic pain only up to 8 h postoperatively [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. The reason for this can be extrapolated to the bioavailability of Piroxicam which is 100% when given as an intraligamentary injection at the target site in comparison to that of the oral Piroxicam as it has to undergo hepatic by-pass before reaching the target site. Thus, the drug available at the target site is less in oral group; hence, supporting the results.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Results of the present study are in accordance with that of other studies where the authors have used NSAID's or steroids to be deposited directly in the periapical area either by intraligamentary route, giving a periapical injection or a supra-periosteal injection to gain effective control over postendodontic pain.</p><p>Various complications are associated with an intraligamentary injection; swelling and discoloration of soft tissue at the injection site and prolonged ischemia of interdental papilla followed by sloughing and exposure of crestal bone. Most common causes of postinjection discomforts are either rapid injection or injection of excessive volume of solution into the site.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The patients in the present study did not report with any such discomfort or complications as the abovementioned causes of discomfort were negated by the use of Comfort Control Syringe<sup>&#x02122;</sup>.</p><p>Further research is required involving a more extensive follow-up for critically evaluating the effectiveness of Piroxicam beyond 48 h. Though there is enough literature on the use of VAS, there are still few concerns regarding the same. The values of the VAS scale are according to the pain threshold level of individual patient, which may vary to a considerable extent. Further clinical studies comparing the effectiveness of Piroxicam with other group of pharmacological agents can be carried out.</p><p>This trial further reiterated the fact that patients reporting with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis more often than not experience posttreatment pain of varying intensities. In such patients, a preemptive analgesic would go a long way to alleviate their pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>However, within the limitations of the study, it can be concluded that Piroxicam was effective in allaying the postendodontic pain experienced by the patient. It was further observed that among oral and intraligamentary mode of delivery of Piroxicam, the latter proved to be more efficacious in abating postendodontic pain for a period up to 48 h.</p><sec
