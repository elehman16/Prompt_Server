We introduced an in-patient PD unit for those admitted urgently with general medical problems. We explored the effect of the unit on medication management, length of stay and patient experience.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a single-center prospective feasibility study. The unit's core features were defined following consultation with patients and professionals: specially trained staff, ready availability of PD drugs, guidelines, and care led by a geriatrician with specialty PD training. Mandatory staff training comprised four 1&#x000a0;h sessions: PD symptoms; medications; therapy; communication and swallowing. Most medication was prescribed using an electronic Prescribing and Administration system (iSOFT) which provided accurate data on time of administration. We compared patient outcomes before and after introduction of the unit.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The general ward care (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;20) and the Specialist Parkinson's Unit care (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;24) groups had similar baseline characteristics. On the specialist unit: less Parkinson's medication was omitted (13% vs 20%, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001); of the medication that was given, more was given on time (64% vs 50%, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001); median length of stay was shorter (9 days vs 13 days, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.043) and patients' experience of care was better (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>If replicated and generalizable to other hospitals, reductions in length of stay would lead to significant cost savings. The apparent improved outcomes with Parkinson's unit care merit further investigation.

People with Parkinson's are more likely than their peers to be admitted to hospital <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> with more than 80% being emergency admissions <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In the UK, many are admitted to general medical or elderly care wards with falls, pneumonia, urinary tract infection and reduced mobility <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However people with Parkinson's are often dissatisfied with the care provided <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and, in particular, are concerned that omitted or delayed administration of medication may lead to immobility, complications and longer lengths of stay <xref rid="bib5 bib6 bib7 bib8" ref-type="bibr">[5&#x02013;8]</xref>. Staff knowledge of Parkinson's is perceived to be poor <xref rid="bib9 bib10" ref-type="bibr">[9,10]</xref>. The US National Parkinson Foundation (NPF) has called for educational programmes, recommendations and guidelines for the care of people with Parkinson's admitted to hospital <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Few intervention studies have been published <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Early consultation by a neurologist and promotion of self-medication have also been recommended <xref rid="bib2 bib13 bib14" ref-type="bibr">[2,13,14]</xref>.</p><p>Emergency care on specialist units by appropriately trained staff has proved beneficial for a variety of other conditions such as stroke, myocardial infarction and gastrointestinal bleeding <xref rid="bib15 bib16 bib17 bib18" ref-type="bibr">[15&#x02013;18]</xref>. Whilst, anecdotally, cohorting of PD in-patients has been tried before, we are not aware of a published formal assessment of this approach.</p><p>We hypothesized that care on a specialist in-patient Parkinson's Disease Unit (SPDU) would improve both clinically important and patient focused outcomes for people with Parkinson's needing urgent medical care. We used staff and patient focus groups to define the core features of a specialist Parkinson's unit, which was subsequently initiated as an intervention in the context of a busy acute elderly medicine ward. This was evaluated using a prospective study design. Secondary objectives were to explore the feasibility of planning a multi-center randomized controlled trial, and to evaluate and improve the intervention; the staff training program and SPDU processes.</p><p>We choose to investigate a specialist unit rather than train all hospital staff because low admission rates on many wards could contribute to decay of staff knowledge.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Study design</title><p>We conducted a single-center prospective pilot study. We compared patient outcomes before and after the introduction of the specialist Parkinson's unit. For 3 months (April&#x02013;June 2012) we recruited patients with Parkinson's admitted urgently to general medical/elderly care wards. In July 2012 we set up the Specialist in-patient Parkinson's Disease Unit and trained the staff on the ward chosen to host the specialist unit. Then (Aug 2012&#x02013;Feb 2013) we recruited Parkinson's patients going through this specialist unit. The prospectively determined primary outcomes were the proportion of PD medication given on time and length of stay. The study protocol was approved by the hospital's research and development department and a local research ethics committee (NRES East Midlands - Northampton, REC reference 11/EM/0460).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Setting</title><p>The unit was located on an acute 28-bed elderly care ward in a 1100 bed teaching hospital serving a population of 500,000. The number of beds for Parkinson's patients was flexible, typically 2&#x02013;6. The specially trained staff cared for other patients as well as Parkinson's patients. Ward staffing levels were the same as other elderly care wards in the hospital (see <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Appendix 1</xref>). Most patients were admitted via the medical assessment unit (MAU) where they typically spent less than 24&#x000a0;h.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>The intervention</title><p>The core features of the unit were: mandatory staff training; care led by a geriatrician with specialist training in Parkinson's; enhanced stock of Parkinson's drugs (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Appendix 2</xref>); use of Parkinson's management guidelines; regular multidisciplinary meetings; enhanced access to specialist PD therapists, PD nurse and movement disorder neurologist; and encouragement of self-medicating when appropriate. The mandatory education program comprised 4 one-hour training sessions: PD symptoms and signs; medications, the importance of accurate and timely drug administration, potential medication side effects; therapy, movement and handling, cueing strategies and avoidance of dual tasking; communication and swallowing. Training was in small groups with a trainer. Training videos were developed by the research team.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><label>2.4</label><title>Study population</title><p>We included only English-speaking patients with PD who needed urgent admission to hospital with a medical problem. We used UK brain bank criteria to confirm the diagnosis of PD <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. We excluded: patients with parkinsonism due to conditions other than PD; patients whose acute condition required admission to a different specialist unit (e.g. Coronary Care Unit, trauma ward). We tried to recruit consecutive PD admissions. We visited the MAU and elderly care wards daily (weekdays) to identify eligible patients. When the Parkinson's unit was open, Parkinson's patients were sent there if there was a bed available. We sought informed consent from participants. Initially we allowed a minimum of 24&#x000a0;h to read the patient information sheet. Following ethical approval this &#x0201c;cooling off&#x0201d; period was reduced to 4&#x000a0;h (September 2012). We included patients who were confused and lacked capacity to consent after seeking written advice from a consultee, usually the next of kin.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><label>2.5</label><title>Data collection</title><p>On admission we collected baseline demographic and clinical data. The correct medication schedule was determined by the following hierarchy: report of lucid patient; report of carer; telephone call to family doctor; drug record from last out-patient visit. We examined accuracy of prescription and administration. Most medication was prescribed using an electronic Prescribing and Administration system (iSOFT) allowing the time of administration to be precisely measured. &#x0201c;On time&#x0201d; administration was defined as within 30&#x000a0;min of the scheduled time. The system also recorded reasons medications were omitted. Prescription errors were checked manually (RS). Potential prescription errors included: medication not prescribed; wrong dose; wrong dose frequency; wrong preparation; wrong timing (we allowed 30&#x000a0;min margin of error); prescription of anti-dopaminergic drug. We counted a single missed dose of Parkinson's medication due to non-prescription of medication as a prescription error. Changes made to medication schedules by the treating physician were not considered erroneous if justified in the medical notes.</p><p>On admission and discharge we checked hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), Barthel Index for activities of daily living and Lindop Parkinson's Assessment Scale (LPAS) for mobility <xref rid="bib20 bib21 bib22" ref-type="bibr">[20&#x02013;22]</xref>.</p><p>A patient experience survey, based on that of Parkinson's UK, was administered by a researcher who was not part of the clinical team. If the survey had not been completed by discharge, it was posted out and self-administered. Carers completed the survey if subjects were unable. In-patient complications were assessed by review of the medical and nursing notes (LB). We used the hospital's patient administration system and the hospital notes to check mortality at 6 months.</p><p>We collected data to assess the feasibility of a future randomized controlled trial. We evaluated the staff training with staff knowledge questionnaires before and after each training module and a feedback form after each module.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><label>2.6</label><title>Study size</title><p>As this was a pilot study, sample size estimations have not been performed. Using hospital patient administration system (PAS) data, we estimated 40&#x02013;50 eligible patients would be admitted to relevant wards over a 3-month period. We estimated a 50% recruitment rate. All the elderly care wards have high bed occupancy so, despite efforts, not all eligible patients would reach the ward hosting the Parkinson's unit. We estimated 40&#x02013;50 patients would go through the unit in 7 months and that 20&#x02013;25 would consent.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.7"><label>2.7</label><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using Stata v11. The unit of analysis was the individual patient for all outcomes except the medication data which were analyzed based on individual doses. The distribution of continuous outcomes was assessed using their histograms and results of non-parametric outcomes are presented as median (interquartile range). The continuous outcomes (age, length of stay, number of complications, time from drug prescription to administration, frequency of daily doses, staff knowledge scores), were compared before and after the SPDU using Mann Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. All categorical variables (demographics, related to medication, mortality, discharge, patient satisfaction questions) were compared between pre and post intervention using Fisher's Exact test. We calculated Spearman's rho to check for correlation between medication outcomes and length of stay.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><sec id="sec3.1"><label>3.1</label><title>Participants</title><p>In the general ward care phase of the study we screened 51 patients, 39 were eligible and 20 were recruited: 51% recruitment rate.

Patient presenting complaints were often non-specific or multiple but included delirium or psychosis in 25% of each group, and motor problems and falls in 35% (Parkinson's unit) and 33% (general ward). One patient in each group was on antipsychotic medication (quetiapine) before admission and one patient on the Parkinson's unit commenced quetiapine during the admission.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><label>3.3</label><title>Medication outcomes</title><p>On the specialist unit significantly less Parkinson's medication was omitted compared to general ward care (13% vs 20% respectively, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4579 doses); of the Parkinson's medication that was given, significantly more was given on time (64% vs 50%, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3494 doses).

Data collection rates on admission and discharge were: Barthel scale 24 (55%) and 7 (17%), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 18 (41%) and 8 (20%), Lindop Parkinson's Gait Assessment 6 (14%) and 2 (5%).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first acute admission unit for PD patients that has been designed by staff and patients, initiated in the context of a busy acute medical hospital and evaluated prospectively, collecting data on clinically important outcomes such as electronically measured timing of medication, as well as patient centered outcomes. Our data demonstrate less omitted PD medication, more PD medication given on time, shorter length of stay, and better patient experience on a specialist Parkinson's ward.</p><p>The strengths of our study design include: involvement of PD patients and professional staff in the development of the intervention, prospective evaluation of the unit, and electronic data collection on medication timing. The inclusion of both hospital-based objective outcomes and patient-centered subjective outcomes allows different impacts of a complex intervention to be explored. Limitations of our study include: population not blinded to hypotheses being tested, non-randomized trial design, small sample size, Hawthorne effect, and lack of an economic evaluation. The trial design does not exclude the possibility that other factors influenced the observed outcomes. Neither patients nor researchers were blinded to treatment allocation. Although there was no significant difference between groups in time from admission to recruitment (data not shown), greater efforts on the Parkinson's specialist unit to recruit patients early, and the shorter cooling off period prior to consenting, could have influenced the observed reduction in length of stay. Although a formal economic evaluation was not undertaken it appears to be a low cost intervention as no new staff were appointed and no new beds opened. Pharmacy costs from wasted drugs held as stock on the ward were negligible. The main costs related to mandatory staff training (estimate: less than &#x000a3;5000 or $8000). On the other hand, if the shorter length of stay were confirmed, and if it could be generalized to other hospitals, cost savings might be considerable: based on an estimate of 160 PD admissions a year and an estimated cost per patient per day of &#x000a3;225, cost savings to our hospital could be in the region of &#x000a3;144,000.</p><p>Specialist Parkinson's units have their own limitations. Pressure on beds in busy acute hospitals means availability of beds on the specialist Parkinson's unit is not guaranteed. In this study 32 potential participants were excluded because they were sent to other wards. Similar problems have, however, been overcome by stroke services. We expect it would be feasible to set up similar units in hospitals of a similar size in the UK. Where there is no geriatrician with appropriate expertise the intervention might be adapted to include daily input from the neurology team.</p><p>There is tension between using beds flexibly and potential improved outcomes in specialized beds; we hope our data will contribute usefully to the discussion. Increased attention to PD patients on the ward could have had a negative impact on the other patients; alternatively care of others could have improved as aspects of the training were relevant to many conditions. Patients needing care on other specialist units are excluded, so an alternative approach is needed for these patients. A pro-active Parkinson's outreach service led by a Parkinson's specialist nurse is a promising option <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>We are aware of only one other published study that reports timeliness of PD medication administration accurately using data from an electronic drug prescription and administration system; this US study reported 8% of medication was omitted and 8% was given late <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In a UK-based study of 51 PD patients admitted to surgical departments, 12% of PD medication was omitted <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In an observational study of 41 PD patients with hip fractures, reported only in abstract form, a multi-faceted intervention reduced the amount of omitted PD medication but did not reduce complications or length of stay <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In all these studies the patient populations differ to ours.</p><p>We believe that the inverse correlation between medication given on time and length of hospital stay has not been previously reported using accurately timed medication data. The association is in keeping with subjective, retrospective reports of patients <xref rid="bib5 bib6 bib10" ref-type="bibr">[5,6,10]</xref>. We know patients' motor function may deteriorate due to medication errors <xref rid="bib14 bib24" ref-type="bibr">[14,24]</xref>. It may be that worse motor function leads to increased length of stay, or timely Parkinson's medication may be a marker of better overall care. Alternatively the sickest patients may stay longer and these patients may struggle to take their medication. The determinants of length of stay in Parkinson's patients should be researched further.</p><p>While our unit administered no contraindicated medication, others report high rates of prescription (7&#x02013;40%) and administration (2&#x02013;21%) of anti-dopaminergic medications to PD in-patients <xref rid="bib7 bib8 bib14 bib25 bib26" ref-type="bibr">[7,8,14,25,26]</xref>.</p><p>Cognitive impairment (indicated by incapacity to sign consent form) and delirium on admission were common. New onset delirium after admission was lower on the Parkinson's unit. Management and prevention of delirium was covered in the training program. Three of the four new cases of delirium on the general wards were associated with hospital acquired infection. Multiple comparisons and small numbers mean this result should be interpreted with caution.</p><p>The proportion of medication omitted due to lack of stock did not improve. Although we had enhanced stock, we did not stock all preparations of all PD drugs. The available stock was not used as flexibly as we had hoped: e.g. doses of modified release medications were omitted rather than a temporary switch to available standard release drugs.</p><p>Following the training program, we found improvements in both self-reported knowledge and objective knowledge scores consistent with published reports. Programs that educate nurses about PD can lead to lasting improvements in knowledge <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and have been associated with improved quality of life and functional outcomes in a residential care setting <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>In summary we report that, in this pilot study of acutely admitted PD patients, care on a specialist Parkinson's unit resulted in less omitted PD medication, more PD medication given on time, shorter length of stay and better patient experience. The next step is to conduct a larger randomized controlled trial to try to confirm the findings of this pilot study including a health economic evaluation of cost-effectiveness.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group
