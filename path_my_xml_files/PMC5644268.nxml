Since that time, IGIV has also been found to be beneficial for inflammatory and immune disorders, such as immune thrombocytopenic purpura, dermatomyositis, Guillain&#x02013;Barr&#x000e9; syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, multifocal motor neuropathy, myasthenia gravis, and stiff person syndrome <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. IGIV exerts immune modulatory and anti-inflammatory effects that are potentially relevant to treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). Human sera from normal donors contain antibodies to amyloid beta (A&#x003b2;) protein <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, which were shown to be neuroprotective in&#x000a0;vitro <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Antibodies purified from human IGIV products reduced amyloid levels in the central nervous system when infused in A&#x003b2; transgenic mice <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. IGIV was therefore considered a promising agent in passive immunotherapy because it contains naturally occurring polyclonal human antibodies that bind to A&#x003b2; aggregates, foster the dissolution of A&#x003b2; fibrils, and enhance microglia-mediated phagocytosis of amyloid deposits in&#x000a0;vitro <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Previous early-phase, investigator-initiated clinical studies suggested that IGIV might halt or reverse symptoms of dementia in subjects with mild-to-moderate AD <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. For this reason, a large randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study in mild-to-moderate AD was initiated to test the safety and efficacy of 18&#x000a0;months of IGIV treatment at 200 or 400&#x000a0;mg/kg/2&#x000a0;wks <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. There were 262 subjects exposed to IGIV, and 121 subjects exposed to human albumin as a control.</p><p>IGIV has an established safety profile in children and adults. Elderly subjects are treated with IGIV for both labeled and unlabeled conditions <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>; however, there are limited data available from appropriately placebo-controlled, double-blinded studies on the safety of IGIV in elderly patients, with most data derived from case studies and retrospective studies <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. IGIV has been associated with uncommon but serious adverse events (SAEs) for which the elderly carry an increased risk such as thrombotic events, transfusion-related lung injury (TRALI), and renal failure. Although the study described in this report did not meet its primary or secondary efficacy endpoints of reducing cognitive decline and preserving functional abilities in AD <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, a substantial body of safety data was amassed in one of the largest placebo-controlled studies of intravenous immunoglobulin conducted in a geriatric population <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Study design and participants</title><p>This was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-dose arm study in elderly subjects with mild-to-moderate AD. Subjects were enrolled in the study at 45 centers within the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS, San Diego, CA) consortium in the United States and Canada. Approximately 385 randomized subjects were planned to be enrolled.</p><p>At screening, each subject underwent mini-mental state examination (MMSE), as well as physical, neurological, and laboratory assessments. Subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three treatment arms to receive infusions every 2&#x000a0;weeks for 70&#x000a0;weeks (a total of 36 infusions) as an add-on to conventional Food and Drug Administration approved AD pharmacotherapy. The three treatment arms were: IGIV 200&#x000a0;mg/kg, IGIV 400&#x000a0;mg/kg, and albumin placebo control at either 2&#x000a0;mL/kg or 4&#x000a0;mL/kg. A concentration of 0.25% albumin was chosen to match the volume, color, and foam-forming characteristics of the IGIV.</p><p>Clinical assessments were conducted every 3&#x000a0;months, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was done every 9&#x000a0;months. End-of-study assessments were performed at week 76. An independent data safety monitoring board performed safety monitoring at regular intervals throughout the study.</p><p>Eligible participants of either gender were aged 50&#x02013;89&#x000a0;years with a diagnosis of probable AD of mild-to-moderate severity as determined by a score of 16&#x02013;26 on the MMSE scale. Subjects may have been receiving stable doses of AD medication (acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and/or memantine) for at least 12&#x000a0;weeks before screening and required the participation of an able caregiver. The main exclusion criteria were non-Alzheimer's dementia, residence in a skilled nursing facility, clinically significant cardiovascular disease, recent central or peripheral thrombosis and/or thromboembolic disease, or active renal disease.</p><p>At the investigator's discretion, subjects may have received investigational product infusions at a clinic, home or other suitable locations. Clinical and laboratory assessments were conducted every 3&#x000a0;months until the end-of-study visit.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Safety outcome measures</title><p>Safety objectives included the proportion of subjects experiencing: any adverse events (AEs), product-related AEs, or serious adverse events (SAEs), the number of infusions temporally associated (defined as during or within 72&#x000a0;hours of completion of an infusion) with AEs or SAEs, infusions causally associated with AEs and/or SAEs, and infusions discontinued, slowed, or interrupted due to an AE. Also examined were the proportions of IGIV-treated subjects experiencing a decrease in hemoglobin (&#x0003e;1.5&#x000a0;g/dL) and clinically significant rash requiring systemic therapy.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>Randomization and statistical analysis</title><p>Randomization was conducted using a stratified permuted block method with an allocation ratio of 1:1:1.

Of the 390 randomized subjects, seven did not receive treatment (two in the 400 IU/kg arm, three in the 200 IU/kg arm, and two in the placebo arm). There were comparable numbers of subjects who discontinued from each treatment group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). Of the 81 subjects who discontinued, 26 discontinued because of an adverse event, 16 were unwilling or unable to participate, 13 withdrew consent, seven had a study partner unwilling or unable to participate, four subjects died, two discontinued due to a protocol violation, and 13 discontinued for other reasons. An analysis of discontinuation by high and low dose was conducted to examine the effect of volume of infusion on discontinuation. Although there were numerically more subjects who discontinued from the low-dose (200&#x000a0;mg/kg) IGIV and low-dose (2&#x000a0;mL) placebo treatment groups (24.7%) compared with the high-dose (400&#x000a0;mg/kg) IGIV and placebo (4&#x000a0;mL) groups (17.3%), this trend did not reach statistical significance (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.081). Similarly, the mean (SD) duration of treatment before withdrawal was similar between the IGIV dose groups (223.3 [146.75] days for high dose and 224.9 [138.61] days for low dose) and the placebo groups (212.9 [157.61] for high dose and 263.3 [141.88] days for low dose).<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Flow chart of subject disposition. 390 subjects were randomized and 383 subjects were treated (and therefore included in the safety population) in three treatment groups: IGIV 400&#x000a0;mg/kg (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;127), 200&#x000a0;mg/kg (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;135), and albumin placebo (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;121).

There were 2 female subjects who experienced myocardial infarction: a 72-year-old in the placebo group and a 77-year-old in the 400-mg/kg dose group. The proportion of subjects with thromboembolic events was lower in the IGIV treatment groups compared to the placebo group: (5/262 [1.9%] vs. 6/121 [5%]).

In contrast, no subjects in the placebo group experienced a rash requiring discontinuation of the infusion. A greater percentage of subjects in the IGIV treatment groups (35 of 262 [13.4%]) experienced a rash requiring systemic therapy (diphenhydramine, cortisone, dexamethasone, loratadine, prednisone, methylprednisolone, or cetirizine) than in the placebo group (8/121 [6.6%]).</p><p>There were not a greater number of deaths in the IGIV treatment groups compared to placebo.

There were two deaths in 121 subjects in the placebo group (not related metastatic colon cancer and possibly related pulmonary embolism).</p><p>The nonserious AEs that occurred in the highest number of subjects in the combined IGIV treatment groups were headache (24.0%), hypertension/blood pressure increased (22.9%), fall/contusion/laceration (18.3%), rash (15.3%), infusion site extravasation (14.5%), and diarrhea (14.1%). When compared to the incidence of nonserious AEs in the placebo group, only AEs of chills and rash exhibited statistically significant elevated risk ratios for IGIV treatment (3.85 [95% CI, 1.18&#x02013;12.50] and 3.08 [95% CI, 1.34&#x02013;7.07], respectively). The rates per subject for chills were 9.5% in subjects receiving IGIV (all doses) versus 2.5% in those receiving placebo, and for rash, they were 15.3% versus 5.0%. Neither of these AEs were unexpected. Statistically significant declines in risk were noted for combined AEs of fall/contusion/laceration (0.67 [95% CI, 0.46&#x02013;0.99]) and bradycardia (0.29 [95% CI, 0.10&#x02013;0.86]). As would be expected, subjects treated with IGIV reported fewer infections than did subjects treated with placebo (34.0% versus 47.9%). Instances of upper respiratory infections were also lower among those receiving IGIV compared to placebo (15.2% vs. 23.1%).

One SAE of vasogenic asymptomatic cerebral edema (amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-E [ARIA-E]) was reported in a subject treated with 400-mg/kg IGIV. Approximately 10% of subjects developed treatment emergent cerebral microhemorrhages (amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-H [ARIA-H]), which was similar across all treatment groups.

To date, limited information has been collected in controlled clinical trials about geriatric use of IGIV. The present study offered an opportunity to examine the safety of IGIV in a large (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;390) sample of elderly patients.</p><p>Geriatric patients are considered to have an elevated risk of acute renal failure and arterial or venous thrombosis during IGIV treatment <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.

Only five subjects experienced new or worsening renal failure, and they were distributed between the three study arms. The proportion of subjects with thromboembolic events was also lower in the IGIV treatment groups compared to the placebo group: (1.9% vs. 5.0%). The occurrence of thrombotic events has been considered one of the most serious health risks of IGIV products. In a recent publication of a retrospective cohort study, Daniel et&#x000a0;al. compared the safety profiles of six IGIV products in 11,785 patients <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Of all six products studied, Gammagard Liquid (IGIV) had the lowest rate of same-day thrombotic events (7.4 cases per 1000 patients exposed) compared to the overall rate of 10.4 cases of same-day thrombotic events per 1000 patients exposed. The authors used Gammagard Liquid IGIV as the reference for analysis of odds ratios for same-day thrombotic event occurrence in all of the other IGIV products, because it had the lowest incidence of thrombotic events. In the present study, one SAE of asymptomatic vascular cerebral edema was reported in a subject treated with 400-mg/kg IGIV (a subsequent MRI demonstrated that the edema was resolved). This reflects approximately 0.4% of treated subjects, which is lower than the incidence of vasogenic edema which was reported in approximately 10% of AD subjects in a phase 1 trial of bapineuzumab <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>The Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable Workgroup recommends careful MRI monitoring for the occurrence of ARIA in clinical studies of amyloid modifying therapeutic agents <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Most subjects did not have additional microhemorrhages at month 18 according to MRI examination. The recent study reported by Dodel et&#x000a0;al <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> using another intravenous immunoglobulin product (Octapharma) reported more patients experiencing microbleeds (the term that team used for &#x0201c;microhemorrhages&#x0201d; as they were referred to in our study), (20%) compared to those receiving placebo (7%). This is unlike the results of our study where the rate of new cerebral microhemorrhages observed was similar among the treatment arms (approximately 10%). However, the rate was numerically increased in subjects who are <italic>APOE</italic> &#x003b5;4 carriers. The relative safety of IGIV with regard to neurologic adverse events (particularly cerebral microhemorrhage or stroke) is notable considering that levels of total IgG antibodies were observed to have increased dose dependently in CSF at the 18-month assessment, indicating that IgG had crossed the blood-brain barrier.</p><p>A documented potential risk of treatment with IGIV is hemolysis <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. There were no AEs of hemolysis reported during the study. Decrease in hemoglobin (&#x0003e;1.5&#x000a0;g/dL) was defined as significant in the protocol; however, only three subjects experienced a clinically significant decrease in hemoglobin that was reported as an AE in the study. There were a greater number of subjects in the IGIV treatment groups experiencing a drop in hemoglobin &#x0003e;1.5&#x000a0;g/dL between consecutive visits compared to subjects receiving placebo. The decline in hemoglobin was mild to moderate, and no specific mechanism for the decline was identified. The higher rate of subjects with a substantial drop in&#x000a0;hemoglobin levels in the 400-mg/kg group might be attributable to the fact that more of these subjects had a &#x0003c;1:3 ratio of iron to iron binding capacity at baseline compared to those in the two other study groups (data not shown). There were no clinical signs linking this decrease in hemoglobin to hemolysis, as LDH was in the normal or near-normal range for all subjects. Furthermore, analysis of isoagglutinins anti-A and anti-B in Gammagard Liquid IGIV demonstrate that the product has titers lower than the 1:64 recommended by the European Pharmacopoeia by at least 2-step dilution (the highest titer of anti-A was 1:16 and all anti-B titers were lower than 1:16).</p><p>When compared to the incidence of nonserious AEs in the placebo treatment group, only chills and rash exhibited statistically significant risk ratios for IGIV, 10% treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>). Although IGIV treatment was associated with an elevated risk of rash, pre-treatment of subjects who experienced allergic reactions with antihistamine was permitted in the study protocol to protect them from further reactions. This approach may permit patients to be treated who would otherwise be unable to receive IGIV.</p><p>The most common adverse event in subjects treated with IGIV was headache, a known risk of IGIV <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. However, there was not an elevated risk ratio for headache because patients receiving placebo had a similar incidence.</p><p>Beneficial decreases in infection rate and falls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>) were observed with IGIV treatment. The reduction of infections may be accounted for by the protective effect of IGIV, 10%, which is well established in primary immunodeficiency <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Although no subjects had an IgG titer considered abnormally low, many subjects were on the lower limit of normal at baseline; 8.1% of subjects had an IgG concentration &#x0003c;7&#x000a0;g/L (data not shown), which suggests that their adaptive immune response to pathogen may have been limited and that supplementation with IGIV may reduce the infection rate in the elderly. Even elderly subjects with a normal IgG titer may exhibit reduced opsonophagocytic activity and low antibody avidity. Such a diminution of endogenous antibody function with age has been reported and may account for decreased vaccine efficacy <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Multiple lymphoid lineages may undergo changes in the elderly contributing to immunosenescence <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The reasons for IGIV infusion in a geriatric patient can be multifarious, ranging from chemotherapy support, to autoimmune disease and solid organ transplantations. This clinical trial was the first large, controlled study of IGIV in this unique patient population. Its results demonstrated IGIV to be safe and comparable in AE incidence rates to albumin infusion in the elderly.</p><p>Allergic/hypersensitivity reactions, hemolysis, TRALI, renal failure, and thrombotic/thromboembolic events are all considered risks with IGIV treatment, particularly in elderly patients, however in this placebo-controlled study, IGIV was found to be well tolerated and safe, with no new safety findings or unexpected AEs. Furthermore, patients treated with IGIV demonstrated a significantly lower risk ratio for infections and falls/lacerations/contusions, which could be a potentially important finding if demonstrated in a controlled clinical trial, considering the risks associated with falls in the geriatric population. The previously established safety record of IGIV has been confirmed in the present controlled analyses in a large geriatric population.<boxed-text id="dtbox1"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="o0010"><label>1.</label><p>Systematic review: The literature was searched for articles and abstracts using PubMed and Embase.
