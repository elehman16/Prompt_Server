type II collagen (CCII) is a protein extracted from the cartilage of chicken breast and exhibits intriguing possibilities for the treatment of autoimmune diseases by inducing oral tolerance. A 24-week, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, methotrexate (MTX)-controlled study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CCII in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Five hundred three RA patients were included in the study. Patients received either 0.1 mg daily of CCII (n = 326) or 10 mg once a week of MTX (n = 177) for 24 weeks. Each patient was evaluated for pain, morning stiffness, tender joint count, swollen joint count, health assessment questionnaire (HAQ), assessments by investigator and patient, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) by using the standard tools at baseline (week 0) and at weeks 12 and 24. Additionally, rheumatoid factor (RF) was evaluated at weeks 0 and 24. Measurement of a battery of biochemical parameters in serum, hematological parameters, and urine analysis was performed to evaluate the safety of CCII.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Four hundred fifty-four patients (94.43%) completed the 24-week follow-up. In both groups, there were decreases in pain, morning stiffness, tender joint count, swollen joint count, HAQ, and assessments by investigator and patient, and all differences were statistically significant. In the MTX group, ESR and CRP decreased. RF did not change in either group. At 24 weeks, 41.55% of patients in the CCII group and 57.86% in the MTX group met the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (ACR-20) and 16.89% and 30.82%, respectively, met the ACR 50% improvement criteria (ACR-50). Both response rates for ACR-20 and ACR-50 in the CCII group were lower than those of the MTX group, and this difference was statistically significant (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05). The DAS28 (disease activity score using 28 joint counts) values of the two treatment groups were calculated, and there was a statistically significant difference between the two treatment groups (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05). Gastrointestinal complaints were common in both groups, but there were fewer and milder side effects in the CCII group than in the MTX group.

It is also a highly disabling disease that limits mobility, hampers work, and reduces quality of life. Chronic inflammation commonly results in progressive joint destruction, deformity, and loss of function. Complex immune mechanisms contribute to the pathology of RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Current pharmacological strategies addressing mainly immune suppression and anti-inflammatory mechanisms have had limited success. Currently, most drugs for RA are steroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), disease-modifying drugs, and biological agents. These therapies are associated with significant side effects with long administration, including anorexia, dyspepsy, suppression of the immune system non-specifically, and infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Recently, more and more oral tolerance mechanisms have been studied in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Oral tolerance has posed intriguing possibilities for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, including RA. Oral tolerance is a state of systemic immune suppression to an antigen induced by oral feeding of the same antigen. Extensive research in this area over the past 10 years has led to the conclusion that two mechanisms are operative in the mediation of oral tolerance: active suppression and clonal anergy or deletion. A number of factors that determine which mechanisms of tolerance are operative have been identified: antigen dose, antigen form, and the timing of antigen administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Oral administration of autoantigen has been shown to suppress a variety of autoimmune pathologies induced experimentally, including antigen-induced RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Modulating the immune response to the autoantigen by oral tolerance may be a safer and more effective treatment. A number of candidate autoantigens have been identified in RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Type II collagen (CII) is a major protein in articular cartilage and a potential autoantigen. Some RA patients demonstrate immunity against CII, and autoantibodies to CII have been detected in the sera of both pauciarticular-onset and systemic-onset RA patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These data support the view that autoimmunity to an antigen such as CII in cartilage plays a major role in the pathogenesis of RA. In animal models, oral administration of CII prevents and reduces the severity of autoimmune diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Work from these animal models has recently been extended into human clinical trials of RA with differing degrees of success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Hence, oral tolerance has been advocated as a treatment strategy for autoimmune diseases, including RA.</p><p>Investigators in our laboratory found that collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) could be established in Wistar rats, Kunming mice, and DBA/1 mice with chicken type II collagen (CCII) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Feeding CCII to rats by oral administration decreased the arthritis index. Meanwhile, cartilage degeneration, synovium hyperplasia, and inflammatory cell infiltration in the knee joints of mice and rats with CIA were suppressed by CCII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. These experiments in rodents have provided the basis for human clinical trials. In a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, and controlled phase II clinical trial involving 236 patients with severe active RA, a decrease in the number of swollen joints and tender joints occurred in subjects fed CCII for 6 months. Meanwhile, CCII could reduce pain, morning stiffness, health assessment questionnaire (HAQ), and assessments by investigator and patient, and the incidence of adverse events of CCII was lower than that of methotrexate (MTX) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. These results demonstrate clinical efficacy of an oral tolerance approach for RA. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of CCII in RA patients further, we treated two groups of RA patients with oral CCII or MTX in a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, and controlled phase III clinical trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Recruitment of patients</title><p>This trial was performed at eight centers from October 2004 to December 2005 (clinical trial registration number: ChiCTR-TRC-00000093).

Admission criteria also included patients of either gender with RA with a duration of 6 to 24 months. Active RA was defined as the presence of at least three of the following criteria: six or more painful or tender joints, three or more swollen joints, morning stiffness for at least 45 minutes (on average during the week prior to entry), and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of at least 28 mm. Second-line agents were discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to entry. Continuous doses of NSAIDs were permitted.

To reach improvement according to the ACR definition, a patient with RA must improve by at least 20% in tender and swollen joint count and by at least 20% in three of the five other measures: patient global assessment, physician global assessment, HAQ, acute-phase reactant, and patient pain assessment. In addition to the evaluation of 20% improvement (ACR-20), we determined RA improvement based on more substantial changes in RA core set measures, such as requiring at least 50% improvement (ACR-50) reported as secondary efficacy measures. The disease activity score using 28 joint counts (DAS28) was evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Clinical parameters also included body weight, blood pressure, and heart rate.

CII is the most abundant structural protein of human cartilage. The cartilage within the joint caused mainly damage of autoimmunity in patients with RA. CII autoimmunity may be a secondary phenomenon induced following inflammation in the joints and may play a role in the persistence of the disease rather than in actual induction of arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In either case, downregulation of the immune response to CII may help prevent the resulting destructive arthritis. Oral administration of CII is an established procedure for inducing peripheral immune tolerance, which suppresses autoimmune responses in RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Bovine or chicken CII has been administered orally to RA patients, resulting in some clinical improvement. However, the precise mechanisms of oral tolerance are not fully known. Animal studies have revealed that the mechanisms of induction of oral tolerance include clonal deletion, suppression of the pro-inflammatory Th1 cells, and the induction of regulatory T (Treg) cells. Treg cells from Peyer's patches in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-&#x003b2;) are reported to mediate the induction of active suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha downregulate and suppressive cytokines such as TGF-&#x003b2; and IL-4 upregulate in oral tolerance. Treg cells, defined as a persistently CD25-expressing subset of CD4<sup>+ </sup>cells, may produce anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-&#x003b2; and are likely to be agents of bystander suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In a basic study, investigators in our laboratory found that CCII plays an important role in regulating the immune balance of Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg in rats with CIA. CCII decreases the overproduction of pro-inflammatory mediator (IL-2, IL-17) and increases the hypoproduction of anti-inflammatory mediator (IL-4, TGF-&#x003b2;). These results may support a mechanism of oral tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>A key feature that may affect the induction of Treg cells and other suppressive mechanisms is the dose of antigen administered. A low dose of antigen stimulates the development of Treg cells, leading to an active immune suppression. The active mechanism appears to be a cytokine-mediated immune deviation with a predominant Th2 and Th3 response (TGF-&#x003b2;). In contrast, high-dose oral antigens lead to clonal deletion and anergy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The active suppression of low-dose oral tolerance can also suppress an unrelated immune response (bystander suppression), paving the way for therapy of autoimmune diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The results from human clinical trials suggest that a daily dose of significantly less than 1 mg is optimal. Similarly, data from CIA studies reveal an optimal dose above and below which there is little or no immune suppression. Indeed, the incorrect dose can prime the immune response and aggravate disease. The timing and frequency of administration are also vital to the level of immune tolerance induced and the control of the pathological process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>In a multicenter study, Barnett and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] treated 90 RA patients with CCII for 12 weeks. Patients taking the lowest dose of CII (20 &#x003bc;g) had a 'significant' improvement in response rate compared with placebo-treated control patients (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.035). Corrigall and Panayi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] also reported a significant improvement in a group of RA patients treated with lyophilized CII. None of the patients in either study had significant side effects attributable to treatment with collagen. Similarly, Barnett and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] previously reported that 8 of 10 juvenile RA patients had decreased numbers of swollen and tender joints after 3 months of treatment with CCII. Sieper and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] administered bovine CII orally to patients with early RA for 12 weeks using doses of either 1 mg/day or 10 mg/day. More patients in the CII-treated groups met the ACR-20 and ACR-50 improvement criteria than did patients in the placebo group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>On the basis of the above, CCII was developed as a novel drug of immunologic tolerance. The present study was undertaken to further evaluate whether oral administration of CCII is safe and effective in patients with RA. In this phase III trial, CCII at 0.1 mg daily and MTX at 10 mg once weekly effectively alleviated signs and symptoms of active RA. However, the efficacy of CCII did not exceed that of MTX. The incidence of treatment-related adverse events was significantly different between the CCII group and the MTX group. According to the former study, CCII led to few adverse events in patients with RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In this study, treatment was carried out in combination with diclofenac sodium, an NSAID, which can frequently cause gastrointestinal complaints. The use of diclofenac sodium can relieve pain. Nevertheless, its mechanism of action and toxicity can overlap with those of the trial drugs. The efficacy of CCII will be affected since diclofenac sodium can damage the alimentary system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>Above all, treatment of autoimmune diseases by induction of oral tolerance is attractive because of the few side effects and easy clinical implementation of this approach. The MTX-controlled, multicenter, 24-week trial in RA patients confirms that treatment with oral CII leads to improvement in arthritis and no significant side effects. These results are encouraging and imply that RA can be effectively treated with oral CII and partly supported the mechanism of oral tolerance. These data will provide a basis for more effective application of oral tolerance induction in RA patients. However, to clarify further the potential role and effectiveness of CCII as a toleragen in RA, ongoing studies and future work should clarify the autoimmune response to collagen in the pathogenesis of RA, and long-term observations in large numbers of patients need to confirm the efficacy of CCII and determine the optimal doses of orally administered CCII and which patients with autoimmune diseases will profit most from it.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, the present study provides evidence in support of the potential efficacy and safety of CCII in patients with RA. CCII significantly improved joint function and exhibited better therapeutic efficacy and is safe for human consumption, even in the long term. This study provides important information about the efficacy and safety of CCII in the treatment of RA, and this information may be useful in promoting CCII as a promising alternative therapeutic strategy that may be used as a nutritional supplement against RA.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ACR: American College of Rheumatology; ACR-20: American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria; ACR-50: American College of Rheumatology 50% improvement criteria; CCII: chicken type II collagen; CIA: collagen-induced arthritis; CII: type II collagen; CRP: C-reactive protein; DAS28: disease activity score using 28 joint counts; ESR: erythrocyte sedimentation rate; HAQ: health assessment questionnaire; IL: interleukin; ITT: intention-to-treat; MTX: methotrexate; NSAID: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug; RA: rheumatoid arthritis; RF: rheumatoid factor; TGF-&#x003b2;: transforming growth factor-beta; Treg: regulatory T; VAS: visual analogue scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>WW contributed to the design of the project, served as the study coordinator, and helped to review the manuscript.
