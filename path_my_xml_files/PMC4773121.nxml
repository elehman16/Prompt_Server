Remarkably, many women suffering from this disorder do not receive appropriate treatment. The aim of this study was to conduct a parallel-group randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of Therapist-Assisted Internet-delivered Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TA-ICBT) for the treatment of postpartum depression. This study was registered with the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trials (ISRCTN: 85456371) and received funding from Canadian Institutes of Health Research (#101526) and the Saskatchewan Health Research Foundation. Fifty women who gave birth to an infant in the past year, who scored above 10 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and who resided in Saskatchewan, Canada were eligible to participate. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either TA-ICBT (<italic>n</italic> = 25) or waitlist control (<italic>n</italic> = 25). The efficacy of the treatment was investigated at baseline and at seven- to 10-week follow-up. TA-ICBT participants were also contacted four-weeks following treatment completion. Symptoms of postpartum depression decreased more for participants in the TA-ICBT group (average reduction of 6.24 points on the EPDS; <italic>n</italic> = 21 included in analyses) compared to those participants in the waitlist control group (average reduction of 2.42 points on the EPDS; <italic>n</italic> = 20 included in analyses), and these results were clinically significant and maintained at four-week follow-up. TA-ICBT participants demonstrated a reduction in postnatal anxiety, general stress, and parental distress, and an increase in psychological and environmental quality of life when compared to the waitlist control participants. Study implications, limitations, and future research directions are discussed.</p><sec id="sec001"><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Controlled-Trials.com <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN85456371">ISRCTN85456371</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The project was partially supported by funding provided by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (#101526;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/">http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/</ext-link>) and the Saskatchewan Health Research Foundation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://shrf.ca/">http://shrf.ca/</ext-link>).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="0"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>Data are from the Maternal Depression Online study and can be located in the fourth supporting information file.

The disorder affects a woman&#x02019;s daily functioning, ability to care for her infant, the mother-infant bond, and overall quality of life [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. PPD may also result in short- and long-term developmental consequences for the infant [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While there is growing evidence in support of psychotherapy for PPD [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], participation rates in treatments are extremely low [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Stigma associated with receiving mental health treatment, difficulty arranging childcare, transportation challenges, and time and financial constraints are factors that contribute to the under-treatment of PPD [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><sec id="sec003"><title>Internet-Delivered Therapy</title><p>Internet delivery systems could overcome many of these face-to-face treatment barriers. Receiving treatment from the comfort and convenience of a woman&#x02019;s home would reduce mobility and childcare concerns. Relatively anonymous Internet-delivered therapy may circumvent women&#x02019;s concerns of stigma [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Further, evidence is accumulating to suggest that Internet-delivered treatments are as efficacious and more cost effective in terms of the provider&#x02019;s time and resources as compared to face-to-face treatments [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Ample empirical evidence supports the efficacy of Internet-delivered Cognitive Behavior Therapy (ICBT) in the treatment of major depression and sub-threshold depression. Particularly with therapist-assistance, ICBT is an effective method for reducing depressive symptoms when compared to treatment as usual (TAU), control groups, and treatment from a general practitioner [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Meta-analytic data from 21 studies indicate that effects obtained by supported Internet-delivered therapy for major and sub-threshold depression is analogous to those obtained in face-to-face therapy [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Moreover, supported Internet-delivered interventions evidence both greater program adherence [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and stronger effects than self-directed interventions [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], with more frequent support resulting in greater symptom change [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Internet-Delivered Therapy for Postpartum Depression</title><p>Preliminary research suggests that Internet-delivered treatment is efficacious for women in the postnatal period. In one study, researchers tested the efficacy of an Internet-delivered Behavioral Activation (iBA) program compared with TAU for PPD [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The 11-session program consisted of psychoeducation and behavioral exercises. Although the iBA program was self-directed, it included access to an Internet chat room that was moderated by parent supporters and supervised by specialist health visitors. Findings from 910 women with PPD indicated that participants in the iBA group reported greater reductions in depressive symptoms compared to the TAU group; attrition rates were high, however, with less than one-third of the participants completing the program. In an effort to improve treatment understanding and adherence rates, these same researchers recently created an 11-module iBA program and added a guided support component (i.e., telephone calls; [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]). Again, attrition rates were high. Only 5% of the women completed more than eight modules, with less than 2% completing all iBA modules. Women who reported lower perceived support, who were working or studying, and who reported lower socio-economic status completed fewer modules.</p><p>Another Internet-delivered intervention, Mom-Net, provided Therapist-Assisted ICBT (TA-ICBT) to economically disadvantaged mothers of young children [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Consisting of eight modules, Mom-Net included cognitive behavioral skills with adaptations relevant to mothers. Weekly phone calls were arranged between coaches and participants to assist with understanding and applying the materials. Women (<italic>n</italic> = 70) with elevated levels of depression, a child under five years of age, and attending a low-income program were randomly assigned to TA-ICBT or TAU. When compared to the TAU participants, Mom-Net participants reported improvements on measures of depression, parental satisfaction and efficacy, as well as a reduction on observational indices of harsh parenting behavior [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. For the Mom-Net intervention, there was less attrition, with nearly two-thirds of women completing all Internet-delivered modules [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>While preliminary research supports the efficacy of TA-ICBT for women of young children [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and Internet-delivered behavioral intervention for PPD [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], researchers have not yet determined whether ICBT is an efficacious modality for treating sub-threshold and clinical PPD within the first post-natal year. Prior to implementation of TA-ICBT within community settings, it is important to ensure that the approach is more efficacious than symptom reduction over time as PPD is often a spontaneously remitting condition [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The purpose of the present investigation was to explore the efficacy of a specialized TA-ICBT program for women with symptoms of sub-threshold and clinical PPD. It was hypothesized that TA-ICBT participants would demonstrate greater symptom improvement than participants who received the delayed intervention on primary and secondary outcome measures (i.e., PPD, postnatal anxiety, general stress, parental stress, quality of life). These changes were expected to be clinically significant and maintained at follow-up.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec005"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec006"><title>Participants</title><p>Using the GPower program [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], to achieve power at 80% (alpha = 0.05), <italic>n</italic> = 23 participants per group were required to detect a medium effect size for a mixed model ANOVA.

Participant recruitment and follow-up occurred between March, 2012 and February, 2013. Recruitment efforts included notifying physicians, perinatal nurses, and the public through the use of posters, information cards, Internet advertisements, and media interviews. Participant recruitment concluded when data collection was complete. Eligibility criteria were: (a) 18 years of age or older; (b) gave birth to an infant within the past year; (c) residing in Saskatchewan; (d) self-reported access to and comfort using a computer and the Internet; (e) score of &#x02265; 10 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]); (f) consent to notify a physician of their participation; (g) not receiving other psychotherapy; (h) if taking medication, stable dose for more than a month; and (i) no past or present psychotic mental illness (schizophrenia), bipolar disorder, or current suicide plan or intent. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0149186.s005">S1 Table</xref> provides demographic details for the participants in the study.

Participants were informed of the need to conduct an initial telephone screening interview to determine eligibility for the study. Verbal informed consent for the telephone screening was obtained at this stage and documented on each participant&#x02019;s file. Participants then completed the telephone screening. Following this initial verbal consent and telephone screening, eligible participants then completed an electronic informed consent form followed by the online questionnaire battery. Participants were not paid for their participation in the study. The informed consent process was approved by the research ethics boards of the institutions involved. Verbal and electronic consent were deemed sufficient for participation. Ethics approval was granted by the Universities of Regina and Saskatchewan and the Regina Qu&#x02019;Appelle Health Region in March, 2012. The trial was registered with the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trials (ISRCTN: 85456371) in June 2013. There was a delay in registering the trial as we were made aware of the benefits of registering the trial after data collection had begun. No changes were made to the study protocol between the start of the trial and the time of registration. The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are registered. The project was partially supported by funding provided by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (#101526) and the Saskatchewan Health Research Foundation.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Procedure</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Screening</title><p>Initial assessment included a telephone screen using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]) along with collection of background information including age of infant, computer and Internet access, and any current psychological or pharmacological treatment. Elevated PPD symptomatology was operationalized as a score of &#x02265; 10 on the EPDS. A threshold of &#x02265; 10 is commonly used to screen for subclinical PPD to increase sensitivity, and has been recommended for community settings to ensure that all potential cases of PPD are identified [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The mean participant EPDS score at pre-screening was 15.96 (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.89).

The researchers were blind to the randomization process and were notified through e-mail regarding participant allocation following the screening process. Following the notification, the primary researcher (N.E.P.) contacted the participants over the telephone and informed them of their assigned treatment group (i.e., TA-ICBT or WLC).

The original program content was licensed from Swinburne University of Technology National eTherapy Centre [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Maternal Depression Online maintained much of the original program&#x02019;s content, but incorporated adaptations relevant to mothers of young infants based on Milgrom et al.&#x02019;s treatment for PPD [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Given that treatment studies for in-person CBT for PPD typically range from six to eight sessions [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and TA-ICBT studies for major depression often range from five to eight modules [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], the depression program was shortened from 12 modules to seven modules. Material that is not traditionally part of CBT was removed such as information on nutrition and mindfulness. Each module included a range of media (e.g., text, graphics, animation, audio, video) given research to suggest that multimedia options enhance the effectiveness of Internet-delivered treatment and are preferred over static treatments [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>Maternal Depression Online was designed so that each page of the program was viewed prior to proceeding to the next page. Check-in questions focusing on the module content were presented at the beginning of each module while homework exercises were assigned at the end of each module. Participants were encouraged to progress at a pace of one module per week although more time was often taken. Most TA-ICBT and WLC participants completed T2 measures at a standard 10-week follow-up time. Measures were administered earlier, however, if the participants withdrew from the program (<italic>n</italic> = 3) or completed seven modules in a shorter period of time (<italic>n</italic> = 6).</p><p>Participants were provided with a username and password that allowed them to access the site and message their therapist over a secure private messaging system. An industry-standard encryption algorithm was used for all data, emails, and check-in questions, and stored on a dedicated university server [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>The Internet therapists included two doctoral students in Clinical Psychology (including co-author N.E.P.) who were supervised by a registered psychologist and expert in TA-ICBT (co-author H.D.H.). Internet therapists completed a training workshop in the provision of TA-ICBT [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Therapists emailed their assigned participant on a set day each week to provide support and encouragement, and to answer questions. E-mails took a variable length of time to compose depending on the information submitted to the therapist with the average email taking 15 to 20 minutes to compose. While the e-mail content overlapped substantially with the treatment material, different components were emphasized and individualized depending on the problems presented by the participant. The e-mails were not pre-prepared. If a participant reported significant distress or failed to log into the program for over seven days, the therapist telephoned the participant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>All outcome data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis such that the analyses included every participant who was randomized according to randomized treatment assignment. Between-group intervention effects on the EPDS from baseline (screening) to T2 (post-intervention/wait-time) were compared using longitudinal mixed effects models [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The longitudinal mixed model uses all data on each subject, is unaffected by randomly missing data, and it can flexibly model time affects. The more familiar mixed model ANOVA (condition as the between subject factor; time as the within subject factor) is a special case of a longitudinal mixed effect model. Random intercept models were computed and a maximum likelihood method with covariance type (based on the variance components) was employed to provide the estimates. Chi-square analysis will determine if the difference between the two conditions is statistical significant.</p><p>Clinically significant change on the EDPS was calculated using procedures outlined by Matthey [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] in their study of 181 women with PPD. Matthey followed Jacobson and Truax&#x02019;s [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] calculations to determine the magnitude of change on the EPDS required to be considered clinically significant. Participants whose EPDS score of more than 10 at baseline, decreased by at least four points were classified as <italic>recovered</italic> based on calculations of Matthey&#x02019;s Reliable Change Index (RCI) for the EPDS. Those who demonstrated a decrease in their EPDS score of four or more points but still scored 10 or more after treatment were classified as <italic>improved but not recovered</italic>. Those participants who showed a four point increase in their EPDS score after treatment were classified as <italic>deteriorated</italic>. Finally, participants whose pre-post difference score was less than four points were classified as <italic>no change</italic> regardless of whether or not their post-treatment scores fell below the cut-off score of ten. The procedure and recommendations outlined by Matthey [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] have been utilized in other Internet therapy research (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>])</p><p>Multiple regression analyses were used to determine if group differences (TA-ICBT versus WLC) predicted secondary outcome measure scores (i.e., DASS, PSI, WHO-QOL subscales) when controlling for pre-treatment scores on each respective secondary outcome measures.

All multiple regressions were analyzed twice&#x02014;once with the original data set and once with the imputed data set. Unstandardized coefficients were used as a measure of effect size to assess the proportion of variance associated with or accounted for by each of the regressions. The results of the two regression analyses were compared to determine if the missing data impacted the results.</p><p>A within-subjects analysis for participants receiving TA-ICBT was conducted comparing four-week follow-up (T3) EPDS scores with post-treatment (T2) and baseline EPDS scores (screening).

The results of this study suggest that a therapist-assisted Internet-delivered intervention is efficacious for women with PPD. While we were not able to compare the findings to an active treatment condition, when compared to WLC TA-ICBT not only reduced symptoms of PPD, but also reduced stress, parental distress and improved domains of quality of life. Reductions in PPD were clinically significant and symptom reduction on the EPDS was maintained at follow-up. Our findings were in accordance with evidence to support the efficacy of Internet-delivered behavioral activation for PPD [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], TA-ICBT for economically disadvantaged mothers of young children [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and face-to-face CBT for PPD [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Further, approximately 20% of TA-ICBT participants were considered improved, while over 62% were considered recovered. This high rate of symptom recovery was promising given not only the morbidity and consequences associated with PPD for the mother, but also the pervasive effects PPD has on the family. Moreover, resulting from the multiple face-to-face treatment barriers reported for women with PPD, this is the first study providing evidence that TA-ICBT is an efficacious treatment for women struggling with PPD and this novel approach may overcome face-to-face treatment barriers [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the efficacy of TA-ICBT, our results indicated significant program adherence, with participants completing, on average, 5.92 of the seven modules (60% of completed the entire program). Participants not only completed weekly check-ins with each module, but they also messaged their therapist on average five times. Therapists, in turn, provided considerable support to participants sending, on average, eleven messages over the course of treatment. A strong therapeutic alliance and high satisfaction with the overall program was also reported. Findings are consistent with a qualitative investigation that explored participants&#x02019; perceptions of this program [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]; the majority of women expressed that the TA-ICBT program was flexible, accessible, convenient, and afforded them increased feelings of anonymity and privacy. The degree of engagement was promising given past research findings of lower participant involvement in Internet-delivered treatment. O&#x02019;Mahen et al. [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], for instance reported only a 39% completion rate for an Internet-delivered behavioral activation intervention for PPD that included weekly automated email reminders and no therapist assistance. On the other hand, for a TA-ICBT program offered to mothers of young children that included weekly telephone calls from a therapist, similar to the present study, 63% of participants completed all treatment modules [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Collectively, these findings are in accordance with a meta-analysis suggesting that for the treatment of major depression, when compared with self-administered Internet&#x02013;delivered interventions, some form of guidance is superior (i.e., TA-ICBT [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]). While weekly Internet therapeutic contact has been validated in a sample of participants diagnosed with panic disorder [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], research has yet to establish the ideal therapist-client contact frequency for women with PPD. Given the multiple demands and challenges of parenting, often coupled with low levels of social support [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], women with PPD may reap additional benefits from more frequent therapeutic contact.</p><p>We did not find any group differences for the secondary outcome measures relating to general depression, general anxiety, overall parental stress, and select domains of quality of life. Interestingly, group differences were revealed for depression when assessed with the EPDS, but not when measured with using the DASS-21. This may have been the result of the sensitivity of the DASS-21 to assess postnatal depression. Indeed, general depression measures often rely on somatic symptoms of depression, which overlap with physical symptoms associated with the postpartum period [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. While statistically significant group differences were revealed with respect to parental distress, group differences were not identified for the other parental stress subscales. The Parental Stress Inventory may not have adequately tapped into the parental stress reported by women with PPD as the measure was originally validated on a sample of mothers of young children (mean age under four years) and a variety of questions focused on parental stress related to caring for an older child [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Given the dearth of literature in the area of TA-ICBT for PPD, future research directions are abundant. To begin, additional well-designed trials of TA-ICBT for PPD are required. It is suggested that these studies include a larger, more diverse sample, as well as longer-term follow-up times. Varying Internet therapeutic contact and styles could also be compared, such as weekly versus bi-weekly therapist contact or telephone versus email versus audio/video correspondence. Additionally, given the efficacy and participant satisfaction of TA-ICBT for PPD, future research exploring TA-ICBT for the treatment of other perinatal clinical disorders is warranted, such as a transdiagnostic program to concurrently address symptoms of perinatal anxiety and depression. The comparison of TA-ICBT to an active treatment condition such as face-to-face CBT as well as other Internet-delivered treatments (e.g., Internet behavioral activation) would also be beneficial, as not all participants responded favorably to TA-ICBT. An economic evaluation study comparing the cost-effectiveness and cost utility of TA-ICBT for PPD compared with face-to-face treatment is also warranted. Finally, future implementation research is required to determine whether different health care professionals are equally effective in delivering TA-ICBT for PPD and how this type of novel programming can be effectively implemented and utilized within community settings.</p><sec id="sec028"><title>Limitations</title><p>There were a number of limitations that should be considered. The sample utilized was relatively small and prohibited an examination of other factors. The results, however, are promising as the sample included participants with sub-threshold PPD. An additional limitation was the absence of an active control condition, which may have exaggerated our results. However, the study demonstrates considerable feasibility and acceptability of TA-ICBT for PPD. The limited sample with respect to demographic characteristics was an additional drawback. Moreover, given that more than half of the sample reported some university education, additional research utilizing a more heterogenous sample is required. A group comparison at follow-up was not conducted, which would have been informative given that PPD is often a spontaneously remitting condition [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and, therefore, may improve over time irrespective of treatment. For ethical reasons, however, we did not unduly extend the waiting period for WLC participants. Additionally, depressive symptoms were assessed using self-report measures, which are known to produce false positives. While we conducted a clinical interview (i.e., MINI) to screen participants, a post-treatment clinical interview would have provided a more objective measure of changes in depressive symptoms. Finally, these findings are specifically related to one TA-ICBT program (i.e., Maternal Depression Online) delivered by Internet therapists who were trained graduate students in clinical psychology. A recent literature review suggests that ICBT outcomes do not differ when delivered by experienced versus inexperienced therapists [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. It is possible that the structure of TA-ICBT (e.g., modules) results in less variation in the delivery of TA-ICBT than is observed in face-to-face therapy; therefore, similar outcomes may arise regardless of therapist experience [<xref rid="pone.0149186.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Nevertheless, it is possible that outcomes could have been more impressive had a different TA-ICBT program been used. It would be valuable to conduct further research on which type of allied health provider will obtain the best outcomes with TA-ICBT for PPD and who is best positioned to deliver TA-ICBT if delivered in community settings.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec029"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Despite some limitations to the research design, we demonstrated that TA-ICBT was an efficacious, well-utilized, and desirable intervention for women with PPD. When compared to a WLC condition, TA-ICBT appeared more efficacious at reducing symptoms of PPD, parental stress, and improved psychological and environmental quality of life. Further investigation for TA-ICBT for PPD is required, particularly comparing TA-ICBT to an active control condition, utilizing a larger and more heterogeneous sample, with longer-term follow-up. Additionally, an examination of the cost-effectiveness of TA-ICBT when delivered in community settings would also be desirable alongside the study of factors that constrain or enhance the implementation of TA-ICBT in community practice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec030"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0149186.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>Consort List.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0149186.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0149186.s002"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Consort Fig.</title><p>(TIFF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0149186.s002.tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0149186.s003"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Database.</title><p>(SAV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0149186.s003.sav"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0149186.s004"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Ethics Protocol.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0149186.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0149186.s005"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Demographic Characteristics by Group.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0149186.s005.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0149186.s006"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Means and Standard Deviations for Primary and Secondary Outcomes.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0149186.s006.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0149186.s007"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Regression Analyses of Secondary Outcome Variables.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0149186.s007.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0149186.s008"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Descriptive Statistics for Program Engagement in the TA-ICBT condition (<italic>N</italic> = 24).</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0149186.s008.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Program materials used by the Online Therapy Unit were licensed from Anxiety Online at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne Australia through Drs.
