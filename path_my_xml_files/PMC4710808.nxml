Such a strategy may potentially serve to increase the uptake of support in this difficult to reach population.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This feasibility pilot RCT was performed at a single centre.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The sample size fell short of its target.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is becoming increasingly evident that PICU admission can have far-reaching psychological after effects including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in parents and children, parental anxiety and depression, and child emotional and behavioural problems.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;6</xref> A recent review reported PTSD prevalence rates of 10&#x02013;21% in parents and 5&#x02013;28% in children following acute paediatric critical illness, with many other parents (up to 84%) suffering subclinical symptoms of PTSD, and with high correlations between parent and child PTSD symptoms.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>There are established associations between both parental mental health problems and parenting changes following critical illness and child mental health symptoms.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> For example, some mothers become more protective and strict, while others make more allowances for their child's behaviour. Successful interventions aimed at improving parental mental health and parenting may therefore be expected to have a beneficial effect on both parent and child mental health.</p><p>In 2009, NICE issued guidance on rehabilitation in adults after critical illness, recommending psychological follow-up for survivors and their family.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> However, there is currently no formal guidance in place for the follow-up of parents and their children after paediatric critical illness. There have been initiatives to evaluate different types of interventions. Melnyk <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> reported on the COPE programme, a three-phase preventative educational-behavioural intervention programme of audiotapes, written information and an activity workbook for parents and children to complete during and after the admission. They found some beneficial psychological effects over one-year follow-up. However, this was a multifaceted, comparatively complex and labour intensive intervention for young children (2&#x02013;7&#x02005;years old). The most significant beneficial findings were at the final 1&#x02005;year follow-up, but they were subject to high attrition rates.</p><p>Other studies have involved less complex interventions, more in line with clinical practice, with offers of psychosocial parent follow-up to discuss any sequelae and provide support and guidance. These clinics have tended to be used by parents with mental health problems and the findings document small effect sizes in favour of the intervention for parental post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression. However, uptake rates have been disappointing, ranging from 25% to 37%.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>We have developed an alternative intervention, offering psychoeducation and guidance to parents following their child's discharge from PICU by means of a carefully crafted written psychoeducational intervention tool supported by a follow-up telephone call. This aimed to increase accessibility of the intervention. Information-based interventions have been evaluated positively by parents and shown to be effective in reducing the parental stress associated with transfer from PICU to the general paediatric ward.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> There are promising results in the use of such interventions following paediatric injury.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> However, the impact of postdischarge psychoeducation on psychological sequelae in parents and their children following PICU admission has not been formally assessed. Screen and intervene approaches that include parental guidance on how to manage PTSD symptoms in children and psychosocial support for families have been recommended after childhood traumatic events.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> We therefore complemented the self-help psychoeducational tool with a supportive guidance telephone session.</p><p>The primary objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of the supported psychoeducational intervention tool and the design and procedures of an evaluative study. It was intended that the assessment of the process outcomes would feed directly into planning a full trial, providing information that would ultimately improve its operational aspects.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> As secondary objectives, we aimed to obtain initial estimates of the effect of the intervention on parent and child mental health, and explore the moderating effect of baseline parental stress.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The study was not powered to assess statistical significance, and thus the analyses are mainly descriptive and should be interpreted with caution.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;23</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Trial design</title><p>This was a single-centre, parallel group, RCT. Parents were individually randomised to either the intervention or treatment as usual (TAU) arm with an allocation ratio of 2:1 in favour of the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participants</title><p>Eligible participants were parents with a child aged 4&#x02013;16&#x02005;years old admitted to the PICU at St Mary's Hospital, London, UK, for at least 12&#x02005;h. Exclusion criteria included child death prior to discharge; discharge to palliative care; planned admissions; history of prior PICU admission; overseas address; or insufficient English to complete study questionnaires. Parents were approached by PICU consultants prior to their child's discharge from PICU and invited to participate. If parents provided permission, once their child had been discharged home, they were then sent detailed information sheets and consent forms with instructions to complete them. All parents gave informed consent before taking part. If the child was aged 8&#x02005;years or older, they provided assent to complete a self-report questionnaire at follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Intervention</title><p>The intervention had two phases: the first phase, (ie, receipt of the psychoeducational tool), was planned to occur within 7&#x02005;days of discharge from hospital and the second phase, (ie, receipt of the telephone call), within 14&#x02005;days of receiving the tool.</p><p>The psychoeducational tool consisted of a handbook developed by mental health and paediatric experts and parents with lived experience of having a child in PICU. The handbook covered three main areas: emotional recovery, behavioural recovery and getting back to normal learning. The first section included a description of common emotional reactions in children, their siblings and parents following discharge from PICU, with advice regarding their management. It also included an outline of when recovery becomes stalled by the development of PTSD, its manifestations, what treatments are available and their rationale. The second section gave more detailed advice to parents about managing behavioural problems in children following hospital discharge. The third section addressed possible learning difficulties (eg, slowed information processing, memory and attention problems) in the aftermath of the child's admission and provided guidance on how to support affected children. There was an additional section containing a list of contacts of possible sources of further support and advice.</p><p>The telephone call, conducted by the researcher, was used to discuss each family's post-PICU experience, reinforce the material in the handbook (thus ensuring all families were exposed to the information), and support families in putting into practice the advice given, if appropriate.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Outcomes</title><sec id="s2d1"><title>Primary outcome</title><p>There were 12 feasibility criteria used to judge the success of the trial (outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015009581TB1">table 1</xref>). Six criteria related to the intervention (covering timings, compliance and evaluation) and six criteria related to the study design and procedures (covering screening, participation rate, acceptability of procedures, loss to follow-up and the time-scale of data collection). The following classification system was outlined for both the intervention and study design according to the number of criteria met: 0&#x02013;2/6: not feasible/acceptable; 3&#x02013;4/6: feasible/acceptable with modifications; 5/6: feasible/acceptable with close monitoring; 6/6: feasible/acceptable as it is.</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2015009581TB1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Feasibility objectives</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Feasibility objectives</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Questions</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">A priori criterion for success</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Criterion met?</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Outcome and contingency plans where appropriate</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.

The results confirm the acceptability and feasibility of many aspects of the intervention, with clear indications of modifications that could be made to improve on this further. Although the study design and procedures were not deemed feasible, the data we gathered provided sufficient information to guide significant protocol amendments in order to ensure the overall feasibility of a future full efficacy trial. The comparison of mental health outcomes in the intervention and TAU groups 5&#x02005;months following PICU discharge show the intervention to hold promise for reducing mental health difficulties in parents and their children.</p><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Feasibility findings</title><p>Of the 12 feasibility criteria developed a priori for the study, 3 of 6 relating to the intervention and 1 of 6 addressing the study design and procedures were fully met. All unmet criteria were reviewed and appropriate modifications to the intervention were formulated as well as more significant amendments to the study design and procedures, leading us to conclude that the revised protocol would be acceptable and feasible for a larger study. Changes include (1) obtaining consent, collecting baseline data, randomising and delivering the psychoeducational tool while the child and their family are still on PICU (to help increase the participation rate, ensure baseline data are collected in a timely manner and that the psychoeducational tool is delivered promptly); (2) a delay of the supportive telephone call to 3&#x02013;6&#x02005;weeks after PICU discharge (in line with a time frame that was logistically viable and also considered acceptable by parents); (3) expanding the age range of children admitted into the study (to increase the number of eligible families); (4) reducing the number of assessment measures (to lessen the burden on participants and decrease the likelihood of attrition); and (5) working with patient and public involvement groups to provide a better explanation of the rationale for randomisation (to reduce non-participation on these grounds).</p><p>Notably, once parents were recruited to the study, it proved possible to provide the full intervention to 82%. This was initially considered an unmet criterion, as the target was 95%. On reflection, 82% was deemed acceptable, as this is a considerably higher rate than in previous studies offering outpatient consultations to families, where uptake in the intervention group ranged from 25% to 37%.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> This suggests that providing after-care via a supported psychoeducational tool may be an effective way of increasing uptake of support in this difficult to reach population.</p></sec><sec id="s4a2"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>Five months after PICU discharge, parents in the intervention group reported fewer post-traumatic stress symptoms and depressive symptoms than parents in the TAU group. Children of parents who received the intervention appeared to have fewer emotional and behavioural difficulties than those that received TAU. These differences were not subjected to statistical significance testing because our study was not powered to identify significant differences. Therefore, these findings need to be treated with caution and speculation about their meaningfulness is precluded. However, we believe the potential benefit of this supported psychoeducational intervention for parent and child mental health is worth exploring in a fully powered trial.</p></sec><sec id="s4a3"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Strengths of this study include its basis on empirical studies of PICU mental health outcomes, drawing and benefiting from the experience of previous well thought out, but ultimately unsuccessful intervention studies; the joint expert and lay approach to the development of the psychoeducational materials; the likely cost-effectiveness of the intervention; the careful approach to assessing feasibility and acceptability of both the intervention and study design/procedures. Limitations include falling short of the suggested minimum sample size for pilot studies; recruiting from a single centre, making generalisability uncertain; and the retrospective assessments of parental stress experienced while on PICU. As intended, however, the study opens the way for a future full RCT of the intervention.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study indicates that our novel intervention, a psychoeducational tool supported by a directed telephone call, is acceptable to parents. Although aspects of the intervention and study design/procedures were not deemed feasible, we were able to address each unmet criteria, putting protocol modifications/amendments in place. In addition, preliminary results indicate the potential beneficial effects of this supported psychoeducational tool for the mental health of parents and children. However, this needs to be subjected to a fully powered study before this intervention can be widely introduced into clinical practice.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are extremely grateful to the families who volunteered to take part in the study and the PICU staff.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> LCA, SN and MEG obtained the funding.
