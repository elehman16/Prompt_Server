The Liverpool Reviews and Implementation Group (LRiG) at the University of Liverpool was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article summarizes the ERG&#x02019;s review of the evidence submitted by the manufacturer and provides a summary of the Appraisal Committee&#x02019;s (AC) decision. The clinical evidence was derived from a multi-centred, open-label, randomized phase III study (PRIMA) comparing first-line maintenance treatment with RTX with observation only in 1,018 patients with previously untreated advanced fNHL. Median time to event (MTE) for the primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) in the RTX arm was not estimable due to data immaturity; median PFS in the observation arm was 48.36&#x000a0;months. A statistically significant benefit of RTX maintenance therapy for PFS was reported (hazard ratio [HR] 0.55, 95&#x000a0;% CI 0.44&#x02013;0.68; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001). Statistically significant differences in favour of RTX were also reported for a range of secondary endpoints. Assessment of overall survival benefit could be not made due to insufficient events. The ERG&#x02019;s main concern with the clinical-effectiveness data presented was their lack of maturity. The submitted incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was within the NICE threshold. The ERG questioned the model on a number of grounds, particularly the use of Markov methodology rather than patient simulations, the impact of patient age on the outcome and the projective PFS modelling. The ERG considered it impossible to draw firm conclusions regarding the clinical or cost effectiveness of the intervention as the dataset was as yet too immature. At a third meeting, the AC concluded that RTX could be recommended as first-line maintenance treatment for patients with fNHL whose disease has responded to induction R-CTX.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="d30e232"><title><bold>Key Points for Decision Makers</bold></title><p>&#x02022; The clinical and cost effectiveness evidence presented was based on a well-designed randomized controlled trial (RCT). The clinical data for the effectiveness of rituximab as a maintenance treatment appeared to be promising.

The NICE Single Technology Appraisal (STA) process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] is specifically designed for the appraisal of a single health technology for a single indication, where most of the relevant evidence lies with one manufacturer or sponsor. Typically, the process is used for new pharmaceutical products close to launch. The evidence for an STA is principally derived from a submission by the manufacturer/sponsor of the technology, which should be based on a specification developed by NICE. The manufacturer&#x02019;s submission (MS) is critiqued by members of the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG) who produce a report to be considered by the NICE Appraisal Committee (AC).</p><p>The NICE AC considers the submissions from the manufacturer and the ERG alongside testimony from experts, patients and other stakeholders to formulate preliminary guidance. All stakeholders have an opportunity to comment on this preliminary guidance and the manufacturer has the opportunity to provide a supplementary evidence submission. The AC meets again to produce the final guidance (final appraisal determination [FAD]). This article presents a summary of the ERG report for the STA of rituximab (RTX) as first-line maintenance treatment for patients with follicular non-Hodgkin&#x02019;s lymphoma (fNHL) whose disease has responded to induction therapy with RTX plus cytotoxic chemotherapy (R-CTX). This is one in a series of STA summaries being published in <italic>PharmacoEconomics</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Full details of all the relevant appraisal documents (including the appraisal scope, ERG report, manufacturer and consultee submissions, Appraisal Consultation Document [ACD], FAD and comments on each of these) can be found on the NICE website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>The Decision Problem</title><p>fNHL is one of a group of diseases known collectively as non-Hodgkin&#x02019;s lymphomas (NHLs), cancers arising from the lymphoid cells of the immune system. These cells normally have a key role in protecting the body from pathogenic microorganisms. Malignant transformation of lymphocytes results in their uncontrolled replication usually starting within the lymph nodes, mainly those of the neck, armpits and groin. Swelling of these structures often provides the first clinical manifestation of illness, although other symptoms including fever, drenching night sweats, weight loss (&#x02018;B-symptoms&#x02019;) and tiredness may also be present at diagnosis or develop later. The incidence of NHL is similar in men and women and increases with age: rates increase sharply in people over 50 and around two-thirds of all cases are diagnosed in people over 60&#x000a0;years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>The estimated number of new cases of NHL in the USA for 2011 is 66,000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Australian projections for new cases of NHL for 2010 are 4,000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. For Europe as a whole, the estimated number of new cases for 2008 was 52,000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In England and Wales in 2008, there were almost 12,000 new cases of NHL recorded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Between 22&#x000a0;% and 40&#x000a0;% of NHLs are fNHL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The majority of cases of fNHL are diagnosed at an advanced stage (III/IV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>Typical estimates of median survival for patients with advanced fNHL are 8&#x02013;10&#x000a0;years from diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, recent evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] suggests that survival may be longer, probably as a consequence of improved treatment. The natural course of advanced disease is of a series of treatment-induced remission followed by relapse, with each remission duration becoming shorter and fewer patients responding to each cycle of therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p>Patients in the UK diagnosed with advanced fNHL and who are symptomatic, have a high tumour burden, rapid disease progression or other key features are normally offered induction treatment with R-CTX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>The aim of using RTX maintenance therapy (375&#x000a0;mg/m&#x000b2; body surface area, by intravenous infusion once every 2&#x000a0;months until disease progression, or for a maximum of 2&#x000a0;years) following response to induction therapy is to extend and deepen the first remission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. It would be expected, as in the relapsed/refractory setting, that extended progression-free survival (PFS) as a consequence of RTX maintenance therapy will delay the time to first relapse and, therefore, the burden of further CTX treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p>NICE developed a scope for the assessment of RTX, which specified that the clinical and cost effectiveness of this drug should be established within its licensed indication relative to standard management without RTX maintenance therapy (observation) and ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin). Five outcome measures were considered relevant to the appraisal: PFS, overall survival (OS), response rates, adverse effects (AEs) of treatment and health-related quality of life (HR-QOL). The time horizon of analysis was stipulated as sufficiently long to reflect any differences in costs or outcomes between the technologies being compared.</p><p>At the time of this appraisal, the licence for RTX as a maintenance therapy was limited to use in patients with relapsed/refractory lymphoma. However, the European Medicines Agency&#x02019;s (EMA) Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use had issued a positive opinion to extend the use of first-line RTX maintenance therapy to include the treatment of fNHL patients responding to induction therapy. The licence extension was granted by the EMA in December 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Independent ERG Report</title><p>The ERG examined and critiqued the initial MS and two subsequent supplementary evidence submissions from the manufacturer as well as taking into consideration the manufacturer&#x02019;s response to the ERG&#x02019;s request for clarification on a number of issues. The ERG report comprised a critical review of the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology and embodied three aims:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>To assess whether the MS conformed to the methodological guidelines issued by NICE</p></list-item><list-item><p>To assess whether the manufacturer&#x02019;s interpretation and analysis of the evidence were appropriate</p></list-item><list-item><p>To indicate the presence of other sources of evidence or alternative interpretations of the evidence that could help inform NICE guidance</p></list-item></list></p><p>In addition to providing this detailed critique, the ERG modified a number of key assumptions and parameters within the manufacturer&#x02019;s economic model to examine the impact of such changes. The next section summarizes the evidence submitted by the manufacturer and the ERG&#x02019;s review of that evidence.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Clinical Evidence</title><p>The clinical-effectiveness evidence was derived from a single trial, PRIMA (Primary Rituximab and Maintenance trial) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], which was unpublished at the time the MS was submitted to NICE. The PRIMA trial results are now published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The MS was based on data from the clinical study report. The PRIMA trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] was an international, multi-centred, open-label, randomized phase III study (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1018) designed to evaluate the efficacy of RTX maintenance treatment compared with observation for patients with advanced fNHL whose disease had responded to induction treatment with R-CTX.</p><p>The outcomes of the trial are described in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. For the primary endpoint of PFS (defined as first documented disease progression, relapse or death from any cause), at median follow-up of 38&#x000a0;months, the median time to event (MTE) for patients in the RTX arm was not estimable due to insufficient PFS events; the median PFS in the observation arm was 48.36&#x000a0;months. A statistically significant benefit of RTX maintenance therapy for PFS was reported (hazard ratio [HR] 0.55, 95 % CI 0.44&#x02013;0.68; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001). For secondary endpoints at a median follow-up of 36&#x000a0;months, statistically significant differences were reported for event-free survival (HR 0.59, 95 % CI 0.48&#x02013;0.72; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001), time to next anti-lymphoma treatment (HR 0.60, 95&#x000a0;% CI 0.47&#x02013;0.76; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001), time to next CTX treatment (HR 0.62, 95&#x000a0;% CI 0.47&#x02013;0.81; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0005) and overall response rate (difference in proportions 17.98, 95&#x000a0;% CI 12.3&#x02013;23.6; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001), although the only calculable MTE was for event-free survival (first documented progression, relapse, initiation of new anti-lymphoma treatment or death from any cause) in the observation arm. No meaningful conclusions regarding OS could be drawn due to the lack of deaths. The incidence of AEs was higher in the RTX arm than the observation arm; however, no unexpected safety findings were reported. No statistically significant differences were reported on the outcome of QOL as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy&#x02014;General (FACT-G) questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ C30) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Key outcomes of the PRIMA trial</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Endpoint</th><th align="left">RTX (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;505)</th><th align="left">Observation (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;513)</th><th align="left">HR (95&#x000a0;% CI)</th><th align="left"><italic>P</italic> value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="5"><italic>Primary: investigator-assessed PFS</italic> (<italic>38</italic>&#x000a0;<italic>months</italic>)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Median time to event (95 % CI)</td><td align="left">NE</td><td align="left">48.36 (42.09 to NS)</td><td align="left">0.55 (0.44&#x02013;0.68)</td><td char="." align="char">&#x0003c;0.0001</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="5"><italic>Secondary endpoints</italic> (<italic>36</italic>&#x000a0;<italic>months</italic>)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="5">Event-free survival</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Median time to event</td><td align="left">NE</td><td align="left">1381&#x000a0;days [45.4&#x000a0;months]</td><td align="left"/><td align="left"/></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;25th percentile</td><td align="left">1000&#x000a0;days [32.8&#x000a0;months]</td><td align="left">497&#x000a0;days [16.3&#x000a0;months]</td><td align="left">0.59 (0.48&#x02013;0.72)</td><td char="." align="char">&#x0003c;0.0001</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;1-year event-free rate (95&#x000a0;% CI)</td><td align="left">0.89 (0.86&#x02013;0.92)</td><td align="left">0.81 (0.78&#x02013;0.84)</td><td align="left"/><td align="left"/></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="5">Overall survival</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Median time to event</td><td align="left">NE</td><td align="left">NE</td><td align="left"/><td align="left"/></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;25th percentile</td><td align="left">NE</td><td align="left">NE</td><td align="left">0.87 (0.45&#x02013;1.47)</td><td char="." align="char">0.6010</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;1-year event-free rate (95&#x000a0;% CI)</td><td align="left">0.99 (0.98&#x02013;1.00)</td><td align="left">0.99 (0.98&#x02013;1.00)</td><td align="left"/><td align="left"/></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="5">Time to next anti-lymphoma treatment</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Median time to event</td><td align="left">NE</td><td align="left">NE</td><td align="left"/><td align="left"/></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;25th percentile</td><td align="left">1328&#x000a0;days [43.6&#x000a0;months]</td><td align="left">775&#x000a0;days [25.5&#x000a0;months]</td><td align="left">0.60 (0.47&#x02013;0.76)</td><td char="." align="char">&#x0003c;0.0001</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;1-year event-free rate (95&#x000a0;% CI)</td><td align="left">0.92 (0.89&#x02013;0.94)</td><td align="left">0.89 (0.87&#x02013;0.92)</td><td align="left"/><td align="left"/></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="5">Time to next CTX treatment</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Median time to event</td><td align="left">NE</td><td align="left">NE</td><td align="left"/><td align="left"/></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;25th percentile</td><td align="left">NE<sup>a</sup></td><td align="left">975&#x000a0;days [32.0&#x000a0;months]</td><td align="left">0.62 (0.47&#x02013;0.81)</td><td char="." align="char">0.0005</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;1-year event-free rate (95&#x000a0;% CI)</td><td align="left">0.92 (0.90&#x02013;0.95)</td><td align="left">0.91 (0.89&#x02013;0.94)</td><td align="left"/><td align="left"/></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>The table is adapted from the manufacturer&#x02019;s submission and is reproduced from Greenhalgh et al.

The ERG&#x02019;s opinion was that the results of the trial were generalizable to UK clinical practice as the participants in the trial were comparable with patients seen in UK clinical practice and the majority were recruited from countries with similar care pathways to the UK. The ERG considered that the manufacturer had made a convincing case for not including Zevalin as a comparator.</p><p>The ERG&#x02019;s chief concern was the immaturity of the outcome data. This immaturity stemmed from two factors: the early closure of the trial (recommended by the study Data and Safety Monitoring Committee on the grounds of benefit [i.e. that the primary endpoint of PFS was crossed in favour of the maintenance arm]) and the limited follow-up data available for report in the MS. At the time of study closure, 1,018 patients were enrolled, 505 and 513 in the RTX and observation arms, respectively. Of these patients, only 93 (18.4&#x000a0;%) in the RTX arm and 174 (33.9&#x000a0;%) in the observation arm had progressed at the time of analysis. None of the patients had been followed up for more than 4&#x000a0;years.</p><p>The ERG&#x02019;s concerns regarding the immaturity of the data were supported by the findings of a meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], which reported large differences in treatment effect sizes between trials that were stopped early and similar trials that ran their full course. This finding, based on a comparison of 91 trials (cancer and non-cancer trials) that were terminated early based on a beneficial treatment effect (typically indicated by a statistically significant hazard ratio) with 424 similar trials that ran to full term, was robust regardless of the methodological quality of the trials or the presence of statistical stopping rules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>ERG Conclusions on the Submitted Clinical Evidence</title><p>Whilst the clinical trial data appeared to show a benefit for patients in the RTX arm, the ERG considered that the data submitted were too immature to draw definite conclusions. Longer follow-up with more events would be required before informed decisions could be made regarding the clinical effectiveness of RTX as a first-line maintenance therapy compared with observation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Cost-Effectiveness Evidence</title><p>The MS included a review of the literature of the cost effectiveness of RTX as a first-line maintenance treatment in fNHL; no relevant published economic evaluations were identified.</p><p>The manufacturer undertook a de novo economic evaluation of RTX first-line maintenance therapy (intervention) compared with observation (comparator) for the treatment of patients with fNHL responding to first-line induction. The economic model was developed over a 25-year time horizon to capture the lifetime costs and QALYs of an average patient with fNHL and took an NHS and Personal Social Services perspective.</p><p>The economic model developed by the manufacturer was a four-state Markov model with a cycle length of 1&#x000a0;month. Patients enter the model in the PFS1 state (disease-free) having successfully completed induction therapy with R-CTX. Patients who responded to R-CTX either receive RTX monotherapy maintenance therapy (for 2&#x000a0;years) in the intervention arm or do not receive any treatment in the comparator arm. After initial treatment, at the end of each cycle patients remain in PFS1 or progress to PFS2 (remission/full response to second-line RTX monotherapy in accordance with NICE&#x02019;s technology appraisal [TA] 137 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]) or die. Once in the PFS2 health state, a patient may remain in this health state, die at the end of each cycle or move to progressive disease (PD). Patients in the PD state cannot move back to PFS2; they can either remain in PD or die at the end of each cycle. Death is an absorbing health state.</p><p>The model was populated with clinical-effectiveness results from the PRIMA trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] at median follow-up of 38&#x000a0;months and from an earlier trial of maintenance treatment with RTX following second-line CTX treatment, known as EORTC 20981 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. HR-QOL utility values were taken from a paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] reporting a study that had originally been commissioned by Roche, and the main sources of cost data were the <italic>NHS Reference Cost Schedule 2008&#x02013;2009</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] and the <italic>British National Formulary</italic> (56&#x02013;59) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p>The manufacturer&#x02019;s base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for RTX for the first-line maintenance treatment of patients with fNHL compared with observation was &#x000a3;15,978 per QALY gained and &#x000a3;14,697 per life-year gained. The manufacturer was confident that probabilistic sensitivity analysis results supported the robustness of the cost effectiveness of RTX maintenance therapy compared with observation in patients with fNHL responding to first-line induction therapy.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Critique of the Cost-Effectiveness Evidence and Interpretation</title><p>The ERG identified that the main source of uncertainty in the economic model was the immature nature of the primary data source, i.e. the PRIMA trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The submitted model projected future benefits in terms of increased patient time in PFS, and this was the dominant driver of cost effectiveness. In the manufacturer&#x02019;s base-case results, the model estimated the mean (undiscounted) survival for patients without maintenance therapy as 11.44&#x000a0;years, and 13.38&#x000a0;years for those with RTX maintenance therapy: a gain of 1.94&#x000a0;years. The model also estimated the mean time spent in PFS as 8.64&#x000a0;years (observation only) and 10.65&#x000a0;years (RTX maintenance): a gain of 2.01&#x000a0;years. Virtually all this benefit was generated in the first PFS phase of the model, with the implication that PFS gains are translated almost entirely (96.6&#x000a0;%) into OS gains. The ERG considered this a &#x02018;best possible&#x02019; scenario that required robust supportive evidence from clinical trials before it could be accepted. At present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], there is no unequivocal evidence from any clinical trial or meta-analysis that RTX maintenance treatment of patients with fNHL offers any significant OS gains, despite good evidence of PFS gains. The PFS advantage from first-line RTX maintenance therapy directly measurable from the mature PRIMA trial data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] (up to 800&#x000a0;days from randomization using the latest clinical data available) amounted to no more than 60&#x000a0;days.</p><p>A number of issues relating to the model design and structure, and to the implementation of the model were also raised by the ERG.

The ERG requested additional results via the clarification process to allow a comparison of clinical effectiveness between three age-based subgroups. Despite the immaturity of the PRIMA trial data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and the unsophisticated nature of the analysis, there appeared to be an emerging trend indicating a reduction in clinical effect as patient age increased&#x02014;a curvilinear trend in odds ratio (OR), equivalent to a linear trend in relative risk. The HR of PFS in the base-case model was adjusted by the ERG to reflect specific patient ages; the results indicated that the combined effect of increasing mortality and reducing effectiveness could alter the estimated ICER substantially. For example, considering patient cohorts with ages at induction of 30, 60 and 90&#x000a0;years generated ICERs of &#x000a3;9,790, &#x000a3;18,055 and &#x000a3;43,306, respectively.</p><p>As a consequence of the immaturity of the PRIMA trial data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] (RTX was not given to patients beyond 2&#x000a0;years), the manufacturer was obliged to model the long-term effect of RTX, making an assumption of the average period for which treatment continued to provide additional clinical effect. In the base case, the manufacturer considered a period of 6&#x000a0;years, but without reference to any supporting evidence. Three alternatives were put forward by the ERG: 26&#x000a0;months (the period over which data were available, i.e. 800&#x000a0;days), 4&#x000a0;years (equivalent to the maximum time over which any patients had been observed within the PRIMA trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]), and 40&#x000a0;years (equivalent to a lifetime). These time periods generated ICERs per QALY gained of &#x000a3;32,230, &#x000a3;21,151 and &#x000a3;8,966, respectively.</p><p>However, when considering these results it is important to note a major assumption used in the manufacturer&#x02019;s model, namely that, at the end of the assumed &#x02018;effective period&#x02019;, the hazard governing the PFS projective model reverts to the hazard of the comparator arm, but from a higher absolute survival level. This approach means that the survival curves of the intervention and comparator arms will never converge within a finite time, ensuring that the RTX arm continues to accumulate survival gains long after the supposed limit of clinical effectiveness. This assumption precludes an alternative process observed in some clinical trials, whereby clinical gains begin to decay at the end of active treatment, until the intervention and comparator survival curves converge to the same long-term trajectory after a few months or years. In simple terms, the difference can be characterized as follows:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The manufacturer&#x02019;s approach assumes that the clock governing the disease process is &#x02018;turned back&#x02019; for patients on RTX maintenance therapy by several years, so that it never catches up with that experienced by untreated patients.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The alternative process assumes that the disease clock is slowed down by RTX for several years, but accelerates when the effect wears off, and eventually catches up with the disease experienced by the untreated patients.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The difference in health gain between these two modelling approaches was difficult to estimate using the manufacturer&#x02019;s model. However, in the manufacturer&#x02019;s base case, more than 72&#x000a0;% of the estimated PFS gain arises after the 4-year point; there is, therefore, considerable scope for a reduction in incremental outcomes if the initial PFS advantage is lost progressively. The estimated ICER could increase by as much as three times, depending on the time over which the gap between PFS curves disappears.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>ERG Conclusions on the Submitted Cost-Effectiveness Evidence</title><p>Overall, the ERG considered that direct use of the model results was too heavily affected by extensive and often unquantifiable uncertainty around the central claims of clinical benefit to be useful for decision making, i.e. the clinical data available made it impossible to compare the cost effectiveness of first-line RTX maintenance therapy with observation in patients with fNHL with any confidence. In addition, several important model assumptions (the age of patients, the assumed duration of benefit from maintenance RTX therapy) indicated much greater uncertainty in the manufacturer&#x02019;s model cost-effectiveness results than was suggested in the MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusions of the ERG Report</title><p>The ERG concluded that the results of the PRIMA trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] appeared promising; however, the early closure of the trial combined with limited follow-up resulted in an immature dataset.

The AC acknowledged that the assumption of a conversion factor of 70&#x000a0;% would increase the base-case ICER. The AC was of the opinion that data from patient registries should have been used to validate the conversion factor assumed for the base-case estimate, and to confirm the degree to which RTX maintenance treatment might prolong life.

It was noted that the estimates were lower than the ERG scenarios; however, the manufacturer and the ERG had used different modelling approaches. The AC was satisfied that the manufacturer&#x02019;s SAs presented the most plausible range of estimates for the treatment effect in line with clinical opinion and the available data. The AC was also satisfied that the manufacturer&#x02019;s SAs, which assumed conversion rates of 70&#x000a0;%, 80&#x000a0;% and 90&#x000a0;%, provided a plausible range of conversion rate estimates.</p><p>In its final deliberations, the AC noted that the manufacturer&#x02019;s ICERS for RTX maintenance therapy compared with observation were less than &#x000a3;30,000 per QALY gained for most scenarios and the ERG ICERs ranged from &#x000a3;24,600 to &#x000a3;35,000 per QALY gained (depending on the conversion rate of PFS to OS). The AC also noted that the model did not include the utility associated with delaying CTX, and that if it were included it would decrease the ICER to an estimate that would be considered as a cost-effective use of NHS resources. The AC therefore recommended the use of RTX in this indication.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The main problem in this appraisal was the uncertainty of the clinical and cost effectiveness of RTX as a maintenance treatment for patients with fNHL whose disease had responded to induction treatment with R-CTX. The uncertainty was a direct result of the immature data presented as evidence of clinical effectiveness. The reported data appeared promising, but the lack of events mitigated against drawing any firm conclusions for either clinical or cost effectiveness. The early closure of the trial was of further concern given that evidence indicates that trials stopped early tend to overestimate treatment effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p>At the time that the ERG report was written, the median PFS for the RTX arm of the trial was not estimable; however, PFS was the key driver of the economic model. In the view of the ERG, the manufacturer was unable to predict the duration of the clinical effect of RTX maintenance therapy on PFS with any plausible certainty. Additionally, the manufacturer was unable to justify any assumptions regarding a direct survival benefit from increased PFS as the PFS to OS gain ratio in this disease area is unknown.</p><p>The ERG maintained the position throughout the process that the trial data were too immature to derive any firm conclusions regarding the clinical and cost effectiveness of RTX as a maintenance treatment and considered that any re-manipulation of the limited data available would not address any of the existing uncertainties. Only a fully mature dataset would adequately address these. As noted by the EMA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] in its evaluation of the data from the PRIMA trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], a median follow-up of about 2&#x000a0;years is relatively short for the assessment of the long-term benefit of RTX maintenance treatment. The ERG awaits the publication of more mature data from the PRIMA trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme (project number 08/218) and is published as part of a compendium of ERG articles in <italic>Health Technology Assessment</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].
