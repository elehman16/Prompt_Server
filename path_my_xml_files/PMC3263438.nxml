Patients entered a &#x02264;7-day screening period to collect baseline safety data and to determine eligibility; eligible patients were then randomised 2:1 to inhaled FF/VI combination (400/25&#x02005;&#x003bc;g) or placebo administered once daily in the morning by a novel dry powder inhaler (NDPI; Glaxo-SmithKline, London, UK). This was a double-blind study. Neither the subject nor the investigator knew which study medication the subject was receiving; the NDPI devices containing active medication or placebo appeared identical to the patient, their caregivers and the investigator, and the placebo dry powder formulation was indistinguishable from the FF/VI inhalation powder formulation. The central randomisation schedule was generated by the sponsor using a validated computerised system (RandAll). Patients were randomised using the Registration and Medication Ordering System (RAMOS), an automated interactive telephone-based system that was used by the investigator or designee to register the patient, randomise the patient and receive medication assignment information. Patients were eligible to be randomised provided none of the following occurred between visit 1 (screening) and visit 2 (randomisation): COPD exacerbation or lower respiratory tract infection; abnormal clinically significant findings including liver chemistry, biochemical, haematology or urinalysis screening tests; evidence of active, clinically significant abnormalities in 24-h Holter ECG at screening or predose 12-lead ECG at visit 2; evidence of non-compliance with prohibited medications and keeping clinic visit appointments. Post-randomisation, patients were reviewed at days 2, 7 (telephone contact), 14, 15, 28 and 29. All visits occurred in the morning with visits on days 2, 15 and 29 needing to occur within 22&#x02005;h following study medication administration to obtain the 23&#x02013;24-h postdose trough FEV<sub>1</sub> measurement.

Heart rate was assessed using standardised ambulatory monitors (Omron HEM-711DLX device (Omron Healthcare Inc. Kyoto, Japan) supplied by Biomedical Systems (Brussels, Belgium, and Maryland Heights, Missouri, USA)) throughout the study to ensure accuracy and consistency of data recorded. Vital signs were collected predose and at 15, 45, 90&#x02005;min and 2 and 4&#x02005;h postdose on days 1, 14 and 28 and predose for all other visits. AEs (coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Authorities) were assessed during each clinic visit. Each patient was provided with a &#x02018;medical problems/medications taken diary&#x02019; in which they were instructed to record any medical problems that they experienced and any medications used to treat the medical problem(s). The investigator or designee reviewed the diary at each clinic visit, and all confirmed AEs/serious AEs were recorded in the electronic Case Report Form.</p><p>Other safety end points included weighted mean and maximum systolic blood pressure and mean arterial blood pressure and weighted mean and minimum diastolic blood pressure over 0&#x02013;4&#x02005;h on days 1, 14 and 28. Weighted mean glucose and potassium over 0&#x02013;4&#x02005;h on days 1, 14 and 28 and maximum glucose and minimum potassium were other safety end points. Weighted mean and maximum QTc(F) (QT interval corrected by Fridericia's method) and QTc(B) (QT interval corrected by Bazett's method) derived from 12-lead ECGs recorded predose and 30&#x02005;min and 1, 2 and 4&#x02005;h postdose on days 1, 14 and 28, changes in haematologic and clinical chemistry parameters on days 14 and 28 and 24-h, 3-lead Holter ECG measurements at screening and day 28 were additional safety end points. Standardised ECG (PCECG 1200M ECG machine) and 3-lead Holter devices (DATRIX DR512 VX3 (Biomedical Systems, Brussels, Belgium, and Maryland Heights, Missouri, USA)) were used throughout the study, with central reader over-reads performed (representative from Biomedical Systems) to ensure consistency and accuracy of data recorded. Collection supplies for blood and blood analyses (for routine assessment of chemistry and haematology analytes and the pharmacodynamic assessments of plasma glucose and serum potassium levels) and urine collection supplies and sample analyses were provided by a central laboratory (Quest Diagnostics Clinical Trials (Heston, Middlesex, UK)). The incidence of COPD exacerbations was also recorded throughout the study. Each patient was provided with an electronic peak flow meter (Micro Medical MicroDiary electronic peak flow meter provided by Biomedical Systems, Brussels, Belgium), which the patient used to measure their peak expiratory flow three times, twice daily, in the morning and evening from screening to the end of 4-week treatment period.</p><p>Secondary efficacy end points were assessed by clinic spirometry. All sites used standardised spirometric equipment (Vitalograph Centralized Spirometry System (Biomedical Systems, Brussels, Belgium, and Maryland Heights, Missouri, USA)), and data were over-read by a trained over-reader (representative from Biomedical Systems) to ensure consistency and accuracy of collected data. Secondary efficacy end points were change from baseline in trough clinic visit FEV<sub>1</sub> (23&#x02013;24&#x02005;h postdose) on days 2, 15 and 29 (to assess the 24&#x02005;h effect of VI and to evaluate the contribution of FF) and weighted mean FEV<sub>1</sub> (0&#x02013;4&#x02005;h postdose) on days 1 and 28 (to evaluate the contribution of VI). Trough FEV<sub>1</sub> was defined as the mean of the FEV<sub>1</sub> values obtained 23 and 24&#x02005;h after dosing on days 1, 14 and 28. Other end points included time to an increase of &#x02265;100&#x02005;ml above baseline in FEV<sub>1</sub> on day 1 (0&#x02013;4&#x02005;h), peak FEV<sub>1</sub> on days 1 and 28 (0&#x02013;4&#x02005;h) and serial FEV<sub>1</sub> and forced vital capacity on days 1 and 28 (to evaluate the contribution of VI).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The sample size of 60 evaluable patients was based on the co-primary end point of change from baseline in weighted mean heart rate 0&#x02013;4&#x02005;h postdose at the end of the 28-day treatment period. The expected variability used for the sample size calculations in this study was based on data from a previous COPD study (B2C108562) with the compound GW642444H (data not shown), which demonstrated between-patient estimates of standard deviation (SD) of up to 10&#x02005;bpm for change from baseline weighted mean heart rate. The residual SD from the corresponding statistical analyses was in the range of 7.2&#x02013;8.0&#x02005;bpm. In the current study, weighted mean heart rate was calculated from heart rate recorded at clinic visits and so a more conservative estimate of SD of 10&#x02005;bpm was used for the sample size calculations. FF/VI was considered non-inferior to placebo for heart rate if the upper limit of the 95% CI for the estimated treatment difference for weighted mean heart rate was less than +10&#x02005;bpm. The true difference between placebo and FF/VI was assumed to be 0&#x02005;bpm. The number of completers in the B2C108562 study was 17 in the placebo group and 34 in the GW642444H group; therefore, if a similar number of patients completed the current study, there would be a 90% power to show non-inferiority to placebo. To allow for a possible withdrawal rate of 15%, 20 patients were randomised to placebo and 40 to FF/VI.</p><p>All efficacy and safety analyses used the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, defined as all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study medication. The primary analysis was performed for the ITT population using a Repeated Measures Mixed Model for weighted mean heart rate 0&#x02013;4&#x02005;h postdose on days 1, 14 and 28 (visits 2, 5 and 7). A one-sided 2.5% risk associated with incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis (significance level) was considered acceptable for this study.

FF/VI, dosed once daily, did not affect heart rate, had an on-treatment AE profile currently known to be associated with ICS therapy and showed clinical efficacy compared with placebo.</p><p>The results of the safety evaluation of this study suggest that FF/VI has a clinically acceptable safety profile at the given dose (400/25&#x02005;&#x003bc;g once daily). Previous studies of other twice-daily LABAs in both patients and healthy volunteers have shown that they can be associated with &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-mediated systemic adverse effects such as headache, palpitations with changes in heart rate, prolongation of the QTc interval and increased glucose and/or decreased potassium blood levels.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27 b28 b29">27&#x02013;29</xref> Consequently, these parameters were investigated in this study. The lack of difference between the FF/VI and placebo groups in the adjusted mean change from baseline in weighted mean heart rate 0&#x02013;4&#x02005;h postdose provides strong evidence of a lack of clinical effect of FF/VI on heart rate. There was also no evidence of clinically relevant treatment effects in the ECG assessments, including dysrhythmias. The absence of detrimental cardiovascular incidents in this study suggests that the risk of adverse cardiovascular effects with FF/VI is low. Longer term studies in substantially larger cohorts of patients with COPD would be required to determine whether any subgroup of patients with COPD may be at higher risk of developing cardiac side effects. Nevertheless, given that cardiovascular diseases are more prevalent in patients with COPD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> and there is an ongoing discussion related to the cardiac safety of many COPD therapies,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31 b32 b33">31&#x02013;33</xref> it is notable that no cardiac safety signal was detected in this study. No clinically relevant treatment effects on haematology, clinical chemistry or urinalysis were observed. A statistically significant difference between FF/VI and placebo was observed at day 28 (but not on days 1 and 14) for weighted mean plasma glucose; this difference was driven by a decrease in the mean change from baseline in plasma glucose in the placebo group (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">figure 3A</xref>) rather than an increase in plasma glucose in the FF/VI group.</p><p>The proportion of patients experiencing one or more on-treatment AEs was higher in the FF/VI group (68%) compared with the placebo group (50%), and these events were primarily accounted for by AEs commonly reported with ICS treatment (nasopharyngitis and oral candidiasis). Dysphonia, an expected AE with ICS treatment, was observed at the incidence of 5% in the FF/VI group and was not observed in the placebo group. No COPD exacerbations were reported during the study.</p><p>The results of the secondary efficacy analysis showed a significant improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> relative to placebo with FF/VI treatment. A treatment difference of 183&#x02005;ml in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> measured 23&#x02013;24&#x02005;h postdose was observed on day 29, showing a 24-h duration of effect for this combination. This improvement was greater than the 100&#x02013;140&#x02005;ml outcome recently suggested to be of a minimal important difference in clinical trials of COPD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> Serial measurements of FEV<sub>1</sub> on day 1 showed a rapid onset of action for FF/VI compared with placebo. Clinically relevant bronchodilation (&#x02265;100&#x02005;ml) was observed at the 5-min postdose time point following the first dose (the earliest postdose assessment time point in this study) in most patients receiving FF/VI.</p><p>A sustained 24-h effect is advantageous in the treatment of patients with COPD, providing it is not accompanied by a loss in efficacy during chronic dosing, as could be seen if tolerance to the bronchodilating effect was induced. Mean changes from baseline in maximal weighted mean FEV<sub>1</sub> observed 0&#x02013;4&#x02005;h postdose were higher on both days 1 and 28 for FF/VI compared with placebo, which argues for no loss in efficacy over the 4-week treatment period and hence an absence of tolerance. It is unlikely that longer term studies with regular treatment would detect any induction of tolerance, as any measurable &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonist-induced tolerance is typically observed within a few days of first dosing.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref></p><p>There are some limitations of this phase IIa study. Most importantly, there was no end point or surrogate marker to specifically address the relative clinical effects of FF in COPD (such as exacerbations), whereas the observed lung function effects are predominantly induced by the LABA component of the combination. Related to this, nor was VI assessed as a monotherapy. As exacerbations are a major cause of morbidity,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> a study with a much larger sample size and performed over a longer period of time is required to determine the effects of FF/VI on exacerbation frequency. This raises the second main limitation of this study, which is the 28-day treatment course. Although sufficient to assess the co-primary safety end points and typical for a phase IIa study, the 28&#x02005;days of treatment in this study is not a sufficient period of time from which firm conclusions, as to the long-term efficacy of FF/VI, can be made. Another issue associated with the ICS component of the FF/VI combination investigated is the potential impact of ICS treatment on the hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;adrenal axis. Morning urinary cortisol excretion may be decreased during ICS/LABA therapy, and urinary cortisol excretion was not measured in this study. Although only one dose of FF/VI was investigated, a previous dose-ranging study investigating the effect of 3, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50&#x02005;&#x003bc;g of VI over 4&#x02005;weeks has demonstrated a good safety and efficacy profile in patients with COPD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref></p><p>In conclusion, this study showed that FF/VI 400/25&#x02005;&#x003bc;g administered once daily by an NDPI was efficacious with a favourable safety and tolerability profile. Combination therapy in COPD is established to be an effective treatment option in moderate-to-severe cases of disease, and these results indicate that a once-daily regimen of this combination is a possible means of addressing the unmet needs in COPD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supporting Statement</title></caption><media xlink:href="bmjopen-2011-000370-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d32e1433" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d32e192" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2011-000370.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d32e194" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2011-000370.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>All listed authors meet the criteria for authorship set forth by the International Committee for Medical Journal Editors.
