The efficacy of the bladder neck plication stitch technique in promoting an earlier return of continence was prospectively evaluated in 158 patients who underwent RARP for clinically localized prostate cancer by a single surgeon at our institute from March 2012 to January 2013. Patients were randomized 1:1 to undergo surgery with (<italic>n</italic> = 79) or without (<italic>n</italic> = 79) the bladder neck plication stitch, and their time to recovery from incontinence, defined as being pad free, was compared. Recovery from incontinence at 1, 3, and 6 months were observed in 22 (27.8%), 42 (53.2%), and 57 (72.2%) patients, respectively, treated with, and 23 (29.1%), 47 (59.5%), and 59 (74.7%) patients, respectively, treated without the bladder neck plication stitch, with no significant difference in time to recovery from incontinence between the two groups. Multivariate analysis showed that age, membranous urethral length and shape of the prostatic apex on magnetic resonance imaging were independent predictors of early recovery from urinary incontinence after RARP. The bladder neck plication stitch had no effect on time to recovery from postoperative urinary incontinence following RARP.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>prostatectomy</kwd><kwd>prostatic neoplasms</kwd><kwd>urinary incontinence</kwd><kwd>urologic surgical procedures</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Although robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) has many advantages over open retropubic radical prostatectomy, postoperative urinary incontinence is a complication of radical prostatectomy that significantly compromises patient quality of life and has serious psychosocial effects, regardless of oncologic and sexual functional outcomes.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The etiology of postprostatectomy incontinence is not completely understood.

Men with preexisting symptoms of incontinence, any previous bladder or urethral surgery, or previous radiation therapy for the pelvis were excluded due to the possible effects of these factors on postoperative continence. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, and all patients provided written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Randomization and masking</title><p>After completion of baseline assessments, participants were randomized 1:1 to undergo RARP with or without the bladder neck plication stitch technique. The randomization process was performed by a senior nurse with no other involvement in the study. Functional outcomes were assessed by a senior nurse in an outpatient clinic who was blinded to group allocations.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Sample size</title><p>Three studies showed that the bladder neck plication stitch technique, during radical retropubic prostatectomy or RARP, enhanced the postoperative continence rate, by a median 20% at 3 months.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Assuming similar outcomes, the sample size was calculated to show a difference of 20% with a two sided significance level at 0.05% and 80% power. This required a total of 142 patients. To account for a dropout and noncompliance rate of 10%, 158 patients were finally included in the study cohort.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-4"><title>Surgical technique</title><p>All procedures were performed by the same experienced robotic surgeon (Hanjong Ahn) using the da Vinci Si robotic system (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and a transperitoneal approach. The bladder neck plication technique used was similar to that described previously.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Briefly, beginning with the anastomosis, Denonvilliers&#x02019; fascia was posteriorly reconstructed using the Rocco <italic>et al</italic>. technique,<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and running, double-armed 3&#x02013;0 absorbable polyglactin suture with a Van Velthoven stitch used for urethrovesical anastomosis.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> After completion of vesicourethral anastomosis, 3&#x02013;0 absorbable polyglactin single suture was used to plicate the bladder neck in a figure-of-8 fashion (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref></bold>). The first suture bite was taken at about the 3 o&#x02019;clock position about 2 cm proximal to the edge of the bladder neck or anastomosis. A similar small bite was taken at the 9 o&#x02019;clock position. This process was repeated at a position 5 mm more proximal on the bladder neck. The suture was then tied down directly on top. This plication of the bladder neck created a funnel configuration, such that the distal bladder neck remained narrower during bladder filling.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The bladder neck plication stitch was very simple and required &#x0003c;2 min.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Schematic (from Lee et al.) showing the bladder neck plication stitch technique.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The bladder neck plication stitch is positioned 2 cm proximal to the vesicourethral anastomosis at 3 o&#x02019;clock and 9 o&#x02019;clock.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AJA-17-304-g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec3-5"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Data were collected prospectively. The primary outcome measure was time to recovery from postoperative urinary incontinence, which was assessed by the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite questionnaire<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> at the 1, 3, and 6 months postoperative follow-up visits. Continence was defined as being pad free. The continence status of patients lost to follow-up was defined as that recorded during the last follow-up visit. The secondary outcome measures included factors associated with the recovery of continence; clinicopathological and patient-specific parameters, including age, body mass index (BMI), level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostate volume, membranous urethral length (MUL) and shape of the prostatic apex on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging. Also included were the results of the neurovascular bundle (NVB) saving, pathologic stage, Gleason score, lymph node involvement, and contrast leakage from urethrovesical anastomosis sites. Continence was also assessed in patients who received postoperative radiation therapy during follow-up to assess the effects of radiation therapy on continence rate. The MUL was estimated by measuring the length from the prostatic apex to the level of the urethra at the penile bulb in the midline sagittal plane of T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate. Data were analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis. Continuous variables were analyzed using unpaired Student's <italic>t</italic>-tests, and categorical variables were analyzed using Fisher's exact tests and Pearson's chi-square test. Factors associated with recovery of continence were assessed by multivariate logistic regression model. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Between March 2012 and January 2013, 158 patients at our institute were recruited to this study.

The precise mechanism by which intussusception of the bladder neck promotes earlier recovery from postoperative incontinence remains unclear, although two possibilities were suggested: (1) buttressing sutures may prevent the bladder neck from pulling apart as the bladder fills; and (2) functional residual urethral length may be increased by preventing the proximal end of urethral stump from opening. Two subsequent comparative studies of intussusception of the bladder neck yielded contradictory findings. One study found that intussusception of the bladder neck during retropubic radical prostatectomy resulted in a significantly greater continence rate of (77% <italic>vs</italic> 60%) after 3 months although continence rates at 12 months were similar.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> By contrast, the other study found that continence rates at 1, 3, and 6 months were 37.5%, 67.7%, and 95.8%, respectively, in patients with, and in 33.3%, 62.5%, and 95.8%, respectively, of patients without intussusception of the bladder neck after retropubic radical prostatectomy, with no significant between-group differences at any time point.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>A modification of the intussusception stitch technique<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> led to the development of the bladder neck plication stitch in RARP.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> This method involved anterior stitching only after urethrovesical anastomosis because posterior bladder neck stitching is technically difficult to perform robotically. The bladder neck plication stitch causes the bladder neck to become more funneled in appearance, likely decreasing the degree of stretch on the bladder neck and urinary sphincter at rest. Furthermore, this funneling may lengthen the functional length of the urethra. That study reported total continence rates in patients with and without bladder neck plication stitching were higher at 1 month (16% <italic>vs</italic> 8.9%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.097) and 3 months (36.3% <italic>vs</italic> 31.3%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.63), and were significantly higher at 12 months (85.7% <italic>vs</italic> 74.4%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.042). By contrast, our study found that the percentages of continent patients with and without bladder neck plication stitching after RARP similar at 1 month (27.8% <italic>vs</italic> 29.1%), 3 months (53.2% <italic>vs</italic> 59.5%), and 6 months (72.2% <italic>vs</italic> 74.7%). These findings were also consistent with the results of per-protocol analysis in our study.</p><p>A possible explanation for the discrepancy between our current findings and those reportedly previously<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> was that the early study only included age, BMI, and prostate volume as preoperative parameters. Several studies have suggested that the mechanism regulating continence is multifactorial, with many factors related to the recovery of urinary continence after radical prostatectomy. Hence, to determine continence status after RARP, not only age, BMI, and prostate volume, but also MUL, shape of the prostatic apex, and nerve-sparing surgery should be considered.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> We, therefore, utilized a logistic regression model to determine whether these factors affect the recovery of continence within 3 and 6 months after RARP. We found that patient age, MUL, and shape of the prostatic apex were significantly and independently associated with early recovery from postoperative urinary incontinence. These results are in accordance with those of prior studies, further indicating that younger age at operation, a nonprotruding prostatic apex and a longer MUL are predictors of earlier postoperative recovery of continence.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>We also found that the bladder neck plication stitch did not have a significant impact on continence status. Indeed, the continence rates 1, 3, and 6 months after the surgery were slightly higher in the absence than in the presence of bladder neck plication stitching, although none of these differences were statistically significant. Although not significant, mean age was lower and mean MUL slightly longer in patients who did not than who did undergo bladder neck plication stitching. Furthermore, the percentage of patients with nonprotruding prostatic apex on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging was slightly higher in patients who did not undergo bladder neck plication stitching. Those findings indicate that factors associated with postoperative incontinence, including age, MUL, and shape of the prostatic apex, have a greater impact on continence recovery than the use of a bladder neck plication stitch. Other potential reason for the differing results is that in the study of Lee <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> the mean patient age, which is one of the predictive factors for continence recovery after RARP,<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> was significantly younger than that of our study.</p><p>Regarding the safety and difficulty of the bladder neck plication stitch technique, no patient in either of our study groups experienced bladder neck contracture or other urinary complications. In addition, the technique was easy to learn and reproduce using robotic surgery.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> These findings indicate the need for prospective randomized controlled trials of modified stitches or other methodologies based on new concepts to develop an effective surgical technique for the earlier recovery from urinary incontinence after RARP. Preoperative factors associated with postoperative urinary incontinence should be considered when counseling patients before surgery.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>SP was responsible for the concept and framework of the paper.
