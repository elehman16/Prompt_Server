Bacterial nasopharyngeal carriage precedes infection, and various studies have pointed toward a causal link between carriage and disease [<xref rid="PIW010C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Children younger than 5 years are a population vulnerable to pneumococcal disease, and they form a reservoir for other age groups. Reduced carriage of <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> decreases exposure of unvaccinated individuals, which results in substantial indirect effects [<xref rid="PIW010C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="PIW010C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p><italic>S pneumoniae</italic> is one of the main bacterial pathogens in acute otitis media (AOM). In Finland, estimations of AOM incidence vary from 370 to 630 per 1000 child-years [<xref rid="PIW010C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] to &#x0003e;1100 per 1000 child-years [<xref rid="PIW010C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Clinical trials have shown efficacy of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) against vaccine-type AOM, but they have generally shown little or no efficacy against all-cause AOM (vaccine efficacy range, 1%&#x02013;7%) [<xref rid="PIW010C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="PIW010C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; except for one study showing efficacy of 34% for an 11-valent pneumococcal protein D&#x02013;conjugated vaccine in children [<xref rid="PIW010C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The 10-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide non-typeable <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> (NTHi) protein D&#x02013;conjugated vaccine (PHiD-CV, or PCV10) [<xref rid="PIW010C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="PIW010C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] was licensed in the European Union in March 2009 (<italic>Synflorix&#x02122;</italic>, GSK Vaccines). In addition to the recommended 3+1 schedule, PHiD-CV has increasingly been administered in a 2+1 schedule when given as part of routine infant immunization programs; however, efficacy/effectiveness data for the 2+1 schedule are limited. FinIP, a large cluster-randomized study in Finland, was the first clinical trial in Europe to document the effectiveness of PHiD-CV against invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and the impact on outpatient antimicrobial purchases when administered as a 2+1 or 3+1 schedule [<xref rid="PIW010C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="PIW010C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Here, we present results from a nested study that evaluated the effectiveness of PHiD-CV, given on different schedules, against nasopharyngeal carriage as an indication of the potential to induce herd effects. This is the largest carriage assessment study with PHiD-CV to date.

Effectiveness against vaccine-type pneumococcal carriage was observed with both the 3+1 and 2+1 infant schedules, although no VE was observed 1 month after the primary vaccination (infant age 6 months) for the 2+1 schedule. VE for the 3+1 and 2+1 schedules were at similar ranges 6 months post-primary vaccination (age 11&#x02013;12 months) and 3 months post-booster (age 14&#x02013;15 months). At the 18- to 22-month time point, VE continued to increase only for those who received the 3+1 schedule and tended to be higher than for those who received the 2+1 schedule. Our results suggest that PHiD-CV vaccination of children may induce herd protection against vaccine-type disease. This hypothesis can be supported by indirect carriage effects observed in FinIP [<xref rid="PIW010C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], reports showing a decline in vaccine-type carriage [<xref rid="PIW010C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and vaccine-type IPD [<xref rid="PIW010C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="PIW010C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] across all age groups after PHiD-CV vaccination of children, and preliminary data showing decreases in pneumonia in unvaccinated children not eligible for the national vaccination program [<xref rid="PIW010C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>The reduction in vaccine-type carriage was mainly a result of decreased carriage of the most prevalent serotypes, 6B, 14, 19F, and 23F. Post-vaccination, antibody levels against serotypes 6B and 23F were low, consistent with previous reports [<xref rid="PIW010C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="PIW010C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Nevertheless, we observed reduced carriage of both serotypes. Furthermore, 100% PHiD-CV effectiveness against serotype 6B IPD has been reported [<xref rid="PIW010C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], but the antibody levels needed to confer protection against IPD may be lower than those for nasopharyngeal carriage.</p><p>We also noted reduced carriage of vaccine-related serotype 19A with the 3+1 PHiD-CV schedule, although the carriage rates were low and, thus, the CIs were large. This finding may fit with observations after PHiD-CV infant immunization showing decreased serotype 19A IPD [<xref rid="PIW010C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="PIW010C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

Similarly, some of the early PCV7 trials did not find a clear impact of vaccination on 6A carriage [<xref rid="PIW010C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], whereas dramatically decreased 6A carriage was observed after widespread adoption of PCV7 [<xref rid="PIW010C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], in addition to significant herd protection against serotype 6A IPD [<xref rid="PIW010C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="PIW010C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Increases in non&#x02013;vaccine-serotype carriage were limited and observed only at later study visits.

Although the degree of replacement in nasopharyngeal carriage may be relative to the degree of vaccine-type reduction, replacement is also affected by changes in the entire microbiome, which, in addition to being under vaccine pressure, are also affected by viral coinfections, antibiotic selection of serotypes commonly resistant to antibiotics, clonal mutants quickly spreading, secular trends in serotype prevalence, etc.</p><p>We found no impact of PHiD-CV vaccination on NTHi carriage, which is consistent with previous PHiD-CV reports [<xref rid="PIW010C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="PIW010C38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The 11-valent PHiD-CV predecessor vaccine had a 38.6% (95% CI, &#x02013;6.3 to 64.6) reduction in NTHi carriage 3 months after a booster, but the difference between groups had disappeared by 12 months post-booster [<xref rid="PIW010C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>No significant effectiveness in reducing AOM rates was observed for the 3+1 or 2+1 regimen. Nevertheless, a low but consistent trend for effectiveness in reducing AOM was observed for each PHiD-CV vaccination regimen. No major differences between the 3+1 and 2+1 schedules were seen; however, this study was not designed to detect schedule differences. PHiD-CV VE against hospital-treated pneumonia [<xref rid="PIW010C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and against outpatient purchases of antimicrobial drugs [<xref rid="PIW010C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] were similar for both schedules.</p><p>A possible limitation is the collection of information about physician-diagnosed AOM from the parents. Nevertheless, Finland has well-established diagnostic and management guidelines for AOM [<xref rid="PIW010C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and the observed incidences were similar to those reported in a Finnish PCV7 efficacy study [<xref rid="PIW010C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Moreover, most participants with AOM received an antimicrobial prescription (&#x0003e;97%), which is in line with national guidelines that recommend antibiotic treatment when an AOM diagnosis is certain [<xref rid="PIW010C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The AOM study end point could be regarded as an antimicrobial-treated AOM end point.</p><p>Last, because this study was part of a cluster-randomized study, the observed effectiveness against carriage and AOM could be higher than the vaccine's efficacy as a result of herd protection within the vaccinated clusters. However, vaccination uptake rates per cluster were low to moderate (8%&#x02013;61%) [<xref rid="PIW010C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and carriage assessment was completed within 2 years after start of the study, which thus limits the possibility of observing a herd effect on the vaccine recipients.</p><p>PHiD-CV administered according to different age-appropriate schedules resulted in an acceptable safety and immunogenicity profile. Antibody GMCs and OPA GMTs were higher after the 3-dose than the 2-dose primary schedule; these differences diminished post-booster vaccination.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The observed effectiveness against nasopharyngeal carriage of vaccine-type pneumococci indicates the potential of PHiD-CV to induce a direct effect and herd protection against vaccine-type pneumococcal disease. Only a limited increase in the carriage of non&#x02013;vaccine-type pneumococcal serotypes was seen at later time points, which resulted in overall decreased carriage of all pneumococci.</p><p>After infant PHiD-CV vaccination, we noted a trend toward decreased numbers of parent-reported physician-diagnosed AOM episodes. PHiD-CV had an acceptable safety profile.</p></sec>
