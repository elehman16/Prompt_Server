One correlate would be the ability of cells induced by vaccination to recognize the Mtb-infected cell. AERAS-402 is a replication-deficient serotype 35 adenovirus containing DNA expressing a fusion protein of Mtb antigens 85A, 85B and TB10.4. We undertook a phase I double-blind, randomized placebo controlled trial of vaccination with AERAS-402 following BCG. Analysis of the vaccine-induced immune response revealed strong antigen-specific polyfunctional CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses. However, analysis of the vaccine-induced CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells revealed that in many instances these cells did not recognize the Mtb-infected cell. Our findings highlight the measurement of vaccine-induced, polyfunctional T cells may not reflect the extent or degree to which these cells are capable of identifying the Mtb-infected cell and correspondingly, the value of detailed experimental medicine studies early in vaccine development.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>To eradicate tuberculosis (TB), a multifaceted approach is needed, including the development of a robust and durable vaccine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.

Recent results from the first Phase IIb vaccine study using MVA-Ag85A in human infants has highlighted the possibility that the induction of polyfunctional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell immunity, while important, may not be sufficient<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> to confer protection.</p><p>While human Mtb specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are similar in the cytolytic and pro-inflammatory capacity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are capable of discerning Mtb-infected cells, particularly those that are HLA-II negative.

Specifically, we note that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are uniquely capable of discerning the Mtb-infected cell, and that a role for these cells in the long-term progression of mycobacterial growth has been demonstrated in the mouse and non-human primate models. For most vaccination studies, the assessment of vaccine-induced CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells has relied upon the measurement of antigen-specific polyfunctional cells, typically using peptide pools. However, as these measurements have been considered as a surrogate of protective immunity, it leaves open the question as to whether or not polyfunctional CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are capable of recognizing epitopes displayed in the context of Mtb infection and hence leaves open the possibility that a key parameter of vaccine immunogenicity may be overlooked.</p><p>AERAS-402 is a replication-deficient serotype 35 adenovirus containing DNA that expresses a fusion protein that includes three Mtb antigens, 85A (Ag85A), 85B (Ag85B) and TB10.4<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.

All received BCG vaccine 84 days prior to adenoviral vaccination. After randomization, 9 participants received AERAS-402 at day 0, 8 received AERAS-402 at day 28, and 2 received placebo at day 0 and 28 respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>; Consort Diagram<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). To perform immunologic characterization of vaccine-induced epitopes, study participants underwent leukapheresis prior to (day -14) and after AERAS-402 vaccination (between day 56 and 98). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) for intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) and IFN-&#x003b3; ELISPOT was collected on days &#x02212;84, &#x02212;14, 28, and 56 respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). ICS was also performed on day 98. ICS and IFN-&#x003b3; ELISPOT assays were performed as described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> using synthetic peptide pools with 15-mers overlapping by 11 amino acids (aa) from each antigen contained within AERAS-402. For the CD8 ELISPOT assay (CD8/others), CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were negatively selected from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) using a combination of CD4 and CD56 magnetic beads. For the PBMC ELISPOT, unfractionated PBMC were used as the source of responding T cells and largely consist of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>AERAS-402 recipients display strong antigen-specific T cell responses after vaccination</title><p>To determine the magnitude and phenotype of vaccine induced immune responses, PBMC, CD8 IFN-&#x003b3; ELISPOT and ICS was performed using peptide pools (15aa, 11aa overlap) representing each of the three antigens contained within the AERAS-402 vaccine. Most AERAS-402 recipients developed detectable antigen-specific PBMC and CD8 responses by IFN-&#x003b3; ELISPOT that were further amplified following the second vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Specifically, the difference for the <italic>ex vivo</italic> PBMC ELISPOT response from day -84 to day 56, reported as the mean, standard error of the mean (SEM), median and IQR (25 to 75 percentile) respectively are [ (Ag85A): 597.1; 378.4; 50.0; 16 to 1315 ], [ (Ag85B): 540.7; 286.6; 60.0; 16 to 1312 ], [ (TB10.4): 243.1; 87.2; 164.0; 13 to 391], compared with the two participants receiving BCG/placebo [ (Ag85A: 55.0; 53.0; 55.0; 2.0 to 108.0], [ (Ag85B): 26.0; 24.0; 26.0; 2.0 to 50.0 ], [ (TB10.4): 47.0; 39.0; 47.0; 8.0 to 86.0 ].

The PBMC median fold increase for the total cytokine response comparing day -84 to day 98 was 12.5, 3.2, and 1.2 for Ag85A, Ag85B and TB10.4 respectively. The CD8 median fold increase for the total cytokine response comparing day -84 to day 98 was 10.3, 53.4, and 5.6 for Ag85A, Ag85B and TB10.4 respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). By comparison, the placebo participants (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2) for both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells had a &#x0003c;1 or negative median fold change (data not shown). Further, these participants generated a polyfunctional cytokine response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>) consistent with prior immunogenicity studies of AERAS-402<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.

Participant 02107 showed a limited response to all of the vaccine antigens while another participant (01805) responded to Ag85A prior to vaccination with BCG. Interestingly, this subject had a more prolonged BCG reaction, suggesting previous exposure to environmental mycobacteria. We also observed a transient, but not insignificant ELISPOT response to Ag85A in a placebo participant at day -14 (00402), which was not observed in the other placebo participant.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>T Cell Clones Generated from AERAS-402 vaccinated participants often do not respond to Mtb-infected cells</title><p>To determine whether or not the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells elicited by AERAS-402 were capable of recognizing an Mtb-infected cell, limiting dilution analysis (LDA), using the peptide pools representing the AERAS-402 antigens, and autologous monocyte-derived APC was performed to obtain antigen-specific T cell clones for their ability to recognize either peptide-pulsed or Mtb-infected dendritic cells (DC). Surprisingly, the T cell clones from the initial five participants revealed exclusive reactivity to peptide-pulsed DC and not to Mtb-infected DC. While we have routinely used 5,000 Mtb-infected DC to elicit robust classically and non-classically-restricted Mtb-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> responses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, clones were tested with 20,000 DC per well to ensure adequate availability of Mtb-derived epitopes. Participant 00201 is shown as a representative example (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>) and none of the T cell clones that responded to peptide responded to the Mtb-infected DC.</p><p>Given these unexpected results, we questioned if the epitope recognized by clones derived from peptide pool stimulation might not reflect the full repertoire of epitopes induced in the setting of the AERAS-402 vaccine, and hence might fail to elicit clones capable of recognizing the Mtb-infected cell. Here, we sought to define the breadth of the epitopes elicited by the vaccine. To do this, we performed direct <italic>ex vivo</italic> IFN-&#x003b3; ELISPOT analysis to define each participant&#x02019;s CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response to each of the individual 15mer peptides that comprised the AERAS-402 peptide pool (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). Here, we show that participants vaccinated with AERAS-402 have distinct but focused reactivity to each of the 15mer peptides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). Where sufficient PBMC were available, we sought to generate an expanded panel of T cell clones that would better reflect the breadth of these responses. We then selected individual 15mer peptides that elicited a robust <italic>ex-vivo</italic> response to generate T cell clones. In this case, either traditional LDA cloning<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> or a novel CFSE-based method was employed and 19 stable CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell clones were derived (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t4">Table 4</xref> and illustrated by+ in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref> for the cognate 15mer). In one instance, (participant 01304, clone B12; Ag85A<sub>133&#x02013;147</sub>) the epitope did not correlate with the <italic>ex-vivo</italic> analysis likely the result of cross reactivity with peptide for Ag85B<sub>133&#x02013;147</sub>. Each clone was tested for its ability to recognize Mtb-infected cells and, where possible, the restricting allele and minimal epitope recognized was defined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>).</p><p>While all clones recognized their cognate peptide, three distinct patterns of Mtb recognition were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). First, we observed clones incapable of recognizing the Mtb-infected target (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;14 (74%)). Second, were clones with a low Mtb-specific response relative to peptide (E2 (00803), B16 (02309), P1 and P3 (02911). Third, one clone had a robust response to Mtb when compared to other clones (K1 for participant 02911), albeit still less than the peptide response. For comparison, the MR1-restricted (HLA-Ia unrestricted) clone B1 has been included as a positive control as it is known to respond to the Mtb-infected cells from all of the donors enrolled.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mtb Unresponsive Clones Efficiently Recognize Adenovirally Presented Antigen</title><p>We reasoned that those clones weakly or non-responsive to the Mtb-infected target might be those with a low-affinity T cell receptor, which in turn would exhibit diminished responsiveness to an adenovirally-infected target. To test this, DC were infected with either the AERAS-402 adenovirus or the wild type adenovirus control, and tested for their ability to elicit IFN-&#x003b3;. All of the clones were strongly responsive to the AERAS-402 vaccine, and we observed no relationship between the degree of responsiveness and the response to Mtb-infected targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). While each clone was screened based on the production of IFN-&#x003b3;, we sought to address the concern that the Mtb-infected target could induce T cell activation, but not IFN-&#x003b3; release. To test this, 100,000 T cell clones were incubated overnight with autologous DC, and assessed for markers associated with T cell activation. Specifically, DC were pulsed with 5&#x02009;ug/ml peptide or DC infected (MOI 30:1) with Mtb for 24 hours and then stained with CD3, CD8, CD4, Live/Dead discriminator and the activation marker CD25. In comparison to a clone generated using an Mtb infected DC (D481 C10; CFP10<sub>75&#x02013;83</sub>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, we observed that stimulation of the AERAS-402 clone (02911 K1 Ag85<sub>137&#x02013;146</sub>) with the Mtb-infected DC resulted in minimal upregulation of CD25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). These data are concordant with the IFN-&#x003b3; data shown, in which the CFP-specific clone elicited comparable IFN-&#x003b3; release in response to either peptide-pulsed or Mtb-infected DC, while the Ag85 specific clone preferentially released IFN-&#x003b3; in response to the peptide-pulsed target. While we did not specifically measure other cytokines or components of the granule exocytosis pathway, we note that T cell activation is a prerequisite for the release of these markers.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Preconditioning antigen presenting cells with proinflammatory cytokines TNF-&#x003b1; or IFN-&#x003b3; does not increase recognition of Mtb-infected cells</title><p>We next tested the hypothesis that induction of the immune-proteasome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> might be required for the processing and presentation of Mtb-derived epitopes. Neither TNF-&#x003b1; nor IFN-&#x003b3; preconditioning of the Mtb-infected DC affected recognition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). Finally we postulated that T cell cloning led to the generation of low-affinity T cells. To test this hypothesis, an identical protocol to that described was used to generate a TB10.4 specific T cell clone (aa 73&#x02013;87; SSTHEANTMAMMARD) from a subject with latent TB infection. The resulting T cell clone responded similarly to its cognate epitope and to the Mtb-infected DC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>While the AERAS-402 vaccine after BCG prime is broadly immunogenic<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, the observation that vaccine-elicited CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were in many instances not capable of recognizing an Mtb-infected cell raises the possibility that enumeration of vaccine-induced polyfunctional T cells may not reflect the extent or degree to which these cells are capable of identifying cells infected with Mtb. At present, correlates of protective immunity for Mtb are poorly understood, and yet desperately needed to guide improved vaccine design. Our data would support supplemental approaches to define vaccine-induced immunity for Mtb<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. In addition to the evaluation of vaccine-induced T cells to recognize the infected cells, these approaches might include direct measurement of Mtb growth inhibition proposed as an adjunct to immunogenicity studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Similarly, our findings would also support the use of leukapheresis in conjunction with Phase I vaccination studies as a platform for comprehensive analysis of vaccine-induced immunity. In this regard, detailed experimental medicine studies, early in vaccine development would allow for a more rational and robust approach in the definition of surrogates of protective immunity in the context of larger Phase IIb studies, and ultimately the prioritization of novel vaccine candidates.</p><p>Collective evidence reinforces the fundamental biologic capacity of the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response to preferentially discern high burden intracellular infection with Mtb<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. However, this study does not identify the specific mechanisms underlying the reasons that some of the vaccine-elicited CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells did not recognize epitopes displayed by the Mtb-infected cell. One possibility is that antigens that are presented by the AERAS-402 vaccine have limited access to the HLA-Ia processing machinery during the course of Mtb infection <italic>in vivo</italic>. This could be the result of protein abundance, tissue distribution, or access to the HLA-Ia processing machinery. In this regard, while many antigens elicit high-frequency T cell responses in the setting of natural infection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> we have observed previously that Ag85, one of the antigens in AERAS-402, is a relatively poor inducer of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Similarly, Lindestrom <italic>et al</italic>. report the structure of TB10.4 limits effective proteosomal and epitope processing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. In any case, the determination and subsequent use of antigens associated with robust Mtb-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses might improve the ability of virally delivered vaccines to elicit epitopes displayed during the course of infection with Mtb.</p><p>Alternately, the immunodominance hierarchy elicited by adenoviral vaccination may not reflect that elicited in the course of natural infection. In this regard, the relatively high abundance of cytosolic proteins found during adenoviral infection may allow for the selection of epitopes that may be rare or less relevant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> during natural infection with Mtb. Mice vaccinated with an Ag85B-ESAT-6 fusion molecule delivered via an adenoviral vector had a strong IFN-&#x003b3; mediated recall response to vaccine-induced epitopes however, this response was ultimately non- protective. Strikingly, modifying the viral delivery system impacted the immune dominance hierarchy toward a more protective phenotype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Thus, the immunodominance hierarchy presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref> may not reflect a profile that may be seen in the same individual following natural infection with Mtb. Similarly, this study was conducted in subjects without a history of BCG vaccination prior to enrollment, thus we cannot ascertain if remote BCG<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> prior to an adenoviral boost would have changed the immunodominance hierarchy seen herein. Specifically, it is possible that those epitopes elicited during the course of natural infection with BCG would be preferentially expanded by the subsequent adenoviral challenge. Counter to this argument, is the observation by ourselves and others that BCG is a poor inducer of Ag85-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses.</p><p>Additionally, a limitation of this study is that sub dominant or &#x0201c;cryptic&#x0201d; epitopes might nonetheless be augmented and hence protective following natural infection with Mtb, as shown in the murine model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. In the approach taken in this report, we have likely failed to map those sub dominant epitopes. Here we note that an epitope that might be considered immune dominant for one individual was often sub dominant for another, precluding a broader classification of immunodominance. Further, we may not have accounted for the full repertoire of T cell effector function. Specifically, we have based our original screen on the production of IFN-&#x003b3;, but did not more directly assess for GM-CSF, IL-1&#x003b2;, granulysin, granzyme B or perforin. In this regard, we note that evaluation of markers of T cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>) directly <italic>ex-vivo</italic> would provide a means to assess the ability of vaccine induced CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to recognize the Mtb-infected cell.</p><p>In summary, while AERAS-402 is broadly immunogenic, our findings highlight that measurement of vaccine-induced, polyfunctional T cells may not reflect the extent or degree to which these cells are capable of identifying the Mtb-infected cell. Detailed experimental medicine studies paired with new vaccine studies may accelerate a more complete understanding of patterns of immune dominance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> and subdominance and thus inform correlates of protective immunity induced by vaccination.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Protocol</title><p>A Phase I, Double Blind, Randomized, Placebo-controlled Leukapheresis Study to Obtain Lymphocytes for the Study of Immune Responses in Healthy Adult Volunteers in the U.S. who receive BCG Vaccination followed by Boosting with AERAS-402.</p><p>Investigational Product: AERAS-402</p><p>Aeras Protocol Number: C-021-402</p><p>US FDA IND Number: BB-IND 13140</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Experimental Design</title><p>We performed a Phase I, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in a group of healthy adult male and female participants who are HIV-negative, BCG-unvaccinated and have no evidence of tuberculosis infection.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Registration number and Trial Registry Information</title><p>The study was registered with Clinicaltrials.gov and has been given the identifier of NCT02375256.

All determinations are performed in duplicate. Solid line: Ag85A, dashed line: Ag85B, dotted line: TB10.4. For the CD8 ELISPOT assay (CD8/others), CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were negatively selected from PBMC using a combination of CD4 and CD56 magnetic beads. For the PBMC ELISPOT, unfractionated PBMC were used as the source of responding T cells and largely consist of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Participant numbers are designated over the graphs with the two participants receiving placebo noted in parentheses. Participant 02309 received only the first dose of AERAS-402 vaccine (day 0), due to an abnormal hematocrit prior to the planned day 28 dose.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="srep36355-f1"/></fig><fig id="f2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Intracellular Cytokine Staining Response to the AERAS-402 Vaccine.</title><p>PBMC and leukapheresis specimens from Study Days &#x02212;84, &#x02212;14, 28, 56, and 98 were thawed, rested overnight, and stimulated for 5&#x02013;7&#x02009;hours with DMSO (negative control), SEB (positive control), or peptide pools corresponding to the vaccine antigens Ag85A, Ag85B, or TB10.4.
