In this study, we used small saphenous vein puncture instead of jugular vein intubation for different doses of D-gal administration, which not only effectively avoided the trauma caused by intubation, but also significantly reduced the anesthesia time and greatly improved the convenience of operation. This study concluded that a simplified, reproducible D-gal-induced large-animal ALF model with an appropriate treatment window had been established successfully, which is suitable for assessing the safety and efficacy of artificial liver support systems, studying the pathogenesis of ALF, and developing new drugs.</p><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Acute liver failure (ALF) results from various causes and is a serious threat to human health[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Therefore, the establishment of an ALF animal model is of great significance for studying its pathogenesis, developing new drugs, and determining the comprehensive treatment of ALF[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In recent years, artificial liver technology has become a topic of great interest to researchers in the ALF field[<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Artificial liver support systems (ALSS) can significantly improve the clinical manifestations and prolong the survival time of patients with liver failure or those awaiting liver transplantation[<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The safety and efficacy of ALSS must be verified before clinical application because they contain biological substances, such as liver cells; at this point, an ideal animal model of ALF would be an indispensable verification platform[<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a simplified and reproducible animal model of ALF with an appropriate treatment window.</p><p>There are current literature reports of many drugs that have been used to induce animal models of ALF[<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. D-galactosamine (D-gal) is a disruptor of uridine triphosphate of hepatocytes, causing diffuse hepatic necrosis and an inflammatory response, similar to the pathological changes of clinical viral hepatitis[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Compared with other drugs, D-gal has many advantages, including better reproducibility and easier dosage control; it is generally accepted as the ideal drug to induce ALF.</p><p>At present, large animals used to establish liver failure models are mainly pigs and dogs[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], but their physiological and biochemical characteristics are dissimilar to those of humans, and results are relatively poor for guiding clinical treatment. As for the methods of drug administration, the main method used is intubation through the jugular vein[<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], which is complex and increases the trauma to experimental animals.</p><p>In this study, we used different doses of D-gal administered through the small saphenous vein of cynomolgus monkeys, and then observed the clinical manifestations, survival times, changes in biochemical indices, intracranial pressure (ICP) changes, and resulting pathological and histological characteristics, in order to establish a simplified, reproducible D-gal-induced large-animal ALF model with an appropriate treatment window, suitable for assessing the safety and efficacy of ALSS, studying the pathogenesis of ALF, and developing new drugs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Sixteen 6-9-year-old male cynomolgus monkeys, weighing 9.4-11 kg, were purchased from Guangdong Landao Biological Technology Co.

Anesthesia was induced by intramuscular injection of Zoletil (15 mg/kg) and atropine (0.5 mg/kg). Blood samples were collected from the forearm and vital signs and ICP were measured as baseline values (0 h). Finally, the prepared D-gal solution was drawn into a 50 mL syringe connected to a disposable needle, air was expelled from the syringe, and then the D-gal solution was administered slowly through the small saphenous vein (Supplementary Figure 2). After D-gal administration, animals were given regular feed and free access to water and fresh fruit.</p></sec><sec><title>Parameters</title><p>The general condition of study animals was monitored during the experiment and the subsequent observation period, as follows: the ability to stand, to walk, and to eat; the response to sight, sound, and stimulation; and presence of cramps or convulsions. When the animal was conscious, these were recorded every 12 h, whereas the animals were observed every 2 h after unconsciousness occurred. The recorded survival time was defined as the time interval from completion of injection of D-gal to death, and surviving animals were observed for 144 h in total.</p><p>ICP, ammonia level, and levels of inflammatory markers [tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1;, interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2;, and IL-6] and endotoxin were recorded at 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h after D-gal administration. An ammonia determination kit (end-point method) purchased from Sysmex Corporation (Japan) was used to measure whole blood ammonia levels. TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IL-6 levels were determined with ELISA kits purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Endotoxin levels were determined with a Tachypleus Amebocyte Lysate kit purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.</p><p>Vital signs were monitored and blood samples to measure liver function indices (AST, ALT, ALB, TBiL, CK, and LDH), renal function indices (BUN and Cr), blood glucose, prothrombin time (PT), and routine blood chemistry tests were collected at 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h after drug administration.

Histopathological examination was then performed.</p><p>Animals surviving at 144 h were sacrificed with a lethal intravenous injection of pentobarbital and KCl, and a detailed autopsy was performed immediately after animal death. Each animal&#x02019;s liver, heart, kidneys, spleen, lungs, large intestine, small intestine, brain, and pancreas were collected, and all tissue specimens were fixed in 10% formalin solution and cut into 5 mm<sup>3</sup> blocks which were paraffin-embedded and thin-sectioned. Subsequently, slides underwent stepwise alcohol dehydration before hematoxylin-eosin (H&#x00026;E) staining for observation under a light microscope.

The ideal criteria for animal models were first proposed by Terblanche et al[<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], which were promoted and supplemented as a result of subsequent studies[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. They mainly comprise the following points: reversibility; reproducibility; death from liver failure; suitable treatment window; large animals; causing minimal harm to environment and researchers; consciousness level making hepatic encephalopathy easy to evaluate; similarity to human beings; and ethically acceptable.</p><p>At present, large animal models of ALF meeting the above criteria mainly include drug-induced models[<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and surgery-induced models[<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Drug-induced models are easy to create, having short anesthesia times, and can be accomplished without use of the highly skilled technical work required to establish surgery-induced models. Although sometimes drug-induced models are unstable because of great individual differences in drug tolerance and metabolic function, these models are of great interest to research scholars because the most common reason for ALF in clinical setting is drug toxicity[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Current literature reports of drugs that can induce ALF include those on D-gal, acetaminophen (APAP), and carbon tetrachloride, to name a few[<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Yu et al[<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] reported on the pharmacokinetics, drug metabolism, and hepatic toxicity of APAP in cynomolgus monkeys and found significant tolerance to APAP; therefore, APAP is not suitable to create a cynomolgus monkey model to study related hepatic injury. Compared with other drugs, D-gal has many advantages for this purpose, including better reproducibility and easier control of the dosage; it is generally accepted as the ideal drug to induce ALF.</p><p>For this study, we chose cynomolgus monkeys because their anatomy, physiology, biochemical metabolism, and immune system characteristics are very similar to those of human beings, making them the ideal animal to establish an ALF model. Given the rarity of primate species and the instability of other models, there are few relevant published reports of primate models of ALF. Zhou et al[<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] induced fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) in the <italic>Macaca mulatta</italic> by intraperitoneal injection of amatoxin and endotoxin, and evaluated the animal model by progressive analysis of clinical features, biochemical indices, and histopathology. However, their study included only two monkeys, so the stability and reproducibility need further verification, and the effective treatment window of this model would make the study of use of ALSS difficult.</p><p>Drug dosages and administration methods are important for establishing drug-induced models. The method of drug administration affects the convenience of using a model. Various ALF studies have different requirements for the survival time, which usually means exploring the optimal dosage and induction methods for different purposes. Glorioso et al[<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] successfully established a pig model of ALF by injecting 0.75 g/kg D-gal through the external jugular vein, which was successfully used in the study of artificial livers. Li et al[<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] established a pig model of FHF by intravenous injection of 1.3 g/kg and 1.5 g/kg[<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] D-gal, which was used in studies to verify the safety and efficacy of ALSS. Ding et al[<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] established a pig model of ALF by injecting 0.45 g/kg D-gal intravenously to study treatment with a novel bio-artificial liver.</p><p>Currently, D-gal is usually administered through the external jugular vein or the abdominal cavity[<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>-<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The abdominal cavity injection is simple and convenient, but resulting models are unstable, while administration through the external jugular vein and portal vein usually requires a long anesthesia time and surgical venous intubation, so the method is more complicated.</p><p>In our early study, we administered 0.45, 0.3, and 0.15 g/kg of D-gal through the external jugular vein to establish an ALF model to explore the optimal basic dosage to establish the primate model of ALF[<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, venous intubation is not only inconvenient, but also brings certain trauma to the experimental animal. In this study, we used small saphenous vein puncture instead of jugular vein intubation for D-gal administration, which not only effectively avoided the trauma caused by intubation, but also significantly reduced the anesthesia time and greatly improved the convenience of operation. Moreover, we further adjusted and optimized the dosage of D-gal using the previous dose of 0.3 g/kg, as well as a 0.25 g/kg single dose, 0.25 g/kg as a divided dose (0.20 + 0.05 g/kg), and a single 0.20 g/kg dose, and then compared in the different groups for changes of clinical manifestation, survival time, liver function, inflammatory factors, PT, ICP, and histopathology.</p><p>The results showed that the experimental monkeys developed different levels of anorexia, anemia, jaundice, and coagulopathy after intravenous injection of different doses of D-gal that were similar to the various degrees of clinical ALF. The animals administered 0.30 g/kg of D-gal had the shortest survival time (56 &#x000b1; 8.7 h), and there was no significant difference in survival time after 0.25 g/kg given as a single or divided dose (95 &#x000b1; 5.5 h and 99 &#x000b1; 2.2 h, respectively). In our study, 81.3% (13/16) of experimental monkeys died, and the survival time of experimental animals was positively correlated with the dose of D-gal.</p><p>D-gal can cause liver cell necrosis and lead to ALF, as well as abnormally elevated serum TNF-&#x003b1;, which then triggers the cascade of inflammatory mediators and is closely related to the pathophysiology of ALF[<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In our study, a strong inflammatory response was observed, as evidenced by markedly increased levels of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, and endotoxin, all of which were positively correlated with the dose of D-gal.</p><p>Liver enzymes are important indices to assess clinical liver injury. When liver cells are necrotic, inflammation and toxicity can cause damage to the liver cell membrane, leading to serum transaminase elevations; transaminase levels 10-fold higher than the baseline indicate acute liver damage[<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In this study, ALT, AST, CK, and LDH increased rapidly in a short time after injection of D-gal, with results demonstrating that acute liver injury and the degree of damage were positively correlated with the dose of D-gal.</p><p>ALB and PT are important indicators of liver synthesis and reserve function. In our study, serum ALB levels showed a progressive decline after D-gal administration except in group D, and this may explain the anomalous finding of abdominal and pleural effusions on autopsy of the study animals. The PT in the four groups was significantly prolonged, with the peak times 4-, 5-, 6-, and 1.5-fold of the baseline time in groups A, B, C and D, respectively. At autopsy, the livers in groups A and B had obvious ecchymosis, and four lung specimens had obvious bleeding; these findings are likely associated with the coagulation dysfunction caused by liver failure.</p><p>Hepatic encephalopathy is a serious complication of ALF and is closely related to the blood ammonia level, elevations of which cause brain edema, oxidative stress, and inflammation[<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In our study, we measured the progression of ammonia levels and ICP to monitor for hepatic encephalopathy. Ammonia and ICP were significantly increased in groups A and B, and were associated with the clinical manifestations of consciousness changes and hepatic coma before death, as well as histopathological changes, all indicating that the experimental animals developed hepatic encephalopathy before death.</p><p>The model established in our study has some limitations. First, we used Zoletil to induce anesthesia before administering D-gal, and although Zoletil has many advantages, including short induction time, minimal side effects, and maximum security compared with ketamine, whether it can affect the effect of D-gal is unknown. In addition, the number of animals used was small, and further studies with larger experimental groups are warranted to verify our results.</p><p>In conclusion, we have successfully established a simplified, reproducible D-gal-induced cynomolgus monkey model of ALF that is suitable for assessing the safety and efficacy of ALSS, studying the pathogenesis of ALF, and developing new drugs, and the dosage of 0.25 g/kg as either a single or divided dose is optimal.</p></sec><sec><title>ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS</title><sec><title>Research Background</title><p>Acute liver failure (ALF) is a serious threat to human health. Artificial liver support system (ALSS) is a novel method to deal with ALF. However, the safety and efficacy of ALSS must be verified before clinical application. Therefore, the establishment of an ALF animal model is of great significance for testing ALSS, studying the pathogenesis of ALF, and determining the comprehensive treatment of ALF. Nowadays, there have been many studies about the acute liver failure in large animals, such as pigs and dogs. However, there have been few previously reported studies of ALF models in cynomolgus monkey. Furthermore, the methods of drug administration are complex and increase the trauma to experimental animals.</p></sec><sec><title>Research motivation</title><p>In this study, our motivation was to establish an ideal animal model of ALF with an appropriate treatment window which is suitable for assessing the safety and efficacy of ALSS, studying the pathogenesis of ALF, developing new drugs, and determining the comprehensive treatment of ALF.</p></sec><sec><title>Research objectives</title><p>The primary objective of this study was to establish a simplified, reproducible D-gal-induced large-animal ALF model with an appropriate treatment window.
