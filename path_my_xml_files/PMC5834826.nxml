</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The study used a mixed method design with a convergent parallel collection of data. Medical students (n=62) from Maastricht University (The Netherlands) were randomized to either a conventional teaching group (control group n=30) or conventional teaching plus the e-learning program (application on smartphone) group (e-learning group n=32). Pre- and post-intervention knowledge test results were analysed using an independent t-test. Individual semi-structured interviews (n=9) were conducted and verbatim-transcribed recordings were analysed using King&#x02019;s template analysis.
</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The e-learning program positively influenced students&#x02019; level of knowledge and their process of learning. A significant difference was found in the post-test scores for the control group (M=51.4, SD=6.43) and the e-learning group (M=73.09, SD=5.12); t(60)=-14.75, p&#x0003c;0.000). Interview data showed that the e-learning program stimulated students&#x02019; learning as the application promoted the identification and recognition of skin disorders, the use of references, creation of documents and sharing information with colleagues.
</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study demonstrated that use of the e-learning program led to a significant improvement in basic dermatological knowledge. The underlying learning processes indicated that e-learning programs in dermatology filled a vital gap in the understanding of clinical reasoning in dermatology. These results might be useful when developing (clinical) teaching formats with a special focus on visual disciplines.&#x000a0;</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>E-learning</kwd><kwd>mixed methods</kwd><kwd>dermatology</kwd><kwd>learning theory</kwd><kwd>students&#x02019; perceptions</kwd><kwd>clinical phase</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In today&#x02019;s general medical practice, physicians are frequently faced with dermatological cases.<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> However, the limited dermatological training in medical schools stands in stark contrast with the high number of skin diseases that are estimated to be encountered in primary care.<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref></p><p>Medical students are insufficiently exposed to dermatological cases prior to their clerkships.

During the fourth year, internal medicine is part of the first clerkship offered to medical students. The clerkships take place in the University Hospital of Maastricht or affiliated hospitals in the region. The clerkship in internal medicine consists of 12 weeks, in which students are placed in various internal medicine disciplines such as cardiology, pulmonology, or dermatology for 3-6 weeks. These placements are random; therefore only 2 out of 15 students are assigned to the dermatology ward per round of 12 weeks.</p><p>Participants were randomized to either a conventional teaching group (control group n=30) or conventional teaching plus the e-learning program (application on smartphone) group (e-learning group n=32). The conventional teaching consisted of one lecture addressing dermatological topics. The duration of the follow-up period of all participants was six weeks. As each group of students started their first clerkship in different periods, the timeframe of data collection ranged from November 2016 until February 2017.</p><p>Participants in the e-learning group were given short verbal and practical instructions on how to use the e-learning program. This program, named Education in Dermatology (ED), is an interactive web-based program that can be accessed from any computer or smartphone. The program contains 35 clinical cases, featuring the most common dermatological diseases. Each case consists of two or three multiple-choice questions regarding the description, diagnosis, and management of the disease. Answers are provided along with examples of typical visual features necessary to evaluate skin lesions. In addition, links and references to learning materials, such as websites, are provided for in-depth information.</p><p>The study was approved by the ethical review board of the Dutch Society for Medical Education. Informed consent forms were obtained from all participants prior to the study. Participation in the study was voluntary. Results did not affect students&#x02019; grades and were used for research purposes only.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection methods</title><sec><title>Quantitative data</title><p>The department of dermatology at the University Hospital of Maastricht developed the multiple-choice questions used in the program and the tests. These questions are part of an existing, validated question bank that is used for summative assessment during the clerkships at the teaching hospital of Maastricht University. To ensure reliability, dermatologists and course instructors (HM, IN) critically reviewed the content before using the questions in the pre- and post-tests and e-learning program. Questions were based on the learning objectives and outcomes of the medical curriculum. Each case consisted of three questions that measured different levels of learning: knowledge, combined comprehension and application, and problem-solving ability. Before the start of the intervention, all students were asked to complete the pre-test. After six weeks, students were asked to complete the post-test. Each test consisted of 45 questions. A time limit of 45 minutes was applied. Scores ranged from 0% to a maximum of 100%. To prevent students in the e-learning group sharing information with the control group, individual passwords for the program were provided to students within the e-learning group.</p></sec><sec><title>Qualitative data</title><p>Individual interviews were used to explore students&#x02019; experiences of the e-learning program, and their learning approaches. The interview consisted of semi-structured questions based on basic concepts of learning, self-regulation of learning, and user-friendliness of the program <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">(Appendix)</xref>.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref><sup>-</sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Students of the e-learning group who had fully completed six weeks of study were invited to take part. A total of 9 students participated in the individual interviews, with 4 students using the e-learning during a placement in the dermatology ward and 5 using the e-learning during a placement in a different internal medicine discipline. Interviews were conducted between December 2016 and February 2017 by the first author (FF). Interview time was fifty-sixty minutes. All interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim.

Students preferred to work on the e-learning program at home, during the evenings, or at weekends (quote 3, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>A few barriers of the e-learning program were related to technological issues, e.g., the sharpness of pictures (quote 4, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Learning value</title><p>In this section, we present pure - and post-learning effects. of the e-learning program on students&#x02019; learning processes.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Pure-learning effects entail learning during the use of the e-learning program, post-learning effects entail the impact on learning following use of the e-learning program.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref></p></sec><sec><title>Pure-learning effects</title><p>The interviewees mentioned specific features where the material of the e-learning program had additional learning value</p><p>for the diseases and procedures in dermatology. The selected cases and associated questions enabled students to get acquainted to the specific steps in a dermatological anamnesis, identifying skin disorders through images, and formulating a differential diagnosis (quote 5, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>Students stated that the pre-selected questions specifically guided a deeper understanding of the cases. Most of these cases included diseases that were also encountered in practice. In this way, as stated by the students, the controlled introduction of knowledge via the cases allowed students to focus on a specific subject, as opposed to being overwhelmed by information in dermatological textbooks (quote 6, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>The field of dermatology was perceived as challenging as it represents a large number of possible diseases, and requires detailed knowledge to formulate a differential diagnosis.<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Students were required to compare images of skin diseases and to link these with accurate anamnestic information. Therefore, the combination of visual images and patient history in the cases in the e-learning program facilitated the recognition of diseases, allowing students to search for differences between diseases when presented with similar features. In addition, the multiple-choice questions were seen as helpful, as the possible answers each represented a differential diagnosis. This was perceived as helpful for the formulation of a differential diagnosis (quote 8, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Post-learning effects</title><p>Regarding the post-learning effect of the program, students noted that the links to websites initiated the use of the references and the creation of documents for personal learning. In addition, use of the program stimulated discussion of information with medical professionals and other students and aided in the recognition of skin problems in the clinic.</p><p>The references helped to review wrong answers in a purposeful way. Feedback on the answers was an important feature for the self-evaluation of their knowledge (quote 9-10, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref>). Links to websites were also used to further study the mechanisms of diseases. Most students kept a document as an &#x02018;overview&#x02019; for themselves, leading to improved retention of knowledge (quote 11, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>Some students discussed the cases in the program with colleagues or medical professionals in the workplace. By discussing cases, more in-depth information was gained, improving the insights in the disease (quote 12, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref>). Use of the program also encouraged students to exchange information and discuss mechanisms; this was considered helpful given the unfamiliarity with dermatological diseases, and the desire to do well in assessments (quote 13, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>Recognition of diseases in the clerkship facilitated students&#x02019; learning by forming a more coherent picture of the patient and disease. Some students used the encounter with patients to return to the program, allowing them to consolidate their knowledge (quote 14, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>An e-learning program in dermatology on smartphones offers a promising approach to enhance students&#x02019; knowledge and learning approaches.

Use of the e-learning program led to a significant improvement in basic dermatological knowledge. An important finding was the underlying mechanism of learning, which were related to pure-learning effects, i.e., learning while using the e-learning program; and post-learning effects, i.e., learning through the use of references, to create documents, and discuss information with other medical professionals. The importance of novel educational formats as described in this paper is very likely to move beyond the scope of medical students and field of dermatology. In addition to previous studies that focused on students in their pre-clinical phase, this study identified important learning processes of medical students in their clinical phase.<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Furthermore, the e-learning program holds promise for other disciplines, such as family medicine, radiology, and pathology.
