Dizziness in convalescence period is of high importance because it can prolong patient's stay at the hospital and decrease in sense of rehealing. Transfusion indication is seen in hemoglobin levels &#x0003c;7 g/dl; however, dizziness has been frequently observed in patients with hemoglobin levels 7-10 g/dl and they have dramatic response to transfusion. Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate effect of transfusion on dizziness in hemoglobin levels of 7-10 g/dl to set a more accurate indication for transfusion in anemic patients after elective off-pump CABG.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>This clinical trial study was conducted on 90 patients undergoing elective off-pump CABG surgery from January to June 2011, in Afshar cardiovascular center, Yazd, Iran. Patients with hemoglobin levels of 7-10 g/ dl measured 48 h after CABG were included in this study and those who stayed in ICU more than 48 h were excluded. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups: the experimental group received packed cell according to study protocol while the control group did not receive packed cell. Hemoglobin concentration was measured at 48 h and 72 h after CABG and discharge time, respectively. Dizziness was evaluated 72 h after surgery. Data were analyzed by ANOVA, Chi-square, and Fisher's exact test for quantitative and qualitative variables.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age of the patients was 63.5 &#x000b1; 10.67 years, from all of patients in which 50 cases (55.6%) were males and 40 cases (44.4%) were females. Dizziness after surgery occurred in 35 cases (38.8%), of whom, 27 cases (62.8%) were in the control group and 8 cases (17%) were in the transfusion group.

Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) is the most common cardiac surgery around the world.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Neurological complications following CABG are incompetency of motor posture, sensation, reflex, convulsion, and consciousness level during 36 h after open heart surgery. Neurological events including stroke, dizziness, cognitional disorder, central, or peripheral neuropathy can increase morbidity and mortality after cardiac surgery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Dizziness describes two different symptoms: vertigo and lightheadedness (faintness). Vertigo explains the sense of spinning, whirling, or motion either of yourself and lightheadedness is a sense like you might faint. The common causes of dizziness may include bleeding, stroke, multiple sclerosis, seizures, and brain tumors. The most important reason of dizziness is anemia following internal bleeding or hemorrhage during surgical procedure. The common symptoms in patients that suffer from dizziness are actual fainting, weakness, confusion, headache or head pressure, imbalance, facial numbness, pain of eye, changes or loss of vision, blind spots, dry mouth, and decreased hearing.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] One of the common complications in cardiac surgery is bleeding during surgery, ICU, and hospital stay. Anemic patients need red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in the preoperative phase. Without RBC transfusion, anemic patients suffer from insufficient hemoglobin to withstand hemodilution during off-pump myocardial revascularization bleeding.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] The common indications for transfusion include shortness of breath, dizziness, congestive heart failure, and decreased tolerance of exercise and actual blood loss of more than 30% of blood volume.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] According to probable complications of anemia in patients undergoing CABG, especially neurological disorders, this study was designed to evaluate the effect of transfusion on dizziness in anemic patients after elective off-pump CABG.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Our prospective randomized clinical trial was approved by the regional committee in our university. After receiving the written consent from patients (<italic>n</italic> = 90), they participated voluntarily for off-pump CABG surgery in the Afshar Cardiovascular Center of Yazd from January to June 2011. All of the operations were performed by a certain surgical team. The patients that had uttermost 2 days ICU stay and hemoglobin concentration from 7 to 10 g/dl undergoing elective off-pump CABG were enrolled in this study. The patients with more than 2 days ICU stay, death after 72 h from revascularization surgery, need for transfusion of more than two units after 48 h from surgery, emergency surgery, and patients suffered from congenital or acquired coagulation disorders were excluded from the study. 90 patients were enrolled 48 h after surgery and were randomly assigned into two groups: the experimental group (<italic>n</italic> = 47) that received packed red cell 250 ml, according to international instruction indexed in Kirklin/Barratt-Boyes Cardiac Surgery textbook, 3<sup>rd</sup> edition (two-volume set) for transfusion, was transfused two-unit packed cell in patients with Hb = 7-8 g/dl and one-unit packed cell in patients with Hb = 9-10 g/dl and the control group (<italic>n</italic> = 43) did not receive packed cell transfusion. The demographic variables and Hb concentration at 48 h, 72 h, and discharge time and evaluation of dizziness in 72h after transfusion were recorded. Regarding that dizziness is a term about lightheadedness, vertigo, confusion, headache, or head pressure, off balance, so, positive response to any of the above symptoms was considered as dizziness in patient. Our data were analyzed by SPSS15 software. We used ANOVA, Chi-square, and Fisher's exact test for quantitative and qualitative variables.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>90 patients with anemia enrolled in this study as possible candidates for CABG surgery. Of those, 50 cases (55.6%) were males and 40 cases (44.4%) were females. The demographic characteristics for our patients have been presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. Of all the participants, dizziness after 72 h from CABG surgery was observed in 35 cases (38.9%), 19 of whom were males (54.2%) and 16 (45.7%) of whom were females. There was not a significant relationship between sex and dizziness after CABG. The participants were divided into two age groups: less than 50 years old with the age average of 43 &#x000b1; 4 and above 50 years old with the age average of 57 &#x000b1; 5. Postoperative dizziness occurred in 16 cases (38%) out of 42 with less than 50 years of age while this occurred in 19 cases (39.5%) out of 48 equal or over 50 years. There was no significant relationship between age and increase in incidence of dizziness following CABG. In our patients, the significant stenosis of one, two, three, and left main coronary artery disease was 0 cases (0%), 15 cases (16.6%), 50 cases (56.2%), and 25 cases (28.1%), respectively. There were 6 cases (40%) of dizziness with two vessels, 21 cases (42%) with three vessels, and 8 cases (32%) of dizziness in those participants suffering from left main coronary artery disease. There was no significant relationship between the number of involved vessels and postoperative dizziness (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic characteristics of both groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AJTS-7-51-g001"/></table-wrap><p>Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels&#x02019; average before CABG was 12 &#x000b1; 1.64 g/dl and 39.3 &#x000b1; 5.25 g/dl, respectively.

Ferraris <italic>et al</italic>. reported that a history of utilization of anti-platelet drugs and a history of emergency surgery are predisposing factors for dizziness after surgery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] In our study, there is no significant relationship between some variables such as sex, EF, history of surgery, history of used anti-platelet or statins, or &#x003b1;-&#x003b2; blocker drugs, levels of urea and creatinine, and incidence of dizziness after CABG indicating the results in contrast with other studies.</p><p>There were 35 cases (38.9%) of new postoperative dizziness in this study: 8 cases (17%) were in the transfusion group and 27 cases (62.8) were in control group; therefore, our findings indicate that transfusion can significantly reduce dizziness after CABG compared to the control group without transfusion. Our results are similar to studies done by Tang <italic>et al</italic> and Haljan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>A study conducted by Karkouti <italic>et al</italic>. indicated that 302 patients (30%) of 1007 cases had undergone CABG need for transfusion;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] however, in our study, 52% of all patients received transfusion. In this study, the type of surgery was elective off-pump CABG; therefore, we could not determine the exact measure of need for transfusion compared to other studies that the type of surgery was on pump CABG.</p><p>In our study, the average level of hemoglobin at 72 h after surgery (24 h after transfusion) did not reveal any significant difference between the two groups, this thus being unexpected and the findings about hemoglobin level at 72 h post-operation was not in line with some of previous studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Reasons for fall in Hb after 72 h in both groups include the preoperative hemoglobin is lower than postoperative Hb, it takes time for the postoperative Hb to get to normal level by bone marrow, medical therapy through iron causes modifying anemia but with delay, and nutrition also has a delaying modifying anemia. In this study, we detected significant differences between both groups about level average of hemoglobin at the discharge time of hospital; therefore, this finding indicated delayed improvement in anemic patients treated with transfusion. We concluded that transfusion at 48 h after off-pump CABG in anemic patients with hemoglobin level from 7 g/dl to 10 g/dl reduced the incidence of dizziness after surgery; thereto, it improved anemia at the discharge time of the hospital. Thus, we recommend transfusion for anemic patients (Hb &#x0003c;10 g/dl) who are candidate for cardiac surgery.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of
