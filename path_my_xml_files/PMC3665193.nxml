In the multiplication of the human race, &#x0201c;woman has a pivotal role to play.&#x0201d; Menopause is generally defined as cessation of periods for 12 months or a period equivalent to 3 previous cycles or as time of cessation of ovarian function resulting in permanent amenorrhea.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] The menopause is thus a gradual and natural transitional phase of adjustment between the active and inactive ovarian function and occupies several years of a women's life and involves biological and psychological changes adjustments. This period is usually associated with unavoidable manifestation of aging process in women.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Most women experience near complete loss of production of estrogen by their mid-fifties.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] During reproductive years, women are protected by female hormones, i.e. estrogen and progesterone. With menopause, women enter an estrogen deficient phase in their lives, which accelerates the ageing process resulting into greater vulnerability to psychosomatic problems. Hot flushes, sweating, changes in mood and libido are some of the important outcomes affecting the quality of life (QoL) during climacterium in women. QoL covers physical, functional, emotional, social, and cognitive variables up to 85% of menopausal women.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Though, <italic>Rajonivritti</italic> as a diseased condition is not described separately in the classical Ayurveda texts, <italic>Rajonivritti Kala</italic> is mentioned by almost all <italic>Acharyas</italic> without any controversy.
