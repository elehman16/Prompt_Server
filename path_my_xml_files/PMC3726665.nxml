Intravenous L-arginine increases endothelial NO in moderately-severe malaria (MSM) without adverse effects. The safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of L-arginine or other agents to improve NO bioavailability in severe malaria have not been assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In an open-label pilot study of L-arginine in adults with severe malaria (ARGISM-1 Study), patients were randomized to 12 g L-arginine hydrochloride or saline over 8 hours together with intravenous artesunate. Vital signs, selected biochemical measures (including blood lactate and L-arginine) and endothelial NO bioavailability (using reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry [RH-PAT]) were assessed serially. Pharmacokinetic analyses of L-arginine concentrations were performed using NONMEM.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Six patients received L-arginine and two saline infusions. There were no deaths in either group. There were no changes in mean systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) or other vital signs with L-arginine, although a transient but clinically unimportant mean maximal decrease in SBP of 14 mmHg was noted. No significant changes in mean potassium, glucose, bicarbonate, or pH were seen, with transient mean maximal increases in plasma potassium of 0.3 mmol/L, and mean maximal decreases in blood glucose of 0.8 mmol/L and bicarbonate of 2.3 mEq/L following L-arginine administration. There was no effect on lactate clearance or RH-PAT index.

Adjunctive agents targeting underlying pathogenesis may be needed to further improve the outcome. Key mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of severe and fatal falciparum malaria are microvascular obstruction and impaired organ perfusion resulting from cytoadherence of parasitized red cells to activated endothelial cells, impaired microvascular reactivity and endothelial dysfunction associated with impaired bioavailability of endothelial nitric oxide <xref rid="pone.0069587-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0069587-Dondorp2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0069587-Yeo1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0069587-Yeo2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability is reduced in both African children with cerebral malaria <xref rid="pone.0069587-Anstey1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, and Asian and Melanesian adults with severe falciparum malaria <xref rid="pone.0069587-Yeo3" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.

Endothelial NO production relies on movement of L-arginine from the extracellular to intracellular compartment using the cationic amino acid transporter-1 (CAT-1) with a half-saturating concentration (<italic>Km</italic>) of 100&#x02013;150 &#x000b5;mol/L <xref rid="pone.0069587-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.

Based on the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic findings in moderately severe malaria, we conducted a study of intravenous L-arginine infusion in Indonesian adults with severe malaria (ARGISM-1 Study).

The ARGISM-1 study was conducted at Mitra Masyarakat Hospital, Timika, Papua, Indonesia, an area with unstable malaria transmission. Written informed consent was obtained from patients or relatives if they were comatose or too ill.

SM was defined as having &#x02265;1 modified WHO severity criteria including i) acute renal failure (creatinine&#x0003e;265 &#x000b5;mol/L), ii) hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin&#x0003e;50 &#x000b5;mol/L with either renal impairment (creatinine&#x0003e;130 &#x000b5;mol/L), or parasitemia of &#x02265;100,000/&#x000b5;L), iii) blackwater fever, iv) hyperparasitemia (&#x0003e;10% parasitized red cells), v) cerebral malaria (Glasgow Coma Score&#x0003c;11), vi) hypoglycemia (glucose&#x0003c;2.5 mmol/L), vi) respiratory distress (respiratory rate&#x0003e;32/min, and the presence of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> parasitemia as used previously <xref rid="pone.0069587-Yeo3" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0069587-Tran1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Clinical criteria for exclusion included pregnancy or breastfeeding, systolic blood pressure of &#x0003c;90 mmHg after fluid resuscitation, having received anti-malarials longer than 18 hours prior to admission, significant comorbidities (including diabetes mellitus, and pre-existing cardiac, renal or hepatic disease), known allergies to L-arginine, clinical evidence of bacterial infection, current use of spironolactone, oral nitrates, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, alpha-blocking antihypertensive agents, and L-arginine. Hematological and biochemical exclusions were hemoglobin levels of &#x0003c;60 g/L, venous potassium &#x0003e;5.5 meq/L, chloride &#x0003e;110 meq/L, and bicarbonate &#x0003c;15 meq/L.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study Design</title><p>All patients with suspected severe malaria were identified at the emergency department or outpatient clinics. On confirmation of severe malaria, patients were screened for any exclusion criteria, and if negative, informed consent was obtained. Patients were then randomized in a 2&#x02236;1 ratio to receive either L-arginine or placebo with allocation concealed in a sealed opaque envelope. The randomization sequence and envelopes were prepared by individuals not directly involved in the study. After randomization, patients underwent a standardized history and physical examination and were monitored in a high dependency unit for at least 24 hours after the start of intravenous L-arginine or saline infusion. L-arginine hydrochloride (Phebra, Sydney, Australia) was administered as a 12 g dose diluted to 10% in normal saline and given by an infusion pump over 8 hours, with a similar volume of normal saline being used in patients randomized to placebo. Patients had continuous electrocardiogram monitoring throughout and up to one hour after the end of the infusion. Vital signs including systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), respiratory rate (RR), pulse rate (PR), Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) and temperature were recorded at regular intervals during and after infusions. Oxygen saturation and blood methemoglobin concentrations were measured using a pulse co-oximeter (Masimo Rad 7, California). Hemoglobin and leukocyte counts were measured by Coulter counter at baseline and venous blood was drawn into lithium heparin tubes at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 12 and 24 hours after the start of infusion. A hand held biochemical analyzer (i-STAT Corp) was used to measure venous potassium, chloride, bicarbonate and lactate at these time points <xref rid="pone.0069587-Yeo7" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Endothelial function was measured non-invasively at 0, 1, 8, 9 and 24 hours by the change in pulse wave amplitude of the digits by peripheral arterial tonometry (EndoPAT) in response to reactive hyperemia, giving a RH-PAT Index as described previously <xref rid="pone.0069587-Yeo3" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The pulse wave amplitude in RH-PAT is at least 50% dependent on endothelial NO production and internal validation and repeatability of RH-PAT in this population have previously been reported <xref rid="pone.0069587-Yeo3" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0069587-Nohria1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. RH-PAT is also associated with lactate in severe malaria suggesting it may also reflect function in the systemic microvasculature <xref rid="pone.0069587-Yeo3" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. We also measured microvascular reactivity using near infrared resonance spectroscopy as previously described <xref rid="pone.0069587-Yeo2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. All patients were managed by non-study hospital physicians and treated with intravenous artesunate and antibiotics using standard hospital protocols and were followed up until discharge.</p><p>Pre-specified criteria for cessation of the infusions were extravasation, a decrease in the SBP of &#x0003e;25 mmHg from baseline or to below 80 mmHg, venous potassium of &#x02265;6.5 meq/L or ECG changes consistent with hyperkalemia, anaphylaxis, a venous blood glucose &#x0003c;3 mmol/L, bicarbonate &#x0003c;10 meq/L, pH &#x0003c;7.1 or methemoglobin level &#x0003e;12%.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>L-arginine Concentration Measurements</title><p>Venous blood was centrifuged within 20 minutes to obtain plasma and immediately stored at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C. Amino acids were extracted from 50 &#x000b5;l of plasma after the addition of 50 &#x000b5;l of an internal standard (norleucine) and 200 &#x000b5;l of cold ethanol. Deproteinized plasma was derivatized with AccQFluor reagent (Waters Corp., Milford, MA), and amino acids were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) as previously described <xref rid="pone.0069587-Yeo3" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The limits of detection were 1.6 &#x000b5;M, and the limit of quantification was 4.9 &#x000b5;M. Inter and intraday coefficient of variation was 4.1 and 1.2.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Population Pharmacokinetic Modelling</title><p>We used a model derived from a previous study of moderately severe malaria which was a two compartmental model with first order elimination <xref rid="pone.0069587-Yeo8" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, as an initial construct to explore the data from the patients with severe malaria. A first order conditional estimation method with interaction was used to analyse the data using NONMEM (version 6), with the G77 FORTRAN compiler. Model suitability was evaluated with standard goodness-of-fit criteria including objective function, parameter estimates, between-subject variability and diagnostic plots. Compartmental models were parameterized in terms of volumes of distribution (V), and clearances.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>Mean values of the vital signs and biochemical parameters before infusion were compared to mean values obtained during and after infusion using a paired t-test (for continuous variables with a normal distribution or variables log transformed to a normal distribution). If parameters were not normally distributed, values before and after infusion were compared by the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. Because analysis in this manner could mask transient but potentially clinically significant changes in a minority of subjects, we also analyzed the maximum change in the vital signs and biochemical markers at any time during and up to two hours after L-arginine infusion compared to baseline readings. This gave a &#x0201c;worst-case scenario&#x0201d;, however transient, for each marker. The mean of the pre-infusion values in each patient was subtracted from the lowest (SBP, DBP, glucose, bicarbonate, pH) and highest (pulse rate, respiratory rate, potassium, chloride and anion gap) measurement during infusion or in the two hours following infusion and expressed as mean maximum change. Relationships between maximum change and the dose weight ratio (calculated as mg/kg) were assessed by Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation coefficient (&#x003c1;). Sample size calculation estimated 20 patients should be randomized to L-arginine and 8 to saline to detect a 20 per cent difference in endothelial function. All analyses were performed with Stata 11 (Statacorp). A two sided value of p&#x0003c;0.05 was considered significant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Patients</title><p>Eight patients were enrolled in the study from 1<sup>st</sup> February 2008 to 28<sup>th</sup> February 2009; six received L-arginine and two, saline <bold>(</bold>

In patients who received L-arginine, four had one severity criterion (three with cerebral malaria and one with hyperbilirubinemia), one had two criteria (acute renal failure and hyperbilirubinemia) and one had four severity criteria (cerebral malaria, acute renal failure, hyperbilirubinemia, and blackwater fever). In those who received saline, one patient had one severity criterion (cerebral malaria) and one had four criteria (cerebral malaria, respiratory distress, hyperbilirubinemia, and hyperparasitemia).

In this study L-arginine was given intravenously to adults with severe falciparum malaria at the dose of 12 g over 8 hours. There were no clinically significant adverse effects on symptoms, vital signs, selected biochemical measures and acid base status. No improvements in lactate clearance time or endothelial function were noted, though only 4 of 6 patients who received L-arginine had abnormal baseline values for lactate and endothelial function. Pharmacokinetic analysis of L-arginine demonstrated the clearance was approximately 40% higher in severe malaria, with concentrations lower than those predicted from a previous model developed in moderately severe malaria <xref rid="pone.0069587-Yeo8" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. However, the small numbers of patients in each group do not permit us to make definite conclusions.</p><p>The effects of L-arginine in decreasing blood pressure are thought to be due to increased endothelial nitric oxide (NO) production <xref rid="pone.0069587-Nakaki1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The lack of decrease in mean blood pressure with L-arginine infused at 1.5 g/hour contrasted with the findings from our previous study in MSM where 12 g was given at a rate of 24 g/hour. In that study, a decrease in the mean systolic and diastolic pressure was noted towards the end of the 12 g but not the 3 g or 6 g infusions. However, our results are in agreement with a study of adult sepsis given L-arginine at 1.1 g/hour for 3 days <xref rid="pone.0069587-Luiking1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, where no hemodynamic effects were reported. In contrast to the lack of change in mean systolic BP, there was a transient but statistically significant change in mean maximal decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure following L-arginine infusion. Both were highly correlated with the L-arginine dose/body weight ratio, suggesting a transient dose-related increase in NO production.</p><p>Consistent with our previous study, there was no statistically significant change in the mean plasma potassium concentrations, but a transient and statistically significant but clinically unimportant mean maximal increase in potassium concentration in patients given L-arginine compared to pre-infusion levels. The mean maximal ranges of increase were 0.2 to 0.7 meq/L and no patient had a potassium concentration higher than 5 meq/L, including the patients with acute renal failure. This was comparable to increases previously seen in patients with moderately-severe malaria given 6 g over 30 minutes but lower than those given 12 g in the same time period <xref rid="pone.0069587-Yeo7" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The increase is thought to result from increased L-arginine uptake by the cells with subsequent movement of intracellular potassium to the extracellular space <xref rid="pone.0069587-Dickerman1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. There was also a statistically significant but clinically unimportant mean maximal decrease in glucose concentration, but again not when mean change was evaluated. These changes were again consistent with those seen in our previous study and were not close to the range where replacement is required. The lack of a clear dose relationship between L-arginine for both the maximal increase in potassium and the decrease in glucose may also indicate that L-arginine was not causal and that other mechanisms may be involved.</p><p>The only commercially available intravenous L-arginine formulation is the hydrochloride form which contains 4.75 meq of hydrogen and chloride ions per gram. In MSM patients, there was a dose-dependent relationship between L-arginine with decreases in bicarbonate and pH, and an increase in chloride <xref rid="pone.0069587-Yeo7" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In this pilot study, patients with metabolic acidosis with bicarbonate concentrations of less than 15 meq/L were excluded. There was a transient statistically significant decrease in bicarbonate concentrations in the maximal but not mean change following L-arginine infusion. There was also a significant but clinically unimportant mean maximal increase in chloride of 2.8 mmol/L compared to baseline, although this was not different to the 2.5 mmol/L change seen in those given saline. The lack of change in the pH and lactate suggest that the effect on overall acid base status was clinically unimportant. The stable anion gap and increase in chloride suggests the bicarbonate decrease was due to hydrogen and chloride contained in the L-arginine. Other agents used to increase NO bioavailability such as inhaled NO, can increase methemoglobin <xref rid="pone.0069587-Rossaint1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. No increase in methemoglobin was seen following L-arginine infusion.</p><p>We did not find any improvement in the lactate clearance time, and in contrast to our study in MSM, there was no increase in endothelial NO production <xref rid="pone.0069587-Yeo3" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Previously, L-arginine was given in MSM over 30 minutes in ascending doses at rates of 6 g/hour to 24 g/hour compared to the 1.5 g/hour rate in this study in severe malaria. Simulations from a pharmacokinetic model of L-arginine infusion developed in MSM predicted that the dose used in the current study would deliver L-arginine concentrations above the <italic>Km</italic> of the CAT-1 transporter in 70% of the patients <xref rid="pone.0069587-Yeo8" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. However, pharmacokinetic analysis in SM showed that the concentrations achieved in the current study were 40 percent lower than expected. This may be due to the increased plasma arginase concentrations found in SM compared to MSM <xref rid="pone.0069587-Yeo3" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, and may have contributed to the lack of endothelial response. Other factors could play a role in reducing vascular NO bioavailability in SM compared to MSM, including increased concentrations of the endogenous NOS inhibitor asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA) <xref rid="pone.0069587-Yeo6" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, and increased NO quenching by cell-free hemoglobin <xref rid="pone.0069587-Yeo5" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The adequacy of concentrations of the NOS cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin, in severe malaria also requires further investigation. Our results suggest that future studies of L-arginine in SM will require an increase in the dosage.</p><p>The structural model derived from moderately severe malaria appears to describe the data in severe malaria accurately. Although the small numbers of patients in whom pharmacokinetic assessment was possible limited the ability to determine accurate estimates of pharmacokinetic parameters, typical population values of CL and V appeared to be &#x0223c;40% and &#x0223c;400% larger for patients with severe malaria compared to the previous study in MSM <xref rid="pone.0069587-Yeo8" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Limitations in available subjects may have led to potential bias in the values of the parameters. It is likely that dose adjustment may be needed in patients with SM compared to MSM.</p><p>In summary, a 12 g dose of L-arginine infused at 1.5 g/hour for 8 hours in patients with SM was safe, well tolerated and resulted in statistically significant but transient and clinically insignificant effects on mean maximal change in systolic blood pressure, potassium, glucose, bicarbonate and chloride compared to pre-infusion levels. Although numbers were small and there were only modest baseline abnormalities in lactate concentrations and endothelial function, no improvement in lactate clearance or endothelial function were seen. Notably plasma L-arginine concentrations following infusion appeared to be 40 percent lower than predicted. Future studies in SM will require an increase in the dosage of L-arginine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0069587.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>
