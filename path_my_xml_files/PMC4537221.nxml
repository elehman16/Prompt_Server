As such, certain subjects, e.g. children, prisoners, pregnant women, mentally disabled persons, economically or educationally disadvantaged persons may be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence. In addition, children or adults with cognitive deficits may find it difficult to understand the implications of research may therefore not be able to fully evaluate consent information [<xref rid="pone.0135997.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Therefore, distinctive safeguards are included in subparts of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (45CFR46, subparts B&#x02013;D) to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects [<xref rid="pone.0135997.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135997.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Also the Declaration of Helsinki stresses the need of special protection for vulnerable groups and individuals: &#x0201c;Medical research with a vulnerable group is only justified if the research is responsive to the health needs or priorities of this group and the research cannot be carried out in a non-vulnerable group. In addition, this group should stand to benefit from the knowledge, practices or interventions that result from the research&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0135997.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A guidance document especially for clinical trials with the pediatric population was published by the European Commission [<xref rid="pone.0135997.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Similar to the FDA who provides specific guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors with regard to clinical trials as well as informed consent information sheets conducted in the U.S. [<xref rid="pone.0135997.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], the European Commission publishes &#x0201c;The rules governing medicinal products in the European Union&#x0201d; that contain guidance documents applying to clinical trials [<xref rid="pone.0135997.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>In the European Union (EU), legally mandatory timelines for ethics review process are 60 days for studies involving medicinal products (EU Directive 2001/20/EC) and studies involving medical devices (Council Directive 93/42/EEC) [<xref rid="pone.0135997.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135997.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. For all other miscellaneous clinical studies, there are no legally mandated timelines. The precise knowledge of timelines and focus from institutional review boards to proposed miscellaneous clinical research protocols can be helpful in the planning and execution these trials. The purpose of this paper is to analyze a) the timelines of various IRBs&#x02019; assessments of research protocols involving vulnerable populations, b) the focus of IRB feedback to research protocols involving vulnerable populations c) contributing factors that can help explaining the heterogeneities in IRB responses to miscellaneous clinical studies outside of the two EU Directives.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>We submitted two different multicenter studies involving vulnerable populations to various IRBs in Germany (N = 34) and Austria (N = 1). Study 1 was a prospective, cross-sectional screening study of a symptomatic pediatric population at risk for an inborn error of metabolism conducted at 29 clinical trial centers. In this study, patients with abdominal pain or pain in the extremities were screened for Fabry disease. Pediatric patients under 18 years were eligible. Whereas males were tested through an enzymatic assay, the study involved genetic testing in females. Target enrolment were N = 2000 patients. The trial was registered on clinicaltrials.gov under <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02152189">NCT02152189</ext-link>.

The study was planned at 20 clinical trial centers. Males and females between 18 and 80 years were eligible. The study was registered as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02135926">NCT02135926</ext-link> on clinicaltrials.gov.

The median time-to-final decision for both protocols was 38.5 (range 0 to 139) days. Variation in response IRB time is not uncommon. McWilliams et al. carried out a multicenter genetic epidemiology study in cystic fibrosis involving children and adults and reported their experience with 31 IRBs in the United States. Twenty-four IRBs conducted a full review and 7 IRBs considered this study to be of minimal risk and permitted an expedited review process. The mean time for IRB approval in an expedited review was 32.2 days (range 9&#x02013;72 day) and for a full review 81.9 days (range 13&#x02013;252 days) [<xref rid="pone.0135997.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Stair and colleagues published a median time-to-IRB approval of 38 days (IQR 26&#x02013;62 days) for an interventional multicenter clinical study involving children and adults with asthma at 44 centers in the U.S. [<xref rid="pone.0135997.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Mansbach reported a median time from initial submission to final approval of 42 days (IQR, 27&#x02013;61 d) for a prospective, observational study in children presenting with bronchiolitis to emergency departments conducted at 34 centers across the United States [<xref rid="pone.0135997.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Of interest, studies in vulnerable populations like the two present protocols do not necessarily require a longer time to approval as illustrated by the data from a study by Green at al. Here, the researchers conducted a multicenter observational study related to guideline adherence in diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypertension in 43 Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers in the U.S. Median time to approval for this protocol in common diseases at the various IRBs was 248 days [<xref rid="pone.0135997.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The request for changes in the present two protocols was focused on the informed consent document, which shows that IRBs fulfill their mission to protect human subjects. Whereas 43% (N = 15/35) of IRBs requested changes to the informed consent documents (N = 15/35, i.e. 43%), very few only (N = 4) asked for changes to the study protocol. This number is lower than in other studies reported in the literature. In the study by Stair et. al, 91% of IRBs requested changes in the consent form, but only 43% of IRBs requested changes to the interventional asthma research protocol [<xref rid="pone.0135997.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In contrast, in the observational bronchiolitis study by Mansbach, the same amount of changes (56%) was required for research protocol and consent form changes by 62% of the IRBs [<xref rid="pone.0135997.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>One issue that arose in the submission process was the complexity of format and nature of information required that varied among the different IRBs. As a primary source of transparency and information, the internet presentations of the different IRBs were considered and evaluated.

IRB workflows and decision times varied substantially. Some IRBs accepted a previous IRB decision without the necessity of another reevaluation process. Requested changes focused on the informed consent documents. The strategy with initial submissions to the IRBs at the coordinating site followed by subsequent multicenter submission with the initial positive vote was helpful to reduce the number of changes. The median time-to-final decision for both protocols was 38.5 (range 0 to 139) days. Knowledge of IRB workflows and decision times is helpful for site selection strategies, although the plethora of forms, standards, and local work-flows render submissions of multicenter research protocols complex. A more standardized approach across jurisdictions is desirable.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all the participating IRBs and their members who volunteer their time to enable and support clinical research.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0135997.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research.
