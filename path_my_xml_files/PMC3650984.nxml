Fatigue, cognitive impairment, irritability, inattentiveness, difficulty concentrating, behavioral problems, poor test performance, and absenteeism are among the causes of poor school performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. A recent study of adolescents in the United Kingdom found that students who had AR were 40% more likely to drop a grade in their school examinations between winter and summer than healthy students,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and Sundberg et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] noted that severe nasal symptoms were associated with lower grades in Swedish adolescents. The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &#x00026; Immunology has estimated that children in the United States lose 2 million school days a year as a result of AR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The guidelines issued by the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma Workshop Group do not recommend the use of first-generation sedating antihistamines--such as diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine, and brompheniramine--for the treatment of AR because, in part, of their marked sedative effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The US Food and Drug Administration Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee recently recommended that over-the-counter cold and cough medications, some of which contain first-generation antihistamines, not be used in children aged 2 to 5 years. In a review of its records, the US Food and Drug Administration found 69 reports of deaths associated with antihistamine medicines containing diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine, or brompheniramine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Nonsedating second-generation antihistamines are recommended for use in adults and adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma Workshop Group and the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology guidelines for pediatric patients are generally similar to those for older patients, but they are less specific when discussing the treatment of children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].

Nasal congestion is often the only presenting symptom of AR in children. Desloratadine, a nonsedating second-generation antihistamine, has demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of AR symptoms in adults and adolescents,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and results of an uncontrolled efficacy trial suggest that it is effective in children aged 6 to 12 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled safety studies have shown that desloratadine is safe and well tolerated in children as young as 6 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Although the prevalence of pediatric AR in Latin America has not been extensively studied, AR may affect 40% or more children in the United States by the age of 6 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Data drawn from patient questionnaires and physician examinations in North America and western Europe suggest that seasonal AR affects 15% to 22% of adolescents. In some studies, perennial AR is estimated to affect only about 1% to 8% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In Latin American study centers (defined as a city or a specified geographic area) participating in the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood, the percentage of children who reported AR symptoms during the previous 12 months ranged from 21% in Panama to 42% in Argentina among 6- to 7-year olds, and from 16% in Chile to 67% in Paraguay among 13- to 14-year olds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. A trial conducted in 13- to 14-year olds in Brazil during 2002 found that 29% were current AR sufferers, and that the monthly prevalence of AR peaked during the winter months of June, July, and August [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Because the frequency of AR varies widely among countries primarily because of environmental factors, determining patient response to medications in different geographic areas is important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].

Subjects aged 6 to 12 years who had a physician-confirmed diagnosis of either seasonal or perennial AR were included. The individual diagnosis, initiation of treatment, and the necessary monitoring and follow-up visits depended on the underlying medical condition and the treatment prescribed, according to the physician's routine practice. If the subject or his/her guardian agreed to participate in the study, treatment with desloratadine was initiated, and clinical data were prospectively collected.</p><p>At the enrollment (baseline) visit, investigators collected demographic data, including a personal and/or family history of other atopic/allergic conditions and a list of AR triggers; the severity of nasal AR symptoms was determined using a questionnaire. Eligible subjects took desloratadine syrup 2.5 mg/d (5 mL) for 6 weeks after the baseline visit. Concomitant corticosteroid therapy (inhaled, oral, or intranasal) was permitted on an as-needed basis during the study period.</p><p>Subjects returned for a second (final) study visit at the end of the treatment period. The use of all concomitant medications, including corticosteroids, was documented at this visit, and efficacy assessments were made. Any adverse events (AEs), regardless of whether they were related to study medication, were recorded at this time as well.</p><p>Study protocol and informed consent forms were approved by the institutional review board for each medical center. The study was conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and under the principles of the Helsinki Declaration.

The questionnaire was completed by the investigators at the baseline and final visits. Scores from the 2 assessments of the 4 symptoms were added to obtain the total TSS4 score.

A study of Brazilian adolescents found that prevalence of diagnosed AR increased by 37% from 1996 to 2002,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] a rise that is consistent with previous reports in other countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>Allergic rhinitis symptoms can impair a child's school performance and affect behavior influenced by sleep disruption. Some of these impairments may be related to nasal congestion, which both adults and children consider the most bothersome symptom of AR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In a large survey of adults in the United States (N = 2355) who had AR or cared for a child with AR, 61% of caregivers reported that nasal congestion caused by AR affected their child's performance at school; the most common effects were poor productivity or inability to concentrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The same survey reported that nasal congestion caused night-time awakening and difficulty falling asleep in nearly 50% of children. Another large survey (N = 4927) found that adults who consistently experienced nighttime congestion related to AR were twice as likely to report habitual snoring, chronic excessive daytime sleepiness, and non-restorative sleep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Therefore, medications used to treat AR should be nonsedating and not cause additional cognitive impairments.</p><p>In the present study conducted in 5 Latin American countries, most of the children enrolled (61%) had perennial AR. Subjects identified house dust and pet dander as the most frequent triggers of their symptoms, and 21% had a history of asthma. Indoor allergens also exacerbate asthma, and this result underscores the need for a comprehensive therapeutic strategy that includes environmental control measures in addition to an effective therapeutic agent.</p><p>The results of this study indicate that desloratadine is an efficacious and safe treatment choice for Latin American children with perennial or seasonal AR. Desloratadine therapy significantly reduced nasal congestion in all subjects (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001); similar decreases were noted for rhinorrhea, nasal pruritus, and sneezing. Nearly all of the caregivers rated symptoms of AR as "better" or "much better" at the end of treatment. The response in the overall patient population and groups treated with desloratadine alone or desloratadine plus corticosteroids was comparable (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001 for all groups), indicating that concomitant corticosteroid therapy did not have an additional therapeutic or detrimental effect on AR symptoms.</p><p>Good tolerability in a pediatric population predominantly affected by perennial AR is important because unlike seasonal AR, which can be treated with a short course of therapy during the pollen season, perennial AR generally requires long-term treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Subjects in this trial reported a low incidence of all AEs (6%), and desloratadine was safe and well tolerated.</p><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate improvement in only the symptoms of AR. For this reason, the conclusion--that there is no difference in outcome whether desloratadine is used alone or with intranasal corticosteroids--should be considered with some caution. Additional studies are needed before deciding that Latin American children with AR can be treated as effectively with desloratadine monotherapy as with combination therapy.</p><p>The results of this open-label, observational, multi-center study show that symptoms of AR, including nasal congestion, were improved with desloratadine therapy in this group of pediatric subjects.
