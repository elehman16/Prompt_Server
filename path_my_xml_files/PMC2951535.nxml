Method : Eligible and consenting patients were randomly allocated to the ECT or Sham ECT groups. Both received antipsychotic drugs.Twenty-five patients completed the study (ECT, n= IS; Sham ECT, n= 10).The study was conducted in a double-blind manner. Clinical change was assessed weekly with BPRS, CGI and adverse event measures.ANOVA for repeated measures and other post-hoc comparisons were used for data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title> Results:</title><p>ECT treated patients improved significantly over successive weeks (p&#x0003c; 0.002) after 6 ECTs, whereas the group receiving sham-ECT did not In both the groups, however, CGI scores did not change significantly, suggesting a dissociated response pattern. ECT was associated with greater relief among carers and lower rehospitalization.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion :</title><p>ECT augmentation may well have a significant impact on the clinical course of patients with treatment resistance schizophrenia. It is unclear, but possible, that these changes may be reinforced and maintained by maintenance ECTs. Replication of the present investigation and further studies on maintenance ECT would be rewarding.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Electroconvulsive therapy</kwd><kwd>Treatment Resistant Schizophrenia</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></article>
