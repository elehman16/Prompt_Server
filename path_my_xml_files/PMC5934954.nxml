In China, the prevalence of HTN is reported to be 27%.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] A survey conducted in 2003 in the US, Europe, and Canada reported 28% (lowest) prevalence of HTN in the US countries and 44% (highest) in the European countries.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In India, highest prevalence of HTN in urban population is men 44% and women 45% found in Mumbai (survey report reported in years 1999) and lowest 14% in Chennai (survey report reported in years 2000).[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Cause of HTN is believed to be the complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Environmental factor includes urban lifestyle characterized by sedentary job, psychological stress, junk food consisting of high-calorie, salt and less fiber food.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>These causes contribute to autonomic imbalance, characterized by reduced vagal tone and increased sympathetic activity. As the lifestyle is a major cause of HTN and lifestyle modification, intervention plays a major role in management and cure of HTN.</p><p>Yoga is a holistic science, discovered and developed by ancient Indian sages around 5000 years back. It is a tradition of lifestyle, health, and spirituality.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Yoga consists of several mind&#x02013;body practices including physical postures, breathing techniques, and meditation. Several scientific investigations have demonstrated the health benefiting effects of yoga practice in healthy and diseased conditions.

IAYT was designed by Dr. Nagaratna R, Medical Consultant, with experience in yoga therapy. Previous studies on IAYT showed its potential role in the management of various chronic health problems such as chronic low back pain, osteoarthritis, asthma, and anxiety. This study is the first attempt to assess the efficacy of IAYT in HTN.</p><p>Yoga intervention has shown to be effective in improving various cardiovascular parameters in hypertensive and cardiac conditions.</p><p>A systematic review by Hagins <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013, reported that yoga is an effective intervention in reducing BP in HTN.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In our study, we also found significant improvement in BP after 1 week of IAYT.</p><p>Very few studies have assessed efficacy of yoga on BRS in HTN. An immediate effect study showed that slow breathing at 6 breaths/min improves BRS in healthy volunteers.</p><p>In another study by Bowman <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997, 6 weeks of yoga intervention improved BRS in elderly persons, whereas practice of aerobic exercises for the same duration in similar population did not improve BRS.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Similarly, we also found a significant improvement in BRS, but the duration of intervention was shorter in our study than previous study and previous studies were of healthy persons.</p><p>In another study by Parshad, 2011, 64 healthy students of average age 21.3 years underwent 6 weeks of yoga practice (1 session/week); postintervention, a significant decrease in SBP, DBP, MAP, CO, SV, and TPVR was observed.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>In our study, we also observed a significant reduction in TPVR, but we did not find improvement in CO and SV, probably because 1 week of intervention may not be sufficient to bring an improvement in left ventricular hypertrophy due to which there was no improvement in CO and SV. The intervention period was lesser in our study and the previous study was in healthy students.
