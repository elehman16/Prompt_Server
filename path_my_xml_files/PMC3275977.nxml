Transcutaneous oximetry (TCOM) is used for wound assessment. We undertook a randomized prospective controlled trial to evaluate the role of HBOT in healing of chronic nonhealing wounds and to determine whether TCOM predicts healing.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>This study was conducted in 30 consenting patients with nonhealing ulcer. The patients were randomized into group HT (receiving HBOT in addition to conventional treatment) and group CT (receiving only conventional treatment). Duration of treatment in both the groups was 30 days. Wound ulcer was analyzed based on size of the wound, exudates, presence of granulation tissue, and wound tissue scoring. Tissue oxygenation (TcPO<sub>2</sub>) was measured on 0, 10<sup>th</sup>, 20<sup>th</sup>, and 30<sup>th</sup> day.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>There was 59% reduction in wound area in group HT and 26% increase in wound area in group CT. Ten patients in group HT showed improvement in wound score as compared to five patients in group CT. Complete healing was seen in three patients in group HT as compared to none in group CT. Surgical debridement was required in 6 patients in group HT and 10 patients in group CT. One patient in group HT required amputation as compared to five patients in group CT. A positive correlation was found between TcPO<sub>2</sub> value and various markers of wound healing.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>HBOT has a definitive adjunctive role in the management of chronic nonhealing ulcers. It decreases the amputation rate and improves patient outcome. Periwound TcPO<sub>2</sub> may be used as a predictor of response to HBOT and has a positive correlation with wound healing.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy</kwd><kwd>nonhealing wounds</kwd><kwd>transcutaneous oximetry</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic nonhealing wound are common and have a high impact on the well-being of those affected.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] They are often associated with diabetes mellitus, arterial, and venous disease. Increased oxygen demand, requiring sufficient supply of blood, is there during ulcer healing.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is a systemic treatment option, wherein a patient breathes pure oxygen at greater than one atmospheric pressure for a specified period of time. Therapeutic effects of HBOT are due to an increase in dissolved oxygen in plasma and tissue oxygen delivery. At 2.5 absolute atmosphere (ATA), partial pressure of oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>) increases from 760 mmHg at room air to 1900 mmHg, on breathing in 100% oxygen, and the plasma content of oxygen increases from 0.3 to 5.62 volume-percent. HBOT promotes healing in chronic nonhealing wounds by means of its antiedema effect, augmenting neovascularization, stimulating fibroblast proliferation and differentiation, increasing collagen formation and cross linking, and stimulating leukocyte microbial killing.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Although HBOT has gained popularity as an adjunctive treatment for problem wounds, there are only few randomized controlled studies that support its efficacy.</p><p>Transcutaneous oximetry (TCOM) is a simple, reliable noninvasive technique for the objective assessment of wound perfusion and oxygenation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Its definitive role in predicting the wound healing has not yet been proven. We undertook a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the role of HBOT in healing of chronic nonhealing wounds and to determine whether TCOM predicts healing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This prospective randomized controlled study was conducted after the approval of the institutional research and ethical committee. Patients referred from surgical specialties to the hyperbaric oxygen unit of the Department of Anaesthesiology, with the complaint of chronic nonhealing ulcer, were included in the study. Patients in the age group of 18&#x02013;65 years of either sex with a nonhealing ulcer, despite conventional therapy of more than 4 weeks duration, were included in the study. Patients who were not willing for HBOT, those with active upper respiratory tract infection, with any active lung pathology or pregnancy were excluded from the study. Written informed consent was obtained from all the patients.</p><p>Investigations including complete hemogram, random blood sugar, electrocardiogram, and X-ray chest were reviewed. Duration of wound, associated medical illness including history of smoking, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and the type of treatment received and advised were recorded. Ear, nose, throat examination was performed by an Otorhinolaryngologist to rule out upper respiratory tract infection and inflammation of tympanic membrane. Local examination of the wound was done and the size (length and width), number, site, color of the surrounding skin, type of wound, discharge, vascular insufficiency, or associated varicose vein were recorded. Doppler examination was performed to confirm vascular insufficiency.</p><p>Thirty consenting patients were randomized by computer-generated random numbers into two groups. Group HT patients received HBOT in addition to conventional treatment, while Group CT patients received only conventional treatment. Duration of treatment in both the groups was 30 days. All the patients received conventional therapy for the management of wounds, i.e., wound debridement, treating infection, daily dressing, etc., which was managed by the referring surgeon. In group HT patients, HBOT was administered at 2.5ATA in a &#x0201c;monoplace&#x0201d; chamber [Bara-Med monoplace hyperbaric chamber, Biomedical systems, Environmental Tectonics Corporation, Southampton, PA, USA) for 90 min, 6 days a week. A total of 30 sessions were administered to each patient along with conventional treatment.</p><p>Wound ulcer was analyzed on 0, 10th, 20th, and 30th day and assessment of healing in both the groups was performed on the basis of size of the wound [area of wound (sq cm) was obtained by product of the greatest length (cm) and greatest width (cm)], exudates (an estimate of ulcer was assessed on the presence or absence of exudates), presence of granulation tissue and wound tissue scoring [the wound (ulcer) bed was scored on a score of 0&#x02013;4] [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>The wound (ulcer) bed scoring</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOACP-28-70-g001"/></table-wrap><p>TCM 400/TINA using Miniature Clark electrode (Tina TCM 400 Transcutaneous pO<sub>2</sub> monitoring system, Radiometer Copenhagen, Bronshoj, Denmark) was utilized for measuring tissue oxygenation (TcPO<sub>2</sub>) in all the patients of both groups. Measurements were recorded on noninflammed skin 1 cm proximal to the upper margin of ulcer. TcPO<sub>2</sub> values were recorded on 0, 10th, 20th, and 30th day. TcPO2 was measured by an electrochemical transducer, which was fixed to the skin with the help of an adhesive ring and contact liquid supplied by the manufacturer. The measuring site was cleaned carefully by a disinfectant (chlorhexidine-spirit). The skin oxygen partial pressure was determined by measuring the oxygen reduction current by means of a measuring cell. To increase the permeability of the skin to oxygen molecules at the measuring site, the transducer is heated to 44&#x000b0;C. The calibration period was on an average 10 min, and the TcPO<sub>2</sub> signal was continuously recorded.</p><p>Patients requiring surgical debridement/amputation were noted. Any side effects related to HBOT were also noted.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary outcome variable was the wound size. Sample size of 30 patients was based on the predicted difference of 25% in the wound area in the two groups of treatment modality. Data were analyzed using SPSS Version 15.0. For quantitative variables, student <italic>t</italic>- test for independent samples was applied to test the difference amongst the averages of the quantitative data of the two groups. Paired <italic>t</italic>-test was applied to compare the difference between the means. For qualitative data, the chi square test, Fischer exact test, and Wilcoxon signed rank test were applied to test the difference amongst the two groups. Kendall's tau b test was applied for correlating periwound TcPO<sub>2</sub> with various parameters of wound healing. Nonparametric Mann Whitney U test was applied for comparing duration of wound as it had non Gaussian distribution.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>Forty-six patients were recruited for the study but only 30 patients fulfilled the study criteria and were randomized in the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> consort chart).

Only one patient in our study had in-chamber TcPO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c; 400mmHg and this patient (from group HT) had vascular insufficiency. He did not respond to treatment and had to undergo amputation. Statistical significance of this could not be calculated, and therefore, we cannot comment upon the in-chamber TcPO<sub>2</sub> values as a predictor of response.</p><p>10 out of 15 patients in group HT showed signs of healing compared to 5 out of 15 patients in group CT which corroborates with the findings of the study by Kalani <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>Complications reported in patients treated with HBOT include ear pain (17%) and generalized seizures (0.5%).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] In our study, the most common adverse effect with HBOT was pressure related ear discomfort/pain (20%), followed by claustrophobia (13%). No cases of seizure or pneumothorax were observed in our study.</p><p>The limitations of our study were that long-term impact of HBOT on wound healing was not studied beyond 30 days and that we included patients having ulcers due to different causes. However, the two groups were comparable.</p><p>We conclude that HBOT has a definitive adjunctive role in the management of chronic nonhealing ulcers. Problem wounds require multidisciplinary, aggressive, and a combined approach including administration of HBOT. Administration of HBOT along with conventional treatment decreases the amputation rate and improves patient outcome. Periwound TcPO<sub>2</sub> values may be used as a predictor of response to HBOT and have a positive correlation with respect to wound healing. No serious adverse effects have been observed with HBOT.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lipsky</surname><given-names>BA</given-names></name><name><surname>Berendt</surname><given-names>AR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for diabetic foot wounds.
