People with HVFD often report difficulty detecting obstacles located in the blind periphery in time when moving around. This may result in feelings of insecurity and even in collisions and may have a serious impact on participation in society [<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Several training programs have been developed aimed at optimal compensation for the HVFD by adapting eye movements. One of these, the IH-CST (InSight-Hemianopia Compensatory Scanning Training), trains patients to apply a systematic, wide horizontal scanning rhythm. Recently, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) [<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] showed that the IH-CST specifically improves detection of peripheral stimuli and avoiding obstacles when moving around, especially in dual task situations. No evidence was found for an improvement in visual functions (including visual field size), reading or searching for targets on a display.</p><p>In this paper, the within-group effects of the IH-CST are analyzed in a larger patient group than in the previously reported RCT [<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Performance of patients with HVFD at the pre-assessment and post-assessment are compared with the performance of a healthy control group. The results of a follow-up assessment are reported, as well as the associations between subjective and objective performance. Furthermore, it will be examined whether the changes between the pre-assessment and post-assessment can be predicted by certain factors. As concluded in a recent systematic review of the literature on HVFD [<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], more research is needed on the predictive variables of training effects. Knowing which variables are related to the effects of training would enable rehabilitation workers to deploy the best rehabilitation program for the individual patient. This may improve efficacy of rehabilitation. The potentially predictive variables are selected for their clinical relevance. In a rehabilitation setting, it is often questioned whether training effects can be predicted by demographic characteristics, variables related to the visual disorder, and neuropsychological test results [<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In short, the aim of the present study is to examine the effects of IH-CST in terms of subjective and objective mobility-related measures, including the long-term effects and the influence of several factors on the effect of training.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Descriptions of the participant recruitment, training protocol and assessment measures are described in more detail elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><sec id="sec007"><title>Ethics</title><p>The Medical Research Ethics Committee of the University Medical Center Groningen (registration number METc 2010/078) and the relevant patient organizations approved the study protocol. The study was performed in accordance with the 2008 Declaration of Helsinki. Informed written consent was provided by all participants.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Participant recruitment</title><p>Patients with a unilateral HVFD caused by acquired postchiasmatic brain injury were recruited at Royal Dutch Visio and Bartim&#x000e9;us, the two centers of expertise for blind and partially sighted people in the Netherlands. Patients were included if standardized ophthalmological testing confirmed the presence of a HVFD, existing for at least five months, minimum binocular visual acuity of Snellen 0.5 (6/12 or 20/40, LogMAR 0.3) and intact eye and head motility. A stable neurological and ophthalmological condition was required and patients had to be able to walk at least 50 meters independently. Furthermore, standardized neuropsychological testing was performed at Royal Dutch Visio or Bartim&#x000e9;us, in order to examine visual perceptual functions as well as cognitive status. Patients with severe (neuro)psychological disorders, such as neglect, or psychiatric conditions, such as anxiety disorders, were excluded from participation in the study. The MMSE score had to be &#x02265; 24. The results from this neuropsychological testing were collected for further analyses in case the patient was included in the study.</p><p>Healthy control participants responded to public announcements and received a financial incentive. Inclusion criteria for the healthy control group were the absence of visual, physical, neurological or psychological impairments, as confirmed by the participants during an interview. A binocular visual acuity of at least Snellen 0.8 (6/7.5 or 20/25, LogMAR 0.1) was required and their MMSE score had to be &#x02265; 24. Healthy control participants were selected in such a way that the distributions of age (mean, standard deviation and range) and education (proportional distribution of participants over education levels) for the control group were similar to the patient group.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Design</title><p>Patients were assessed in the week before onset of training (T-pre) and after 13 weeks of training (T-post). More specifically, time between T-pre and T-post was filled with an introductory meeting in which the patient and occupational therapist agreed on the specific goals for training, followed by 10 weeks of training, and some spare time for delay. Training was extended with a number of sessions after T-post, i.e. outside the scope of this study, in case the individual mobility goals were not fully reached after 13 weeks of training. During a follow-up assessment (FU) six to ten months after T-post, questionnaires were administered measuring the impact of the HVFD on daily living. The scanning and mobility-related tests included in T-pre and T-post were also administered in a healthy control group. The healthy controls performed these tests however only once. Comparing performance of patients before and after training to the performance of a healthy control group puts the performance and improvement of the patients in perspective of a bench-mark.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Relation to RCT analysis</title><p>The participants described in this report are the same as described in the article on the RCT [<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0166310.g001">Fig 1</xref> presents the full study design.</p><fig id="pone.0166310.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0166310.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Full study design.</title><p><sup>a</sup> Neuropsychological testing in the inclusion phase including Mini Mental State Examination [<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], Trailmaking Test [<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], Complex Figure of Rey [<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; <sup>b</sup> including the neuropsychological tests Nederlandse Leestest voor Volwassenen [<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and 15 Word Test [<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]; <sup>c</sup> including the neuropsychological test Digit Span (subtest of the WAIS) [<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; <sup>d</sup> treatment&#x02014;non-treatment comparison (RCT) [<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; <sup>e</sup> within-group comparison of training effect (analysis described in the present paper); FU = follow up.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0166310.g001"/></fig><p>In the RCT [<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], patients were assigned to either a training group or a waiting list control group. Allocation to the groups was done by the method of minimization, minimizing bias regarding important patient characteristics [<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Both patient groups eventually received the IH-CST. Between T-pre and T-post, both patient groups followed the same training program in the same amount of time, and were handled equal in all other aspects.</p><p>From a rehabilitation perspective, it is important to know which training effects are expected and to what extent the expected training effects depend on demographic characteristics, variables related to the visual disorder, and neuropsychological test results. Also, it is important to know to what extent training effects last over time. To this end, we pooled the data from the two groups in the current analyses.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Training</title><p>The training program is described in more detail elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. All patients underwent the IH-CST (InSight-Hemianopia Compensatory Scanning Training) between T-pre and T-post. The main focus of the IH-CST was on learning a systematic, anticipatory scanning rhythm that could be applied in a wide range of mobility-related activities.</p><p>The training program contained exercises aimed at improvement of awareness of the visual field defect and its consequences for daily life, learning to apply a predefined systematic scanning rhythm, and practice of the scanning rhythm in daily life mobility situations. The scanning rhythm consisted of a triad of horizontal eye movements. First, a large saccade from the center towards the blind side was made, in order to shift the visual field defect and to receive the visual information from the periphery. Then a second saccade was made back towards the seeing side to prevent overcompensation. Third, a small saccade was made back to the center. This scanning pattern was repeated at a speed matching the environmental demands and speed of moving around.</p><p>The IH-CST was developed at Royal Dutch Visio. Training was provided by occupational therapists at one location of Bartim&#x000e9;us and nine locations of Royal Dutch Visio in the Netherlands. There were no differences between the locations with regard to logistics, case handling, or financing of care. The IH-CST consisted of 15 sessions (18.5 hours of face-to-face training, plus homework assignments) during a period of 10 weeks by default.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Assessments</title><sec id="sec013"><title>Assessment procedure</title><p>The assessments were performed at the University Medical Center Groningen, the Netherlands. All participants were tested individually. Training for the patient group was provided between March 2010 and October 2012. The results of the assessments had no influence on the way the patient was treated at the rehabilitation center; data were anonymized and not provided on the individual level to Royal Dutch Visio or Bartim&#x000e9;us. The healthy control group started with the test for visual acuity and the MMSE and continued only if the inclusion criteria were met with regard to these tests, i.e. binocular visual acuity of at least Snellen 0.8 (6/7.5 or 20/25, LogMAR 0.1) and MMSE score &#x02265; 24. Participants in this group performed the tests related to scanning and mobility, with similar setup and instructions as the patient group. Assessments of the healthy control group took place between October and December 2012. All patients were approached for a follow-up six to ten months after T-post. The same questionnaires as included in T-pre and T-post were administered via telephone by research assistants who were not involved in data analyses. The follow-up assessments were performed between May 2011 and May 2013.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Tests for visual functions</title><p>Monocular visual acuity was measured with the ETDRS 2000 Letter Chart [<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and peak contrast sensitivity was tested with the Gecko Test [<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Goldmann perimetry (isopters V-4, III-4 and I-4) was used to plot the monocular visual fields. Size of the intact binocular visual field was calculated and expressed in Functional Field Score, which corresponds to the number of points of a pre-defined overlay grid that fall within the intact visual field [<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Furthermore, it was analyzed whether the border between the blind and intact area had shifted more than 5 degrees between T-pre and T-post. The tests for visual functions were only administered in the patient group. For the healthy control group, it was only checked if binocular visual acuity was higher than Snellen 0.8 (6/7.5 or 20/25, LogMAR 0.1).</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Reading tests</title><p>Reading speed, minimal readable text size, and comprehension of the text were assessed with the Radner reading chart [<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and with a text of approximately 400 words (three standardized parallel versions).</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Basic scanning tests</title><p>Three basic scanning tests were administered, presenting the stimuli on a large screen (40&#x000b0; horizontally and 33&#x000b0; vertically, viewing distance 192 cm). In the dot counting test, participants were asked to count dot patterns as quickly and as correct as possible. Half of the trials contained few dots (between 6 and 9 dots), while the other half contained many dots (between 18 and 21 dots). In the parallel search test, participants had to indicate whether or not the target letter O was present among T&#x02019;s, again as fast and accurate as possible. In the serial search test, participants indicated whether the target letter G was present among C&#x02019;s. Reaction times and accuracy scores were recorded.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Hazard perception test</title><p>Photos of traffic situations were presented on a large screen (40&#x000b0; horizontally by 25&#x000b0; vertically, viewing distance 192 cm). Participants were asked to carefully view the photos, each presented for eight seconds, and decide whether they would brake, release the accelerator or keep the same speed (i.e., no intervention), imagining that they were positioned in the driver&#x02019;s seat. The number of incorrect responses (absolute error rate) was recorded. Two other parameters were calculated taking the type of errors into account. The adapted error rate was defined by the sum of the incorrect responses, but very risky responses (&#x0201c;no intervention&#x0201d; when the correct response is &#x0201c;braking&#x0201d;) and very cautious responses (&#x02018;braking&#x0201d; when the correct response is &#x0201c;no intervention&#x0201d;) were counted double. The risk-index reflected the proportion of risky answers in the adapted error rate (risk-index = (risky responses + 2*very risky responses) / adapted error rate). The hazard perception test is described in more detail by Vlakveld [<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and De Haan et al.

In the dual task condition, a second task was added. While responding to the peripheral targets, participants simultaneously had to perform a steering task. On a monitor in front, a straight road was presented, on which they were driving with fixed speed. Because of an imaginary cross-wind, they had to attend to the screen continuously and correct their lateral position on the road using a steering wheel. The Tracking Task is described in more detail by Brouwer [<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and De Haan et al. [<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Outcome parameters were number of omissions (no response to stimulus), number of errors (incorrect response to stimulus) and reaction times for the peripheral stimuli, and the standard deviation in lateral position on the road (SDLP), all from the dual task condition. Dividing the mean reaction time in the dual task condition by the mean reaction time in the single task condition resulted in the dual-to-single-task-ratio (DSR).</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Obstacle course</title><p>A standardized obstacle course was used to examine the influence of obstacles and cognitive load on walking speed. First, preferred walking speed was measured in an obstacle-free corridor. Subsequently, participants walked through the empty corridor again, but this time they had to repeat verbally presented series of digits during their walk (i.e., with cognitive load; cognitive dual task). After that, the corridor was filled with obstacles and participants walked through the course once with cognitive load and once without cognitive load. Included in the analyses were the number of contacts with obstacles and the Digit Score (proportion correct answers on the digit series) during the walk through the obstacle course. Furthermore, percentage preferred walking speed was included (PPWS = (walking speed in obstacle course with cognitive load / walking speed in empty corridor with cognitive load) * 100).</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Questionnaires</title><p>The impact of the HVFD on activities and participation in daily life was assessed using the Independent Mobility Questionnaire (IMQ) [<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], the Visual Functioning Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-25) [<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and the Cerebral Visual Disorders questionnaire (CVD; described by Kerkhoff and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and by Dittrich, 1996, as cited by Tant [<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], p.75). The three total scores of the questionnaires were included in the analyses. For the IMQ and CVD, higher scores indicate more difficulty as experienced by the patient. For the NEI-VFQ-25, higher scores mean less difficulty experienced in daily life.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Analysis</title><p>Differences in participant characteristics between the patient group and the healthy control group were analyzed with two-tailed independent samples t-Tests for age and level of education and a two-tailed Chi-Square Test for gender.</p><p>To compare test performance of the patient group at T-pre and at T-post with test performance of the healthy control group, two-tailed independent samples t-Tests were used. Change within the patient group between T-pre and T-post was examined with two-tailed matched pairs t-Tests. For the questionnaire data in the patient group, the results of T-pre, T-post, and FU were compared in a General Linear Model (GLM) Repeated Measures analysis, with simple contrasts comparing T-pre with FU and T-post with FU. In case Levene&#x02019;s test showed that the assumption of equal variances could not be assumed for a t-Test, the unequal-variance t-Test was used. Missing values were excluded pairwise. Significant effects were defined by <italic>P</italic>-values &#x0003c; .05. <italic>P</italic>-values are reported in case of a <italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.10. Cohen&#x02019;s d was used for calculating the effect sizes of the between-group and within-group comparisons [<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Effect sizes were classified as negligible (d &#x0003c; 0.20), small (0.20 &#x0003c; d &#x0003c;0.50), medium (0.50 &#x0003c; d &#x0003c; 0.80) or large (d &#x0003e; 0.80).</p><p>Four parameters related to scanning in mobility situations were further examined. These outcome parameters were found to improve by IH-CST in the RCT analysis [<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The total score on the IMQ reflected the experienced difficulty in several mobility situations as reported by the patients, reaction time to peripheral stimuli in the dual tracking task (TT-RT-all) was an indication of the level of compensation regarding detection of information in the periphery, the DSR in the tracking task (DSR-all) represented the influence of a secondary task on efficiency of scanning, and PPWS represented a measure of the ability to detect and avoid obstacles during walking. First, Pearson&#x02019;s correlations were used to examine how self-reported mobility performance was related to test performance. Then, a linear regression analysis was performed for each of the outcome parameters to examine the associations between training effects and a number of demographic characteristics, variables related to the visual disorder, and neuropsychological test results. The absolute difference between scores on T-pre and T-post was chosen as the dependent variable reflecting training effect. The independent variables, including score of the outcome parameter on T-pre, were inserted stepwise. Listwise exclusion in case of missing values would have led to few remaining data. Therefore, multiple imputation [<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] was applied for the missing values among the independent variables. This created multiple datasets (five in this case) with different values for the originally missing values. Each regression analysis was then performed on each of these five datasets, resulting in one final model in which the five outcomes were pooled back together.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec022"><title>Results</title><p>The individual-level data are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0166310.s001">S1 File</xref>.</p><sec id="sec023"><title>Participants</title><p>Nine of the 54 included patients with HVFD dropped out of the study after T-pre.

First, it was examined whether the results of an RCT on the effect of IH-CST [<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] could be confirmed in a larger patient sample by comparing data from T-pre and T-post and by comparing the patient group with a healthy control group. Second, it was evaluated whether there is evidence for long-term training effects. The third aim of this study was to determine whether training effects could be predicted by demographic characteristics, variables related to the patients&#x02019; visual disorder, and neuropsychological test results. This would allow clinicians working in the field of rehabilitation to select appropriate and effective rehabilitation programs for their patients.</p><p>The results of the RCT [<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] showed that compared to a waiting list control group, patients who received the IH-CST specifically improved in detecting peripheral stimuli in mobility situations, while no effects were found on visual functions (including visual field size), reading, visual search or dot counting.

Performance in the obstacle course after training, however, was no longer significantly different from the performance of the healthy control group after training regarding the number of contacts with obstacles and the score acquired in the cognitive task during walking.</p><p>The self-reported improvements caused by training appear to be long-term effects. Based on the questionnaire data from the half year follow-up, the positive effects of training on activities and participation in daily life were still present or increased even further six months after training. However, the data from T-pre and T-post indicated that self-reported improvement did not correlate with improvement in objective mobility performance. Therefore, no conclusions can be drawn on the long-term training effects on objective measures. Since the focus of the IH-CST is on automatizing the compensatory scanning strategy as much as possible, this skill might slowly deteriorate without the patient noticing. One may consider implementing refresher sessions, e.g. six months following the training sessions and each following year.</p><p>In the present study, only patients without severe (neuro)psychological disorders, such as neglect, or psychiatric conditions, such as anxiety disorders, were included. In this group with minimal comorbidity, training effects could not be predicted by demographic characteristics, variables related to the visual disorder, or neuropsychological test results. The only variable with potential predictive value was <italic>side of HVFD</italic>, and by this <italic>side of lesion</italic>; reaction times to peripheral stimuli in a dual task situation decreased on average more for patients with a left-sided HVFD compared to patients with a right-sided HVFD. However, no influence of side of HVFD on training effect was found for the other variables. Therefore, the results are inconclusive on the effect of side of HVFD.</p><p>A recurring finding for both the subjective and the objective measures was that change between T-pre and T-post depended on performance at T-pre. Patients who performed worse before onset of training, showed in general more improvement after training in terms of the absolute difference in performance. This might be explained by a ceiling effect for those patients that already performed well prior to training. However, even the patient group with the best performance before onset of training still improved on one or more parameters. It cannot be ruled out that the larger effect of training for lower performers has its limits. For patients with extremely low performance because of serious comorbidity, such as a severe cognitive or physical disorder, this comorbidity may interfere with training effects. For example, if a person is not able to walk more than 50 meters because of physical health problems, mobility performance may not improve substantially after following the IH-CST.</p><p>Two comments are made with respect to the methods used in the present study. First, in the analyses of potential predictors of training effects, the amount of change by training was defined by the absolute difference between the scores on T-pre and T-post. We recognize that a direct translation to clinical implications is not possible and that use of other definitions of training effects may lead to different nuances in the results. Second, we did not investigate possible carry-over effects of treatment and advice in the subacute stage on the effects of the IH-CST. We cannot exclude the possibility that patients who received good explanation about the nature and consequences of the HVFD in the subacute stage profited more from training than people who received less explanations and instructions. All patients in this study had in common that despite previous explanation, advices, or treatment, they all still experienced mobility-related difficulties in daily life and signed up for help on this matter at Visio or Bartim&#x000e9;us. The current study examined whether the IH-CST improves mobility-related tasks and activities, in addition to previous treatment that may have been received. Future studies may investigate whether and how treatment in the subacute stage interacts with the effects of IH-CST.</p><p>With regard to clinical practice, a number of recommendations are provided. Based on the findings of the current study in combination with the results of the previous RCT [<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], the IH-CST is recommended for improving detection of visual stimuli during mobility-related activities for patients with HVFD and minimal comorbidity, as assessed via neuropsychological testing. An observation of visual performance during mobility-related activities prior to training seems crucial to inform the clinician and patient about the training effects to be expected. In order to evaluate the progress made by an individual patient, it is important to assess both the training effects as experienced by the patient, as well as the changes on objective test measures. The training protocol provides standardized exercises and scoring forms for the occupational therapists to measure progress, as well as an evaluation form that is used to assess the patients&#x02019; own idea of improvement. In order to measure the objective improvement on mobility-related activities different from the exercises included in the training program, tests may be implemented in the rehabilitation center before and after training, such as a test similar to the Tracking Task of the current study. Standardized questionnaires, such as the IMQ, might be incorporated to quantify the changes as experienced by the patients.</p><p>Future studies may examine the effect of the IH-CST, or an adapted version, for patients with neglect (with or without HVFD). A recent Cochrane review [<xref rid="pone.0166310.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] concluded that at the moment, no rehabilitation approach for neglect can be supported or refuted from current randomized controlled trials.</p><p>In conclusion, additional evidence was provided confirming the beneficial effect of IH-CST on detection of visual stimuli during mobility-related activities. Again, no evidence was found for improvement on visual functions, reading, visual search and dot counting. According to the patients&#x02019; reports, the effects were still present six to ten months after training. However, the patients&#x02019; impressions could not be supported by objective data since no objective measurements were included in the follow-up assessment. Besides inconclusive evidence for more improvement in patients with a left-sided HVFD than in patients with right-sided HFVD, no demographic characteristics, variables related to the patients&#x02019; visual disorders, and neuropsychological test results have been found to predict size of training effect in this sample where serious (neuro)psychological disorders have been excluded. Further research is needed to explore the effects and feasibility of IH-CST for patients with comorbidity. Also, it is recommended to examine the need for a follow-up training to ensure permanent use of the skills practiced and acquired during the IH-CST.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec036"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0166310.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Individual-level data.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0166310.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Special thanks goes out to all participants, as well as the staff from Royal Dutch Visio and Bartim&#x000e9;us involved in participant recruitment and training.
