Adopting safe and effective methods of labor induction at appropriate gestation age can greatly decrease complications and morbidity of pregnancy and fetus. In recent years, the rate of induction presents gradually increasing tendency, and the incidence for labor induction dramatically varies 8&#x02013;44&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Therefore, looking for induction methods with safety, efficacy, feasibility, low cost, and patient preferences, for a long time, is a pursuit of the goal of all obstetric providers.</p><p>Recently, many studies reported oral misoprostol for labor induction with different doses and interval times; at the same time, respectively compared with other induction methods including vaginal insert misoprostol, oxytocin, Foley catheter induction, oxytocin associated Foley catheter and vaginal insert Dinoprostone. The target of all these studies is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of oral misoprostol for labor induction. According to these study results, we propose the concept that misoprostol will be a new promising agent for cervical ripening and induction of labor, but ideal dose, route and administration frequency are still needed for investigation.</p><p>Misoprostol, a synthetic prostaglandin E<sub>1</sub> analog, can be administered orally, sublingually, buccally, intra-vaginally, or rectally and is used for both cervical ripening and labor induction. The World Health Organization recommends a fixed oral misoprostol dose of 25&#x000a0;mg every 2&#x000a0;h for labor induction based on moderate-quality evidence and strong recommendation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, trials continue in efforts to identify the optimum treatment regimen.</p><p>On the basis of the misoprostol pharmacokinetics, this medicine shows the characteristics of rapid oral absorption, its active metabolites of misoprostol acid in plasma reach peak value after 15&#x000a0;min of oral administration, and its mean tmax concentration is 0.309&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L. Its half-life is 20&#x02013;40&#x000a0;min following oral administration, followed by a rapid decline to low levels during the period of 120&#x000a0;min, thereafter with a more gradual decline, and no drug accumulation phenomenon. According to its pharmacokinetics property, we designed the administration procedure of hourly titrated oral misoprostol dosing and gradually increasing dosage, compared with 2&#x000a0;h dosing; this procedure may make drug serum level more steady with better efficacy, and at last improve clinical induction outcome.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>This trial was a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial. The study was performed within four obstetric centers; participating hospitals can be district, teaching or academic hospitals. Before entry into the study, women were informed about the aims, methods, reasonably anticipated benefits and potential hazards of the study. Prior to interview, informed consents had been taken from every respondent. Patients who met the selection criteria were explained about advantages and disadvantages of the procedure. Among them, those who provided their informed consents were interviewed and recruited in the study. They were informed that their participation would been voluntary and may withdraw consent for participation at any time during the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>All the women must be singleton pregnancies with occipital presentation, nullipara, gestational age is at least 36&#x000a0;weeks, Bishop score less than six, no vaginal delivery contraindication, e.g. cephalopelvic disproportion, mal-presentation, fetal compromise, no reassuring fetal heart rate pattern, previous scar and antepartum haemorrhage.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Women with any contraindication to induction and vagina delivery, allergic to prostaglandin, and with complication of glaucoma, asthma and allergic colitis, woman with heart, liver, renal and adrenal cortex insufficiency.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Multicenter randomized control design</title><p>This multicenter randomized controlled trial was conducted from January to October in 2014 at four gynecologic and obstetric departments (including Obstetric Department of Affiliated Guangren Hospital of Xi&#x02019;an Jiaotong University; Obstetric Department of First Affiliated Hospital of Medical College of Xi&#x02019;an Jiaotong University in China; Obstetric Department of Maternal and Child Care Service Center of Northwest; Obstetric Department of Shannxi Province People Hospital).

Dinoprostone should be removed from the freezer in direct connection with the insertion, and be inserted high into the posterior vaginal fornix using only small amount of water soluble lubricants to aid insertion. After dinoprostone has been inserted, the withdrawal tap may be cut with scissors ensuring there is sufficient tap outside the vagina to allow removal. The norms of terminating drug administration were as same as OMS group.</p><p>When participants began the process of labor induction, abdominal palpation uterine contraction and electric monitoring would be taken to evaluate uterine contraction, fetal heart-rate every hour, and vaginal exam to know the dilatation of cervix every 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;h.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Outcomes measure</title><p>General situation of participants: including age, gestational age, body mass index (BMI).

In 2001, Hofmeyr [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] compared the titrated oral misoprostol solution with vaginal dinoprostone for labor induction, proposed the new approach, titrated oral misoprostol solution administration and was successful in minimizing the risk of uterine hyperstimulation, and with no significant difference in maternal adverse effect and neonatal outcome between the two groups. From then on, many obstetricians pay attention to titrated oral misoprostol induction method because of its greater acceptance and fewer adverse effects. To further evaluate safety and efficacy of titrate oral misoprostol induction, many obstetricians compared with different labor induction method. Comparing OMS with conventional oxytocin induction, the result showed misoprostol was a safe and effective drug with low complications for the induction of labor, failure was seen less with misoprostol and cesarean sections are less frequently indicated as compared to oxytocin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Comparing OMS with Foley catheter in cervical ripening and induction effect, OMS group showed higher rate of delivery in 24&#x000a0;h, and in labor augmentation, cesarean section and instrumental delivery were somewhat fewer frequency than Foley group, but these differences were not statistically significant, side effects and neonatal complications were similar between the two groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A comparative study about oral and vaginal misoprostol for labor induction, which showed oral misoprostol was as effective as vaginal misoprostol with the advantage of shorter induction delivery interval, lower cesarean section rate, and lower incidence of failed induction rate, lower proportion of fetal distress and easy intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In 2011, WHO guideline also strongly recommended oral misoprostol (25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, 2-hourly) than vaginal low-dose misoprostol (25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, 6 hourly) for induction of labor. A randomized controlled trial about comparison of OMS with vaginal misoprostol showed that OMS associated with a lower incidence of uterine hyperstimulation and a lower cesarean delivery rate than vaginal misoprostol for labor induction in patients with unfavorable cervix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A randomized double-blind trial compared efficacy and safety about OMS and oral misoprostol, participants were allocated to receive 20&#x000a0;ml of misoprostol solution (1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml) orally every 1&#x000a0;h for four doses then titrated to 40&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g every 1&#x000a0;h (OMS group) or 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of misoprostol orally every 4&#x000a0;h up to 12&#x000a0;h (oral group), and concluded that oral misoprostol was as effective as titrated misoprostol for cervical ripening and labor induction, but had a lower incidence of tachysystole and a lower total dose of misoprostol are required. Its results seem to be contradictory to previous studies, perhaps OMS dose and administration interval time difference could affect the outcomes of induction of labor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A systematic review and net meta-analysis based on the data of Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group&#x02019;s Database of Trials show low dose (&#x0003c;50&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g) titrated oral misoprostol solution had the lowest probability of cesarean section, whereas vaginal misprostol (&#x02265;50&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g) had the highest probability of achieving a vaginal delivery within 24&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>However, up to now, there are still no definite conclusions about the optimal dose, interval time and route of administration. In our study, we take the new method that gradually increase titrated oral misoprostol solution dose, and adminstrate by 1&#x02013;2 h, compare with vaginal dinoprotone for evaluating its effectiveness and safety. Evaluation from mode and outcomes of delivery, which is similar for total proportion of vaginal delivery between the two groups during 48&#x000a0;h, nevertheless titrated oral misoprostol has the property of relatively slower duration of labor compared with dinoprostone, but accompanied the lower rate of uterine hyperstimulation, hypertonus, usage frequency of tocolytics and non-reassuring fetal heart; and concurrently OMS with lower incidence of tachysystole, cesarean delivery rate although with little significant difference in our study. Analyzed from the respect of neonatal outcomes, meconium-stained liquor rate in OMS group are lower than vaginal dinoprostone. From these points of view, titrated oral misoprostol is safer than dinoprostone for women labor induction, these results are as same as other studies.</p><p>The incidence of non-reassuring fetal heart rate in dinoprostone was significantly higher than OMS group, we also found that the rate of fetal distress in dinoprotone was also higher than OMS group, but the total proportion of cesarean section between two group showed no difference because of higher incidence of usage of tocolytics in dinoprostone. Uterine tachysystole, hyperstimulation, hypertonus accompanied non-reassuring fetal heart rate, tocolytics should be used to at once, so that a part of women would not been dealt with cesarean section. I think that may be the reason of our study with higher non-reassuring fetal heart rate rather without higher incidence of cesarean section in dinoprostone.</p><p>The phenomenon of higher proportion membrane rupture in oral misoprostol perplexed us, and we exclude the reason of amniotic membrane infection by placental histopathology. This phenomenon was not reported in other document literature, but 54 women in OMS group and 23 women in dinoprostone group presented on regular uterine contraction and delivered within 12&#x000a0;h, and three women did not present regular uterine contraction after 12&#x000a0;h, then experienced oxytocin induction and delivered, two women who presented delivery process block were transferred to cesarean section. We thought that higher incidence of membrane rupture in OMS group needed to be further studied by expanded sample size.</p><p>Based on the cervix Bishop score, we found that with the lower of cervix Bishop score, corresponding emergency needed higher dose of oral misoprostol solution and longer duration of time for labor induction. We consider that other procedure of labor induction with OMS will be studied, for women with lower Bishop score &#x02264;3, could be administrated higher dose of initial dose, and increased more than 10&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g every time, and been longer than 2&#x000a0;h interval. Of course, optimum dose and interval of administration for women with low Bishop score need further extensive and intensive study.</p><p>In conclusion, titrated oral misoprostol given hourly for labor induction is as effective as vaginal dinoprostone from the respect of maternal/fetal outcomes, but titrated oral misoprostol is associated with lower rate of uterine hyperstimulation, hypertonus, tachysystole, and nonreassuring fetal heart compared with vaginal dinoprostone. Taking into account the higher vaginal delivery rate, lower adverse effect for maternal/fetal outcomes, costs and women&#x02019;s preferences; our study consider that titrated oral misoprostol solution would be a safe, cost-effective and patient favorite way for inducing labor.</p></sec></body><back><notes notes-type="conflict-interest"><title>Compliance with ethical standards</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The authors report no declarations of interest.</p></sec></notes><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Geeta</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Swamy</surname><given-names>MD</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Current methods of labor induction</article-title><source>Semin Perinatol</source><year>2012</year><volume>36</volume><issue>5</issue><fpage>348</fpage><lpage>352</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1053/j.semperi.2012.04.018</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23009967</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>ACOG Committee on Practice</collab></person-group><article-title>Bulletins&#x02014;obstetrics.
