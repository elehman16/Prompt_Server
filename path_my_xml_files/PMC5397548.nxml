In the experimental group, after the initial analgesic effect was achieved, additionally a 10 Fr Tieman bladder catheter (coudetipped catheter) was inserted to distribute the lidocaine gel along the entire length of the urethra, and hence to anaesthetize the posterior urethra. The time from gel administration to urethra instrumentation with the cystoscope was 5 min in both groups.</p><p>Urinary tract infection (UTI) was excluded before the procedure in all cases. Six residents in urology participated in the study and performed uniform anaesthesia and cystoscopies. No dedicated patient preparation for the procedure was adopted.

Considering a mean visual analogue scale (VAS) score of 3.0 in the control group based on literature data, a sample size of 50 patients in each study arm was planned to detect a 30% difference in NRS score and obtain 80% power using a one-sided &#x003b1; value of 0.05.</p><sec id="sec3.1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical calculations were performed with Statistica 10.0 software.

According to GLOBOCAN data, the incidence in Central Europe is 15.1 new cases per 100 000 habitants per year [<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. About 75% of patients are diagnosed with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) [<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. They undergo TURBT followed by intravesical chemo- and/or immunotherapy. Due to the significant risk of recurrence and progression, these patients need close, often lifelong, follow-up with numerous cystoscopies performed every 3&#x02013;12 months [<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Despite significant technological improvement, including wide implementation of flexible cystoscopies, the procedure remains uncomfortable for patients.</p><p>We performed a prospective, randomised controlled study aimed at optimisation of anaesthesia in men undergoing cystoscopy. As patients report that the most painful step of the procedure is the moment when the cystoscope passes the posterior urethra [<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], we focused on improvement in anaesthesia of this particular region. To our knowledge, this is the first study that presents a method of anaesthesia of the posterior urethra and assesses its clinical significance.</p><p>Our study did not reveal a direct and statistically significant effect of anaesthesia of the posterior urethra at the time of cystoscopy; however, it did find an important improvement in overall perception of the procedure in the experimental group. This fact can be crucial for patients&#x02019; compliance. In everyday clinical practice it is not uncommon that patients abandon follow-up because of pain related to cystoscopy. In a historical study by Schrag <italic>et al.</italic> the incidence of suboptimal frequency of follow-up cystoscopies was over 60% of NMIBC patients, while almost 10% of patients did not even have a single follow-up cystoscopy done [<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Numerous research groups have already attempted to optimise the cystoscopy protocol, especially to reduce pain perception. There have been many prospective, randomized and controlled trials on this issue published in recent years. Thompson <italic>et al.</italic> and Goel and Aron independently proposed to cool the gel to 4&#x000b0;C [<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]; however, the benefit of lower temperature was not confirmed by Bhomi <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Brekkan <italic>et al.</italic> and Holmes <italic>et al.</italic> independently suggested increasing the volume of lidocaine gel to 20 ml before cystoscopy in men, especially in patients younger than 55 years [<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Khan <italic>et al.</italic> outlined the importance of the delivery rate of lidocaine gel, indicating that slow administration within 10 s reduces patient discomfort compared to 2-second administration [<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Vasudeva <italic>et al.</italic> and Losco <italic>et al.</italic> independently examined the optimal dwell time of intraurethral lidocaine gel before insertion of the cystoscope. The first group concluded that 15 min is more effective than both 5 and 10 min for patient as well as physician assessment of pain intensity [<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], while the second group did not observe significant differences between immediate insertion of the cystoscope and after a 3-minute delay [<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Moharari <italic>et al.</italic> added ketamine to lidocaine gel and observed significantly lower scores on the visual analogue scale compared to lidocaine alone [<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The analgesic effect can also be strengthened when lidocaine gel is combined with oral medication. Komiya <italic>et al</italic>. proposed administering orally a 160 mg single dose of zaltoprofen 60 min before cystoscopy, which resulted in lower pain scores compared to no premedication [<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Gunendran <italic>et al.</italic> described a &#x0201c;bag squeeze&#x0201d; technique, during which a member of the nursing staff gently squeezes the irrigating fluid bag until the opening of the external sphincter visible on the video camera before the scope passes through the posterior urethra [<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Zhang <italic>et al.</italic> recently improved this technique. They confirmed that higher irrigation pressure is associated with less discomfort during cystoscopy and proposed to raise the irrigation solution bag and adjust the height in order to easily improve patients&#x02019; satisfaction [<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Apart from technical tips and tricks, Yeo <italic>et al.</italic> found that listening to classical music during rigid cystoscopy is a simple, economical and effective means of enhancing patient comfort and reducing feelings of pain, anxiety, and dissatisfaction [<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Finally, numerous research groups have questioned the value of the analgesic effect of lidocaine gel for cystoscopy. In 2008 two meta-analyses on this issue with contradictory results were published. While Aaronson <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that intraurethral instillation of lidocaine gel provides control of moderate to severe pain and benefit to male patients undergoing cystoscopy [<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], Patel <italic>et al.</italic> provided no evidence of a statistically significant difference in pain scores between lidocaine gel and plain gel instillation [<xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Apart from uncertainty regarding effectiveness, some authors report that delivery of lidocaine gel can cause significant discomfort compared to plain lubricant [<xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]; however, this finding is not consistent within the literature [<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. None of the already published studies have focused on optimization of anaesthesia of the posterior urethra.</p><p>In the present study we found that age and number of cystoscopies performed in the past were inversely correlated with pain intensity during the procedure. This finding was not universal, as statistically significant differences were not observed at all assessed time points, or in all examined groups. However, there is a trend to worse pain scoring during the first cystoscopy and in younger men, which is also described by other authors [<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. While the aim of our study was to optimise local anaesthesia for cystoscopy, these findings are clinically useless despite their relevance. However, being fully consistent with previously published data, they confirm that our methods and protocol are sound, despite the negative findings.</p><p>Our study has some limitations. First, nowadays flexible cystoscopy is becoming a standard procedure, while rigid instruments are used less commonly. However, in our institution we still use both rigid and flexible cystoscopes. What is more, we think that in many urological centres rigid cystoscopes are still in use due to their simplicity, reliability and cost-effectiveness. Finally, the character of the instrument does not impact the significance of the results obtained in our study, although one could expect lower NRS scores if a flexible cystoscope were used [<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Second, as this study is not a blind one, the level of evidence is limited. However, from a practical point of view, it is impossible to plan a blind and especially double-blind study of such character. Last but not least is the fact that as many as six physicians were involved in conducting the experiment. The significance of this fact is substantially reduced by standardisation of the procedure and inclusion of a similar number of patients in both study groups by each resident.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Anaesthesia of the posterior urethra does not decrease the pain at the time of introducing a cystoscope and has no influence on the overall feeling of pain during the procedure. However, it improves the general perception of the procedure, and hence may positively influence patient compliance. Standard injection of anaesthetic gel through the external urethral orifice to exclude pain perception within the posterior urethra is as sufficient as extended gel distribution to the posterior urethra.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="cit0001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Torre</surname><given-names>LA</given-names></name><name><surname>Bray</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Siegel</surname><given-names>RL</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Global cancer statistics, 2012</article-title><source>CA Cancer J Clin</source><year>2015</year><volume>65</volume><fpage>87</fpage><lpage>108</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">25651787</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="cit0002"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Babjuk</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>B&#x000f6;hle</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Burger</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>EAU Guidelines on non-muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder: update 2016</article-title><source>Eur Urol</source><year>2017</year><volume>71</volume><fpage>447</fpage><lpage>61</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">27324428</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="cit0003"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Seklehner</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Remzi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Fajkovic</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Prospective multi-institutional study analyzing pain perception of flexible and rigid cystoscopy in men</article-title><source>Urology</source><year>2015</year><volume>85</volume><fpage>737</fpage><lpage>41</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">25817101</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="cit0004"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Greenstein</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Greenstein</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Senderovich</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Mabjeesh</surname><given-names>NJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Is diagnostic cystoscopy painful?
