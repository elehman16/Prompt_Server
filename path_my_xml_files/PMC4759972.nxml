Orthodontic fixed retainers are applied as long-term retention of maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Zachrisson introduced multi-strand wires in 1982, which were bonded to six anterior teeth from canine to canine.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Some clinical studies showed these retainers had a significant failure (2.9&#x02013;47%) during a short-term follow-up. These investigations count various factors as the causes of fixed retainers' failures: Corrosion, lower abrasion resistance and erosion due to chewing or tooth brushing, wire thickness, and periodic slag forces.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Furthermore, the failure of retainers may lead to a significant dental relapse.</p><p>Studies have shown the acceptable compatibility of metal bonded retainers with periodontal health.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] However, the limitations have been esthetic problems and the fact that these retainers may not be used in patients who were allergic to nickel. As a result, alternatives can be applied like fiber-reinforced composite (FRC) retainers.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Diamond and Orchinde fined glass fibers as alternatives to multi-strand wires.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] FRCs have the appropriate flexural strength to act as a restorative material <italic>in vivo</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Based on the study of Tahmasbi <italic>et al</italic>., FRC bars had enough strength to withstand simulated forces (equal to 2 years).[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Comparing FRC retainers to flexible wire retainers, the basic advantage of FRC bars is the high transparency, which make them almost invisible. Therefore, the retainers may be bonded near the incisal edge, which have biological and biomechanical advantages. Despite these benefits, one of the FRC retainers' drawbacks is that they should be supported by composite coverage. Hence, bonding in interproximal contacts is necessary which, in turn, may lead to the creation of calculus and decay and may endanger periodontal health.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Moreover, the bonding process of FRC retainers is technique sensitive.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Conventional glass ionomer cements (GICs) have been evaluated for the bonding of orthodontic brackets due to their anti-caries features.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] These cement have a similar thermal expansion coefficient to dental structures and their advantage in comparison to composite resin is the fluoride-releasing capability that prevents secondary decay.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] However, there is a clinical limitation in using this material due to its low bond strength.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] The other disadvantages of GICs include its short working time, sensitivity to be contaminated with saliva, and its hydrophilic characteristics.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] These problems were solved by the introduction of the resin-modified GICs (RMGICs). Their rapid hardening after exposure to light cure makes them less sensitive to moisture.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>The previous studies evaluated the effect of various adhesive systems on the shear bond strength (SBS) of FRC retainers.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Orthodontic adhesives encounter thermal changes in the mouth. Different factors such as air temperature, moisture, and airspeed during breathing can change the mouth's temperature.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Even though, the prediction of changes is difficult during a test, the evaluation of the effect of these stresses on bond strength is significant. Therefore, Bishara <italic>et al</italic>. recommended thermal cycling as part of the new adhesive test protocol.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</p><p>Despite manufacturers' advice, some orthodontists prefer to use FRC bars without composite coverage to facilitate the cleansing of interproximal spaces.</p><p>Thus, the primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the SBS of FRC retainers when bonding them to the teeth using two different adhesive systems (Tetric Flow [TF]/RMGIC): With and without covering the FRC bars with adhesives.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>For this <italic>in-vitro</italic> study, samples included 120 maxillary first premolars that were randomly divided into eight groups of 15 each.

This study was approved by the Ethical Committees of the Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Specimen Preparation</title><p>The tooth surface was cleaned by rubber cup and pumice powder and then etched with 35% phosphoric acid gel (Ultra-Etch, USA) for 30 s and after rinsing and drying, unfilled resin (Whalendent/unfilled Coltene, Alstatten, Switzerland), Tetric Flow (Tetric EvoFlow, Ivoclar Vivadent, Switzerland), and RMGIC (ODP, Vista, CA, USA) were applied for bonding procedures. Subsequently, FRCs (Everstick Ortho<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Stick Tech, Oy, Turku, Finland) were placed. The fibers that reinforced the FRCs were E-glass and unidirectional to polymerize FRC. They were maintained at 5&#x02013;8&#x000b0;C, and their cross sections were circular with a diameter of 0.75 mm. They were applied routinely in the clinic as a retainer due to the appropriate thickness and conformity to tooth curvature. Thereafter, the halogen light curing unit (Astralis 7, Ivoclar, Vivadent, Schann, Liechtenstein) was used. To simulate the oral condition, a thermal cycling device was employed (Willytec, Munich, Germany) and specimens were maintained at a temperature of 5&#x02013;55&#x000b0;C at 30 s intervals to simulate thermal fluctuations. The SBS was also measured with a universal testing machine (Zwick, GMBH, Ulm, Germany).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Experimental Groups</title><p><bold>Group 1</bold></p><p>A layer of margin bond (unfilled resin, Coltene/Whaledent, Alsstatten, Switzerland) was applied to the etched surface with a brush. Then, with a mild air burst, this layer was thinned and cured over 20 s using light cure device (Astralis 7). Subsequently, a thin layer of TF was placed on the teeth. FRC bars, with the length of 4 mm, were then cut and placed on the enamel surface of the teeth, and the excess TF was removed with a scaler.</p><p>To assure equal sizes of the FRC and adhesive in all specimens, an aluminum foil with dimensions of 4 mm &#x000d7; 1.5 mm was used.

Subsequently, the mounted specimens were placed in distilled water for 24 h at room temperature. At this point, the SBS measurement process was performed using the Zwick device, and FRCs were debonded by applying the shear force of the blade at the speed of 1 mm/min. Then, the maximum required force to debond FRCs was registered based on Newton and transferred to Megapascal by dividing to FRC bonded cross section (4 mm &#x000d7; 1.5 mm = 6 mm<sup>2</sup>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Surveyor device</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOS-4-102-g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Adhesive Remnant Index</title><p>After debonding, fibers and the enamel surfaces were evaluated by employing 10 times magnification lenses.

The findings showed that the type of material (TF, RMGIC) and covering and noncovering factor influenced by each other, but thermocycling factor did not influence of those two other factors.

By covering of FRCs, the volume of bars will increase, and oral hygiene will be jeopardized. RMGIC is frequently used as this material can absorb and release fluoride. As FRCs are maintained for long periods of time, this material can help to prevent decay and may be appropriate for bonding FRC retainers. Without covering of FRC bars, the current study indicated that RMGIC had a higher SBS compared TF. The previous studies on RMGIC also reported satisfactorily bond strength to the enamel surface.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</p><p>Our findings showed that the thermal cycling process had no significant effect on bond strength. Tezvergil <italic>et al</italic>. showed that when thermal cycling was performed, the bond strength of FRC was increased.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] However, in most of the studies that have evaluated the thermal cycling effect on bond strength, a decrease in bond strength was confirmed after thermal cycling.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] The reasons for such a decrease in SBS are assumed to be the difference in the linear coefficient of the thermal expansion of the adhesive, FRC, tooth, and bracket, and also water absorption during thermal cycling may lead to hygroscopic expansion and may decrease bond strength.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] According to our findings, if TF were used as an adhesive the FRC should have been completely covered to increase bond strength. On the other hand, results indicated that, if RMGIC were applied for bonding of FRC, then covering of the FRC did not lead to increase in bond strength.</p><p>This study showed that if the clinician does not choose to cover FRC, it is better to use RMGIC as an adhesive material. For TF, the average of SBS among 60 samples was 14.06 &#x000b1; 3.31 MPa. However, the average of RGMICwas 14.87 &#x000b1; 3.35 MPa.</p><p>According to the present findings, RMGIC is a better adhesive for FRC bonding when compared to TF. It should be noted that TF has a micromechanical bond. However, after enamel etching, the RMGIC's bond is both micromechanical and chemical.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] On the other hand, RMGIC is a dual-cured adhesive, and more complete curing may be achieved in comparison to light cured TF. These factors can be the reasons for the higher RMGIC's bond strength compared to TF. As the difference between FRC and TF regarding the thermal expansion coefficient is more than that of FRC and RMGIC, during water absorption, the hygroscopic expansion of two materials would differ and the bond between TF and FRC would become weaker.</p><p>The basic advantage of RMGIC, compared to TF, is the possibility of the charge and release of fluoride ions.[<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] This leads to a decrease in decalcification and white spots around orthodontic appliances. FRC retainers are bonded to the lingual surface of the anterior teeth for long duration or permanently and consequently, RMGIC is appropriate for FRC bonding.</p><p>In debonding of FRCs from the tooth surface, most failures were cohesive. In general, 5.2% of the failures were adhesive, and 94.8% of the failures were cohesive. In all groups, failure patterns were similar, and there were no differences among them. Matasa showed that when the bond failure was cohesive, the bond strength was higher compared to adhesive bond failure[<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and moreover, bond failure within the adhesive, or at the bracket-resin interface is more desirable than at resin-enamel interface.[<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref><xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] Possible limitations of the present study can include the difficulty in standardization of procedure to assess the ARI, as it is mainly used for debonding brackets not bonded retainers, as well as the fact, that using the ARI did not allow microscopical assessment of the enamel surfaces of teeth and investigating the underlying mechanism for observed differences between TF and RMGIC groups. The use of scanning electron microscope can be incorporated in future studies. It should be noted that this study could not completely simulate the clinical procedures of composite coverage of the FRC in the interproximal spaces, and further clinical studies are necessary for further details.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Our findings showed no significant differences between SBS of FRC bars with and without covering by RMGIC. Not covering the surface of FRC can result in less bulky constructions that may reduce plaque accumulation and irritation of the tongue. Our results showed that when using RMGIC as an adhesive material, covering of FRC bars seems unnecessary.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Financial Support and Sponsorship</title><p>Vice-Chancellor for Research of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank the Vice-Chancellor for Research of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences for the financial support of this project.
