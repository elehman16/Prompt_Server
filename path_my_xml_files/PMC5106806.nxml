Existing interventions to improve triage by physicians ignore the role that intuition (heuristics) plays in these decisions. One such heuristic is to form an initial impression based on representativeness (how typical does a patient appear of one with severe injuries). We created a video game (<italic>Night Shift)</italic> to recalibrate physician&#x02019;s representativeness heuristic in trauma triage.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We developed <italic>Night Shift</italic> in collaboration with emergency medicine physicians, trauma surgeons, behavioral scientists, and game designers. Players take on the persona of Andy Jordan, an emergency medicine physician, who accepts a new job in a small town. Through a series of cases that go awry, they gain experience with the contextual cues that distinguish patients with minor and severe injuries (based on the theory of analogical encoding) and receive emotionally-laden feedback on their performance (based on the theory of narrative engagement). The planned study will compare the effect of <italic>Night Shift</italic> with that of an educational program on physician triage decisions and on physician heuristics. Psychological theory predicts that cognitive load increases reliance on heuristics, thereby increasing the under-triage rate when heuristics are poorly calibrated. We will randomize physicians (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;366) either to play the game or to review an educational program, and will assess performance using a validated virtual simulation. The validated simulation includes both control and cognitive load conditions. We will compare rates of under-triage after exposure to the two interventions (primary outcome) and will compare the effect of cognitive load on physicians&#x02019; under-triage rates (secondary outcome). We hypothesize that: a) physicians exposed to <italic>Night Shift</italic> will have lower rates of under-triage compared to those exposed to the educational program, and b) cognitive load will not degrade triage performance among physicians exposed to <italic>Night Shift</italic> as much as it will among those exposed to the educational program.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Serious games offer a new approach to the problem of poorly-calibrated heuristics in trauma triage.

Professional organizations, state authorities, and the federal government endorse the systematic triage and transfer of these patients to trauma centers either directly from the field or after evaluation at a non-trauma center [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Nonetheless, between 30 and 40&#x000a0;% of patients with moderate-to-severe injuries still receive treatment at non-trauma centers (<italic>under-triage)</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The problem amplifies among the cohort evaluated by physicians at non-trauma centers&#x02014;70 to 80&#x000a0;% of whom are under-triaged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Current efforts to change physician decision making in trauma triage focus primarily on education and outreach by opinion leaders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These strategies assume that the problem is one of ignorance. In other words, physicians make the wrong decision because they either lack knowledge of the clinical practice guidelines or do not believe in the validity of the guidelines. However, this approach ignores the influence of intuitive judgments (<italic>heuristics</italic>) on triage decisions. Heuristics, mental short cuts based on pattern recognition, drive most decision making. They take precedence over rule-based algorithms (analytic cognitive processes), by springing to mind spontaneously and effortlessly. They work well under conditions of time-pressure and uncertainty precisely because they ignore irrelevant information and streamline decision making. Most importantly, they generate useful answers most of the time. However, they can also draw attention to the wrong contextual cues, leading to predictable errors of judgment (<italic>biases</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Our observational and experimental work suggests that the use of heuristics may explain some patterns of non-compliance with clinical practice guidelines in trauma triage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Because they are automatic, the use of heuristics cannot be eradicated. Moreover, the uncertainty and complexity of the clinical environment make well-calibrated heuristics a powerful tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. We propose what we believe to be the first intervention designed to recalibrate physician heuristics. It draws on research from other domains suggesting the potential effectiveness of promoting <italic>analogical encoding</italic> and <italic>narrative engagement</italic>. Analogical encoding interventions use case studies to highlight core principles of decision making, emphasizing the identification of relevant and irrelevant contextual cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Narrative engagement interventions use messages designed to resonate with recipients in personally relevant and meaningful ways. Our intervention is an adventure video game that combines these two features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The planned study will compare the impact of the game on simulated physician trauma triage decisions with that of an educational program of equivalent duration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Overview</title><p>We developed the video game (<italic>Night Shift</italic>) in collaboration with Schell Games (Pittsburgh, PA) through an iterative process involving behavioral scientists, cognitive psychologists, trauma surgeons, and emergency medicine physicians.

We will recruit physicians working at non-trauma centers, randomize them to play <italic>Night Shift</italic> or to review a standard educational program, and assess their decision making on a validated virtual simulation.</p><p>The virtual simulation allows us to assess physician performance in terms of the number of severely injured patients not transferred to trauma centers (under-triage). We can also assess the effect of <italic>Night Shift</italic> on physician heuristics, by experimentally manipulating cognitive load in the simulation. Psychological theory predicts that cognitive load will increase reliance on heuristics, thereby increasing the under-triage rate in situations where those heuristics are inaccurate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Our target heuristic is representativeness. In the context of trauma triage, it would entail forming an initial impression based on how typical a patient appears of the severely injured.</p><p>We hypothesize that: a) physicians exposed to <italic>Night Shift</italic> will have lower rates of under-triage compared to those exposed to the educational program, and b) cognitive load will not degrade triage performance among physicians exposed to <italic>Night Shift</italic> as much as it will among those exposed to the educational program.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study setting</title><p>Using a strategy that has proven successful in the past, we will recruit physicians at a national meeting of the American College of Emergency Physicians in the fall of 2016, using a booth in the Exhibition Hall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Physicians will be eligible for participation if they care for adult patients in the Emergency Department of either a non-trauma center or a Level III/IV trauma center in the United States.

We will generate a randomization scheme using Stata 13.0 (Statacorp, College Station, TX, USA) statistical software, using random block sizes of 4 or 8.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Study protocol</title><p>Upon enrollment, subject physicians receive an iPad mini 2 with their intervention pre-loaded, along with written instructions on how to complete the study protocol. They will receive weekly reminder emails to complete the protocol for the duration of the study. We will ask participants to spend a minimum of one hour completing the intervention task. After completing it, they will be instructed to log in to a website that hosts: a) the virtual simulation; b) a questionnaire about their personal information, and c) a questionnaire about the intervention&#x02019;s tolerability. Completing the simulation and two questionnaires will take approximately one hour. Participants will be able to complete the two portions of the study protocol at their convenience, within 1&#x000a0;month of enrollment. They will keep the iPad mini 2 as an honorarium (approximate value $260).</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Intervention: night shift</title><p>The goal of Night Shift is to teach physicians to recognize patients with &#x02018;non-representative&#x02019; severe injuries, defined as injuries that are classified by the American College of Surgeons as life-threatening or critical, but that do not fit the archetype for injuries requiring treatment at a trauma center [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The intervention is designed to increase analogical encoding by having players experience a case that goes awry because of reliance on the representativeness heuristic, and providing specific feedback on relevant and irrelevant cues (i.e. ones they might have missed and ones that might have misled them). It is designed to facilitate narrative engagement by the providing the information in an emotionally compelling way. After considering different types of games (e.g. puzzles, role-playing), we decided that an adventure video game would provide an environment realistic enough for existing triage guidelines to appear valid, while including an element of fantasy to promote character identification and engagement.</p><p>Players take on the persona of Andy Jordan, a young emergency medicine physician who moves home after the disappearance of his estranged grandfather (Robert Jordan) and takes a job in the local emergency department (ED). The introduction tells players that they have two objectives. The first is to diagnose and treat patients who present to their ED. The second is to solve the mystery of Robert&#x02019;s disappearance: was he murdered or has he chosen to disappear? [Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>].<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Screen shots of trailer to Night Shift. Description of data: We show the trailer to the game. We provided players with two explicit objectives in order to heighten narrative engagement, while simultaneously providing a vehicle for physician education</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12873_2016_108_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>
</p><p>The patients who present to the ED have both severe injuries and non-trauma complaints. In each case, subject physicians must interview the patients to elicit relevant elements of the history and physical exam. They then have the option of: a) ordering ancillary testing, b) discussing the case with a consultant, or c) discharging the patient home. Cases end when players make disposition decisions (admit, transfer, or discharge).</p><p>We categorize cases as &#x02018;relevant&#x02019; or &#x02018;non-relevant&#x02019; to our objective. &#x02018;Relevant&#x02019; patients have non-representative severe injuries. When players fail to transfer one of these patients, he/she returns with complications that require additional treatment. Players also receive feedback on their performance from peers, family members, or their supervisor. The feedback includes both information about the clinical practice guidelines and a personal reprimand. In contrast, when players successfully transfer the patient to a trauma center, they receive an update, stating that the patient has improved, information about the guidelines, and a compliment on their diagnostic and decision-making capability.</p><p>&#x02018;Non-relevant&#x02019; patients either have representative severe injuries or non-trauma complaints. We included these cases because playtesters found that the &#x02018;relevant&#x02019; cases did not pose sufficient diagnostic challenge, making game-play tedious. Players do not receive in-game feedback on their treatment of these patients. However, we do provide a summary of their performance at the end of <italic>Night Shift</italic>, which includes their ability to diagnose and treat the &#x02018;non-relevant&#x02019; cases.</p><p>The mystery component of <italic>Night Shift</italic> occurs concurrently with the clinical challenges, and serves to facilitate players&#x02019; identification with their character and interest in their task. Players must solve Robert&#x02019;s disappearance through interactions with other characters, including patients, and their physical environment. Andy Jordan&#x02019;s background and character are also revealed through these interaction, which are designed to make him and his decisions more appealing and sympathetic [Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Description of <italic>Night Shift</italic>

</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Intervention: educational control</title><p>The gold standard educational strategy in trauma is <italic>Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS)</italic>. The American College of Surgeons have developed ATLS, a 2-day seminar, to teach participants: to assess the patient&#x02019;s condition rapidly and accurately; to resuscitate and to stabilize the patient; to determine if the patient&#x02019;s needs exceeds the capabilities of their facility; to arrange for the definitive care of the patient, and to ensure that optimal care if provided. The course includes lectures on key topics (e.g. assessing the severity of the injury), instruction on skills relevant to the initial stabilization of the patient (e.g. putting in chest tubes), and practice using standardized patients. Participants must complete a multiple choice test before and after the course to receive certification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>We will use a two-part educational program as a surrogate. First, physicians review the <italic>myATLS</italic> app, designed and produced by the American College of Surgeons as an adjunct to the ATLS course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The app includes a review of each chapter of the ATLS textbook, a series of videos demonstrating common trauma procedures, and clinical resources including checklists for use at the bedside. Second, physicians use the <italic>Trauma Life Support MCQ Review</italic>, an app designed to help students prepare for the ATLS exam. It includes 550 multiple-choice questions with correct answers and explanations. We will ask physicians to review the <italic>myATLS</italic> app and then complete questions in the <italic>Trauma Life Support MCQ Review</italic>, spending at least 1&#x000a0;h on the combined tasks.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Data sources and management</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Interventions</title><p>We will install <italic>Centrify</italic> on each iPad that we distribute, an app that tracks usage of programs, to measure how long physicians spend on their assigned apps (adherence). Data from this app will download daily to a secure server hosted by the University of Pittsburgh. In addition, the <italic>Night Shift</italic> application collects data on each player&#x02019;s behaviors and actions (e.g. disposition decisions) during game-play. These data will be summarized using Google Analytics and then downloaded to the server.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Outcome assessment</title><p>After completing their assigned interventions, subjects will log into a website to complete a virtual simulation designed to replicate the task environment of an Emergency Department at a non-trauma center. The primary outcome of the clinical trial will be performance on the simulation, measured as the physician&#x02019;s rate of under-triage (proportion of severely injured patients not transferred to a trauma center). We previously collaborated with a gaming company (Breakaway Ltd; Hunt Valley, MD) to develop a 2-D simulation to assess physician decision making in trauma triage [Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>]. The simulation has both internal reliability as well as construct validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Most importantly, in prior studies, we found that physicians make similar decisions for trauma patients on the simulation as they do in real-life. Performance on the virtual simulation will be transmitted from the website to a secure server hosted by the University of Pittsburgh.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Screen shots of virtual simulation. Description of data: We show examples from the simulation. <bold>a</bold> Each case included a 2-D rendering of the patient, a chief complaint, vital signs, a history, and a written description of the physical exam. Physicians had 42&#x000a0;min (a simulated 8&#x000a0;h shift) to complete the ten cases. A clock at the top right of the screen helped track the passage of time. <bold>b</bold> Physicians could manage patients by selecting from a pre-specified list of 250 medications, studies, and procedures. <bold>c</bold> We included audio-visual distractors, including nursing requests for help with disruptive patients to increase the verisimilitude of the experience</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12873_2016_108_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig>
</p><p>The simulation has ten cases: three severely injured patients (one representative, two-non-representative), three minimally injured patients, and four non-trauma cases. Users must evaluate and manage these cases over 42&#x000a0;min, simulating a busy 8-h ED shift. New patients arrive at pre-specified (but unpredictable) intervals, so that physicians must manage multiple patients concurrently. Each case includes a 2-D rendering of the patient, a chief complaint, vital signs which update every 30&#x000a0;s, a history, and a written description of the physical exam. In the absence of clinical intervention by the player, severely injured patients and critically ill distractor patients decompensate and die over the course of the simulation.</p><p>Physicians manage patients by selecting from a pre-specified list of 250 medications, studies, and procedures. Some orders affect patients&#x02019; clinical status, leading to corresponding changes in their vital signs and physical exam. Other orders generate additional information, presented as reports added to the patients&#x02019; charts. The cases end when physicians either make a disposition decision (admit, discharge, transfer) or the patient dies.</p><p>There are two versions of the simulation: a control and a cognitive load condition. As mentioned earlier, cognitive load is expected to increase reliance on heuristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. When poorly calibrated, these heuristics result in predictable errors. By varying cognitive load, we can assess the effect of the interventions on physicians&#x02019; heuristics (a secondary outcome measure). Specifically, a comparison of the difference in performance under control and cognitive load conditions of physicians in the two arms of the study will provide insight into the mechanism by which the interventions work. If physicians exposed to <italic>Night Shift</italic> demonstrate both lower under-triage rates, and less effect of cognitive load on performance, we can infer that <italic>Night Shift</italic> functions by recalibrating heuristics. In contrast, if physicians exposed to <italic>Night Shift</italic> perform better in general but have the same rate of errors when working under cognitive load as physicians exposed to the educational module, then we can infer that <italic>Night Shift</italic> functions through some alternative mechanism.</p><p>We operationalize cognitive load in two ways. First, we vary the complexity of the non-trauma cases. In the control arm, non-trauma cases have routine complaints (e.g. appendicitis), arrive hemodynamically stable, and do not deteriorate over the course of the simulation. In the cognitive load arm, non-trauma cases are critically ill (e.g. have sepsis), arrive hemodynamically unstable, and deteriorate without adequate management. Second, we reduce the number of rooms that physicians can use to evaluate patients, from eight in the control arm to four in the cognitive load arm, which increases the number of distractors that they receive.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Questionnaire to assess personal characteristics</title><p>Each physician will complete a questionnaire querying age, sex, race, ethnicity, educational background (board certification, ATLS certification, years since completion of residency).

We will use a randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy of that video game with that of a standard educational control intervention of similar duration and complexity.</p><p>The National Academy of Medicine recently issued a white paper, <italic>Improving Diagnosis in Health Care</italic>, in which it highlighted the influence of heuristics on diagnostic error [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Existing interventions have had limited success at ensuring that physicians use well-calibrated heuristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. These efforts typically focus on increasing physicians&#x02019; use of rational processes either implicitly by disseminating rule-based algorithms or explicitly by promoting reflective reasoning. The latter encourages physicians to take a step back, to consider their diagnoses more carefully, and to recognize the shortcomings of judgments made based on intuition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. A few studies recommend removing the clinician altogether from the decision problem, shifting the burden of judgment to decision tools or external consultants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. All of these proposals ignore the potentially adaptive nature of heuristics. Although heuristics can result in predictable errors, they arise because they often produce useful responses to complex questions with relatively little cognitive effort. An intervention that can improve physician heuristics would leverage the strengths and talents of the people at the center of the diagnostic challenge: physicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p>Our intervention focuses on the representativeness heuristic, whereby individuals&#x02019; initial judgment of a case reflects how typical it seems of a process. In the trauma triage setting, reliance on representativeness would lead to correct diagnoses of, say, cases involving penetrating injuries, but not cases involving seemingly more benign processes (e.g. falls for elderly individuals). The intervention uses stories designed to immerse participants in playing the role of a physician concurrently solving both clinical and personal problems. It draws on three bodies of research finding the potential power of stories to facilitate behavioral change. One research thread finds that stories facilitate processing and retaining new data, called narrative engagement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In our context, the stories are meant to help physicians integrate their simulated experience into the mental models evoked in normal clinical practice. The second body of research finds that practicing desired behaviors in a safe environment helps people to gain warranted feelings of self-efficacy, providing the confidence needed to deploy newly acquired skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The third body of research finds that stories can engage players cognitively and emotionally in ways that transcends traditional forms of education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>We also exploit the growing appeal and prevalence of serious game technology. Video games are a $22 billion/year industry. 155 million Americans play video games. The average gamer is 34&#x000a0;years old. Twenty-seven percent of players are older than 50; 44&#x000a0;% are female. A majority (80&#x000a0;%) of US households own a device to play games [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Statistics do not exist on the number of physicians who play video games. However, states and professional organizations already require between 20 and 50&#x000a0;h a year of continuing medical education as a condition for licensure. Games could easily become part of the roster of accepted educational activities.</p><p>This study has potential limitations including its design as a two-arm trial. An alternative design would include four arms: control, game, educational module, game plus educational module. However the constraints of the budget and concerns about recruiting sufficient numbers of physicians precluded this approach. Second, we plan to use a convenience sample to test the efficacy of the game, which may not represent the population at-large. If the game does affect performance, we can then proceed with testing its effectiveness. However, if we find no effect even among motivated participants, it provides a rationale to explore other methods of promoting behavior change. Third, we have chosen an educational intervention without any proven effectiveness. However, the structure (a didactic program that informs users of the clinical practice guidelines accompanied with multiple choice questions to reinforce key decision priniciples) reflects that of ATLS, the current gold standard for continuing medical education in trauma. Furthermore, the American College of Surgeons promotes <italic>myATLS</italic> as an adjunct to ATLS, giving the intervention additional face validity.</p><p>In conclusion, physician heuristics play an important role in diagnostic error. Altering heuristics is a challenge, with no effective solution. Serious games have attributes that make them well suited to address this problem, and therefore offer a new approach. We have chosen the special case of trauma triage to test the effect of a video game intervention to recalibrate heuristics. The results of this trial will contribute to the literature on physician quality improvement and the efficacy of video games as behavioral interventions.</p><p>Trial Status: Recruiting</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ANOVA</term><def><p>Analysis of variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ATLS</term><def><p>Advanced Trauma Life Support</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ED</term><def><p>Emergency Department</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the many University of Pittsburgh faculty and staff who playtested prototypes of the game.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health through grants DP2 LM012339 (Mohan) and NHLBI-K08-HL122478 (Wallace).
