Previously, low absolute bioavailability was observed for the 1500-mg oral tablet formulation, resulting in a less than dose-proportional increase from the 1000-mg dose. Furthermore, high variability of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters within cohorts was suggested to be associated with differences in body weight. This open-label, randomized, 4-period, crossover, single-dose phase I study in healthy individuals compared the PK, safety, and tolerability of free base oral tablets under fasted or fed conditions with intravenous and oral mesylate salt solution of GSK1322322 under fasted conditions. Absolute bioavailability of GSK1322322 1500-mg free base tablets under fasted conditions, fed conditions, and oral mesylate salt solution was 57%, 77%, and 92%, respectively. Moderate-fat/calorie food intake increased area under the concentration&#x02013;time curve (AUC<sub>0&#x02212;&#x0221e;</sub>) by 36%, maintained maximum observed concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), and delayed time to C<sub>max</sub>. It appeared that AUC<sub>0&#x02212;&#x0221e;</sub> decreased with body weight, whereas clearance increased. GSK1322322 administration resulted in only mild-to-moderate adverse events. These results support future clinical investigations of the free base oral tablet formulation of GSK1322322 1500&#x02009;mg after intake of a moderate-fat/calorie meal, including further investigation of a potential weight-based dosage change.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>GSK1322322</kwd><kwd>peptide deformylase</kwd><kwd>free base</kwd><kwd>mesylate salt solution</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is increasing, creating a need for the development of novel antimicrobial agents that target essential bacterial processes.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Peptide deformylase (PDF), a metalloprotease that removes the N-formyl group present in all newly synthesized bacterial polypeptides, is required for proper protein maturation in prokaryotes but not mammalian cells.<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> However, PDF is an unexploited clinical target as a novel antimicrobial agent.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> GSK1322322 is a potent inhibitor of PDF, discovered by a combination of structure-based drug design and iterative medicinal chemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>).<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Chemical structure of GSK1322322.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cpdd0004-0049-f1"/></fig><p>Several phase I studies have investigated single- and repeat-dose administration of different formulations of oral and intravenous (IV) GSK1322322.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The tablet formulation of GSK1322322 at 1500&#x02009;mg demonstrated lower absolute bioavailability (56%) and higher variability than expected from the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of the previously described single-dose powder-in-bottle formulation.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Also, preliminary population PK analysis based on four phase I studies suggests that the PK of GSK1322322 was affected by body weight as individuals with lower body weight had lower clearance and thus higher systemic exposure than those with higher body weight.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Therefore, optimization of exposure after administration of the oral tablet formulation of GSK1322322 and more robust data on PK versus body weight are important for suggesting potential dose modifications.</p><p>In the present study, the PK, safety, and tolerability of a free base tablet, an oral mesylate salt solution, and an IV mesylate salt solution of GSK1322322 administered as a single 1500-mg (free base equivalent) dose were assessed in healthy volunteers.

Female volunteers were eligible for enrollment if they were of non-childbearing potential and excluded if they were lactating or pregnant, as determined by positive human chorionic gonadotropin test at screening or before dosing. Volunteers were excluded from the study if they met any of the following conditions: regularly used alcohol and drugs of abuse; had hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV infection; had used an investigational drug within 30 days, five half-lives, or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational drug (whichever was longer) before the day of dosing; or had been exposed to &#x0003e;4 new chemical entities within 12 months before the day of dosing. Concomitant prescription or non-prescription drugs (including vitamins and dietary or herbal supplements) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug was a potential enzyme inducer) or five half-lives (whichever was longer) were prohibited before the first dose of study medication until completion of the follow-up visit. Use of antacids, vitamins, and iron supplements was strictly prohibited within 7 days before the first dose of study medication and for the duration of the trial, including follow-up. Volunteers were advised not to take any medications that were sensitive substrates for the CYP3A4/5 enzyme from 14 days before baseline visit to the last study assessment.

Weight stratification was based on the modeling-based prediction with allometrically scaled body weight as a covariate on clearance up to a body weight of &#x0223c;65&#x02009;kg, whereas clearance in patients &#x0003e;80&#x02009;kg seems unchanged relative to weight.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The study was conducted at a single study center (DaVita Clinical Research, Minneapolis, MN) and was approved by an institutional review board (Independent Investigational Review Board, Inc., Plantation, FL) in accordance with International Conference on Harmonization guidelines.

In periods 1, 2, and 3, the 72-hour sample was the predose sample in periods 2, 3, and 4, respectively, while period 4 had a blood draw at 72&#x02009;hours solely to complete its sampling schedule. Some predose samples had measurable concentrations due to incomplete washout; however, the majority of the measurable concentration values were &#x0003c;0.1% of the following C<sub>max</sub> and hence were included in the non-compartmental PK analysis. Plasma and GSK1322322 concentrations were determined by Worldwide Bioanalysis (GlaxoSmithKline) using high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Briefly, the analytical system consisted of an Acquity UPLC&#x000ae; system (Waters, Milford, MA), Acquity UPLC HSS T3 analytical column (1.8-&#x003bc;m particle size, 2.1 by 50&#x02009;mm; Waters, Milford, MA; mobile phase was 0.1% formic acid in water and 90/10 acetonitrile/methanol), and a mass spectrometer (API 4000&#x02122;/API 5500&#x02122;; Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex, Framingham, MA) with turbo ion spray, operated in positive mode. GSK1322322 was extracted from samples by protein precipitation with acetonitrile after the addition of an isotopically labeled internal standard ([<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>
<sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub>]-GSK1322322). Extracts were analyzed by UPLC&#x02013;MS/MS using a TurboIonSpray&#x000ae; interface and multiple reaction monitoring. Mass-to-charge ratios of 480&#x02013;267 were monitored for GSK1322322. Using a 25-&#x003bc;L aliquot, the lower limit of quantification for the plasma assay was 5.0&#x02009;ng/mL, and the upper limit of quantification was 5000&#x02009;ng/mL. The standard curve for GSK1322322 in plasma was linear (r<sup>2</sup> &#x02265;0.999) over the concentration range of 5&#x02013;5000&#x02009;ng/mL. The accuracy ranged from &#x02212;4.0% to 9.5%. The within- and between-run precision values (percent coefficient of variation [% CV]) were &#x02264;6.0% and &#x02264;4.4%, respectively. Computer systems used to acquire and quantify data included Analyst software (version 5.1, Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex) and Study Management System 2000 (version 2.3, GlaxoSmithKline). Pharmacokinetic analyses of plasma GSK1322322 concentration&#x02013;time data were conducted using non-compartmental Model 200 (for extravascular administration) or Model 202 (for IV administration) of WinNonlin&#x000ae;, version 5.2 (Pharsight Corporation, St Louis, MO). The following plasma GSK1322322 PK assessments were calculated: AUC from time zero extrapolated to infinity (AUC<sub>0&#x02212;&#x0221e;</sub>), maximum observed plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), time of C<sub>max</sub> (T<sub>max</sub>), terminal phase half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>), systemic clearance (CL; IV formulation only), apparent clearance after oral dosing (CL/F; oral formulations only), volume of distribution by the area method (V<sub>area</sub>; also called V<sub>z</sub>; IV formulation only), and volume of distribution at steady state (V<sub>ss</sub>; IV formulation only). Absolute bioavailability was determined by comparing oral AUC<sub>0&#x02212;&#x0221e;</sub> with IV AUC<sub>0&#x02212;&#x0221e;</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety Assessments</title><p>Safety was assessed by observed AEs and changes over time in hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, vital signs, and electrocardiograms.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SAS&#x000ae; Version 9 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). Baseline and demographic characteristics, safety data, and PK parameters were summarized using descriptive statistics. The PK parameters AUC and C<sub>max</sub> and the factor dose were log<sub>e</sub>-transformed before the analyses. After log-transformation, AUC<sub>0&#x02212;&#x0221e;</sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02212;t</sub>, and C<sub>max</sub> of GSK1322322 were separately analyzed using a mixed effects model as appropriate to the study design, fitting fixed effect terms for period and regimen and treating subject within sequence as a random effect. Point estimates and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the differences of PK parameters of treatments of interest (fasted-oral mesylate salt solution, fed-oral mesylate salt solution, fasted-IV, fed-IV, oral mesylate salt solution-IV, fed-fasted) were constructed using the residual variance. Point and interval estimates were then exponentially back-transformed to construct point and 90% CI estimates for the ratios of PK parameters of interest (fasted to oral mesylate salt solution, fed to oral mesylate salt solution, fasted to IV, fed to IV, oral mesylate salt solution to IV, fed to fasted). Estimates of within-subject variability for AUC<sub>0&#x02212;&#x0221e;</sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02212;t</sub>, and C<sub>max</sub> of GSK1322322 were provided, where CVw (%)&#x02009;=&#x02009;sqrt[exp(MSE)&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;1]&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;100 and MSE was the residual mean squared error from the model. CVw (%) represented a pooled measure of within-subject variability across regimens. Below limit of quantification values were entered as zero and included in the calculations of the means.</p><p>For the relative bioavailability assessment, T<sub>max</sub> was analyzed non-parametrically using the Wilcoxon matched pairs method to compute the point estimate and 90% CI for the median difference for each comparison of interest listed above.</p><p>Sample size was based on preliminary estimates of the coefficient of variation of AUC<sub>0&#x02212;&#x0221e;</sub> (17.16%) and C<sub>max</sub> (36.34%) of a single 1500-mg GSK1322322 dose. Twenty-four subjects would provide a precision of 8.55% for AUC<sub>0&#x02212;&#x0221e;</sub> and 18.5% for C<sub>max</sub>, where precision represents the half-width of the 90% CI. On the basis of the upper bound of the 90% CI for the CV for AUC<sub>0&#x02212;&#x0221e;</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> of 33.5% and 75.9%, respectively, a sample size of 24 subjects provided a precision of 17% for AUC<sub>0&#x02212;&#x0221e;</sub> and 38.4% for C<sub>max</sub>, where precision represents the half-width of the 90% CI.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 24 healthy volunteers enrolled in the study and were randomized to receive four single doses of GSK1322322 with a washout period of 3 days between doses.

Compared with the absolute bioavailability of the mesylate salt solution, the free base tablet showed a lower absolute bioavailability under fasted conditions (57%), consistent with 56% absolute bioavailability observed with the 1500-mg dose from a tablet formulation in a previous phase I study.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Furthermore, absolute bioavailability of the free base tablet increased with food intake (77% vs. 57% in fed and fasted states, respectively). The relative bioavailability of the free base tablet after a meal was 136% compared with a fasted state, an increase similar to the previously published corresponding values for the free base tablet of GSK1322322 1000&#x02009;mg (119%).<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The within coefficient of variation of AUC and C<sub>max</sub> were 22% and 39%, respectively, suggesting that GSK1322322 has moderate variability. These combined results indicate that a moderate-fat/calorie meal increased the extent of absorption of the free base tablet, suggesting that the increased bioavailability of a 1500-mg free base tablet administered with food may be important when considering future GSK1322322 regimens.</p><p>Although there has been no official regulatory decision yet, GSK1322322 has the characteristics of a Biopharmaceutics Classification System Class 2 compound indicating high permeability and poor solubility. High permeability of GSK1322322 is exemplified by the 92% absolute bioavailability of the mesylate salt oral solution. However, the solubility drops from 40&#x02009;mg/mL at pH 3.5 to approximately 0.5&#x02009;mg/mL at pH 6.5 in fasted state-simulated intestinal fluid. Therefore, the enhanced absorption associated with concomitant food intake observed in this study may result from increased GSK1322322 solubility in the lower pH, higher fluid volume environment, and longer gastric residence time of the fed stomach. Glucuronidation appears to be a major metabolic pathway but is unstable in the gastrointestinal tract, possibly because of low solubility at higher pH in the intestines.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Previous studies had shown within-cohort variability of AUC and CL that could potentially be explained by differences in body weight.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In the current study, the cohorts were stratified by weight with most volunteers weighing &#x0003c;60 or &#x0003e;80&#x02009;kg, the body weight groups that were less represented in previous studies. In general, CL (data not shown) and V<sub>area</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3</xref>A) increased, and correspondingly, AUC<sub>0&#x02212;&#x0221e;</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> decreased, with increase in body weight. However, this study is limited by the small population size, and further analysis, especially PK modeling based solely on data from IV administration, would be important to assess the need for a weight-based change in dosing scheme.</p><p>The present study was designed on the basis of PK data from previous phase I studies. To determine absolute bioavailabilities of oral GSK1322322 formulations in this study, PK parameters after 60-minute IV infusion of GSK1322322 1500&#x02009;mg were assessed. This regimen resulted in linear PK at single-dose increases between 500 and 3000&#x02009;mg. The AUC<sub>0&#x02212;&#x0221e;</sub> (75.4&#x02009;&#x000b5;g&#x02009;h/mL) and C<sub>max</sub> (28.6&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/mL) in this study (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>) were similar to the corresponding values of single 1500-mg doses reported in the first-time-in-human IV study (61.0&#x02009;&#x000b5;g&#x02009;h/mL and 25.5&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/mL, respectively).<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>All AEs reported during the study were mild to moderate in intensity. One volunteer was withdrawn because of an AE (bronchospasm) during the IV administration period, which was drug related, resolved 3&#x02009;minutes after the infusion was terminated, and required no medical treatment. Follow-up interviews with the individual revealed that the AE could have been associated with anxiety in receiving IV study medication. The quick resolution of the bronchospasm argues against a possible allergic reaction to the drug. Sensitivity of teeth was commonly reported across all treatments in this study. Sensitivity of teeth has been previously reported after administration of a single 3000-mg dose of GSK1322322, repeat dosing at 500 and 1000&#x02009;mg (in an elderly cohort), and after 1500-mg IV administration (data on file).<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The symptoms were mostly mild and resolved spontaneously. High rates of throat irritation and nausea were reported only after administration of the oral mesylate salt solution (52% and 26%, respectively), likely due to the apparent bad taste of the solution. Throat irritation and nausea were not observed with other formulations in this study and were not commonly reported in previous studies.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrated favorable PK and safety profiles for the free base tablet formulation of GSK1322322 1500&#x02009;mg after intake of a moderate-fat/calorie meal, suggesting that GSK1322322 has the potential to become the first-in-class PDF inhibitor for clinical use as an oral tablet. Further interrogation of weight differences on PK parameters will be evaluated in future clinical programs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Funding was provided by GlaxoSmithKline for the conduct of the study and for editorial support in development of this manuscript.
