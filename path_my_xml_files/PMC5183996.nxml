Electrocardiograms were recorded on all visits. To mimic clinical shared decision-making, the patients were randomized not to a single drug, but to a sequence of the SGAs under investigation. The first drug in the sequence defined the randomization group, but the patient and/or clinician could choose an SGA later in the sequence if prior negative experiences with the first one(s) in the sequence had occurred. The study focuses on the time of, and actual use of the SGAs under investigation, that is until treatment discontinuation or change, in order to capture the direct medication effects on the QTc interval. Secondary intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses were also performed.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 173 patients, with even distribution among the treatment groups, underwent ECG assessments. About 70% were males and 43% had never used antipsychotic drugs before the study. The mean antipsychotic doses in milligrams per day with standard deviations (SD) were 3.4 (1.2) for risperidone, 13.9 (4.6) for olanzapine, 325.9 (185.8) for quetiapine, and 97.2 (42.8) for ziprasidone treated groups. The time until discontinuation of the antipsychotic drug used did not differ in a statistically significant way among the groups (Log-Rank test: <italic>P</italic> = 0.171). The maximum QTc interval recorded during follow-up was 462 ms. Based on linear mixed effects analyses, the QTc interval change per day with standard error was -0.0030 (0.0280) for risperidone; -0.0099 (0.0108) for olanzapine; -0.0027 (0.0170) for quetiapine, and -0.0081 (0.0229) for ziprasidone. There were no statistically significant differences among the groups in this regard. LME analyses based on ITT groups (the randomization groups), revealed almost identical slopes with -0.0063 (0.0160) for risperidone, -0.0130 (0.0126) for olanzapine, -0.0034 (0.0168) for quetiapine, and -0.0045 (0.0225) for ziprasidone.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>None of the SGAs under investigation led to statistically significant QTc prolongation.

Differential propensities for QTc prolongation among second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) have been claimed, but lack substantial support from pragmatic studies. None of the SGAs was statistically significantly prolonging the QTc interval in the present pragmatic study, and no statistically significant differences among the drug groups were found for this outcome. Even in a situation with a substantial proportion with QTc prolongation at admittance any of the SGAs under investigation seemed to be safe choices in the present study.</p><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a rare, but dramatic event in patients with schizophrenia, with a standardized mortality rate of 4.5 compared to in the general population[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Antipsychotic drugs have been implicated as conveying a risk for SCD because of their potential for prolonging the heart rate corrected QT (QTc) interval of the electrocardiogram (ECG) which may lead to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia [Torsade de pointes (TdP)], ventricular fibrillation and heart arrest[<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Some agents have even been temporarily or permanently withdrawn from the market[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Indeed different propensities for inducing QT interval prolongation have been reported for various antipsychotic drugs, with ziprasidone among the worst offenders[<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Several methodological issues have been raised however, with regards to how well differences, derived mainly from phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs), might translate into usual clinical practice[<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Potential limitations include the numerous exclusion criteria, with a risk of selection bias, and the short durations of most RCTs of antipsychotic efficacy. To combat some of the limitations, the pragmatic trial of effectiveness design has been launched in an attempt to deliver more relevant data for clinical decision makers. Effectiveness studies are characterized by heterogeneous samples and study settings more representative of usual clinical practice[<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Pragmatic studies investigating the different propensities of QTc prolongation of second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) in real-life settings are rare, but we have previously reported QTc interval findings from a pragmatic RCT of SGAs in acutely admitted patients with psychosis and followed for 24 mo[<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Only the intention-to-treat (ITT)/overall change of the QTc intervals during the full 24-mo follow-up were analysed in this study, regardless of the many drug changes that occurred during the study. Furthermore, we have recently published cross-sectional data on the proportion with prolonged QTc intervals at admittance and at the end of the acute treatment phase approximately 4 wk later[<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. About a quarter of the sample had borderline prolonged or prolonged QTc intervals at admittance, with a reduction of this proportion at follow-up. The substantial proportion with prolonged QTc intervals could theoretically be at particular risk if the &#x0201c;wrong&#x0201d; antipsychotic drug were initiated, and we want to compare risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and ziprasidone head-to-head in a consecutive sample in the period from initiation in the acute phase of psychosis, up until discontinuation, in order to determine which drug, if any, could be considered the safest in this regard.</p><p>Accordingly, the primary aim was to investigate whether differential influence on the QTc interval existed among the SGAs under investigation. We hypothesized that ziprasidone would increase the QTc interval during follow-up, and that the QTc interval change in those receiving ziprasidone would be different from that in the other drug groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The Bergen Psychosis Project (BPP) compared the effectiveness of olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone with a 2-year follow-up[<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The study was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics (RCMRE) and the Norwegian Social Science Data Services, and was sponsored independently of the pharmaceutical industry. The study investigates the first allocated antipsychotic drugs until treatment discontinuation or change to another antipsychotic drug, to isolate the effect of the drugs on the QTc interval.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients</title><p>The RCMRE allowed eligible patients to be included before informed consent was provided. This enabled a clinically representative sample. Adults acutely admitted for psychosis were consecutively recruited when antipsychotic drugs in the oral formulation were indicated. A symptom threshold for inclusion was set at &#x02265; 4 on at least one of the following items of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)[<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]: Delusions, Hallucinatory behavior, Grandiosity, Suspiciousness/persecution, or Unusual thought content. Diagnostic valuations were conducted by the clinical staff (psychiatrists or specialists in clinical psychology) according to the ICD-10 (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en">http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en</uri>). Exclusion criteria were: Antipsychotic drugs in the oral formulation not indicated, manic psychosis because of concerns of reduced cooperativeness with assessments, other behavioral or mental reasons causing inability to cooperate, language barrier towards spoken Norwegian, electroconvulsive therapy indicated, or established clozapine treatment. Drug-induced psychosis was not an exclusion criterium when antipsychotic drug therapy was deemed indicated by the attending clinician.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatments</title><p>Eligible patients were offered the first SGA in a random order of the investigational agents. The result of the randomization was known both to the clinical staff and the patient. The SGA that was first on the list defined the randomization group. The treating physician and/or the patient could select the next drug in the sequence if the first could not be used. Reasons for unselecting the first drug included contraindications, or negative experiences with previous use of the drug. In theory, contraindications or previous negative experiences could also include QTc-interval pathologies but this was not the case for any of the patients screened for eligibility. The same procedure was repeated if the next drug could not be used. Doses, concomitant use of other medicines, or antipsychotic drug changes were determined by the attending physician or psychiatrist. Combinations of antipsychotic drugs were not allowed except in some sporadic instances.</p><p>Importantly, the present study does not focus on the randomization groups but on the actual chosen SGA from the sequence. We have previously reported that there were no statistically significant differences among the randomization groups regarding the percentage choosing a different SGA from the first one on the list[<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical assessments</title><p>Assessments were conducted at baseline, at discharge or at 6-9 wk from baseline if still admitted, and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 mo from baseline. Other than the PANSS interview, the assessments included the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia[<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the Clinical Drug and Alcohol Use Scales[<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], the Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness scale[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and the Global Assessment of Functioning-Split Version, Functions scale[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Blood was collected between 8 am and 10 am for analysis of serum levels of the antipsychotic drugs.</p><p>Until discharge, or at 6-9 wk at the latest the study procedures were part of the hospital&#x02019;s routine quality project for patients with psychosis, and the procedures were part of the patients&#x02019; medical record. At this point, the patients were asked for informed consent to be contacted and included in the follow-up project.</p><p>At follow-up visits 3, 6, 12, and 24 mo after baseline, measures of psychopathology, blood sampling, and ECG recordings were repeated, and all medications were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>QTc assessments</title><p>The QTc interval estimation was done automatically by a Philips Pagewriter Trim II cardiograph at admission and discharge/at 6-9 wk when the patient was still in hospital. At later visits after discharge, a Schiller AT-101 cardiograph was used. Bazett&#x02019;s formula was used for correction. The ECG recording at baseline was done before the first administration of the study SGAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The baseline data of were analyzed using IBM SPSS software, version 23.0, and by means of exact <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> tests (categorical data) and one-way ANOVAs (continuous data). These tests were also applied for baseline comparisons between those lost to follow-up before retesting and those with repeated tests.</p><p>Power analyses were run in R (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org">http://www.r-project.org</uri>) by means of linear mixed effects (LME) models. The baseline QTc interval and standard deviations were based on the results of the model used in the present study, and slope differences between the groups deemed to be of clinical significance were used in the model. The drop-out rate was set to 3% per month, and 10000 simulations were run. Based on the power analysis the study should have 96% power to detect 2.5% QTc interval differences between the drug groups with 30 subjects in each group.</p><p>Changes in the QTc intervals were analysed in R by means of LME models (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org">http://www.r-project.org</uri>)[<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Fixed effects, <italic>i.e</italic>., systematic differences between the drugs, gave different linear slopes in the four treatment groups, technically a group-by-time interaction with a potential for baseline group differences. The sensitivity analyses based on the ITT groups had no baseline group differences as this was based on the randomization groups. The model calculated overall QTc interval change per day during follow-up that could be visually represented by the slope of a linear curve with time plotted against the QTc interval. The model utilized all available data and handled different numbers of visits by individual patients, as well as differences in time between visits. The LME has demonstrated superior statistical power in studies where missing data cannot be ignored[<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], as is the case in the present study. Benjamini-Hochberg adjustments were applied for multiple comparisons. An &#x003b1;-level = 0.05, two-sided, was used as a threshold for statistical significance. The statistical review of the study was performed by a biomedical statistician.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 226 patients were included in the study, and 173 patients underwent ECG assessments.

These differences did not persist at later visits.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>SGAs are among the groups of drugs that have a bad reputation for prolonging the QTc interval, and thereby possibly leading to fatal incidents of TdP and SCD. This issue has received a lot of attention in previous studies, and differential propensities for QTc interval prolongation have been found among antipsychotic drugs[<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The implications for usual clinical practice are unresolved, however, as the experimental designs of the majority of the studies may limit the generalizability of their findings[<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The present study was conducted as close to clinical practice as possible by virtue of its pragmatic design. It aimed to investigate whether or not four first-line SGAs used in the acute treatment of psychosis increased the QTc interval - and if so - is there a basis for a ranking between these drugs, regarding the risk of such a prolongation?</p><p>The main results of the study were that none of the SGAs prolonged the QTc intervals in a statistically significant way, and that no statistically significant QTC interval differences among the SGAs were found. These findings do not support some of the previous literature, including the comprehensive meta-analysis of 15 different antipsychotics by Leucht and collaborators[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], where ziprasidone was among the top three antipsychotics with regards to QTc prolongation. A recent review also finds that ziprasidone prolongs the QTc interval, but with heterogeneous results in different studies[<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Theoretically, short term treatment with antipsychotics may not give sufficient plasma levels to influence the heart cells but we find this unlikely as both mean doses and serum levels for the SGAs under investigation were in the therapeutic range. However, pharmacokinetic estimations are beyond the scope of the present study. Indeed, we have previously demonstrated that the distinct side-effect profiles derived from phase III RCTs are dampened in pragmatic studies[<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Moving beyond the mean scores one might suspect the existence of a subgroup of patients with pathologically prolonged QTc intervals, but not numerous enough to alter the mean scores substantially. All the more there is reason to believe this group could be clinically very important. During follow-up, however, none of the participants had critically prolonged QTc intervals as the maximum QTc interval recorded was 462 ms. In a previous study we reported that approximately 25% of the patients had prolonged QTc intervals, or borderline prolongations, at the time of admittance to hospital[<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Most likely, this prolongation was due to other causes than the use of SGAs including agitation, because many of the patients had never used antipsychotic drugs before, or those who had used SGAs had, in many instances, discontinued their antipsychotics some time before hospital admission. Taken together, the present study seems to indicate that, even in a situation with a substantial proportion of patients with QTc prolongation at admittance, any of the SGAs under investigation are safe choices.</p><p>Some limitations to the study need consideration. For one, attrition was substantial during follow-up. Two hundred and twenty-six patients participated in the study, but only 173 patients underwent ECG assessments because of feasibility issues in the acute phase. There were no statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics between those with and without ECG assessments except a small difference in alcohol consumption patterns. Therefore, selection bias seems unlikely. Furthermore, no baseline characteristics showed statistically significant differences between those with only baseline tests and those with repeated tests. Finally we chose LME statistics for the longitudinal data analyses to handle drop-outs and missing data.</p><p>Even though the BPP was a randomized study, the randomization was not to a single SGA but to a sequence of all of the four SGAs under investigation to mimic the clinical process of choosing a drug for a patient as closely as possible. The first drug in the sequence defined the randomization group, but about 20% chose a different SGA than the one first on the list in the sequence, although this proportion did not differ in a statistically significant way among the groups, as accounted for in a previous publication[<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In the present study, we focused not on the randomization groups, but on the drugs actually used as we wanted to investigate the direct drug effects on the ECG. However, this also violates the effects of randomization and could introduce bias. However, the 173 patients divided themselves by chance into fairly even large groups for the four SGAs, and the only statistically significant baseline difference among the drug groups was a higher PANSS positive subscale score in the olanzapine group. Also no statistically significant differences in times to discontinuation were found. Finally, the sensitivity analyses based on ITT groups gave almost identical results. Significant bias therefore seems unlikely.</p><p>ECG assessments were carried out using two automatic measuring devices which both used Bazett&#x02019;s formula for heart rate correction of the QT intervals. As this formula has a tendency to overcorrect QT intervals at higher heart rates, Frederica&#x02019;s formula is now the preferred one. Both the stress associated with acute admissions as well as psychotropic medications themselves could increase the heart rate in patients with mental illness. Nielsen and collaborators[<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] described incident differences in measurements by 12 ms when the heartrate was &#x0003e; 70/min (Bazett&#x02019;s 475 ms <italic>vs</italic> Frederica&#x02019;s 463 ms), and increases to 24 ms (508 <italic>vs</italic> 484) when the heartrate was &#x0003e; 80/min. Accordingly, the use of Bazett&#x02019;s formula in our study may have led to higher QTc measures compared to if Frederica&#x02019;s formula had been used. Ideally, all the recordings should have been carried out with the same equipment, but for practical reasons this was not possible. We have no reason to suspect that this should introduce bias, and believe the use of the same correction formula is the most important factor for comparable recordings.</p><p>The use of concomitant medication was equally distributed among the groups. However, it cannot be ruled out with certainty that the effects of other drugs may have influenced the slopes of the QTc recordings. The direction of any such influence would be hard to predict. There were more men than women in the study, which may have led to somewhat lower mean QTc total intervals as women have longer QTc intervals than men. This should not have introduced bias to the group comparisons as gender was evenly distributed among the drug groups. The risperidone group had higher serum prolactin levels at baseline and the first follow-up, but not thereafter. Any influence on the QTc interval from the prolactin level could only be speculative.</p><p>Despite the above mentioned limitations we conclude that our findings do not support that any of the SGAs under investigation leads to QTc prolongation. No statistically significant differences among the SGAs were found, and all the drugs on which the study is based may be considered to be safe alternatives in this regard.</p></sec><sec><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We wish to thank the Division of Psychiatry, Haukeland University Hospital for financial support, and the Clinical Departments for their enthusiasm and cooperation.</p></sec><sec><title>COMMENTS</title><sec><title>Background</title><p>The ability of antipsychotic drugs to prolong the QT interval of the electrocardiogram (ECG) has been associated with increased risk of sudden cardiac death in patients using these drugs.</p></sec><sec><title>Research frontiers</title><p>Although differential propensities among various antipsychotics for QT prolongation have been found, the generalizability to, and hence the clinical relevance of these findings in, the population have been questioned.</p></sec><sec><title>Innovations and breakthroughs</title><p>The majority of clinical antipsychotic drug trials typically include highly selected patient samples where concomitant illicit drug use, other mental or physical comorbidities, or the need for other psychotropics are exclusion criteria.
