Two commonly used RGP lens designs include the Soper contact lens and the Rose-K contact lens. The Soper lens system includes bicurve lenses based on sagittal depth. The smaller lenses are used for smaller, centrally located cones. The large diameters are used for oval cones. The Rose-K lens for Keratoconus is a proprietary design. It is a multi-spherical posterior design with aberration control aspheric optics across the back and front optic zone diameters.</p><p>We performed a randomized comparative trial evaluating the efficacy and acceptability of Rose-K Contact Lens and Soper Contact Lens in Keratoconus.

All patients were enrolled after an informed consent and approval of Institutional Ethics and Review Committee was taken. Sixty eyes were enrolled in the study from the Contact Lens Services of our center. The enrolled subjects were new cases of primary Keratoconus aged between 15 year and 40 years with keratometric values ranging between 48 and 60 diopters (D). Patients suffering from vernal keratoconjunctivitis, hydrops, giant papillary conjunctivitis, dry eye, ocular surface disorder, corneal scarring or any other corneal pathology as well as patients who had undergone some surgical intervention for Keratoconus in the past were excluded from the study. Patients were randomized into two groups based on the type of contact lens fitted: Rose-K group (<italic>n</italic> = 30 eyes) and; Soper Group (<italic>n</italic> = 30 eyes). Patients in each group were further subdivided into one of the 3 subgroups according to keratometric value, subgroup 1: 48-52 D (Rose-K group = 12 eyes; Soper = 12 eyes), subgroup 2: 52-56 D (Rose-K = 10 eyes; Soper = 9 eyes), subgroup 3: &#x0003e;56 D (Rose-K = 8 eyes; Soper = 9 eyes).

We believe that the increased comfort with Rose-K lens is due to the improved multicurve design of Rose-K and also due to the ability of the edge design to be further modified.

Furthermore, at the 3 month follow-up, the glare acuity with Rose-K lens was significantly better than Soper lens in subgroup 1. This suggests that in mild Keratoconus, Rose-K provides better glare acuity than the Soper contact lens.</p><p>Both the contact lens showed a significant improvement in contrast sensitivity at 3 month follow-up. However, Rose-K lens was significantly better than the Soper Lens at 1 month (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001) and 3 months (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002) follow-up.

Thus, less chair time was required in fitting the Rose-K CL when compared with the Soper CL.

In a retrospective study, it was found that 5 mm average K reading on axial map was the best predictor of final BC of Rose K lens in Keratoconus.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> However in our study in both groups, 3 mm average K had a stronger correlation than the 5 mm average K. We could also derive an equation to judge the BC of the lens from the average keratometric value at 3 and 5 mm in both groups. This can reduce the time required in finalizing the contact lens fitting.</p><p>There are some limitations of this study. We did not look into the socio-economic aspects and education levels of the patients. This is more applicable in developing countries like India where the Soper design is desired by many patients due to its low cost in comparison to Rose K lens. Further, a study with a longer follow-up may be more helpful as it may determine the drop outs and the reasons amongst the contact lens users as well as the need for replacement of any type of contact lens. A long-term study will also be useful to determine the changes in the corneal and ocular surface caused by the two lenses.</p><p>Bourne <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> evaluated the effect of rigid contact lens on the endothelium of corneal transplants for Keratoconus. They<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> found that compared with normal controls the changes in the endothelium were more severe in the abnormal cornea. Though there was no significant change in the endothelial density, the contact lens group developed polymegethism. In our study, we found that though there was a decrease in the endothelial count in both groups, the change was not significant. However, a long-term study on the endothelial changes may provide better information.</p><p>The study concludes that both the contact lenses provide comparable improvement in visual acuity in cases of Keratoconus. However, Rose-K lens provides better comfort, quality of vision and requires less chair time in comparison to the Soper lens. It may be attributed to improved multicurve design and the option of edge modification with Rose-K lens.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Krachmer</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name><name><surname>Feder</surname><given-names>RS</given-names></name><name><surname>Belin</surname><given-names>MW</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Keratoconus and related noninflammatory corneal thinning disorders</article-title><source>Surv Ophthalmol</source><year>1984</year><volume>28</volume><fpage>293</fpage><lpage>322</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">6230745</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rabinowitz</surname><given-names>YS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Keratoconus</article-title><source>Surv Ophthalmol</source><year>1998</year><volume>42</volume><fpage>297</fpage><lpage>319</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9493273</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Buxton</surname><given-names>JN</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Contact lenses in Keratoconus</article-title><source>Contact Intraocul Lens Med J</source><year>1978</year><volume>4</volume><fpage>74</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rabinowitz</surname><given-names>YS</given-names></name><name><surname>Garbus</surname><given-names>JJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Garbus</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>McDonnell</surname><given-names>PJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Contact lens selection for Keratoconus using a computer-assisted videophotokeratoscope</article-title><source>CLAO J</source><year>1991</year><volume>17</volume><fpage>88</fpage><lpage>93</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">2049828</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rosenthal</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Cotter</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Clinical performance of a spline-based apical vaulting Keratoconus corneal contact lens design</article-title><source>CLAO J</source><year>1995</year><volume>21</volume><fpage>42</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7712606</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Yeung</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Eghbali</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Weissman</surname><given-names>BA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Clinical experience with piggyback contact lens systems on keratoconic eyes</article-title><source>J Am Optom Assoc</source><year>1995</year><volume>66</volume><fpage>539</fpage><lpage>43</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7490414</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref7"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mandathara</surname><given-names>Sudharman P</given-names></name><name><surname>Rathi</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Dumapati</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Rose K lenses for Keratoconus &#x02013; An Indian experience</article-title><source>Eye Contact Lens</source><year>2010</year><volume>36</volume><fpage>220</fpage><lpage>2</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20539234</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref8"><label>8</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Belin</surname><given-names>MW</given-names></name><name><surname>Fowler</surname><given-names>WC</given-names></name><name><surname>Chambers</surname><given-names>WA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Keratoconus.
