Attention disturbance, which leads to impaired concentration and overall reduced cognitive functions, is strongly associated with stroke. The clinical efficacy of acupuncture with Baihui (GV20) and Shenting (GV24) as well as computer-assisted cognitive training in stroke and post-stroke cognitive impairment have both been demonstrated in previous studies. To date, no systematic comparison of these exists and the potential beneficial effects of a combined application are yet to be examined. The main objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the effects of computer-assisted cognitive training compared to acupuncture on the outcomes of attention assessments. The second objective is to test the effects of a combined cognitive intervention that incorporates computer-assisted cognitive training and acupuncture (ACoTrain).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>An international multicentre, single-blinded, randomised controlled pilot trial will be conducted. In a 1:1:1 ratio, 60 inpatients with post-stroke cognitive dysfunction will be randomly allocated into either the acupuncture group, the computer-assisted cognitive training group, or the ACoTrain group in addition to their individual rehabilitation programme. The intervention period of this pilot trial will last 4&#x000a0;weeks (30&#x000a0;minutes per day, 5&#x000a0;days per week, Monday to Friday). The primary outcome is the test battery for attentional performance. The secondary outcomes include the Trail Making Test, Test des Deux Barrages, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, and Modified Barthel Index for assessment of daily life competence, and the EuroQol Questionnaire for health-related quality of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial mainly focuses on evaluating the effects of computer-assisted cognitive training compared to acupuncture on the outcomes of attention assessments. The results of this pilot trial are expected to provide new insights on how Eastern and Western medicine can complement one another and improve the treatment of cognitive impairments in early stroke rehabilitation. Including patients with different cultural backgrounds allows a more generalisable interpretation of the results but also poses risks of performance bias. Using standardised and well-described assessments, validated for each region, is pivotal to allow pooling of the data.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinical Trails.gov ID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=NCT02324959&#x00026;Search=Search">NCT02324959</ext-link> (8 December 2014)</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Computer-assisted cognitive training</kwd><kwd>Acupuncture</kwd><kwd>Attention deficits</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Cognitive impairment is a condition characterised by mental deficits. Cognitive deficits occur in more than half of stroke survivors and are deemed to be more important determinants of health- and quality of life-related outcomes than physical disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The most common type of cognitive deficit is impaired attention, with a point prevalence between 46&#x000a0;% and 92&#x000a0;% reported in acute stroke survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These deficits along with difficulties to concentrate and continued decline in cognitive functions severely affect quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Attention is closely related to and involved in most cognitive functions, such as most processes of perception, memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], planning and acting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], speech perception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], spatial orienting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and social problem-solving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Accordingly, attention can be considered a basic competence necessary for most practical and intellectual performances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Consequently, it cannot be isolated, whether conceptually or functionally, from other cognitive functions. It has further been shown that these deficits impair certain motor abilities and inhibit motor learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Impairments of attention are a major problem for people with stroke and affect rehabilitation outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A systematic review on cognitive training for post-stroke attention deficits, which included six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 223 participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], suggested that there may be a short-term effect on attention abilities. However, due to the methodological limitations of the reported studies, there was insufficient evidence to support or refute the persisting effects of cognitive rehabilitation on attention or on functional outcomes.</p><p>Acupuncture is one of the main modalities of treatment in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and has a practical history of more than 2000&#x000a0;years in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture on cognitive impairment (function) after stroke. Twenty-one trials with a total of 1421 patients were included. The cumulative findings suggest that acupuncture has positive effects on cognitive function after stroke. According to TCM theory of acupuncture, the Du meridian plays an important role in treating attention problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Baihui (GV20) and Shenting (GV24) are two main acupoints from the Du meridian which are believed to activate the spirit. Previous studies with experimentally induced cerebral ischemia injuries in rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] showed improved learning and memory abilities after 4&#x000a0;weeks (five times per week, 30&#x000a0;minutes per time) of Baihui (GV20) and Shenting (GV24) acupuncture treatment. However, the existing literature of the effects of acupuncture on cognitive impairment after stroke describes general cognitive functions and do not provide sufficient evidence as to how acupuncture could improve attention deficits after stroke.</p><p>The aims of our study are: (1) to observe the effect of acupuncture combined with RehaCom training on cognitive dysfunction (in particular attention disturbances) after stroke, and (2) to test efficacy compared to conventional treatment combined with acupuncture or conventional treatment combined with RehaCom training.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>The study is designed as an international multicentre study with randomised, controlled group comparators and blinded assessors. The study will be an explorative pilot study with three parallel treatment groups: computer-assisted cognitive training (CaCT), acupuncture (AP), and intervention that incorporates CaCT and AP (ACoTrain, ACT). Three neurological rehabilitation clinics from three different countries will be involved in recruitment, treatments and assessments. Each clinic will aim to recruit 20 inpatients currently recovering from their clinically first-ever stroke. Attention performance will be assessed as the primary study outcome in all groups before and after a 4-week intervention. The multicentric body of trial centres consists of specialised neurological rehabilitation centres from China (Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, A), Switzerland (Reha Rheinfelden, B), and Germany (m&#x00026;i Fachklinik Herzogenaurach, C).

However, it is also expected that high heterogeneity regarding affected cortical areas and functional ability within the study groups of stroke patients will occur. The number of participants will therefore not suffice to conduct a full-scale study but are thought to provide a basis for estimation of the effects and planning of a larger follow-up study, if proven feasible.</p><p>The aim is to recruit 20 patients per clinic (N<sub>total</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;60). The results will be used to compute sample size and conduct a power calculation to plan the full-scale follow-up study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participant and recruitment</title><p>The participants will be recruited from three inpatient stroke rehabilitation units from (1) Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Subsidiary Rehabilitation Hospital; (2) m&#x00026;i-Fachklinik Herzogenaurach; and (3) Reha Rheinfelden. Patients will be identified and recruited via the clinic&#x02019;s database according to diagnosis and medical referral. Respective medical personnel will be asked to invite patients from the population under investigation. Patients who express a general interest in taking part in the study will meet with one of the study personnel to receive all necessary information in oral and written form. After a 24-hour consideration period, the patient will be reapproached by the investigator to resolve any uncertainties and to be invited to sign informed consent after an assessment of eligibility criteria.

Following insertion, a 1-minute stimulation of the acupuncture point will be performed using bidirectional rotation of the needle&#x02019;s sleeve. This provokes a sensation known as Deqi, which is commonly described as a &#x02018;glowing&#x02019; feeling. The needle will be kept in this position for 30&#x000a0;minutes. The described manipulation will be repeated every 10&#x000a0;minutes and the needles are withdrawn after the fourth manipulation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Computer-assisted cognitive training with RehaCom</title><p>It is important to note that the CaCT group will use RehaCom (Hasomed Inc., Magdeburg, Germany, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hasomed.de">http://www.hasomed.de</ext-link>) in our study. Three rehabilitation centres from different countries will be involved in our study. Traditional cognitive training programs are delivered in individual or group format by a trained instructor, and differ primarily with regards to trained abilities, length and frequency of training, and specific strategies practiced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Therefore, it is better to use a computer-assisted training program to ensure patients from different centres will all receive equal treatments. RehaCom has been translated into different languages and extensively used in cognitive rehabilitation following the relevant diseases, for example, stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>The software has five different therapeutic programs aimed at restoration of attention, memory, executive functions, or visual field.

To approach intensity of attention, the RehaCom task called &#x0201c;Attention and Concentration&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Vigilance&#x0201d; will be used. For selectivity the RehaCom task called &#x0201c;Alertness&#x0201d; for reaction behaviour and reactivity will be used. Divided attention will use the task called &#x0201c;Divided Attention Training 1 and 2&#x0201d;. Each task will start at the lowest difficulty level to allow progression according to the patient&#x02019;s abilities. Only &#x0201c;Attention and Concentration&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Divided Attention Training 2&#x0201d; will begin with level 4 and 2 respectively.

The TMT provides information on visual search, scanning, speed of processing, mental flexibility, and executive functions. The TMT consists of two parts. TMT-A requires an individual to draw lines sequentially connecting 25 encircled numbers distributed on a sheet of paper. Task requirements are similar for TMT-B except the person must alternate between numbers and letters (e.g. 1, A, 2, B, 3, C, etc.). The score on each part represents the amount of time required to complete the task(s). The Chinese version of the TMT-B uses Digit Symbol Coding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

The original version consists of two parts, one time-independent, the second limited to 10&#x000a0;minutes. For the purpose of this study, only the latter will be applied. The test is presented on a large A3 sheet that displays two symbols in the header line and a 40&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;25 matrix with a total of 1000 randomly assorted symbols similar to those in the header line. Only a few of the matrix symbols are identical to the header symbols. The participant is instructed to mark only identical ones. Test duration is 10&#x000a0;minutes. After every minute, the assessor notes the progress of the participant indicating the line and column. After 10&#x000a0;minutes, the amount of falsely marked symbols is counted using a template solution. The task is to work as quick and accurately as possible. The parameters to quantify this are: time needed (if less than 10&#x000a0;minutes), total amount of correct markings per minute, amount of omitted symbols per minute, amount of wrong markings per minute, sum of errors per minute (omitted or wrong marking), percentage of errors, and range of performance (highest frequency of correct markings per minute to lowest frequency of correct markings per minute).</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIH-SS)</title><p>The NIH-SS is a standardised assessment of neurological functions in the acute phase of stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].

Sustaining attention is a prerequisite of motor relearning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], which is essentially the mechanism of functional recovery after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The traditional neurocognitive strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] used to improve attention deficit after stroke often result in incomplete resolution, and thus, more effective adjuvant strategies are needed.</p><p>Acupuncture focuses on the global cognitive function from the holistic conception of TCM, while the RehaCom cognitive training concerns the specific impaired cognitive functions, which need to be trained from the viewpoint of symptomatic treatment. However, the cognitive impairment after stroke is so complex that it needs an integrated method.</p><p>The aims of our study are to compare CaCT and AP efficacy in terms of attention improvement after stroke and to investigate the potential effect of a combination of both (ACT). The participants will have the study treatment added to their existing rehabilitation program and will be assessed for changes in attention (intensity, selectivity, and divided attention) at 4&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>Although CaCT and AP both have shown to have beneficial effects on overall cognition in various studies, they have not been compared directly and for specific attentional performance. This is the first study of its kind that assesses attention-specific outcomes for both methods and not only compares the methods but also advances into new approaches where two methods well accepted in two very different cultures are combined to complement one another. The multicentric approach allows more generalisable interpretation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] of the results and the usage of standardised and cross-culturally adapted assessments allows comparison and pooling of all study data coming from different trial centres.</p><p>Given its small sample size, the pilot study will mainly produce results to provide estimation of large-scale study sample sizes and test the feasibility of the international multicentric study design and its management. A further limitation of the study is the distinction of effects caused by the conventional training as opposed to the experimental interventions. However, the primary aim of the study is a parallel comparison of three experimental interventions rather than comparison to conventional therapy. Hence, no control group receiving no experimental intervention was included for methodological and ethical reasons. This allowed the same amount of time spent with a therapist in all intervention groups. That is deemed as an important measure to prevent bias, particularly when patients cannot be blinded to interventions, as it exposes each group to the same amount of potential placebo effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p>The ACoTrain study intends to assess stroke patients of very different cultures (Asia and Europe). Great care has been taken to select cross-culturally adapted and validated assessments to allow pooling of the final data. The assessments are designed to measure the same construct, independent of cultural, educational, or lingual differences. Further, patients in early stroke rehabilitation often present with impairments in other areas than cognition. When assessing cognition, however, these impairments may confound the outcomes, as the task at hand cannot be isolated from other motor and cognition functions. Effects of motor disabilities, impaired perception (e.g. visual deficits, reduced proprioception), or other cognitive defects (e.g. memory) and lack of motivation can limit the interpretability of attention assessments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The eligibility criteria were carefully selected to exclude such confounding factors. To further promote internal validity of the assessments, trained and experienced neuropsychologists will educate all assessors accordingly. To achieve this, a series of assessment training workshops for all personnel involved in the study have been held twice prior to the beginning of the study (March 2014 and August 2014 in Germany and China respectively).</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Trial status</title><p>Ongoing recruitment.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ACoTrain</term><def><p>ACT, intervention that incorporates CCT and AP</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AEs</term><def><p>Adverse events</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AP</term><def><p>Acupuncture</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BL</term><def><p>Baseline</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Ca CT</term><def><p>Computer-assisted cognitive training</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DCC</term><def><p>Data Control Centre</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>e-CRF</term><def><p>Digitalised Case Report Form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EQ-5D</term><def><p>EuroQol Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p>Intention-to-treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KAP</term><def><p>Short aphasia test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MBI</term><def><p>Modified Barthel Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MoCA</term><def><p>Montreal Cognitive Assessment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NIH-SS</term><def><p>National Institute of Health Stroke Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>p-CRF</term><def><p>Paper Case Report Form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCTs</term><def><p>Randomised controlled trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAEs</term><def><p>Serious adverse events</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SOPs</term><def><p>Standard operating procedures</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T2B</term><def><p>Test des Deux Barrages</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TAP</term><def><p>Test for Attentional Performance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TCM</term><def><p>Traditional Chinese Medicine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TIDieR</term><def><p>Template for Intervention Description and Replication checklist and guide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TMT</term><def><p>Trail Making Test</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p>Jia Huang and Michael A.
