This analysis evaluated the incidence of narcotic use and abdominal adverse events among patients with short bowel syndrome receiving teduglutide. <italic>Materials and Methods:</italic> Pooled data from patients who received &#x02265;1 dose of teduglutide 0.05 mg/kg/d (n = 77) or placebo (n = 59) in either of 2 randomized, double-blind, phase III studies were analyzed. <italic>Results:</italic> Of 136 patients, 52 (38%) received narcotics. GI adverse events occurred more often among patients who received narcotics than among those who did not (abdominal pain, 51% vs 21%; nausea, 42% vs 11%; abdominal distension, 17% vs 8%; vomiting, 19% vs 6%). Logistic regression analysis indicated that the probability of GI adverse events was significantly increased in patients with narcotic use (<italic>P</italic> = .0009). In contrast, teduglutide treatment, as well as the interaction between teduglutide and narcotic use, did not affect the probability of GI adverse events. <italic>Conclusions:</italic> These results suggest that patients with short bowel syndrome receiving narcotics have chronic GI complaints independent of teduglutide treatment. Data included in this analysis were derived from ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00081458 and NCT00798967 (EudraCT 2004-000438-35 and 2008-006193-15).</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>intestinal failure</kwd><kwd>peristalsis inhibition</kwd><kwd>intestinal absorption</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1-0148607116663481"><funding-source id="funding1-0148607116663481"><institution-wrap><institution>Research funded by NPS Pharmaceuticals, Inc, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Shire plc.</institution><institution-id/></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-0148607116663481"><title>Clinical Relevancy Statement</title><p>Adverse gastrointestinal effects are a common complaint among patients with short bowel syndrome receiving narcotic agents as well as those receiving teduglutide, making it unclear the extent to which these complaints are attributable to narcotic agents or teduglutide.

Within both groups, most GI AEs were more common among patients who received narcotics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607116663481">Table 1</xref>). The finding that a higher percentage of patients who received narcotics (compared with those who did not) reported events of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting suggests that, independent of teduglutide, chronic GI complaints in patients with SBS receiving narcotics are a major symptom management challenge. Regression analysis supported the findings and showed that narcotic use significantly increased the probability of GI AEs in both the teduglutide and placebo study arms.</p><p>The major limitation of this report is that it is a post hoc analysis in what is, by necessity in this rare disease state, a relatively small number of patients. Furthermore, the assessed narcotic agent data were limited to the details captured in the concomitant medication record. The scope of interpretation of these findings should be curtailed because of the lack of analysis determining whether a specific GI symptom is attributable to the underlying disease state or some combination of treatment-related factors. In addition, the temporal relationship between the initiation of the concomitant narcotic agent and the onset of GI AEs was not determined in this analysis. GI AE onset could have been separated from initial administration of a narcotic drug. Similarly, rather than preceding a GI event, narcotic agents could have been administered in response to a GI AE. Nonetheless, the current analysis indicates that narcotic use is associated with an increased probability of a GI AE in patients with SBS.</p><p>One of the precautions for the use of teduglutide is that it has the potential to increase absorption of concomitant oral medications.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-0148607116663481" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> It was beyond the scope of this analysis to determine whether early reduction of narcotic dosage might have prevented possible GI AEs, particularly abdominal pain.
