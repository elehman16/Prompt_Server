When the continuation of pregnancy represents a risk to the mother and/or the fetus that is greater than the risk of interrupting the pregnancy, labor induction is an option to allow vaginal delivery to occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Misoprostol is a synthetic analog of prostaglandin E1 that acts on the cervix and on the uterine smooth muscle, facilitating cervical dilatation and promoting uterine contractions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The first time misoprostol was used for labor induction involving a live fetus was in 1991, and the drug was administered vaginally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Since then, various studies have been conducted using different dosage regimens and progressively lower doses. In addition, some studies have compared misoprostol with other methods of labor induction, while others have compared different routes of administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Currently, the most commonly used and recommended routes of administration of misoprostol for labor induction in routine practice are the vaginal and oral routes at a dose of 25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]; however, the sublingual and buccal routes have also been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">The administration of misoprostol by the sublingual route was proposed as a means of reducing the number of vaginal examinations, thus providing patients with greater comfort and possibly also reducing rates of maternal and fetal infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition, evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of the drug showed a higher peak of plasma concentration in pregnant women receiving misoprostol by the sublingual route compared to oral or vaginal administration or to vaginal administration with the addition of water. The bioavailability of the drug is also greater with the use of the sublingual route of administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. On the other hand, plasma levels are maintained over a longer period of time when the vaginal route is used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">In a systematic review that included five clinical trials comparing misoprostol administered sublingually and vaginally, no statistically significant difference was found between the two groups in relation to the rate of vaginal deliveries within the first 24&#x000a0;h, to the rate of uterine hyperstimulation or to the Cesarean section rate. There was, however, a greater risk of tachysystole in the sublingual misoprostol group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Those authors also suggested that this effect was dose-dependent; i.e. the higher the dose of misoprostol, the greater the risk of tachysystole. In that study, the lowest dose used was 25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Therefore, those authors concluded that new studies would have to be conducted to determine the lowest effective dose with the fewest side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">This study was proposed with the objective of comparing the effectiveness and safety of the sublingual administration of 12.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of misoprostol (low dose) with the vaginal administration of 25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of misoprostol (standard recommended dose) for the induction of labor involving a live, full-term fetus.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Setting and recruitment</title><p id="Par12">The study will be developed at the <italic>Instituto de Medicina Integral Prof. Fernando Figueira</italic> and at the Assis Chateaubriand Maternity Teaching Hospital of the Federal University of Cear&#x000e1;, all of which are situated in northeastern Brazil.

One of the principal limiting factors to this process is the condition of unfavorable cervix, which hampers induction of labor, consequently contributing towards increasing Cesarean section rates.</p><p id="Par30">Misoprostol has been identified as a safe, inexpensive, easily administered option for the induction of labor, with satisfactory results. An experimental study showed that sublingual misoprostol at a dose of 25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g appears to be effective and is associated with greater maternal satisfaction when used to induce labor in women with an unfavorable cervix. Nevertheless, the rate of tachysystole remains high; therefore, further studies need to be conducted to determine the dose and the ideal time interval between doses to minimize the side effects. The only clinical trial conducted using a 12.5-&#x003bc;g dose of misoprostol administered sublingually, a non-randomized open study with no control group, reported that labor was successfully triggered in 90% of cases, with vaginal deliveries occurring in 60% of the women, and a rate of 47% of vaginal deliveries within 24&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. When the frequency of tachysystole found in that study is compared with others in which misoprostol was used vaginally at a dose of 25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, a similar frequency of between 4.3 and 6.6% is found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The systematic review available in the Cochrane Library suggests a global rate of uterine hyperstimulation with no changes in fetal heart rate of 11% with 25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of misoprostol, even higher than that found in an earlier review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Nevertheless, these results are based on a single clinical trial with no control group, thus rendering comparisons difficult.</p><p id="Par31">We believe that with this low dose of misoprostol administered sublingually the frequency of tachysystole or uterine hyperstimulation may be lower than that found with the habitual 25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g dose of misoprostol administered vaginally, since it was suggested in a systematic review that the occurrence of tachysystole with misoprostol is probably dose-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">This will be the first randomized, controlled clinical trial to compare the effectiveness and safety of misoprostol at a dose of 12.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g administered sublingually with the currently standard 25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g dose administered vaginally every six hours to induce labor in pregnant women with a full-term live fetus. Expectations are that the present study will clarify whether the rate of tachysystole during labor induction is lower in the sublingual group. On the other hand, no differences between the groups are expected with respect to uterine rupture, need for analgesia during labor, need for operative vaginal delivery or the rate of maternal death.</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par33">This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as: NCT01406392.
