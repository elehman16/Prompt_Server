Because of increasing life expectancies, the prevalence of ED is expected to increase by more than 30% over the next 25 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>). The prevalence and severity of ED have been shown to increase with age. The causes of ED are divided into 3 broad categories: psychogenic, organic, and mixed. Psychogenic factors are involved alone or in combination with organic causes in a substantial number of ED cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>).</p><p>Orally administered phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors have become the first-line treatment option for ED. PDE5 inhibitors have been shown to enhance erectile response in patients with ED by mediating the relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle of the penis. Nevertheless, the available approved medications for ED are often unsatisfactory, and there may be a place for alternative medicines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>).</p><p>Yohimbine (Yocon, Yohimex) is derived from an herbal remedy. It appears to boost erectile function by improving blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>). Studies have been inconclusive about its benefits, but a recent analysis of seven trials reported that between 34% and 75% of men achieved favorable results when taking 5 mg to 10 mg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>). L-arginine, while not an herb, is a naturally occurring amino acid present in foods. Studies on L-arginine have shown mixed results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>)</p><p>The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of SX (combination of yohimbine and L-arginine) in the treatment of ED.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S0001"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This trial was a 4-week, double blind study of parallel groups of patients with mild to moderate ED and was undertaken in two centers from September 2009 to December 2009.</p><sec id="S20002"><title>Participants</title><p>Forty married male patients with ED of mild-to-moderate severity were screened for the study entry. Those men aged 25&#x02013;50 who reported a minimum of a -3-month history of ED were eligible to enroll in this study. The severity of ED was based on EF domain scores on the international index of erectile function (IIEF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>). The scores of 15&#x02013;25 were considered as mild to moderate ED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>). Patients were excluded from the study if they met any of the exclusion criteria specified in the protocol. These criteria included clinically significant penile deformities or penile implants; a recent history of stroke or spinal cord trauma; unstable cardiovascular status (eg, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, or myocardial revascularization within the prior 90 days); cancer chemotherapy, or antiandrogens; or failure to achieve any erection following radical prostatectomy or pelvic surgery. No other approved or experimental medications or treatments or devices to treat ED were allowed during the study. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients participating in this study before the performance of any protocol-specific procedure occurred.</p></sec><sec id="S20003"><title>Efficacy Variables</title><p>The primary efficacy measure was the EF domain score (questions 1&#x02013;5 and 15) of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire. The additional secondary efficacy measure reported here was the response of those patients who completed week 4 of the treatment to the following Global Assessment Question (GAQ): (&#x02018;&#x02018;Have the treatment you have taken over the past 4 weeks improved your sexual function?&#x02019;&#x02019;).</p></sec><sec id="S20004"><title>Intervention</title><p>Patients were randomized to receive one capsule of SX (a product of nature Gift) or placebo on demand in a 1:1 ratio using a computer-generated code. No individual participant randomization code was revealed during the trial. Treatment codes were unblinded at the termination of the study after the database was locked. Placebo and SX were visually identical. In this double blind, multi center trial, patients were randomly assigned to receive SX (Group A) or placebo (Group B) for a 4-week study. All adverse events, reported or observed, were recorded at each visit. Routine physical examinations were also conducted at each visit.</p></sec><sec id="S20005"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>To compare the score of the IIEF at weeks 0 and 4 in the two groups, an unpaired two sided Student T test was used.

Likewise, stress and mental health problems can cause or worsen erectile dysfunction. Research on drugs for treating ED is expanding rapidly. Several alternative treatments are used to treat erectile dysfunction, but more studies are needed to ensure whether they are safe or effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>).</p><p>This study indicates that the SX is effective for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate ED as shown by improvements in both the IIEF and GAQ measures. This is the first study to evaluate SX in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate ED and so it is not possible to draw any comparisons with the results of others trials. However, there are a couple of published studies that have investigated the efficacy of combination of L-arginine and yohimbine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>). Both studies reported that on-demand oral administration of the L-arginine and 6 mg yohimbine combination is effective in improving erectile function in patients with mild to moderate ED.</p><p>The results of the present study are in line with those of the conducted studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>). Adverse events were generally mild to moderate with no drop-out as a result of adverse events. The limitations of the present study include the small number of patients and a relatively short period of the follow-up. Therefore, further randomized controlled evaluation should be undertaken.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S0010"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study indicates that SX is safe and
