Little is known, however, about the impact of these cues on neurophysiological responses during a socially threatening situation. In the current investigation we implemented a widely used paradigm to study social exclusion&#x02014;Cyberball&#x02014;to examine whether chemosensory cues signaling anxiety modulate the neuronal effects of ostracism. In a double-blind, within-subjects design, 24 healthy, normosmic participants were presented with chemosensory cues of anxiety (or control samples) and completed the Cyberball task while in a 3T fMRI scanner. Axillary sweat collected from male students awaiting an oral examination served as the anxiety cues while the chemosensory control stimuli consisted of sweat collected from the same individuals participating in an ergometer training session. The neuroimaging data revealed that under the control chemosensory condition, exclusion from Cyberball was associated with significantly higher orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex activity, which is consistent with previous studies in the field. However, when participants were primed with the anxiety sweat, the activity in these regions was not observed. Further, under exposure to anxiety cues during ostracism the participants showed deactivations in brain regions involved in memory (hippocampus), social cognition (middle temporal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus) and processing of salience (inferior frontal gyrus). These results suggest that successful communication of anxiety via the chemosensory domain may moderate the experience of social exclusion. It is possible that the anxiety signals make it easier for the individuals to detach from the group, pointing to the communicative role of chemosensory anxiety cues in enhancing adjustment mechanisms in light of a distressing situation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>social exclusion</kwd><kwd>chemosignals</kwd><kwd>cyberball</kwd><kwd>ostracism</kwd><kwd>olfaction</kwd><kwd>anxiety</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="49"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Recent evidence suggests that the experience of stress can be communicated between individuals via chemosensory cues. It was proposed that upon activation of the sympathetic-adrenal medullary (SAM) system, operating closely with the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, individuals release sweat, which includes physiological markers of anxiety/fear (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">de Groot et al., 2015</xref>). In response to threat, ranging from situations inducing acute fear (such as skydiving, e.g., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Mujica-Parodi et al., 2009</xref>) to situations inducing acute anxiety (such as anticipation of an oral examination, e.g., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Prehn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Prehn-Kristensen et al., 2009</xref>), the release of &#x0201c;alarm" signals induces a partial fear state in those exposed to the chemosensory compounds (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Prehn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Mujica-Parodi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">de Groot et al., 2012</xref>). This includes fear-related behavioral and physiological outcomes such as improved cognitive performance (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2006</xref>), a bias toward identification of faces as more fearful (e.g., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Zhou and Chen, 2009</xref>), increased visual field size, and enhanced sensory intake (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">de Groot et al., 2012</xref>), to name just a few. The successful transmission of the &#x0201c;alarm&#x0201d; signals is believed to serve the adaptive function of enhancing sensory vigilance, preparing the organism for environmental dangers (for a review see <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Stevenson, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Although current support for the role of chemosensory &#x0201c;alarm&#x0201d; signals in modulating specific emotional, cognitive and physiological processes is abundant (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Stevenson, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Pause, 2012</xref>), little is known about the impact of these signals on neurophysiological responses during an <italic>actual</italic> threatening context. Given that in everyday life, exposure to chemosignals rarely occurs without a relevant contextual background, it seems critical to assess the impact of chemosensory &#x0201c;alarm&#x0201d; signals during an actual threat. Thus, the current study investigated the impact of chemosensory cues of anxiety on one of the most distressing social situations, i.e., social exclusion. Social exclusion is considered a social danger, as it threatens the basic human need to belong, which is necessary for survival and well-being (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bowlby, 1969</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Baumeister and Leary, 1995</xref>).</p><p>To examine whether chemosensory cues signaling anxiety modulate neuronal effects to social exclusion we first collected axillary sweat from donors in anticipation of an oral examination at a university, which has been linked to experiences of anxiety and the release of emotional chemosignals (e.g., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Prehn-Kristensen et al., 2009</xref>). We then employed a widely used and well-validated paradigm to study social ostracism in the laboratory environment &#x02013; Cyberball (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Williams and Jarvis, 2006</xref>). In this task participants play a ball-tossing game with two individuals (in reality simulated by the computer) in which, after a series of inclusion trials, they are eventually excluded from the game. The exclusion from Cyberball has been shown to pose a threat to the basic human needs of belonging, feeling in control, maintaining self-esteem, and experiencing a meaningful existence (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Williams, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Eisenberger, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The central question of the current research was whether the communication of anxiety via chemosensory signals modulates the neuronal responses to social exclusion. The evidence suggesting that chemosensory &#x0201c;alarm&#x0201d; cues enhance salience of fear-related socio-emotional cues (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Zhou and Chen, 2009</xref>) argues for augmented experience of social rejection following the exposure to the anxiety chemosignals. Similarly, studies pointing to emotion contagion via chemosensory &#x0201c;alarm signals&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Prehn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Mujica-Parodi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">de Groot et al., 2012</xref>) suggest enhanced contagion of anxiety in the context of a distressing situation. Further, the results showing increased fear contagion when olfactory fear is paired with another modality (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">de Groot et al., 2014</xref>) also support this hypothesis. Cumulatively, the expected increased negative experience of social exclusion could be a collective result of chemosensory anxiety and a distressing context. Alternatively, given that chemosensory anxiety cues are potential social threat signals, it cannot be precluded that they are associated with enhancing reappraisal of social rejection to promote fitness. Specifically, from an evolutionary perspective, the successful chemosensory communication of another person&#x02019;s anxiety could be expected to lead to dissociation from the negative experience of social exclusion, in order to enhance productive coping mechanisms during the potentially harmful situation. This hypothesis is supported by an abundance of animal and human studies suggesting a key role for chemosensory &#x0201c;alarm&#x0201d; cues in preparing the organism to tackle a hazardous situation via boosting physiological arousal (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Prehn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Inagaki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Pause et al., 2009</xref>) and enhancing sensory vigilance (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Zhou and Chen, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">de Groot et al., 2012</xref>). These processes may be initiated in preparation to withdraw from the threatening situation (for a review see <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Pause, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, the current study assessed the neuronal implications of exposure to chemosensory anxiety cues in a threatening context of social exclusion. Does the smell of another&#x02019;s person anxiety make us more vulnerable to social exclusion or more prepared to cope with the difficult situation? Increased activity in regions typically involved in processing of social exclusion, including anterior cingulate cortex, medial orbitofrontal cortex, insula, and in regions previously reported to play a role in the processing of socio-emotional information, including the amygdala, hippocampus, and superior temporal gyrus, would support the first answer. By contrast, diminished activity in the regions typically implied in processing of social exclusion would argue for down-regulation of negative feelings associated with ostracism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The local ethics committee at the Medical Faculty of RWTH Aachen University approved the current study.

Ten healthy males were recruited as sweat donors. Twenty-four healthy participants (14 men and 10 women) were recruited to take part in the Cyberball study, as sweat recipients. Only males were chosen to donate their sweat, as the apocrine glands in the male underarm area are known to be larger (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Doty, 1981</xref>). Both genders were included in the fMRI study, as previous research indicated that male stress sweat induces similar neural responses in both gender recipients (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Radulescu and Mujica-Parodi, 2013</xref>). All Cyberball participants (18&#x02013;29 years, <italic>M</italic> = 24.33 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.91) were screened for fMRI contraindications. In addition, we included only right-handed (Edinburgh Inventory; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Oldfield, 1971</xref>), non-smoking individuals, who did not suffer from any neurological nor psychiatric illnesses (as assessed via Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, SCID, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">First et al., 1995</xref>), nor showed signs of depression (Beck Depression Inventory; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Beck et al., 1961</xref>; <italic>M</italic> = 2.9; <italic>SD</italic> = 3.9). Participants&#x02019; olfactory function, specifically odor identification, was assessed with Monex 40 (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Freiherr et al., 2012</xref>). According to this task, all participants were normosmic (range: 27&#x02013;36, <italic>M</italic> = 31.54, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.90).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials</title><sec><title>Chemosensory Stimuli</title><p>The olfactory stimuli consisted of sweat samples collected from males undergoing an important oral examination (anxiety condition) and exercising at a stationery bicycle (sports condition). The sweat donors were invited to take part in the study if they anticipated an important oral examination about which they felt nervous. In addition, their participation was only possible if they reported to be: of Caucasian origin, heterosexual, non-smokers, aged between 18 and 40 years-old, healthy, physically fit and not taking any medication. Ten males (22&#x02013;33 years, <italic>M</italic> = 26.40 years; <italic>SD</italic> = 3.75) who fulfilled these criteria were recruited to donate their sweat. They were asked to follow several rules starting 2 days prior to the sweat donation (consistently with, e.g., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Zhou and Chen, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">de Groot et al., 2012</xref>). These included not going into the swimming pool or sauna, not consuming garlic, onion, asparagus, curry, and strongly spiced meals, not drinking alcohol and coffee, sleeping alone, not using deodorant, after-shave, scented creams, and perfumes. In addition, they were asked to use scent-less shampoo and soap provided to them by the experimenter starting 2 days prior to the donation as well as to wash their sheets with an odor-less detergent. Before the sweat donation session, they were asked to shower and wear clothes, which they had washed with an odor-less detergent provided by the experimenter. All the participants reported following these rules.</p><p>The experimental protocol for sweat collection was based on <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Prehn-Kristensen et al.&#x02019;s (2009)</xref> design. Specifically, the olfactory stimuli were gathered from donors&#x02019; underarm area with cotton pads attached with plasters for sensitive skin. In the anxiety condition, participants&#x02019; sweat was collected during anticipation of an important oral examination for 60 min. In addition, at that time, participants&#x02019; salivary samples were gathered to assess cortisol levels: 60 min before the examination (t0), 30 min before the examination (t1), right before the examination (t2), and right after the examination (t3) using salivettes (Sarstedt, Nuembrecht, Germany). Participants were further asked to complete a Self-Assessment Manikin (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bradley and Lang, 1994</xref>) and to evaluate the intensity of six basic emotions (anxiety, joy, surprise, anger, sadness, disgust; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Ekman and Friesen, 1975</xref>) on visual analog scales, 5 min before the examination. Shortly before the examination the sweat pads were removed. The sports condition consisted of a 10-min introduction to the procedure, three sets of cycling on a stationary bike, 10 min in duration each, with 10 min breaks in between the sets. The salivary samples were collected right at the beginning of the session (t0) as well as 30 (t1), 60 (t2), and 90 min after the start (t3). The Self-Assessment Manikin and Basic Emotions questionnaire were administered after the last bicycle set. Shortly after that the sweat pads were removed. Upon completion of the sweat collection procedure the pads from both sessions were cut into 8 pieces each, blinded by an experimenter not directly involved in this research, sealed in odor-free freezer bags separately per condition and stored at -80&#x000b0; Celsius until the day of the examination. The four pieces of the pads per condition, originating from 4 different donors, were defrosted 30 min before the experiment and placed in odorless teabags. During the fMRI experiment, the olfactory stimuli were attached under participants&#x02019; noses with an odorless strap for the duration of the experimental trial (see <italic>Procedure</italic> for more details). Care was taken to ensure that the chemosensory stimuli did not come into direct contact with participants&#x02019; skin. Each chemosensory stimulus was prepared and used for one participant only.</p></sec><sec><title>Cyberball Task</title><p>Participants completed the Cyberball task (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2000</xref>), a virtual ball-tossing game developed to study social ostracism. The game consists of cartoon images representing other players in the upper corners of the screen and a hand representing the participant at the bottom of the screen, tossing the ball among each other (see <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref></bold> for illustration). In the current version, the names of the players &#x02013;&#x0201c;Dieter&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Nora&#x0201d; &#x02013; were displayed on the screen next to the animated cartoons. The participants were informed that they were connected to the other two individuals over the Internet, while in reality the game was simulated by the pre-set computer program. The game included two conditions: social inclusion and social exclusion. The participants completed two rounds of the game, one each under exposure to anxiety vs. control sweat cues, presented in a counterbalanced order (see <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref></bold> for a schematic illustration of the session). For each odor, an inclusion condition was followed by an exclusion condition. Each condition started with a display indicating that the computer was connecting to the other players. The fixation cross was then presented for 15 s, after which the trial began. The participants could toss the ball to one of the two players, by pressing &#x0201c;left&#x0201d; with their index finger or &#x0201c;right&#x0201d; with their middle finger, on a response box. Each trial was set for 60 throws, with the opponents tossing the ball after 0.5&#x02013;3.0 s of waiting time (determined randomly). In the inclusion condition, participants played with the two opponents throughout the trial. Each player received the ball on approximately 50% of the throws. In the exclusion condition, the participants received the ball for the first 10 throws, after which they were excluded from the game and did not receive the ball for the rest of the trial (&#x0223c;50&#x02013;70 s) while other players tossed the ball among themselves. Following the inclusion condition participants were asked how happy and how angry they were as well as how much they liked the female player and the male player. Following the exclusion condition, participants completed the Need-Threat scale (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2000</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) assessing participants&#x02019; four fundamental needs: belonging (e.g., I felt I belonged to the group), self-esteem (e.g., I felt good about myself), meaningful existence (e.g., I felt non-existent), and control (e.g., I felt powerful). In order to maintain the cover story, the Need-Threat scale was administered to the participants only after the exclusion condition.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p><bold>Experimental Setup.

In this procedure, the first pass&#x02014;the first scan, and the second pass&#x02014;the mean scan, were substituted as reference image. Subsequently, the anatomical scans were coregistered to the mean EPI scan. The coregistered images were used for the estimation of spatial normalization parameters using unified segmentation approach (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Ashburner and Friston, 2005</xref>). The normalization parameters applied to the images transformed them into the standard space as defined by the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) and resampled the images to a voxel size of 2 mm &#x000d7; 2 mm &#x000d7; 2 mm. Lastly, smoothing of the images was conducted with a Gaussian kernel of 8mm full-width-at-half-maximum.</p></sec><sec><title>First Level Analyses</title><p>In the first level analyses, the onset and duration vectors for separate Cyberball conditions (i.e., exclusion and inclusion blocks) under the two chemosensory conditions (i.e., anxiety and sports) were convolved with hemodynamic response function (HRF). In addition, the onsets and duration vectors for the sources of noise (i.e., instructions, questionnaires, and waiting time) were modeled out in a separate regressor of no interest. The mean across time for each voxel was modeled by a constant term and low-frequency drifts were removed using a high-pass filter with a cutoff period of 512 s.

We implemented a widely used paradigm to study social exclusion &#x02013; Cyberball &#x02014; while exposing participants to chemosensory cues signaling anxiety (versus control cues). The results revealed that exposure to anxiety cues: (1) modulates the activity in the brain regions involved in processing of negative experience of social exclusion and (2) down-regulates the neuronal areas involved in socio-emotional cognition. These results suggest that chemosensory anxiety signals might diminish the experience of social exclusion and facilitate withdrawal from others in the context of a stressful social situation.</p><sec><title>Neural Responses to Ostracism under Chemosensory Anxiety Cues</title><p>Our results extend conclusions of previous studies in the area of chemosensory communication, by showing the association between the exposure to chemosensory anxiety signals and modulation of neural responses during an actual threatening situation of social ostracism. Specifically, during the episode of social rejection the presentation of chemosensory anxiety was not associated with increased activation of the regions previously implied in social rejection (e.g., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Eisenberger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Eisenberger, 2012</xref>), and also observed in our control chemosensory condition (i.e., anterior cingulate, medial frontal gyrus, orbitofrontal cortices). The lack of activation in these regions, known to be a part of the pain matrix (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Eisenberger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Eisenberger, 2012</xref>; although a recent meta-analysis by <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Cacioppo et al., 2013</xref>, challenged this perspective arguing that neural correlates of social pain are more complex than claimed by those earlier studies), might imply that chemosensory anxiety moderates the experience of social rejection observed in the control situation.</p><p>Moreover, simultaneous deactivations in the brain regions involved in memory (hippocampus), social cognition (middle temporal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus) and salience processing (inferior frontal gyrus) might suggest that successful communication of chemosensory anxiety may be linked to enhancing the preparation of the individual to tackle a stressful episode (e.g., in line with <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Mujica-Parodi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Zhou and Chen, 2009</xref>). Previous studies demonstrated that anxiety signals are driven by the activation of the SAM system (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">de Groot et al., 2015</xref>), which plays a role in the initiation of the fight/flight response. If this state is at least partially communicated to the sweat recipients, it can be presumed that anxiety signals in the context of a distressing social situation may promote the emergence of mechanisms helping to address the hazardous scene e.g., via promotion of distance from the emotional state, or withdrawal from the rejection scenes (also see <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Koenigsberg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Premkumar, 2012</xref>). Accordingly, in the current experiment, upon presentation of the anxiety signals during exclusion, the relative deactivation of the hippocampal area, the region involved in memory, especially encoding processes (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Brewer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Wagner et al., 1998</xref>), suggests diminished imprinting of negative events into the long term-memory. Given that the opposite pattern was observed in the control chemosensory condition, i.e., rejection led to stronger activity in the region, it appears that chemosensory anxiety plays a role in modulating this process in the context of a challenging situation such as ostracism. Correspondingly, the inhibition of the region encompassing middle temporal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus during the socially distressing episode under anxiety chemosensory cues implies decreased processing of social cues and diminished inclination for &#x0201c;theory of mind&#x0201d; or mentalizing processes, which could be related to increased detachment from the social experience altogether. Similarly, the modulation of inferior frontal gyrus activity in the anxiety (but not in the control chemosensory condition) suggests an influence of anxiety signals on salience processing: while being in a social situation with others (inclusion) the anxiety cues might add salience or arousal to the situation, as the chemosensory input may be perceived as an alarm signal. However, during dissociation from that situation (exclusion), the relative deactivation of the inferior frontal gyrus might be a result of the potential withdrawal from &#x0201c;social threat&#x0201d; signaled by anxiety sweat, which in turn lowers the inferior frontal gyrus activity.</p><p>Although, these results might appear counterintuitive in light of findings that anxiety cues enhance the salience of fear-related stimuli and the activation of the socio-emotional regions (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Mujica-Parodi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Prehn-Kristensen et al., 2009</xref>) they suggest that anxiety signals in an actual, distressing context might override other functions and emphasize the primary role of the chemosensory &#x0201c;alarm&#x0201d; signals in the animal kingdom which is to initiate the organisms&#x02019; withdrawal behavior from the situation appraised as threatening (e.g., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Suh et al., 2004</xref>). This interpretation is also in line with a strong body of research showing that the participants exposed to sweat collected from stress-inducing social situation show other signs of preparedness for threat such as improved cognitive performance (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2006</xref>), enhanced sensory acquisition (sensory intake, increased visual field size, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">de Groot et al., 2012</xref>) and activation of the withdrawal systems (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Prehn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Pause et al., 2009</xref>). It should be noted that the withdrawal in light of anxiety signals can be considered a positive outcome, as it facilitates the possible threatening stimulus that leads the sender of the signal to be alarmed in the first place. Future studies should investigate the interaction between the anxiety signals, processing of salience and withdrawal motivation. They should also further decode the mechanisms by which the anxiety signals might promote disconnection from the difficult social situation (e.g., what emotional or physiological tactics are employed by those exposed to the chemosensory cues). This is particularly important, because, given that the currently observed neural regions are involved in a wide range of processes, beyond social cognition and salience, it cannot be precluded, that other processes contribute to the observed results as well.</p><p>Lastly, we did not observe any gender effects in the current research, which suggests that the exposure to anxiety signals does not influence neural responses to social exclusion, as a function of gender. Although this is consistent with research showing that both males and females show similar neural activation patterns in response to the olfactory samples of male fear signals (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Radulescu and Mujica-Parodi, 2013</xref>), studies with larger samples of men and women, designed to test for gender effects specifically are encouraged, to further explore possible differences in experience of social exclusion under influence of chemosensory cues in men and women.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Although the commonly implemented Cyberball task offers a relatively high ecological validity, it suffers from several limitations when used in the fMRI scanner. Particularly problematic are: (1) the exclusion condition follows the inclusion condition and thus there is a risk of the neural responses being a result of expectancy violation (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Somerville et al., 2006</xref>), and (2) the length of the blocks leads to a less-than-optimal signal-to-noise ratio. With regards to the current experiment, the choice of a within-subject design, although beneficial for measuring intraindividual variability, might have reduced the experience of social exclusion in the second round of the game (as the repeated rejection trial following inclusion trial appears less realistic). It has to be noted, however, that the order of odor presentation was counterbalanced across participants, such that a &#x0201c;lack of belief in the second exclusion&#x0201d; problem should not occur for different odors. Moreover, several studies have indicated that even a lack of belief in the cover story or knowledge of the exclusion being simulated by the computer is nevertheless associated with the automatic response typical for ostracism (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Zadro et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Sebastian et al., 2011</xref>, also in line with <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Williams, 2007</xref>). Further, the inclusion of a control chemosensory condition, in which non-social cues were presented, would be beneficial to drawing the conclusions regarding the social chemosensory nature of the effects. Lastly, the visual depiction in the differential contrast sports exclusion &#x0003e; sports inclusion (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref></bold>) suggests a possible motion artifact in the third panel. However, given that the motion parameters were included into our design (which should minimize such effects) and the extent of this cluster is in large part in the gray matter (with peak MNI coordinates within Superior Occipital Gyrus), it appears that the activation is not solely artifact related.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The current results suggest that successful communication of anxiety via chemosensory domain is associated with down-regulation of regions typically implied in the experience of social exclusion during social ostracism. Moreover, it suggests that chemosensory anxiety cues distance individuals from the group, by inhibiting social cognition, salience and memory formation regions during a distressing social event. Cumulatively, it is possible that the anxiety signals make it easier for the individuals to withdraw from the hazardous social situation, pointing to the communicative role of chemosensory &#x0201c;alarm&#x0201d; cues in enhancing adjustment mechanisms in light of distressing circumstances.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding.</bold> This work was supported by German Research Foundation (DFG, IRTG 1328, International Research Training Group).</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group><fn id="fn01"><label>1</label><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm">http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm</ext-link></p></fn><fn id="fn02"><label>2</label><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/harvardagingbrain/People/AaronSchultz/Aarons_Scripts.html">http://nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/harvardagingbrain/People/AaronSchultz/Aarons_Scripts.html</ext-link></p></fn><fn id="fn03"><label>3</label><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.alivelearn.net/xjview8">www.alivelearn.net/xjview8</ext-link></p></fn><fn id="fn04"><label>4</label><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://marsbar.sourceforge.net/">http://marsbar.sourceforge.net/</ext-link></p></fn></fn-group><sec sec-type="supplementary material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p>The Supplementary Material for this article can be found online at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01475">http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01475</ext-link></p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><media xlink:href="Image_1.JPEG"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ashburner</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Friston</surname><given-names>K.
