Patient rehabilitation&#x02009;is necessarily also complex, requiring a personalized, multidisciplinary and highly specialized effort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Modern immune drug therapy has not convincingly delayed the progressive neurodegenerative process in MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and it remains unclear to what extent medical treatment can prevent permanent loss of functional abilities. Rehabilitation services will thus continue to be as important as pharmacological interventions for patients with MS. As such, they should be designed according to guidelines based on high quality evidence and assessed using standard evaluative methods.</p><p>Personalized rehabilitation is based on the premise that every individual is unique in terms of biology, personality, psychology, physical and social ability in combination with a unique life history formed by social circumstances, daily activities and life style. The objective of personalized rehabilitation is to improve patients&#x02019; functional status and to improve extroversion, activity and participation by strengthening the individual&#x02019;s motivation and ability to cope with the disease and related challenges for living an active life and to be active with their own rehabilitation. Personal rehabilitation takes place during meetings between active, well-prepared patients and rehabilitation teams.</p><p>MS rehabilitation is a process that from the beginning is matched to the patient's individual needs and desires and includes active involvement of both the patient and relatives. The patient has a personal coach and a trained specialist as sparring partners throughout the rehabilitation process and these provide guidance to the rehabilitation team composed to support the patients&#x02019; needs and goals.</p><p>Through coaching patient can be supported to set goals for the rehabilitation. Such goals can be two-dimensional: to achieve at positive changes in the person's life and to be realistic about achievable goals for the rehabilitation process. When the goals of the rehabilitation are determined, a unique personalized program may be developed so that the content and intensity match the patients&#x02019; needs, opportunities and constraints. The rehabilitation process can therefore be characterized as shared decision-making between the patient (and relatives) and the supervisor and the rehabilitation team with regular assessment of content in the rehabilitation program and progression in relation to results.</p><p>The Sclerosis Hospitals at Haslev and Ry were established by the Multiple Sclerosis Society in 1960 to offer specialized treatment to people with MS in Denmark. Since the early 1990s the hospitals have had annual operating agreements with the Danish health authorities and today are highly specialized hospitals with recent quality accreditation from the Danish Quality Model for Hospitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The Danish Multiple Sclerosis Hospitals provide personalized rehabilitation through a four-week inpatient program after referral by general practitioner or neurologist. A highly qualified and experienced multidisciplinary team collaborates with the patient in assessing and providing a personal program based on the individual patient&#x02019;s needs. The program includes a range of training, treatment and education focusing both on the whole person and on specific conditions caused by MS. The goal of the rehabilitation program is to improve the patients' functional capacity in all relevant dimensions: participation and activity; physical, social and psychological functioning, including the patients&#x02019; ability to cope with the disease and its symptoms and to be active in their own rehabilitation. This personalized rehabilitation program can be seen as a paradigm shift in relation to an earlier and more uniform rehabilitation program.</p><sec><title>Evidence for MS rehabilitation</title><p>A recently updated version (April 2011) of a Cochrane review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] identified ten studies of varying quality and concluded that although MS rehabilitation may have limited effect on body functions, short-term improvement in activity and participation could be observed.&#x02009;Another Cochrane review suggested that exercise therapy might be beneficial for muscle power function, exercise tolerance, mobility-related activities and mood in patients with MS, although no clear effects could be identified in relation to fatigue or perception of handicap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the Sclerosis Hospitals rehabilitation program for MS patients were investigated in a longitudinal study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], in which participants completed a single outcome instrument (FAMS questionnaire) to measure quality of life at referral, admission, discharge and up to five months after discharge. The study showed an increase in the FAMS score from referral and admission to discharge and thereby identified a statistically significant improvement in quality of life. Although the FAMS scores had decreased five months after discharge, there was still a statistically significant improvement compared with the score at referral. The study had a number of design issues that complicated assessment of the rehabilitation effort. As the study had no control group, part of the observed effect may have been due to factors other than the rehabilitation program. The considerable variation in participants' personal and disease-related factors could also have influenced the observed effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Study objectives</title><p>The aim of the planned study is to document the effects of a highly personalized rehabilitation program for MS patients as provided by the Sclerosis hospitals using a randomized controlled study design and standard generic and disease-specific outcome measures. The objective is to assess the program&#x02019;s effect on patients in terms of changes in disease-specific quality of life and to answer the following questions:</p><p>To what extent are the observed effects maintained six and twelve months after discharge?</p><p>How do different dimensions of quality of life, functional ability, mastery, coping, compliance and specific measurements of sleep, daily activities, gait, balance and activity limitations correlate?</p><p>What individual goals are set before the start of the rehabilitation?</p><p>What are the central areas and priorities of the personalized rehabilitation program?</p><p>What specific and measurable actions are included in the personalized rehabilitation program?</p><p>What effect does the rehabilitation process have on individual patient&#x02019;s goals and priorities at discharge?</p><p>To what extent do patients maintain coping, one month after discharge?</p><p>What resource use and costs occur for patients and their relatives, and for the rest of the health care system?</p><p>What is the relationship between the obtained effects and costs?</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><p>The study is designed as a pragmatic clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] of a complex intervention with personalized outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. It attempts to maximize external validity by incorporating important features of the rehabilitation intervention in real-life settings and allowing individual participant-selected treatment goals and personalized outcomes.</p><p>The study design (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) is a two-hospital controlled trial of the rehabilitation intervention with randomization to either early admission (&#x02018;intervention group&#x02019;; admission within two months after referral and clinical prescreening) or usual admission (&#x02018;control group&#x02019;; admission approximately eight months after referral to the hospital and clinical prescreening). Any differences between these two groups on observed measures between baseline and six-month assessments will be considered as effects of the rehabilitation program. As the control-group patients are admitted to the hospitals after approximately eight months from referral and prescreening, they also contribute with data to the effect of personalized rehabilitation. To observe long-term effects, data collection will be repeated after twelve months.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Patient selection for a randomized study of a MS rehabilitation program.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1472-6963-12-306-1"/></fig><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Study participants will be recruited among all patients referred to the four-week individual rehabilitation program during March 2012 to June 2013.

Patients who need time to make a final decision whether to participate in the study or not, should return a completed consent form within two days of the clinical examination.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>Randomization will be performed by staff at the admitting hospital using specialized computer software. To ensure balance between different patient groups, the randomization will be stratified according to gender, age (four groups), MS type (three groups), duration of diagnosis (five groups), EDSS score (three groups), and whether or not the patient is admitted to the hospital for the first time (two groups).</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation day</title><p>The preparation day will take place seven days prior to the scheduled hospitalization. The overall purpose of the rehabilitation program will be explained and the individual areas for rehabilitation efforts will be defined in a collaboration between the patient and an appointed supervisor who serves as both the patient&#x02019;s coach and as an 'orchestra conductor' for the rehabilitation team during the entire hospitalization. Prior to this preparation day, the patient will complete a FAMS form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], a questionnaire on diet, smoking, alcohol and exercise, and indicate which of five focus areas is most important for him/her:</p><p>Energy level, including fatigue, scheduling, breaks and structure</p><p>Cognitive function, including memory, concentration and insight</p><p>Physical function, including walking, balance, endurance, strength and mobility</p><p>Psychological well-being, including strengthening coping mechanism, confidence, self-care, cognition and adjustment processes</p><p>Personal needs, including transferring, urination, toilet visits, bathing and medication.</p><p>The patient will also complete Form one in MYCaW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].

collection</title><p>In November 2011 a pilot study was conducted to test and adjust the screening and randomization processes, and to test the online survey facility. Data were collected for 8 patients in accordance with the protocol for the two groups. This pilot study identified a number of practical challenges that were addressed in the final study protocol. The target group was expanded from only patients who were referred for the first time to also include patients who had previously been admitted to the hospitals. The inclusion criteria were tightened to require that participants should be able to respond to the computerized questionnaires. A maximum age of 65&#x02009;years and an additional exclusion criterion regarding other illnesses that could impede participation in the study were introduced. In addition, the screening for depression was changed to be part of the clinical assessment rather than being based on self-assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Register and economic data</title><p>In addition to data from questionnaires, data from routine administrative health registries will be obtained from the Sclerosis Hospitals, the national patient registry and the primary care registry (through the National Board of Health&#x02019;s research service) and the registry of primary care prescription medicine. Data available in these registries include records of actual resource consumption (number of hospitalizations, outpatient visits and consultations) and costs in terms of service fees, fees paid to health care providers and pharmacy retail prices (AUP). Data on vital status will be obtained from the national mortality registry. These data will be obtained for the years 2010&#x02013;14, i.e. for the two years prior to baseline and up to the 12&#x02009;months of follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><sec><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>Determination of the required sample size is based on known data from the previous FAMS study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The FAMS total score ranges from 0-170 and the average score at referral was 103 (SD 27). Assuming that a 5% score change indicates a clinically significant change, then the mean score should change to more than 108 i.e. that a clinically significant change requires a 5-point change.</p><p>To test a 5-point difference between two groups with 5% statistical significance (alpha) and 90% power (beta), the calculated required number of participants in each group is 613 people. With 80% power the required number of participants is reduced to 458.</p><p>If we want to test a 10-point difference, there needs to be 154 people (assuming 90% power) or 115 people (80% power).</p><p>The current study participants are expected to be a more homogeneous group than in the previous study, thus the variation in FAMS score is likely to be reduced. If the standard deviation is assumed to be 20 (instead of 27), then 252 patients will be needed in each group to identify a 5% difference with 80% power.</p><p>Taking into account correlation between repeated measurements for the same individual and assuming that the correlation between two subsequent measurements is 0.8, a 5-point difference could be identified with 160 participants (90% power) or 120 participants (80% power) in each group.</p><p>Based on these assessments a reasonable sample size is considered to be around 200 participants in each of the two groups. The Sclerosis Hospitals expects to admit 1,200 people with multiple sclerosis in the period March 2012 through June 2013. An unknown number will be either excluded from the study or will decline to participate in the study. If an insufficient number of patients has been recruited at the end of the planned inclusion period, a (short) extension of the inclusion period will be possible.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Analysis will be both descriptive and comparative.</p></sec><sec><title>Descriptive analysis</title><p>Differences in personal and disease characteristics will be compared between participants completing the study, those who fulfill the inclusion criteria but decline participation (primary drop-out), and those who participate in parts of the study but for various reasons end participation (secondary drop-out). We will investigate for specific characteristics that distinguish drop-out individuals from those who complete the study.</p><p>The included study population will be described and the intervention and control groups will be compared for eventual significant differences in personal and disease characteristics. 'Intention to treat' analysis will be used for comparing the efficacy of the two groups and longitudinal random effects regression models (panel analysis) will be applied.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparative analysis</title><p>The following comparative analysis will be conducted:</p><p>Difference from Time A1 to Time A5 for intervention group compared with the difference from Time B1 to Time B2 for control group (i.e. difference in outcomes for rehabilitation vs. no rehabilitation at 6-month follow-up)</p><p>Difference between Time A1 and Time B1 (i.e. difference between intervention and control group at baseline)</p><p>Difference between Time A1 and Times A5 and A6 (i.e. baseline vs. 6- and 12-month follow-up for intervention group)</p><p>Difference between Time B3 and Time B6 for control group (i.e. admission vs. 12-month follow-up).</p><p>Difference between A2 and A3 for intervention group (pre- vs. post-hospital rehabilitation)</p><p>Difference between B3 and B4 for control group (pre- vs. post-hospital rehabilitation).</p><p>Difference between Time A1 and Time A4 for intervention group A (baseline vs. one month after hospital rehabilitation)</p><p>Difference between Time B3 and Time B5 for control group (pre- vs. one month after hospital rehabilitation)</p><p>Changes in Mastery (heiQ) over time: Times A1, A4, A5 and A6 for intervention group compared with Times B1, B2, B5 and B6 for control group</p><p>Subgroup analyses will be performed on the individual focus areas, based on data from participants who have completed the goal-related questionnaires.</p></sec><sec><title>Time scale</title><p>Patient recruitment will be ongoing and is expected to be completed by mid-2013. Data collection is expected to last a further twelve months until mid-2014. This period will be followed by a one-year period of data analysis and manuscript preparation.</p></sec><sec><title>Blinding</title><p>It is not possible to blind participants in relation to which group they are randomized to. Similarly, it is not possible to blind the staff at the two hospitals regarding participation in the study and randomization group. Study participants will be admitted to the rehabilitation program concurrently with non-participants. This means that the intervention group and control group will be treated alongside patients outside the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and permissions</title><p>Participation in the study will have no influence on the offer of rehabilitation or its content. Patients who do not wish to participate in the study will be treated as usual. All study participants will regardless of the randomization be offered rehabilitation.</p><p>The study is organized to meet the standards of the Declaration of Helsinki and the study protocol has been approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Zealand Region (ref.no. 1-01-83-0002-07). The Danish Data Authority has granted permission to collect and store the required project information (ref. no. 2011-41-6751).

The results will contribute to further development of MS rehabilitation services and to discussions about the design and content of such service. The results will also provide additional information to health authorities responsible for providing and financing rehabilitation services.</p><p>To our knowledge this study will be one of the first randomized clinical trials to examine patient outcomes from a personalized rehabilitation program for MS. A wide variety of outcomes will be assessed immediately after discharge as well as one, six and twelve months after completion of the rehabilitation the program completion. A combination providing the basis for analyzing the complexity of MS and outcomes of a personalized rehabilitation. Cost-effectiveness will be assessed at twelve months.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>JS and AL are full-time employees of the University of Southern Denmark.
