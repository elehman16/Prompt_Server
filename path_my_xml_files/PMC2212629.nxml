Pain in at least 11 of 18 trigger point sites on digital palpation is the only condition required to fulfil the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for fibromyalgia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It is thought that fibromyalgia affects between 2.4&#x02013;3.4% of the adult population, mainly women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The cause of fibromyalgia is not known. However, the identification of this syndrome as a single clinical entity has improved the knowledge of its pathophysiology. There is evidence that the syndrome is influenced by psychiatric conditions such as anxiety or depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Additionally, reduced levels of biogenic amines, increased concentrations of excitatory neurotransmitters (both in the central nervous system nuclea and the medullary dorsal horn) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and alterations of the autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis have also been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>There is some evidence of functional GH deficiency, expressed as low insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) serum levels, in a subset of fibromyalgia patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. There is a marked decrease in spontaneous integrated GH secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Normal pituitary responsiveness to exogenously administered growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) is counteracted by hypersomatostatinemia, as evidenced by the pyridostigmine test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Futhermore, serum GH together with normal/low IGF-1 levels have been found elevated fibromyalgia syndrome, suggesting a GH resistance, and mediating a pro-inflammatory state responsible in part for the pain suffered by these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Current consensus based on clinical trials establishes that the best available fibromyalgia treatment should include drugs, rehabilitation and psychological support. Therapies with proven efficacy in fibromyalgia includes tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), and opioid analgesics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Regarding fibromyalgia patients with low IGF-1 levels, GH administration demonstrated efficacy and a good tolerability profile in a placebo-controlled study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Although other studies allowed the presence of other medications, no clinical trials have been conducted with GH as an adjuvant agent added to homogeneous active treatment in the management of severe and prolonged fibromyalgia with low IGF-1 levels so far.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients and study design</title><p>Women greater than 18 years old with severe fibromyalgia and abnormally low IGF-1 levels included in an exercise rehabilitation and psychological program and stable under standard intensive treatment for at least 6 months participated in this prospective, randomized, open-label, best available treatment-controlled clinical trial. All patients fulfilled the 1990 ACR diagnostic criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and had an IGF-1 level &#x0003c;250 ng/mL (or 1 standard deviation bellow the mean value corresponding to age and gender according to laboratory reference values). Other inclusion criteria were duration of fibromyalgia for 1 year or greater, pain in at least 16 (8 bilateral) of the 18 trigger points and a score in the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) &#x02265; 75.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were as follows: Disabling physical or mental status; previous or current malignancies, either active or inactive; intracranial space occupying lesion; any relevant endocrine disorder including diabetes mellitus; history of another pituitary disorder; previous treatment with growth hormone; other systemic or joint inflammatory rheumatic conditions; and known to be hypersensitive to somatropin or any of the excipients. Pregnant women, nursing mothers, or women with childbearing potential not using adequate contraceptive methods were also excluded.</p><p>This study was conducted in the Centro M&#x000e9;dico Teknon between May 2004 and November 2005. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and received the local institutional review board and Spanish Drug Agency (n&#x000b0;C03-0456) approvals. It has been registered (NCT00497562) at ClinicalTrials.gov. All patients gave written informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment administration</title><p>The study medication is a human growth hormone produced by recombinant DNA technology in a mammalian cell line (Saizen<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>8 mg click easy, solution for injection). Patients were randomly assigned, according to a computer-generated randomisation table, to receive either 0.0125 mg/kg/d of r-hGH subcutaneously added to standard intensive therapy or standard intensive therapy alone during one year. Standard intensive therapy (administered under stable conditions for at least 6 months before inclusion) consisted of three oral administered drugs: amitriptyline 10&#x02013;50 mg/d, fluoxetine (or other SSRI 10&#x02013;40 mg/d) and tramadol 100&#x02013;400 mg/d. These doses were individually adjusted according to the associated pathology in each case. Doses of r-hGH were adjusted after the first month according to IGF-1 plasma levels and/or the appearance of adverse events possibly related to GH.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Procedures</title><p>Prior to starting treatment administration, medical history, physical examination, selection criteria and informed consent were recorded. Additionally, an insulin tolerance test (ITT) and a cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed at baseline visit at investigator's discretion when IGF-1 levels were &#x0003c; 150 ng/mL (or 2 standard deviations below the mean value corresponding to age and gender according to laboratory reference values).</p><p>Follow-up visits were scheduled at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. At baseline and follow-up visits, investigators determined the number of tender points according to the ACR criteria for fibromyalgia and patients self-completed the FIQ, the EQ-5D, and a health-related Quality of Life Visual Analogic Scale (VAS). A blood sample was drawn at baseline and at follow-up visits to measure blood cell count, biochemical profile and other laboratory assays including GH, IGF-1, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroxine (free T4), triiodothyronine (free T3), Estradiol (E2), progesterone (P4), urinary free cortisol, insulinemia, apolipoprotein B, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, rheumatoid factor, aldolase and creatinkinase. Adverse events, concomitant medication and treatment compliance were recorded at each follow-up visit.

Fibromyalgia trigger points were assessed by an observer blind to the treatment group using the protocol described by Wolfe et al. employing 18 (9 bilateral) standardized sites and according to ACR criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Secondary efficacy endpoints included the number of patients who discontinued the study due to lack of efficacy, and the completion of spanish validated versions of FIQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and the EQ-5D Quality of Life questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] at baseline and follow-up visits. The FIQ is a 10-item instrument with good reliability and validity, that measures physical impairment, wellbeing, missed work, pain, fatigue, rest, stiffness, anxiety and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The EQ-5D consists of two parts; the Self-Questionnaire, which captures respondent's descriptions of health problems on a 5-dimensional classification of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression, and the EQ-VAS, which is a 20-centimeter visual analogue scale where the respondent rates her health state today between 0 (worst imaginable) and 100 (best imaginable). The EQ-5D has been shown to be both reliable and valid in adult patients with GH deficiency but also in multiple musculoskeletal diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Laboratory assays</title><p>Serum GH, IGF-1, TSH, free T4, free T3, E2, P4 and insuline levels were determined by automated chemiluminescent immunoassay system using a commercially available kit (IMMULITE<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>2000, DPC, Los Angeles, CA). The interassay coefficient of variation of GH and IGF-1 assays was 4.52% and 3.04%, respectively. The analytical sensitivity of GH and IGF-1 assays was 0.05 ng/mL and &#x0003c;25 ng/mL, respectively. Serum cortisol levels were also determined by chemiluminiscence using the Liason Analizer (Sorin Diagnostics S.pA, Italy).</p></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>Safety was assessed by the investigator through physical examinations, including vital signs, haematological and biochemical laboratory tests, reporting of adverse events, and local tolerability. In order to minimize the occurrence of adverse events, r-hGH doses were individually adjusted during the study according to age-adjusted IGF-1 serum levels (+ 2 standard deviation corresponding to 450 ug/dL) and the investigator discretion.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>This was a pilot study with an exploratory goal. Thus, a sample size was estimated to obtain preliminary results that would allow evaluation for further possible investigations. Quantitative endpoints are presented as mean and standard deviation (SD) or median and range. The 95% confidence interval was used to indicate the precision of an estimate. The homogeneity of variances was analysed by a Levene's test and the within-group comparisons employed t test and the non-parametric Mann-Whitney Wilcoxon test when necessary. Categorical data are presented as absolute numbers and percentages. A Chi-Square analysis or Fisher exact-test were used to compare these variables when applicable.</p><p>Regarding the main variable, the differences between groups were analyzed by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with basal number of tender points as a covariate. The time course within-group comparisons were analysed by repeated measurements analysis of variance (ANOVA). All p values were based on a two-tailed distribution, and 5% level of significance was considered. The statistical analysis was based on Intention to Treat. The SPSS statistical software package (version 12.0) was used for statistical analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The study population included 24 women with a mean age of 48.5 years, randomly assigned to r-hGH (n = 12) or control (n = 12) groups. All patients fulfilled the ACR criteria for fibromyalgia, the cut-off levels for severity (16/18 positive trigger points and FIQ&#x0003e;75) and duration of symptoms (&#x0003e;1 year), IGF-1 levels&#x0003e;250 ug/dL (three patients in the control group had IGF-1&#x0003c;150 ug/dL and undergone an ITT with a peak GH response above 5 ug/dL and had normal MNR) and completed the study.

Despite the high r-hGH dosage (mean dose 0,123 mg/Kg/d; range 0,8 mg- 1,4 mg), only 10 adverse events were reported in 4 patients, all of them in the r-hGH group (two cases each of joint pain, oedema and anemia and 1 case each of carpal tunnel syndrome, cholelithiasis, hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia). No patient discontinued the study due to adverse events. All reported adverse events were considered to be possibly related to the study treatment. All events were of mild intensity and no serious adverse events were reported during the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Fibromyalgia is a common syndrome of widespread musculoskeletal pain. Although its etiology is not known, there is evidence that fibromyalgia is influenced by several factors, including alterations of autonomic nervous system activity and HPA axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Growth Hormone secreted by the pituitary acts on the liver and other tissues to stimulate the production of IGF-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Despite IGF-1 levels are influenced by age, gender, nutrition, body mass index, chronic stress and concomitant psychiatric medication, and a low sensibility stays (between 37% and 48%, when standardized by age and gender for a controlled population) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], a subset of fibromyalgia patients with low IGF-1 serum levels (cut-off 150 ug/dL for -2SD, as in our study) but with normal insulin tolerance test has been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. We hypothesize that this could be caused by a low integrated GH secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] together with a hypersomatostatinergic tone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The standard pharmacological therapy for this syndrome includes the combination of tricyclic antidepressants, SSRI and opioid analgesics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Currently in fibromyalgia patients with low IGF-1 serum levels, the administration of r-hGH demonstrated efficacy as compared with placebo in a randomized, double-blind study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, although other studies permitted the use of other medications, no homogeneous active-controlled GH add-on studies have been performed to date in this population. Taking into account this evidence, it seemed interesting to conduct a study that evaluates the efficacy and safety of low r-hGH doses added to standard therapy in the treatment of severe (FIQ&#x0003e;75 and 16/18 positive trigger points) and prolonged (&#x0003e;1 year) fibromyalgia patients with low IGF-1 serum levels.</p><p>The present study is a prospective, randomized, open-label, best available treatment-controlled clinical trial. Even though no placebo group was included, the different overall response observed between treatment groups, as well as the intra-group differences in the r-hGH group as compared with baseline, supports the internal validity of this assay. The endpoints used in this study are well-validated outcome measures in the evaluation of fibromyalgia. The manual trigger point examination (in this case by an observer blinded to the treatment) has been historically considered a key feature in the definition of fibromyalgia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>. Likewise, the FIQ and EQ-5D have been widely used in the clinical evaluation of this syndrome and GH deficiency, respectivelly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Other associated symptoms such as fatigue were evaluated with individual FIQ subscales. The one-year duration of this study is longer than the previous GH controlled trial (9 months) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, thus avoiding the seasonal variability of fibromyalgia symptoms. At the end of the study (12 months evaluation), the mean number of tender points in the r-hGH group showed a reduction of 60% compared to the control group and 63% compared to baseline (p &#x0003c; 0.05 in both comparisons). Similar results were observed at the same time-point assessment in the FIQ, with a mean score reduction of 39.5% compared to control group and 45.7% compared to baseline (p &#x0003c; 0.05 for both comparisons). This global FIQ score improvement in the GH group is the result of a similar improvement in all the specific subscales (fatigue, pain, professional activity, tenderness, anxiety, depression, morning weakness, global well-being, laboral absenteeism, and physical dysfunction).</p><p>Regarding the quality of life self-assessment, the VAS evaluation showed a similar trend, with a 38.7% mean score improvement at 12 months in the r-hGH group versus control group and 64.9% versus baseline (p = 0.001 in both comparisons). The weighted score assessment of the EQ-5D questionnaire at the end of the study compared to baseline showed a mean change of 0.59 and 0.33 in r-hGH and control groups, respectively. This change from baseline achieved statistical significance in the r-hGH group (p = 0.017).</p><p>It is important to mention the prompt response in the r-hGH group, evidenced and maintained since the first month assessment. In our study all 12 patients in the r-hGH group experienced global improvement and 1 patient even scored 100 in the VAS scale at the end of the study. This contrasts favourably with Bennett's previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] where only 15 out of 22 patients in the GH treatment group experienced improvement. The difference in success rates could possibly be explained by the greater basal homogeneity in the present study regarding duration and severity (FIQ &#x02265; 75; &#x0003e;16/18 positive trigger points) of disease, active and concomitant pharmacological treatment, together with active rehabilitation and psychological assistance. The lack of correlation between IGF-1 and markers of clinical improvement may be due in part to the step-down r-hGH dose adjustments performed in order to avoid adverse events, and in part due to the unexpected statistical difference seen in IGF-1 levels. These differences in a small number group are due to 3 patients in the control group with values lower than 150 ug/dL (who had an ITT and MNR for this reason). IGF-1 was considered as a dyctomic variable at inclusion, not as a continuous one, therefore we cannot expect it to be a predictor marker of response.</p><p>The concomitant administration of r-hGH and standard therapy was well tolerated. No important changes in any of the clinical or laboratory parameters were observed in the two groups. A total of 10 adverse events were reported in 4 patients, all of them in the r-hGH group. However, only one (8.3%) carpal tunnel syndrome was described in comparison with the 7 cases (31.8%) reported in the GH treatment group in Bennett's previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] despite the fact that both administered 0.0125 mg/kg/d of r-hGH. There was 1 case of hyperglycemia at the 1<sup>st </sup>month follow-up vist, which was normalized at the 3<sup>rd </sup>month evaluation after reducing the dose by 0.02 mg/d. No patients discontinued the study due to r-hGH related adverse events. No control group dropouts were seen, possibly due to the intense standard treatment received (pharmacological, psychological and rehabilitation).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study suggests the advantage of adding a 0.0125 mg/Kg r-hGH daily dose to the standard therapy versus the standard therapy alone in a subset of severe fibromyalgia patients with low IGF-1 serum levels. Obviously, the results of this study should be viewed in light of the methodological limitations, such as the open assignment to the study drug, the lack of a placebo group and the small sample size. However, the consistency and magnitude of these results, obtained in this well-characterized sample and with long-term treatment period, added to the similar trend observed in the previous placebo-controlled study, are encouraging and warrant further validation in a multicenter, double-blind confirmatory study which is currently ongoing.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors have received external funding from Serono-Iberia (now Merck Espa&#x000f1;a S.L) for the preparation of study data for submission.
