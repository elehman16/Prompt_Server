In this double-blind clinical trial, 68 children were randomly assigned to midazolam (0.2 mg/kg) or chloral hydrate (50 mg/kg). The intensity, duration, and onset of the drugs&#x02019; effects were assessed. Data were analyzed using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> and Mann-Whitney tests (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; .05). The average onset and duration of sedation in the children assigned to midazolam was shorter than in those assigned chloral hydrate (6.35 &#x000b1; 3.65 and 19.14 &#x000b1; 5.86 minutes, <italic>P</italic> = .0001, and 27.64 &#x000b1; 8.34 and 48.97 &#x000b1; 14.81 minutes, <italic>P</italic> = .0001). Gastrointestinal side effects were more frequent in the chloral hydrate group (23.5% against 0%, <italic>P</italic> = .003). According to the results of the present study, chloral hydrate and midazolam can be appropriate choices for pre-echocardiography sedation of patients without cardiovascular risk factors. Considering the similar effectiveness, more rapid onset, and shorter duration of sedation, besides less side effects in the midazolam group, researchers recommend the routine use of this drug.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>oral midazolam</kwd><kwd>oral chloral hydrate</kwd><kwd>pediatric sedation</kwd><kwd>echocardiography</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January-December 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-2333794X17735972"><title>Introduction</title><p>Echocardiography is a very helpful and accurate tool in evaluating the normal and abnormal cardiac anatomy. Echocardiography is efficient in the assessment of congenital cardiac anomalies, cardiac muscular strength, and particularly the ability of the left ventricle and heart valve problems.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2333794X17735972" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><p>One of the major difficulties in pediatric echocardiography is anxiety and fear in children and problems in separating them from their parents while being transferred to the echocardiography room, and therefore, most of them need premedication, regarding their medical status and background, duration of echocardiography, optimal induction of anesthesia, and psychological state of the child and parents.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2333794X17735972" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Premedication is associated with improved quality of echocardiography and decrease in medical errors.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2333794X17735972" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>The psychological and pharmacological preparation before echocardiography is known as premedication. Premedication drugs are administered orally, intramuscularly, intravenously, rectally, sublingually, or nasally, of which oral premedication is the most appropriate and acceptable in children. Premedication is necessary for children after the age of 10 to 21 months because separation anxiety begins at this age. Midazolam and chloral hydrate are the most common drugs used in the premedication of children.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2333794X17735972" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-2333794X17735972" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>The drugs usually prescribed in premedication of children in echocardiography are midazolam and chloral hydrate. Previously, chloral hydrate was considered as a therapeutic standard in pre-echocardiography sedation.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2333794X17735972" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Previous studies have indicated the safety and high efficiency of this drug in completing echocardiography.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2333794X17735972" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> In spite of the clinical benefits, the use of this drug has become limited due to decreased production of the drug due to commercial reasons.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2333794X17735972" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Therefore, more attention has been paid to other drugs from this group such as midazolam. Midazolam is a fast-acting benzodiazepine that provides short-term sedation with minimal side effects, by inhibitory effects on the central nervous system.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2333794X17735972" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The efficiency and side effects of these 2 drugs have been evaluated in various studies. In the study by Wheeler et al, no significant difference was found in the onset of the sedation effect of these 2 drugs, although recovery time in the midazolam group was significantly lower than in the chloral hydrate group; also children had deeper sedation in the chloral hydrate group compared with the midazolam group.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2333794X17735972" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> In the study by Layangool et al, it was shown that children in the chloral hydrate group required a repeated dose for an effective sedation and the onset and duration of the drug effect was significantly shorter in the midazolam group. According to the findings of this study, midazolam had higher efficacy and better results in echocardiography of children (pediatric echocardiography).<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2333794X17735972" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>We performed this clinical trial with the aim of comparing the efficacy in sedation of children before undergoing echocardiography.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section2-2333794X17735972"><title>Method</title><p>In this randomized double-blind (patient and observer) clinical trial, 34 children received oral midazolam and 34 children received oral chloral hydrate.</p><sec id="section3-2333794X17735972"><title>Patients</title><p>In this study, children below 10 years of age who were referred to Birjand city&#x02019;s Valiasr Pediatric Hospital and Heart Clinic, and were indicated with echocardiography during the year 2015, took part.

According to results of this study, midazolam has better results and effectiveness in children&#x02019;s echocardiography.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2333794X17735972" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> In a study by Moshiri et al in Tehran, on the effectiveness and safety of 2 combinations of drugs, midazolam-ketamine and propofol-alfentanil in providing sedation and analgesia during bone marrow aspiration in children, if was found that the onset of sedation and recovery time was significantly shorter in the propofol-alfentanil group.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2333794X17735972" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Pariya et al,<sup><xref rid="bibr17-2333794X17735972" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> in a study in Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Science, comparing the sedation of oral chloral hydrate (50 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.3 mg/kg) before lumber puncture, concluded that the average sedation degree was higher in the chloral hydrate group. Also, the mean onset time of sedative effects was shorter in the midazolam group. Regarding the side effects, results showed that side effects in the oral midazolam group were higher than in the chloral hydrate group.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-2333794X17735972" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> In a clinical trial by Sigari et al<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2333794X17735972" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> in Ardabil, which compared the sedation of chloral hydrate and midazolam in children undergoing echocardiography, the findings indicated that onset of the drug&#x02019;s effects was shorter in the midazolam group. Also, it was observed that sedative effects were deeper in the chloral hydrate group compared with the midazolam group. Results also showed side effects to be significantly lower in the midazolam group.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2333794X17735972" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> In a study by Heistein et al,<sup><xref rid="bibr19-2333794X17735972" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> which aimed to assess the effects of chloral hydrate in the sedation of children before echocardiography, a total of 1095 patients were sedated by chloral hydrate and their vital signs were measured and recovered every 5 minutes, and no irreversible side effects or mortalities were reported and the most common side effects were respiratory and gastrointestinal.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section10-2333794X17735972"><title>Conclusion</title><p>According to the results of the current study, chloral hydrate and midazolam can be the right choice in pre-echocardiography sedation, in patients without cardiovascular risk factors.</p><p>Considering the similar effectiveness, more rapid onset, and shorter duration of sedation, besides less side effects of midazolam, researchers recommend more use of this drug. The most important problem we faced while performing this study was the scarcity and high cost of the oral forms of midazolam and chloral hydrate. Another limitation was lack of interest in parents due to their fear of the potential side effects of drugs. It is recommended that future studies evaluate the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of intravenous midazolam.</p></sec><sec id="section11-2333794X17735972"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>FS: Contributed to design; contributed to acquisition, analysis, and interpretation; drafted manuscript; critically revised manuscript; gave final approval; agrees to be accountable for all aspects of work ensuring integrity and accuracy.</p><p>HRR: Contributed to conception; contributed to acquisition and analysis; drafted manuscript; critically revised manuscript; gave final approval; agrees to be accountable for all aspects of work ensuring integrity and accuracy.</p><p>AE: Contributed to conception and design; contributed to interpretation; drafted manuscript; critically revised manuscript; gave final approval; agrees to be accountable for all aspects of work ensuring integrity and accuracy.</p><p>SAJ: Contributed to design; contributed to acquisition; drafted manuscript; critically revised manuscript; gave final approval; agrees to be accountable for all aspects of work ensuring integrity and accuracy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank all the individuals who participated in this research, especially the echocardiography staff of Valiasr Hospital.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; Note:</bold> This study is the result of the thesis of Ali Ebrahimzadeh as the general physician&#x02019;s degree (Thesis Number 808) and financial support of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Technology of Birjand University of Medical Sciences.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Financial support was provided by the Vice Chancellor for Research and Technology of Birjand University of Medical Sciences.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-2333794X17735972"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book">
