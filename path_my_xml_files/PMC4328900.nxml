After 2&#x000a0;weeks, the exercise groups ran on a treadmill at 25&#x000a0;m/min for 30&#x000a0;min. Immediately post-exercise, intermuscular pH was measured, and hind limb muscle and blood samples were collected to measure biochemical parameters. In a double-blind, cross-over study, 8 healthy men (35.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.0 y) were administered either glutathione (1&#x000a0;g/d) or placebo for 2&#x000a0;weeks.

It is stored in an oxidized or reduced form at high concentrations in the majority of cells. Glutathione is reported to be involved in the regulation of various physiological functions, in particular, antioxidation and detoxification functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Reduced glutathione is easily oxidized by reactive oxygen species and subsequently reduced again by glutathione reductase, and the redox balance of glutathione has been used as a marker of antioxidant status in various conditions. Physical exercise decreases the reduced form and increases the oxidized form of glutathione [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition, prolonged exercise decreases total plasma and tissue glutathione content over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], which suggests that glutathione may be associated with aerobic energy metabolism and maintenance of muscle contraction.</p><p>Energy and nutrient metabolism in skeletal muscle plays an important role in muscular fatigue. In particular, the energy source can affect muscle performance. For example, a carbohydrate-based energy source results in decreased muscular pH owing to increased lactic acid production, which leads to impaired muscle contraction. However, when the energy expended during exercise is derived from lipids, a large amount of energy can be continuously supplied via aerobic metabolism. Therefore, increased lipid utilization in the mitochondria of skeletal muscle cells is associated with continued muscle contraction, and the number and activity of mitochondria influence the utilization of fatty acids in muscle cells.</p><p>Over the past decade, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#x003b3; coactivator-1&#x003b1; (PGC-1&#x003b1;) has been demonstrated as a key transcriptional co-activator, providing a mechanistic insight into nuclear regulatory pathways in the biogenesis of mitochondria in skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Its contents are changed by differing levels of physical activity, metabolic disorders, and aging, which are all associated with metabolic capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Moreover, it interacts with nuclear receptors and transcription factors to activate the transcription of lipid metabolic genes, and its activity is responsive to aerobic metabolic events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Recently, Kovacs-Nolan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] demonstrated, in <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> intestinal absorption model, that intact glutathione can be transported across human intestinal epithelial cells. In addition, we reported that the plasma glutathione concentration is transiently elevated after oral glutathione supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], which suggests that exogenous glutathione can be absorbed into the body and act as an important glutathione supply. Therefore, we hypothesized that glutathione supplementation may contribute to aerobic metabolism during exercise as a result of activated mitochondria via PGC-1&#x003b1; in skeletal muscle. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of glutathione supplementation on muscle fatigue in exercise as a result of improved muscular aerobic metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animal experimental design</title><p>This study complied with the guidelines of the Japanese Council on Animal Care and was approved by the Committee for Animal Research at Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine (No. 23&#x02013;77). ICR mice (7-week-old; Shimizu Laboratory Supplies, Kyoto, Japan) were acclimatized for 1&#x000a0;week in an air-conditioned (22&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2&#x000b0;C) room on a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on from 7:30 to 19:30). Mice were divided into 4 groups containing 8 animals each: sedentary control, sedentary supplemented with glutathione, exercise control, and exercise supplemented with glutathione. Glutathione was purified and crystalized after separation from the fermented food-grade yeast <italic>Candida utilis</italic> which approved by the U.S. food and drug administration (FDA), and used for experiments.</p><p>A glutathione solution (2% w/w) was provided 1 time per d (5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L/g body weight) for 2&#x000a0;weeks. Saline was provided to control mice in the same volume. After 2&#x000a0;weeks of treatment, the exercise groups ran on a treadmill; after an initial 5-min warm up, the running speed was gradually increased to 25&#x000a0;m/min, which was maintained for 30&#x000a0;min. Immediately following the exercise, intermuscular pH was measured under anesthesia; then the hind limb muscles and blood were collected. The control mice underwent the same measurements. Blood glucose was measured (GluTest; Arkray, Inc., Kyoto, Japan), following which the blood samples were centrifuged at 3,500&#x000a0;rpm for 15&#x000a0;min at 4&#x000b0;C to collect plasma. Plasma nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) was measured using a NEFA-C assay kit (WAKO, Osaka, Japan).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>pH measurements in animals</title><p>pH levels in the interstitial fluid of exercised muscle tissue were measured under anesthesia using a glass microelectrode that was inserted into the interstitium between the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Protein was extracted from muscle tissues obtained from sedentary groups using a lysis buffer (Sigma, St. Louise, MO) containing protease inhibitor.

All of the subjects provided written, informed consent. The subjects did not have a current or prior chronic disease or a history of smoking, and they were not currently using any medications. The subjects were also not habituated to a regular exercise regimen.</p><p>A single-bout exercise experiment was performed following 2&#x000a0;weeks of glutathione (1&#x000a0;g/d) or placebo supplementation in capsule form. The subjects were asked to fast, except for water, from 22:00 the night prior to the experiment. On the experiment day, all subjects consumed the same breakfast (200&#x000a0;g of steamed rice) 90&#x000a0;min before the exercise session to normalize the effects of a pre-exercise meal. All participants performed a single bout of steady-state cycling exercise at 40% maximum heart rate for 60&#x000a0;min. Heart rate and the rating of perceived exertion (RPE; Borg scale) were monitored every 10&#x000a0;min during exercise. Blood samples were collected from the antecubital vein before and after exercise, and blood glucose and lactate were measured using simple measuring instruments (Lactate Pro, GluTest; Arkray, Kyoto, Japan). Data obtained from seven subjects was analyzed for glucose and lactate due to failure of blood collection during exercise for one subject. Psychological state was assessed after blood collection using the Profile of Mood State test, of which we were interested in 2 mood factors (fatigue&#x02013;inertia and vigor&#x02013;activity). In addition, the degree of relaxation was examined using a visual analogue scale (VAS). A 4-week washout period separated the conditions, and all of the subjects completed both testing conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Measurement of plasma glutathione</title><p>Plasma glutathione concentration was measured according to our previously reported protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].

The ethanol precipitate of the plasma was mixed with the 5% (final concentration) TCA and 2% 2-mercaptoethanol. After centrifugation, the supernatant was used as the protein-bound plasma fraction. The concentrations of both fractions were determined by precolumn derivation with 6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxy succinimidyl carbamate and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data are reported as mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SE.

Moreover, in humans, glutathione supplementation suppressed fatigue-related parameters during and after exercise. While it has been well documented that glutathione plays a central role in the antioxidant network in animal cells and redox balance can act as a marker of antioxidant status in various pathological and physiological conditions including exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], the role of exogenous glutathione on phenotypic changes relating to physical exercise has not been explored. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to demonstrate that glutathione supplementation improves aerobic metabolism in skeletal muscle, leading to reduced exercise-induced muscle fatigue.</p><p>During muscle contraction, lactic acid, a major source of protons, is rapidly produced by increased glycolytic metabolism, lowering the pH and inhibiting muscle contraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The protons generated from cytosolic lactic acid are immediately buffered in the cell or exported to the interstitial fluid and further transported to the blood. The buffering capacity is relatively high in the cytosol and blood, whereas this capacity is low in interstitial fluid where the presence of buffering factors, such as proteins, is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Therefore, the pH of the interstitial fluid in muscle tissues can drastically change in response to muscle contraction and can also be a marker of acid&#x02013;base conditions in muscle tissue. In contrast, the majority of lactate anions are released into the circulation or immediately metabolized as an energy substrate through aerobic metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]; therefore, their levels are not suitable as a marker. The results of both the animal and human studies indicate that glutathione supplementation inhibited the decrease in intermuscular pH after exercise; in the human study, this was demonstrated by the differences in blood lactate concentrations following exercise between the placebo and glutathione trials. These results may also explain the differences observed between the trials in RPE and subjective fatigue during and after exercise; in particular, an improvement in muscular acidosis results in less fatigue.</p><p>Circulating NEFA concentrations are regulated by a balance between catabolic processes in adipose tissue and fatty acid substrate utilization by the skeletal muscle. Circulating catecholamines such as adrenalin and noradrenalin are increased in response to exercise and stimulate lipolysis of triglycerides in adipose tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], which causes an elevation of circulating fatty acids. In contrast, muscle contraction increases uptake of fatty acids from the circulation into muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], which leads to a decrease in circulating fatty acids. Therefore, we suggest that the reduction of NEFA observed in the glutathione-supplemented mice was due to an increase in muscle utilization rather than a release from adipose tissue. Because energy consumed in muscle during exercise is mainly supplied by carbohydrates and lipids, glutathione-induced lipid utilization can decrease energy obtained from carbohydrates, which may lead to a decrease in lactate/proton production. Collectively, this indicates that glutathione improves metabolic acidosis through the activation of lipid metabolism, which leads to suppression of exercise-induced fatigue.</p><p>PGC-1&#x003b1; is a central member of a family of transcriptional co-activators involved in aerobic metabolism. Activation of PGC-1&#x003b1; alters the metabolic phenotype through interactions with nuclear respiratory factor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], which leads to increased mitochondrial biogenesis and activity. It has been reported that PGC-1&#x003b1; activation causes significant improvements in athletic performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], prevention and treatment of muscle weakness in the elderly, obesity, and other metabolic diseases such as mitochondrial myopathies and diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Here, we detected an increase in PGC-1&#x003b1; with 2&#x000a0;weeks of glutathione intake, along with an increase in mtDNA content, indicating the activation of mitochondrial biogenesis. Therefore, the observed elevation of PGC-1&#x003b1; by glutathione intake strongly suggests an acceleration in lipid metabolism. In addition, the increase of mitochondria content could also lead to a decrease of lactate generation by accelerating aerobic metabolism of glucose, which would prevent muscle acidosis during exercise even further.</p><p>The regulatory mechanism for glutathione-induced increases in PGC-1&#x003b1; is unclear. One explanation is the elevation of AMPK, which is an upstream factor of PGC-1&#x003b1; regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Recently, it has been argued that oral intake of other antioxidants, including vitamin C and E, do not elevate PGC-1&#x003b1; in the skeletal muscle of mice and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]; thus, this may be a specific action of glutathione as a signal factor, but not its antioxidant properties. We found that 2&#x000a0;weeks of glutathione supplementation did not affect plasma glutathione concentration in the basal state. However, glutathione is transported across the intestines with in its intact form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and its plasma concentration, along with the glutathione-derived dipeptides &#x003b3;-glutamyl-cysteine and cysteinyl-glycine, is markedly elevated during the 60&#x02013;120-min period after oral administration, as shown in our previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Therefore, the transient elevation of glutathione or the derived dipeptides following supplementation over 2&#x000a0;weeks may indicate stimulation of specific signaling factors that lead to elevated AMPK and PGC-1&#x003b1;. Alternatively, glutathione content in muscle tissues may also increase with supplementation, leading to the up-regulation of these factors. Further studies are needed to determine the specific mechanism(s) by which glutathione affects muscle aerobic metabolism. In addition, we also observed that reduction of the protein-bound glutathione concentration in plasma after exercise was suppressed following glutathione supplementation, which may also be related to the regulation of energy metabolism or fatigue. Future studies should also aim to identify the bound protein in plasma and examine the mechanism of protein binding or release from the protein and its source.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present results demonstrated that 2&#x000a0;weeks of glutathione supplementation decreased plasma fatty acids and suppressed the exercise-induced reduction in intermuscular pH. Glutathione supplementation also resulted in elevated concentrations of PGC-1&#x003b1; and mitochondria in skeletal muscle. These observations suggest that glutathione induces aerobic metabolism and improves an acidic environment in skeletal muscle during exercise by elevating PGC-1&#x003b1;, which would prevent exercise-induced fatigue.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec18"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12970_2015_67_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Figure S1.</label><caption><p>Images of western blotting for PGC-1&#x003b1;, AMPK, and &#x003b2;-actin in control (C) and glutathione (G) groups.</p></caption></media></p></sec></app></app-group><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>AMPK</term><def><p>AMP-activated protein kinase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COX II</term><def><p>Cytochrome c oxidase subunit II</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mtDNA</term><def><p>Mitochondrial DNA</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NEFA</term><def><p>Nonesterified fatty acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCR</term><def><p>Polymerase chain reaction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PGC-1&#x003b1;</term><def><p>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#x003b3; coactivator-1&#x003b1;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RPE</term><def><p>Rating of perceived exertion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p>visual analogue scale</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>This study was supported in part by a research fund from the KOHJIN Life Sciences Company, Ltd.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>WA, YO, MT, YS, and AH conceived and designed the experiments.
