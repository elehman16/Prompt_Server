Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) are defined as changes in sputum volume, color, or consistency, accompanied by an increase in dyspnea. Exacerbations usually result in decreases in lung function, exercise tolerance, and quality of life (QOL) [<xref rid="b2-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It has been shown that, even with optimal medical treatment during hospitalization, patients at discharge need considerable time to recover to baseline levels of physical function and health status [<xref rid="b2-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Up to 25% of patients after an acute exacerbation may not fully recover to baseline peak flow at 3 months [<xref rid="b3-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The recovery period of health status is very long, but there is no further exacerbation [<xref rid="b4-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Frequent exacerbators have a reduced response to treatment of AECOPD in terms of inflammatory indices and quality of life [<xref rid="b5-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) plays an important role in the management of COPD [<xref rid="b6-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. PR includes respiratory system interventions (e.g., smoking cessation and medications), psychological support (e.g., patients&#x02019; education, and psychological and social support), and physical exercise, and there is evidence showing that PR is able to improve exercise capacity and QOL [<xref rid="b7-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b9-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Most studies on PR have been done in stable COPD patients, and trials with small sample size also suggest that PR is feasible and effective in patients with exacerbations of COPD [<xref rid="b10-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b13-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, an early PR has become a component of recovery programs in the management of acute COPD. However, PR is rarely applied in China. The main reasons might be that physicians need more knowledge on PR, and concern about whether PR is safe after exacerbations of COPD, especially in patients with severe COPD [<xref rid="b14-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of PR after exacerbation of COPD. The feasibility and safety of an early PR was evaluated in AECOPD inpatients, and the effects of PR on the exercise capacity and QOL were determined.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects</title><p>This was a prospective, randomized, open trial conducted in inpatients admitted due to AECOPD. These patients received standard medical treatments and were then randomized to receive either routine care (control group) or PR (PR group) from the second day of admission until discharge.</p><p>We recruited 101 consecutive inpatients with AECOPD between December 2011 and November 2013 from Tongji Hospital, School of Medicine of Tongji University. All the patients had a diagnosis of COPD prior to admission. The diagnosis and determination of COPD severity were conducted according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines. An exacerbation of COPD was defined as the worsening of respiratory symptoms beyond normal day-to-day variation and leading to a change in medication [<xref rid="b16-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Patients were eligible if they reported a limitation in daily activities due to dyspnea on exertion, as categorized using the Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea grade &#x0003e;0. When patients had any disease not associated with COPD (e.g., uncontrolled heart failure, sever lower limb arthritis, and symptomatic peripheral vascular disease, which may affect the outcome of dyspnea or exercise tolerance) they were excluded from this study. Other exclusion criteria included severe orthopedic or neurological disorders limiting exercise performance, unstable cardiac disease, and inability to understand or complete questionnaires. This study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR-TRC-13003068) and approved by the Human Research Ethics Board of Affiliated Tongji Hospital of Tongji University in Shanghai, China (2011-161). All participants signed written informed consent before participating in the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Baseline measurements</title><p>Baseline measurements were age, gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, use of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT), and pulmonary function. The outcome measures in this study were dyspnea and functional status, functional exercise capacity, limitation in daily activities, and health status. This information was collected at baseline and on the day of discharge.</p><p>Spirometry, static lung volumes, and lung diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide were also measured in accordance with a standard protocol [<xref rid="b17-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Arterial blood gas analysis was done at rest, or in the presence of oxygen supplementation for subjects receiving LTOT.</p><p>Dyspnea and functional status were evaluated using the mMRC dyspnea grade [<xref rid="b19-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Subjects were asked to point to the Borg scale, and rate the severity of perceived breathlessness.</p><p>The 6-minute walk test was performed according to published guidelines along a 30-meter corridor [<xref rid="b20-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The test was performed twice on consecutive days and the longest distance [6-minute walk distance (6MWD)] was used for analysis. Oxygen saturation was monitored continuously throughout the test, and the test was terminated if oxygen saturation fell to below 80%. Pre-exercise and the lowest oxygen saturation were recorded during the test. Heart rate (HR) was monitored continuously throughout the test (Polar, Polar Electro, Oy, Finland). In the 6-minute walk test, the same flow rate of supplemental oxygen was used as was prescribed for their normal daily activities in subjects receiving LTOT. All follow-up exercise tests were performed in subjects using the same flow rate of supplemental oxygen as applied in the exercise test at baseline.</p><p>Limitations in daily life activities were assessed using an Activity of Daily Living Dyspnea scale (ADL-D scale), which was a validated scale for COPD patients [<xref rid="b21-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Paul et al. reported that the CAT correlated well with CRQ-SAS domains and SGRQ scores in health status measures in pulmonary rehabilitation [<xref rid="b22-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, QOL was measured using the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire-Self Administered Standardized (CRQ-SAS) scale [<xref rid="b23-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and COPD assessment test (CAT) [<xref rid="b24-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Pulmonary rehabilitation program</title><p>Briefly, each PR session included exercise training, relaxation, and breathing retraining and education [<xref rid="b25-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Symptom-limited exercise training was used. Patients were trained at between 3 and 5 on the Borg breathlessness score (moderate to severe). Resting oxygen saturation, HR, and blood pressure were measured and recorded before, during, and at the end of PR. Patients received 30-minute exercise twice-daily. Exercise training included stretches, endurance, and strength training. Lower-limb endurance training was performed using a treadmill with the initial workload prescribed at 60% of the peak work rate achieved in the 6-minute walk test at baseline. Walking was controlled within 5&#x02013;10 min and progressively increased, within symptom tolerance, to 20 min of continuous walking. Upper-limb endurance training comprised repetitive bilateral shoulder flexion and abduction using a light weight and was synchronized with expiration for 2 min. Strength training was accomplished using free weights or the subject&#x02019;s own body weight. One set of 10 repetitions was initially prescribed and then increased to 3 sets when the subject could perform the exercises without any difficulty. Arterial oxygen saturation was monitored, and supplemental oxygen was given to maintain arterial oxygen saturation above 85%. Breathing retraining consisted of relaxation with breathing control, pursed-lip breathing, and pacing during exercise training and daily life activities. The pursed-lip breathing was to assist subjects to control their breathing by reducing respiratory frequency. All subjects received the same instructions.</p><p>The education component was provided by a physiotherapist at each class and consisted of the benefits and importance of daily exercise, pacing and energy-conservation techniques to manage daily-life activities, and self-management strategies for coping with an exacerbation of COPD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data are presented as mean &#x000b1; standard error.

There was a significant improvement in resting SpO<sub>2</sub> at rest in the PR group as compared to baseline. There was a significant improvement in the dyspnea at rest as measured by Borg dyspnea score in both the PR and control groups as compared to that at baseline. However, a significant improvement was observed in dyspnea at exercises (<italic>P</italic>=0.008) only in the PR group, but not in the control group (<italic>P</italic>=0.108). These findings suggested that there was a significant improvement in the exercise capacity after PR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-medscimonit-21-806">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of exercise on QOL and daily life activities</title><p>There was a significant improvement in CAT score (the lower the score, the better the QOL was) in both the PR group and the control group.

One of the major goals of COPD treatment is to attenuate dyspnea. To measure the severity of dyspnea during exercise and daily life activities, the mMRC dyspnea scale was used. Results showed that the mMRC was improved from 3.1&#x000b1;0.93 at baseline to 2.2&#x000b1;0.09 after PR in the PR group, showing a significant difference. The mMRC was improved from 2.9&#x000b1;0.65 at baseline to 2.7&#x000b1;0.71 in the control group without marked difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-medscimonit-21-806">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>The BODE index is a multi-dimensional grading system determined on the basis of BMI, FEV<sub>1</sub>%, mMRC dyspnea score, and 6MWD. The BODE index has been validated in COPD patients, and is responsive to PR [<xref rid="b26-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Our study indicated that the BODE index was improved from 5.6&#x000b1;0.24 at baseline to 3.8&#x000b1;0.24 after PR in the PR group, showing a significant difference.

Of 94 patients completing this trial, none experienced a serious adverse event, nor had an increase in hospital stay. In a large population of severely impaired COPD patients with high exacerbation rates, a significant reduction in exacerbation and hospitalization frequency was observed after participation in a comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation program [<xref rid="b27-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In a previous study, 14 of 126 patients with stable COPD experienced a serious adverse event during PR in a community setting [<xref rid="b28-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The relaxation training (e.g., stretches and strength training before exercise training, breathing training, and symptom-limited exercise training) may help these patients to finish PR [<xref rid="b29-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Our results showed that the PR group had significant improvements in 6MWD, resting SpO<sub>2,</sub> and exercise Borg dyspnea score, indicating that PR is beneficial in improving the exercise capacity of patients with AECOPD. In addition, greater improvement in total CRQ-SAS score and lower CAT score were also observed in the PR group, indicating that PR is helpful to improve the QOL of patients with AECOPD.</p><p>Several factors have contributed to the improvements identified in this study. PR was applied with symptom-limited exercise training, which is a low-intensity exercise. Moderate-to-high-intensity exercise may be inappropriate for acutely ill patients with a compromised respiratory function. In other studies, low-intensity exercise has been found to benefit patients experiencing AECOPD [<xref rid="b11-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b30-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. A second contribution to the improvements was that the &#x0201c;respiratory conditioning&#x0201d; of PR was a procedure for improving the flexibility of the chest with the correction of posture and the stretching and mobilization of the rib cage. Our PR incorporated physical therapist-assisted manual stretching of the respiratory muscles to reduce dyspnea before starting exercise training. Respiratory conditioning was reported to decrease the chest wall stiffness by stretching the respiratory muscles of the chest wall during breathing, and contributed to expanding expiratory flow and reducing hyperinflation of the lungs at rest [<xref rid="b31-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="b32-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In addition, by decreasing chest wall stiffness and increasing its flexibility, the reduced hyperinflation of the lung at rest may generate greater mobility of the diaphragm. Consequently, this effect improves the exercise capacity. In this context, respiratory conditioning in our PR ameliorated symptoms, and raised exercise capacity. Moreover, physical therapist-assistant manual compression and relaxation of the thoracic cage of our respiratory conditioning created a strong interaction between patient and physical therapist, thereby decreasing the anxiety about exercise training and reducing the breathlessness, which is another factor playing a role in the improvement of daily life activities and QOL. Our PR may ensure that all the patients including the severe COPD patients can finish their exercise sessions. A third contributing factor to the improvements was the breath training of PR. Our PR included pursed-lips breathing and diaphragmatic breathing, aiming to alter the respiratory muscle recruitment, improve respiratory muscle performance, and reduce dyspnea [<xref rid="b33-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="b34-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], which have been reported to improve the 6MWD [<xref rid="b33-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Our study has several limitations: the sample size was relatively small; the majority of patients were males, reflecting the gender difference in disease morbidity; and we did not assess social background. In addition, the mechanism by which PR achieves its effectiveness was not explored. Therefore, these factors should be taken into account in future studies.</p><p>PR is recommended by the international guidelines as a part of COPD management. PR is becoming more popular for patients. An awareness of the clinical sequelae of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease enables approaches, such as early post-exacerbation rehabilitation to mitigate its negative effects [<xref rid="b35-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, it is still not adequately used in China [<xref rid="b36-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and the major barriers are the low referral rate in the primary-care center and difficulty in accessing suitable programs. Studies from Shanghai, China reported that PR was rarely used in local hospitals. The main reason was that respiratory physicians have only limited knowledge about PR, which leads to a poor attendance of COPD patients to PR. Therefore, research on the availability of suitable and safe PR programs and interrelated issues of referral and access is needed [<xref rid="b14-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15-medscimonit-21-806" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present study provides evidence that it is safe and feasible to implement an early PR for inpatients with AECOPD, and clinicians should promote PR after AECOPD no matter how severe AECOPD is.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank all the patients and staff members at each rehabilitation center.
