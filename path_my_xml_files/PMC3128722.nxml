They have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of pain disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002 CIT0003 CIT0004 CIT0005 CIT0006">2&#x02013;6</xref>), including headache (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>), and have been the subject of increased interest during recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>).With regard to migraine, using a variety of behavior therapies, alone or mixed, such as cognitive therapies, life-style modifications, bio-feedback training, and relaxation training, has shown efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007 CIT0008 CIT0009 CIT0010">7&#x02013;10</xref>), and two studies have used a multimodal approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>).</p><p>In recent decades, the arsenal for pharmacological intervention in migraine has broadened, and the prospect of rapid symptom alleviation has improved considerably, but pharmacological treatment of migraine is still far from optimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">11</xref>). Also, migraine medications can have adverse side-effects or sometimes be ineffective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">12</xref>). Therefore, and because migraine is highly conditional on stress factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">13</xref>), it would be beneficial to find non-pharmacological forms of treatment that are focused on relevant psycho-social factors. Multimodal behavior treatment is therefore of clear interest in migraine treatment. Furthermore, pharmacological and behavioral oriented treatments have shown additive effects in relation to migraine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014 CIT0015 CIT0016">14&#x02013;16</xref>).</p><p>The role of massage in pain and headache treatment is controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">18</xref>). Positive effects, including a decreased headache frequency and improved sleep quality, have been shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">20</xref>) presumably through increased muscular relaxation and decreased bodily symptoms of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">21</xref>).</p><p>The Internet offers possibilities to increase the availability of different kinds of treatment programs at a low cost, and the efficacy of such web-based health care programs has been demonstrated for a variety of conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">23</xref>). This particular advantage of Internet-based programs is valuable in relation to migraine, as many migraineurs have poor access to specialized health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0024 CIT0025 CIT0026">24&#x02013;26</xref>). Only a few such Internet-based programs have addressed headache, and these have included migraine as one of the headache types; no such program has addressed migraine exclusively. We have thus identified three Internet-based studies on behavioral treatment of headache (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0027 CIT0028 CIT0029">27&#x02013;29</xref>), all of which included mixed headache populations, with participants who have migraine and/or tension-type headache. Two of these Internet-based studies were from the same research group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0029">29</xref>), and the same 6-week program for relaxation and cognitive behavior therapy was used in both studies. In the first study, consisting of 102 participants, significant improvements in headache frequencies were obtained. However, a high attrition rate of 56% made the result somewhat difficult to evaluate. In the second study, telephone contacts were added in an attempt to decrease the number of drop-outs. This study, too, revealed significant improvements in headache, but no statistically significant decrease in drop-outs was seen. A further, purely Internet-based study on chronic headache included one group with migraine/mixed headache and one with solely tension-type headache (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0028">28</xref>). However, because the results from the headache groups were merged, the specific effect of the migraine/mixed headache treatment was not known. The total attrition rate was 38% out of an initial treatment group of 139 participants. These three studies demonstrate that the Internet is useful in the administration of programs for relaxation and cognitive treatment of headache, although web-based programs seem associated with a high attrition rate.</p><p>Thus, to date, Internet-based behavioral treatment programs for headache have not utilized a comprehensive multimodal approach, and have not specifically addressed migraine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0027 CIT0028 CIT0029">27&#x02013;29</xref>). The primary aim of the present study was therefore to develop and evaluate such a migraine-specific Internet-administered multimodal behavioral treatment (MBT) program. The intention of this program was to improve participants' knowledge of stress physiology and awareness of factors of importance for daily stress and of the beneficial effects of physical activity, diet, as well as cognitive aspects with regard to thought patterns, handling of emotions, and attitudes. Hand massage was also randomly tested as an additional treatment modality.</p><p>We hypothesized that both the Internet-administered MBT program and the hand massage would be effective in decreasing the frequency of migraine. Therefore our primary outcome measure was reduction of migraine frequency by 50% or more. Secondary outcome measures were: physical activity, scores for depression and well-being, and participants' evaluations of the MBT program and of the hand massage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="ss2"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="ss3"><title>Study population</title><p>The study population was recruited by approaching participants in a previous descriptive study on migraine. These 150 individuals had been recruited via advertisements in the local daily newspaper, asking people to participate in a 2-hour interview concerning their migraine. The inclusion criteria used for both studies were: fulfillment of migraine criteria according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0030">30</xref>) and at least two migraine attacks monthly, as reported at the time of inclusion. At this initial session, a general medical and a specific headache history were recorded, followed by a general and neurological physical examination by one of the authors, a specialist in neurology. A battery of computer-based questionnaires was also answered by the participants. Eighty-three individuals, all adults, 58 women and 25 men, agreed to participate in the present study&#x02014;all of whom were included after giving their verbal informed consent (ethical approval no.: Dnr Ups 03-189 Regional Ethical Review Board, Uppsala, Sweden). All participants were Swedish speaking, and the great majority of them lived in the city of Uppsala or its vicinity. Other than traveling costs, no financial compensation was offered.</p></sec><sec id="ss4"><title>Web tool for migraine diary and for the MBT program</title><p>The authors, together with a professional advisor in stress management, developed an MBT program for migraine adapted for scientific purposes. A web-based tool was developed with support from web-designers; it contained the treatment program and a diary. Participants accessed the tool via a personal log-in. The diary was filled in day-by-day. In order to register on the next day, the program required that data for the previous day first be completed. A paper version of the diary could be used instead if participants did not have immediate access to the Internet. They were asked to transfer the data from the paper version to the web-based diary within one week; otherwise an automatic e-mail reminder would appear informing them that the missing data were necessary for continued diary recording. Via the web tool, participants were also asked to answer two questionnaires regarding depression and quality of life, repeated at 3&#x02013;5-month intervals. The items recorded in the diary that were relevant for the present study were: <italic>migraine frequency</italic>, defined as number of days with migraine; <italic>physical activity</italic>, recorded as the number of days with physical activity here defined as brisk walks, cycling, and all forms of more extensive physical activities lasting 30 minutes or more; and intake of <italic>migraine medication</italic>. The MBT program was intended to increase participants' awareness of essential factors in everyday life that might have an impact on their migraine. This training program consisted of 53 text pages divided into the following topics: stress physiology, physical activity, diet, thought patterns, handling of emotions, and attitudes (toward oneself and others). A summary of the content of these topics and associated recommendations for behavioral change are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table I</xref>. Physical activity lasting 30 minutes or more was recorded in the diary. Participants were told to use migraine drugs at their own discretion, independently of the study. The respective topics of the program included a reference list for eventual further reading. Print-outs were made possible by attached PDF files. The Swedish language was used throughout in the web tool.</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table I.</label><caption><p>Summary of content of the multimodal behavior treatment program.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Topic</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Background information</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Recommended behavioral change</th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stress physiology</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Concept of stress as a specific syndrome of bodily and mental reactions to unspecific strain; importance of cognitive processes for perceived stress; difference between acute and chronic stress; role of stress in migraine; importance of relaxation and sleep habits to mitigate stress reactions</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(i)&#x02002;Identify own symptoms of stress and own protective &#x02018;peace-and-rest&#x02019; reactions against stress <break/>(ii)&#x02002;Identify personal stressors in daily life, and analyze how they can be diminished <break/>(iii)&#x02002;Practice a muscular relaxation program via a provided CD</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Physical activity</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Description of potential benefits of physical activity and examples of different forms of physical activity</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(i)&#x02002;Perform some form of daily condition-enhancing exercise with a minimal duration of 30 minutes <break/>(ii)&#x02002;Perform a provided 5&#x02013;10-minute exercise program for improved strength, posture, and balance</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Diet</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Physiology of metabolism; types of foodstuffs; body mass index and abdominal circumference as measures of metabolic health</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(i)&#x02002;Increase awareness of personal dietary habits by answering a set of questions <break/>(ii)&#x02002;Avoid sugar and other simple carbohydrates.Have meals at regular intervals <break/>(iii)&#x02002;Avoid over-eating</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Thought patterns</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Effects of positive and negative thoughts, respectively; how to identify personal strengths; how to accomplish and maintain changes in thought patterns</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(i)&#x02002;Identify personal strengths <break/>(ii)&#x02002;Focus on possibilities rather than on difficulties <break/>(iii)&#x02002;Sustainably change habits of thought from negative to positive thinking <break/>(iv)&#x02002;Improve awareness of realistic limits in daily life and how to implement them</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Handling of emotions</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">How feelings of sadness, anger, envy, and happiness affect thinking and well-being; the roles of feelings and empathy for communication; the concept of emotional intelligence (EQ)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(i)&#x02002;Identify which types of feelings you easily come in contact with and those that are difficult to become aware of <break/>(ii)&#x02002;Identify how you react to and are affected by your feelings <break/>(iii)&#x02002;Apply various strategies for coping with negative feelings: analyze their causes, verbalize them for those concerned, improve emotional balance via improved relaxation and sleep habits, and avoid unproductive thoughts, e.g. of revenge</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Attitudes</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">How individuals differ in degree of trust in themselves and in others; how trust affects thinking and attitudes</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(i)&#x02002;Achieve increased awareness of attitudes of trust/mistrust (one's own and others') <break/>(ii)&#x02002;Improve self-reliance and trust in others</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="ss5"><title>Randomization and study flow</title><p>The general flow of the study was as follows and is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>: All participants first recorded their migraine in the diary during a period of 2 months (56 days) as a base-line. Thereafter, the participants were randomized into one of two intervention groups A (<italic>n</italic> = 27; 19 women and 8 men) and B (<italic>n</italic> = 28; 19 women and 9 men) or a control group C (<italic>n</italic> = 28; 20 women and 8 men). The following procedure was used for randomization: a sequence of random numbers was generated in Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 18.0 (SPSS) software, stratified by gender in order to obtain an equal distribution of women and men in the groups. Based on magnitude, these numbers were arranged into three equal-sized groups, which translated into the three study groups. The number sequence thus translated into a unique sequence of group affiliation which corresponded to the chronological order of inclusion. The procedure was performed by an independent researcher, thus the randomization process was blinded to the investigators.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Diagram of the study design with group sizes and drop-outs (MBT = multimodal behavior treatment; Q = questionnaires; R = randomization; CD = compact disc).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="UPS-0300-9734-116-169_g001"/></fig><p>The complete study period was 11 months (308 days) for the intervention groups, and 8 months (224 days) for the control group. Hand massage began immediately after randomization (group A) and was practiced throughout the rest of the study, while participants in intervention group B extended their base-line diary recording for another 3 months (84 days) after randomization. Thereafter, i.e. 5 months (140 days) from the start of the study, MBT was added in both intervention groups (A and B) and lasted for 6 months (168 days). During the first 2 months (56 days) of MBT, the different parts of the program were introduced stepwise at regular intervals via the Internet, gradually building up to the complete program, which the participants were instructed to practice until the end of the study.</p><p>The rationale for the study design was to obtain: 1) base-line values unbiased by participants' awareness of which group they would be randomized to; 2) an initial 3-month period of hand massage in one of the intervention groups (group A), while the other intervention group (group B) continued diary registration to enable evaluation of the short-term efficacy of hand massage as the sole form of intervention; 3) an MBT intervention period of sufficient length to learn and practice the program and perceive its effects; and 4) a reasonably long follow-up period of the control group, the assumption being that 11 months, as used in the intervention groups, would be too long for ethical reasons and because the longer period might entail the risk of exhaustion and affect compliance. A CD containing a 15-minute program for muscular relaxation was given to all participants and used as a placebo treatment for the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0031">31</xref>). The study design is largely in accordance with the criteria described by Goslin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>).</p><p>Aside from communicating via the web tool, participants were also able to make inquiries via e-mail or phone throughout the study. Also, biological sampling (blood and saliva; intended for a separate report) after 5 months (controls) or 5 and 8 months (intervention groups) provided opportunities for 5&#x02013;10-minute face-to-face communication while the study was underway. The participants in intervention group A also had one face-to-face encounter with one of the researchers when they were taught how to perform hand massage. Thus, all participants experienced a 2-hour initial face-to-face contact upon inclusion, and the total lengths of subsequent face-to-face encounters during the course of the study were estimated to 80 minutes for group A, 20 minutes for group B, and 10 minutes for group C. At the end of the study, after data collection was complete, all participants had a final 5&#x02013;10-minute study-related face-to-face encounter in connection with biological sampling. At this point in time, participants in the control group were offered access to the MBT program.</p></sec><sec id="ss6"><title>Hand massage</title><p>Hand massage was chosen as a possible complementary means of achieving stress reduction and as an easy variant of massage that was not intrusive on participants' integrity. The massage was not intended as a measure of acute alleviation of migraine attacks. The total massage time was 15 minutes per session. The massage was of the &#x02018;Swedish&#x02019; type, consisting of: <italic>effleurage</italic> (stroking from the wrist down to the fingers, simultaneously on the palm and on the back of the hand, with use of soft circular stretching strokes), <italic>petrissage</italic> (kneading of the palm), and <italic>friction</italic> (strokes in circles on the fingers) (manual in Swedish provided on request). The collaborator who would perform the massage was chosen by the participant. One of the researchers (K.H.) provided 1 hour's face-to-face training on the massage technique to each participant&#x02013;collaborator pair, ending with a practical examination. Each pair also received an instructional videotape on how to perform the massage. The participants were asked to perform hand massage at least twice a week during the first 4 weeks and subsequently at least once a week during the remaining 32 weeks of the study period.</p></sec><sec id="ss7"><title>Introduction of questionnaires via the web tool</title><p>Two questionnaires were provided via the web tool to all participants for evaluation of depressive symptoms (Montgomery-&#x000c5;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-S)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0033">33</xref>) and for issues regarding quality of life (PQ23 quality of life questionnaire) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0034">34</xref>): at the start of the diary recording and after 5 and 8 months of recording. For participants in the intervention groups, these questionnaires were also provided after 11 months, which was at the end of the intervention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). This final evaluation also included a set of four questions, each concerning participants' views on the MBT program and on the hand massage, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="ss8"><title>Questionnaires</title><p>The MADRS<bold>-</bold>S is a validated instrument for evaluation of depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0035">35</xref>). It is a self-estimating scale, based on evaluations of the past three days regarding the following nine issues: mood, feeling of unease, sleep, appetite, ability to concentrate, initiative, emotional involvement, pessimism, and zest for life. Seven response options were given for each issue, with ratings running from zero to six. A total score above 12 was defined as a depressive state, with the limits of 20 and 35 defining those with moderate or severe depression, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0033">33</xref>).</p><p>We also included the PQ23 questionnaire (see Appendix). This is a quality of life instrument developed and tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0034">34</xref>) at the Department of Environmental Stress Disorders (CEOS), Uppsala University, Sweden. It is composed of 23 questions, all of which refer to the current situation. We sought a way to group these questions. Therefore, factor analysis was performed on the PQ23 instrument, based on the present answers given at study start, so as to reduce the number of variables and to identify groupings of items. It yielded a four-factor solution with an eigenvalue of &#x0003e;1. The question concerning physical activity was excluded, as it was the only question not included in any of these four factors. The factors were designated as follows: 1: &#x02018;Well-being&#x02019; (eigenvalue 8.1; 35.4% of variance explained); 2: &#x02018;Occupational satisfaction&#x02019; (2.8; 12.4%); 3: &#x02018;Mood and social satisfaction&#x02019; (1.8; 7.8%); 4: &#x02018;Perceived work performance&#x02019; (1.4; 5.8%). The internal consistency of scales was tested according to Cronbach's alpha, which yielded values between 0.745 and 0.903.</p><p>The participants' opinions about the MBT were obtained by posing four questions. Question 1: &#x02018;How do you rate the clarity of the respective parts of the program?&#x02019; Question 2: &#x02018;How do you rate the feasibility of the respective parts of the program?&#x02019; Answers were given as a score on a visual analog scale (VAS) scale graded from 0 to 10 (0 = poor; 10 = good). The remaining questions were in an open format: Question 3: &#x02018;Which element(s) of the entire MBT program do you personally consider the most valuable?&#x02019; Question 4: &#x02018;Do you have any general suggestions that could improve the program?&#x02019;</p><p>The hand massage was also evaluated using four questions. Answers were given as a VAS score on a scale from 0 to 10: Question 1: &#x02018;How clear was the information given at the training session on how to perform the hand massage?&#x02019; (0 = poor; 10 = good). Question 2: &#x02018;How clear were the instructions given on the videotape on how to perform the hand massage?&#x02019; (0 = poor; 10 = good). Question 3: &#x02018;What were your emotional impressions of the hand massage?&#x02019; (0 = negative; 10 = positive). Question 4: &#x02018;Did the hand massage have an effect on your migraine?&#x02019; (0 = negative; 10 = positive).</p></sec><sec id="ss9"><title>Analyses of data</title><sec id="ss10"><title>Multivariate analyses</title><p>SPSS's generalized linear model with a binary response variable (50% or more reduction of migraine frequency or not) and a logit link was used.

The significance levels were adjusted for multiple testing with sequential SIDAK correction.</p></sec><sec id="ss11"><title>Univariate intergroup comparisons: three-group comparisons</title><p>Dichotomous parameters differences in proportions were analyzed using the chi-square test (gender, marital status, children living at home, presence of tension-type headache, migraine with or without aura, and depression). Group differences regarding continuous parameters were examined using one-way ANOVA with Tukey <italic>post-hoc</italic> test (age, body mass index (BMI), migraine frequency, and years of migraine). Differences in proportions of subcategories between groups were analyzed using the Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test (income, education, employment). Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), including interaction effect analysis, was used for evaluation of the repeated measures of the MADRS-S and the PQ23 questionnaires.

Preliminary data indicate that such drug use decreased in the intervention groups but not in the control group C. Fourteen participants were on continuous preventive medication throughout the study, and five participants underwent a change in preventive medication during the course of the study, almost evenly distributed between the groups.</p></sec><sec id="ss30"><title>Attrition</title><p>Seven of the initial study participants dropped out during the study. The gender and group affiliation of the drop-outs were as follows: two women in group A, three women and one man in group B, and one woman in the control group C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The reasons were: family situation (two women and one man), divorce, cancer diagnosis, moving from the region, and for one participant for an unknown reason. Data on these individuals were not included in the study. We analyzed drop-outs versus the remaining participants for differences in demographics and background migraine characteristics and found no statistical evidence for any differences (data not shown). Two participants in the hand massage intervention group (group A) were not able to find a hand massage collaborator, and three others never carried out their hand massage. An intention-to-treat approach was used for evaluating the effects of hand massage, thus including the data of these five participants despite their non-compliance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="" id="ss31"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="ss32"><title>Main findings regarding multimodal behavioral treatment</title><p>The main objective of the present study was to develop and evaluate an Internet-administered multimodal behavioral treatment (MBT) program for migraine. Our web-based platform appears to be unique in specifically addressing this disorder, and we consider the design of our MBT program promising, as our intention to obtain decreased suffering from migraine was achieved. Based on our measure of a 50% or greater reduction in headache frequency, we found a significantly higher rate of improvement among participants of the MBT than in controls. This relative measure of migraine improvement is a preferred outcome measure, as suggested by Goslin et al.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>). When looking at migraine improvement in absolute figures, participants of the study groups receiving MBT showed 23% and 29% average improvement in migraine frequency, respectively, compared to none in the control group. Considering the high prevalence of migraine and the high accessibility of Internet-administered behavioral treatment, we regard the present result to be of health economical significance.</p><p>The effects of our MBT intervention were studied as a whole, with limited ambitions to sort out the relative contributions of individual constituents of the program. However, we did perform a multivariate analysis in which the potential effect of increased physical activity was analyzed. We were not able to show an overall effect, but a tendency for an interaction with gender hinted at the possibility that specifically women's migraine might profit from increased physical activity. When analyzing gender in our multivariate model we found no significant contribution to the obtained effect by this variable, arguing that female and male migraineurs have similar benefit from our program.</p><p>One further result, a low attrition rate, was a considerable advancement compared to other Internet-based studies for headache treatment, which have shown attrition rates in the 32%&#x02013;56% range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0027 CIT0028 CIT0029">27&#x02013;29</xref>). Our rate of 8.4% conforms to the recommended less than 20% attrition rate for studies on behavioral therapy for migraine, as suggested in an evidence-based Cochrane protocol for such studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0038">38</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="ss33"><title>Hand massage</title><p>We were not able to demonstrate any migraine-alleviating effect of massage in the present study. It is noteworthy that compliance with the hand massage program during the initial 3 months, prior to MBT, was high, with a 1.1 sessions per week rate (recommended rate: 16 session/12 weeks), but decreased after onset of the MBT program resulting in an average practice rate of less than once a fortnight (recommended rate: once weekly). This low massage frequency during the latter part of the study definitely constitutes a power problem of the hand massage study. The fact that not even during the first 3 months could an effect be seen argues more strongly against any greater effect of massage on migraine, despite our sincere efforts to elucidate this. Nonetheless, it is noteworthy that many participants appreciated highly the positive emotional impact of the massage and that our format appeared fully feasible for a substantial number of participants.</p></sec><sec id="ss34"><title>Questionnaire evaluation</title><p>The written evaluation of the MBT program clearly showed that participants appreciated its content, witnessing that it was helpful in achieving improved knowledge on the importance of stress and that they had been able to integrate its cognitive aspects into their daily lives.</p><p>Regarding depressive symptoms we saw no evidence of a general effect in the present study. It is well known that the prevalence of depression is higher in migraine populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0039 CIT0040 CIT0041">39&#x02013;41</xref>), and, judging from the MADRS-S scores, participants in the present study did show a higher prevalence of depression than that found in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0042">42</xref>). At the same time, the number of participants in each group with symptoms of depression was too low to make any valid statistical analyses.</p><p>The PQ23 quality of life instrument used here showed some effects in the &#x02018;Perceived work performance&#x02019; factor, and this was seen exclusively for participants in the hand massage group. We consider that this finding could have been biased by the low base-line value for the mentioned factor, specifically in this treatment group. We therefore conclude that no reliable improvement in quality of life was detected.</p></sec><sec id="ss35"><title>Design, representativeness, and limitations</title><p>The design of the present study differed from other similar headache studies in that it included also participants with more moderate migraine frequency by using a limit of at least two monthly attacks, compared to at least four (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0027 CIT0028 CIT0029">27&#x02013;29</xref>), at least eight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>) attacks/month, or chronic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>) symptoms.Because of this, and due to the character of our MBT program, longer base-line and treatment periods than used in these mentioned studies were deemed necessary. The feasibility, shown here, of using such long periods may be of interest for future studies. It is furthermore noteworthy that our design accords quite well with the criteria for optimal behavioral intervention studies in migraine, as formulated in the meta-analysis by Goslin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>): use of headache frequency as the outcome measure&#x02014;as opposed to headache index; use of a prospective base-line period and an end recording period of at least 4 weeks each (8 weeks each in the present study); a treatment period of at least 3 months (6 months' MBT treatment and 9 months' hand massage in the present study), and use of 50% or more reduction in headache frequency as the criterion for individual response. Our study also complied with the more recent recommendations of the above-mentioned Cochrane protocol on migraine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0038">38</xref>), with use of a daily headache diary and an attrition rate not exceeding 20%.</p><p>We believe that the low attrition rate in our study was boosted by the compulsory format of the diary as well as the face-to-face contacts, which were not used in the previously mentioned Internet-based headache studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0027 CIT0028 CIT0029">27&#x02013;29</xref>). We believe that the thorough initial face-to-face contact with all participants at the time of inclusion in the study was psychologically particularly important for achieving our low attrition rate. Our control group showed the lowest attrition rate. One possible explanation for this could be that the MBT program is fairly demanding as regards both personal engagement and time needed for its different activities. The balance between potential benefits and how much engagement the person is willing and able to invest is important to take into account when designing a program such as this. We experienced a considerably smaller attrition problem than reported in six of eight studies in a review on Internet-based behavioral treatment programs for a variety of health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">23</xref>). Interestingly, only one of these eight studies used a face-to-face introduction to the program, and this was one of the two studies with a low attrition similar to ours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0043">43</xref>), thus giving further support to our presumption that an initial personal contact is important for subsequent attendance to Internet-administered treatment. When compared with other headache studies, our attrition rate is more comparable with that of a somewhat similar face-to-face study on migraine by Lemstra et al. (3.8% attrition rate; <italic>n</italic> = 80) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>) than with the Internet-based headache studies we have identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0027 CIT0028 CIT0029">27&#x02013;29</xref>). Similar to our study, an MBT approach was used in the study by Lemstra et al., including issues of diet, physical activity, cognitive change, and massage. However, the study by Lemstra et al. differed by including only participants with chronic migraine, who were also younger on average, and by using a 6-week face-to-face group session design.</p><p>In the present study, we chose not to interfere with any on-going pharmacological treatment, and when checking for any change in preventive medication only very few changed their medication. We do not believe this had any impact on the outcome.</p><p>It is likely that a larger sample size with more power would have yielded clearer results, although the present size was evidently sufficient for determining that our format for MBT has an effect. Although we would have liked to include more participants, our sample size compares well with those of recent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0027 CIT0028 CIT0029">27&#x02013;29</xref>) and older studies (before 1999: reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>)) on behavioral treatment of migraine. Furthermore, gender aspects are of importance in a disease such as migraine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0044 CIT0045 CIT0046 CIT0047">44&#x02013;47</xref>),and gender-based analyses may generate new knowledge. However, despite our extra efforts to recruit men, we consider their number suboptimal for this purpose.</p></sec><sec id="ss36"><title>Concluding remarks and prospects for the future</title><p>We conclude that our MBT program, in its present format, seems to improve migraine, presumably via increasing awareness of, and adjustments to, healthier life-style patterns. The results, showing both efficacy and a low attrition rate, speak in favor of using the Internet for behavioral treatment of migraine. We therefore believe our program has the potential of becoming a valuable and effective tool at a probably limited cost in the treatment of migraine. However, further evaluation of the program is needed for better understanding of the individual contributions of its components, its long-term effects, and its full potential for improvement.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful for: financial support from the Erik, Karin, and G&#x000f6;sta Selander Foundation and from the Nursing Research Foundation, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, Uppsala University; skillful help from Harriet Marnell, adviser in stress management, and valuable support from Ulla Anderberg MD, PhD, formerly Uppsala University, and statistical assistance from: Hans Arinell, BSc, Uppsala University, Lars-Olof Nordesj&#x000f6;, MD, PhD, formerly Uppsala University and Karl-Erik Westergren, Tech lic, senior lecturer, University of G&#x000e4;vle.</p><p>
