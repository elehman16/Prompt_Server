intercourse for at least one year are evaluated
for infertility. The workup of such patients include basic infertility tests. These tests involve
the spermiogram, a marker of sperm production, a hysterosalpingogram (HSG) which
determines tubal patency, and the evaluation
of ovulation. The pregnancy rate in normally
fertile couples is 20-25%, while this rate averages between 2-4% in infertile couples (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).
Since controlled ovarian hyperstimulation
plus intrauterine insemination (COH+IUI) is
less expensive and less laborious than intracytoplasmic sperm injection or <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization (ICSI/IVF), the former is considered as a first treatment choice. Studies to increase the suc-
cess of this treatment modality are ongoing.</p><p>Hysterosalpingography, which is one of the basic tests of infertility, has a mechanical washing
effect on the uterine cavity and tubes. Particularly
after performing this test with an oil-based contrast
medium, the chance of spontaneous pregnancy increases. Given that the HSG is normal, expectant
management reveals a pregancy rate of up to 40%
in such patients. If the same patients were to undergo
appropriate treatment, the pregnancy rate generally
reaches 30%. Therefore, following an HSG with an
oil-based contrast, management with an average duration of six months is preferred in most centers (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>)</p><p>The positive effect of this phenomenon may be utilized by introducing uterine cavity pertubation prior
to infertility treatment. Considering cases of early
stage endometriosis, the mechanical effect of pertubation may decrease minor tubal adhesions. The proposed immunologic effect is based on the prevention
of sperm phagocytosis and the removal of peritoneal
cytokins and immunological factors (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>)</p><p>We considered the mechanical and immunological effect of uterine cavity pertubation on treatment
protocols for patients with unexplained infertility.
To demonstrate a possible beneficial impact of this
procedure we designed a randomized prospective
study, in which uterine washing was administered
prior to insemination in patients diagnosed with
unexplained infertility.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This study was carried out in patients who presented to Gazi University Hospital, Division of
Infertility Services with diagnoses of unexplained
infertility. This was a single-center, prospective,
randomized, blinded control trial undertaken at
a tertiary care university fertility center between
January 2010-March 2011</p><p>Patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria
(180 cases) were randomized by systemic randomization in which they were sequentially allocated to two treatment groups. This systemic
randomization was performed by the nurse coordinator on the hCG injection day in the absence of the clinicians.</p><p>We included 180 patients in the study. It was initially planned to form to equal groups, namely the
control and study groups, however only 79 eligible
participants gave writen consent and accepted the
pertubation procedure. The other 101 participants received the planned treatment protocol only (control
group). We excluded one patient from the study group
due to cycle cancellation. The study group eligibility
criteria included: age of 18-44 years; presence of regular menstrual cycles and ovulation; absence of tubal
occlusion on HSG; sperm concentration &#x0003e;15 million
spermatoza/ml and total sperm number &#x0003e;39 million/
ml according to WHO criteria (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Exclusion criteria
were the presence of endocrinologic disease; use of
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or
corticosteroids; clinical findings suggestive of pelvic
inflamatory disease; and the presence of undiagnosed
uterine bleeding.</p><p>Follitropin alpha (Gonal F, rec-FSH, Serona,
Turkey), follitropin beta (Puregon, rec-FSH Organon, Turkey), urinary hMG (Merional, Aris,
Turkey veya Menogon, Erkim, Turkey) and urofolitropin (Fostimon, Aris, Turkey) were used
for ovarian stimulation. Ovulation induction
was started between 2-5 days of menstruation
on patients who had no residual cysts larger
than 15 mm as visualized with basal transvaginal USG (ultrasound). All patients had 75-150
Iu/day drug as an initial dose. On cycle day 5-6,
stimulated follicles were measured ultrasonographically. Induction doses were increased or
decreased between 37.5-75 IU/day according to
follicle size. Blood estriol and LH levels were
monitored and recorded during follow up. When
1-2 follicles reached a mean diameter of 17 mm,
we administered 250 &#x000b5;g of recombinant hCG
to trigger ovulation. Treatment was discontinued when two or more follicles showed equal
maturation in order to avoid the risk of multiple
pregnancies. In case of maturation of two follicles because of the risk of a twin pregnancy,
treatment was discontinued. At 35-36 hours after the hCG injection, IUI was performed. Two
days following insemination micronized vaginal progesterone (400-600 mg/day, Progestan,
Kocak, Turkey) was administered to support the
luteal phase until the pregnancy was confirmed.
Two weeks after insemination, blood beta-hCG
levels were analyzed. If the result was negative,
progesterone support was discontinued. Patients
with positive hCG titers received progesterone
support until nine weeks of gestation.</p><p>The swim up prcedure was used for sperm washing. A Rocket Embryo IUI catheter was used during insemination.</p><p>Since our study aimed to evaluate the use of
pertubation prior to ovulation, the procedure
was performed on the same day as the hCG
injection, prior to its administration. The pertubation procedure was performed in the dorsal lithotomy position after the application of
a vaginal speculum. The vaginal portion of the
cervix was cleansed with a povidone-iodine
(PVP-I) solution to prevent potential uterine infections. Povidone-iodine is a stable chemical
complex of polyvinylpyrrolidone (povidone,
PVP) and elemental iodine (I). It is used for
the prevention and treatment of skin infections,
and the treatment of wounds. This solution has
cytotoxic effects on sperm and embryo. However PVP-I is used on the hCG injection day,
36 hours before IUI. Similarly, many clinics
use betadine for cervical preparation prior to
the oocyte pick-up procedure. Vaginal preparation by betadine does not seem to affect the IVF
results (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Uterine washing was accomplished by introducing a silicone catheter through the internal cervical
os, after which 20 cc saline and 1 cc jetocain were
slowly injected. Special attention was given to infuse the solution over a few seconds, since rapid
injections could give rise to pelvic pain. Jetocain
was used for its local anesthetic effects. The speculum was removed and the procedure completed
after the injection.</p><p>Two weeks after insemination, a blood beta
hCG level was obtained. Two days later, patients whose results were positive had a repeat
test to ascertain a healthy increase in beta hCG
levels. Patients whose control beta hCG level
decreased or those who experienced vaginal
bleeding were classified as biochemical pregnancies. Patients with a healthy beta hCG increase were evaluated two weeks later for
clinical pregnancy status. A regular intrauterine
gestational sac and presence of fetal cardiac
activity confirmed the clinical pregnancy. Patients who experienced pregnancy loss after the
sac was visualized were considered as clinical
miscarriages. Pregnancies over 20 gestational
weeks that resulted in births were defined as
live births.</p><p>This study was approved by the Ethics Committee clinical studies in Ankara and received approval on 25.11.2009.</p><p>Pertubation was considered the independent variable. Pregnancy rate (chemical and clinical) was
the primary dependent outcome variable.</p><p>Data were analyzed with the SPSS software
version 15.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago,
Illinois, USA). Continuous variables (age, duration of infertility, total motile sperm count,
3<sup>rd</sup> day FSH, initial and total dose of ovulation
induction agent, follicle count and size, and endometrial thickness) were presented as mean &#x000b1;
SD. Categorical variables (alcohol or cigarette
use, agent of ovulation induction, fertilization
rate or pregnancy outcomes) as frequency and
percentage. Student&#x02019;s t test was used to compare normally distributed continuous variables
and the Mann-Whitney U test for variables
without normal distribution. Categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test.
A two-tailed p value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered
statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>
Among the 180 patients included, 135 were primarily infertile. There were 51 (64%) primary infertile patients in the study group and 84 (83%)
primary infertile patients included in the control
group. In a comparison between groups, we noted
that secondary infertility was more common in the
control group (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>Participants included in the study were be-
tween the ages of 18-44 years. The mean age of
the study group was 28.8 &#x000b1; 5.3 years and 28.2
&#x000b1; 4.7 for the control group (p=0.401). The average infertility period was 3.6 &#x000b1; 2.3 years in
the study group and 3.8 &#x000b1; 2.8 years in the con-
trol group. This difference was not statistically
significant (p=0.684). As seen in table 1, day-3
basal FSH levels were not significantly different between groups (p&#x0003e;0.05).</p><p>There were 21 smokers in the study, of which 7
(8.9%) were from study group and 14 (13.9%) were in
the control group. There was no statistical difference
between both groups when compared for distribution of smokers (p=0.300). Both groups did not include
patients that had a background of regular alcohol use.</p><p>There was no significant difference between
the types and initial or total doses of gonadotrophins (p&#x0003e;0.05, Tables 2, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). There was also
no significant difference between the study
and control groups in terms of dominat follicle
count, mean follicle diameter and endometrial
thickness.</p><p>The mean total motile sperm number in the study
group was 99.706 &#x000b1; 85.214 and for the control
group, it was 86.304 &#x000b1; 61.057. A comparison of
both groups showed no significant differnce in total motile sperm count (p=0.405).</p><p>From the 180 participants, 39 concieved. A total of 15 pregnancies were from the study group
and 24 from the control group. In the study
group 3 patients had biochemical pregnancies,
1 miscarried and 10 patients had live births. In
the control group, 1 patient had a biochemical
pregnancy, 3 patients miscarried and 20 patients
had live births. Between the two groups, there
was no significant difference in pregnancy rates
(p=0.296, Tables 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>). Pregnancy loss rates
were statistically similar.</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p> Patients&#x02019; demographic characteristics</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><th colspan="5" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th rowspan="2" colspan="1">Demographic data</th><th colspan="2" rowspan="1">Pertubation</th><th rowspan="2" colspan="1">P value</th><th rowspan="2" colspan="1">Minimum/maximum</th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Performed Mean &#x000b1;

age group (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Around 10% of the infertile population is classed as unexplained. Ovulation induction and intrauterine insemination is the accepted first line treatment plan for unexplained
infertility.</p><p>In order to obtain a homogenous patient population we only included patients diagnosed with
unexplained infertility in this study.</p><p>At least three cytokines are synthesized by the
endometrium, colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF) and interleukin-1 (IL-<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), which are associated with implantation (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). CSF-1 expression from endometrium and
preimplantation embryo. Cadherin is an important
agent for intercellular junctional providing on epithelial cells. In the peri-implantation phase, E-cadherin and E-cadherin mRNA expression from endometrium (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). E-cadherin and E-cadherin mRNA
levels are lower in the proliferative endometrium
than during the secretion phase. The adhesive
function of the endometrium is to be activated after ovulation.</p><p>T helper (Th) 1 and 2 expression increases in
peripheral lymphocytes of patients with recurrent
artificial reproductive tecnology (ART) failure (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).
In pregnancy, Th 2 concentration is higher than Th
1 concentration. The Th1/Th2 rate is higher in patients who have recurrent abortions and recurrent
implantation failure when compared with a fertile
control group (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In some studies, findings have
shown increases in the numbers of peripheral natural killer cells. However this finding has not been
fully verified (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>We can analyze the effect of immunological
factors on implantation success in patients with
hydrosalpinx. The liquid of the hydrosalpinx
blocks implantation either by a direct embrotoxic effect, a negative impact on the endometrium, and mechanical impact. Implantation
and pregnancy rate is lower in patients with hydrosalpinx than in a normal control group (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).
Prospective rondomized studies have shown that
the success of an ART procedure increases with
salpingectomy in patients who have hydrosal-
pinx. This effect is the same on both of the first
ART cycles and with recurrent ART cycles (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The endometrial environment becomes more ideal for implantation with cleaning of embry-
otoxic cytokines. In a similar way, during the
pertubation, thin adhesions in the endometrial
cavity was opened with rapid fluid pressure.</p><p>The downfall of the current study was the use
of an open randomized technique during patient
recruitment. As a result when we compared both
groups, it was evident that in the study group secondary infertile patients outnumbered primary
infertile couples, whereas in the control group
primarily infertile patients were more common.
According to one study performed at our center,
independent factors which increased clinic pregnancy rates were secondary infertiliy and unexplained infertility. However these factors did not
affect live birth rates (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>Although the pregnancy rate was higher in the
control group, this was not statistically significant
when compared with the study group (p=0.296).
When we evaluated both biochemical and clinical
pregnancies, the pregnancy rate was 17.8% in the
study group and 23.8% in the control group. The
rate of live births, which was the main purpose of
this treatment was 12.7% in the study group and
19.8% in the control group.</p><p>Spontaneous miscarriage occurs in 15-20% of
known pregnancies. If serial hCG is measured to
detect early subclinical pregnancy loss, this rate
would increase to 30% (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In our study, 21%
of total pregnancies were abort. This rate was not
higher than the expected pregnancy loss rates in
normal cycles. When we compared pregnancy loss
rates in both groups, there was no significant difference observed (p&#x0003e;0.05).</p><p>Aboulghar et al. included 213 patients in a study
where they performed hydropertubation on 103
patients. They used clomiphen citrate and urinary
HMG for ovulation induction followed by IUI. In
our study, we only used gonadotropins for ovulation induction. Both studies have performed intrauterine insemination after ovulation induction.
Generally the expected fecundability rate associated with this type of treatment protocol is approximately 17% (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Aboulghar et al. reported
an ongoing pregnancy rate of 12.6% in their study
group. Similarly, our research resulted in a rate of
fecundability of 17.8% and an ongoing pregnancy
rate of 12.7% in the study group. Therefore our
results were compatible with the aforemenioned study (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>In our study the control group&#x02019;s fecundability
rate was 23.8% and the continued pregnancy rate
was 19.8%. There was no significant difference
between the study and control groups. However
the relatively higher rate in the control group suggested the negative effects of pertubation.</p><p>Yap&#x000e7;a et al. investigated the effectivity of
hydrotubation in unexplained infertility therapy by evaluating 80 patients and 144 cycles
(<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). They reported 11(15.7%) pregnancies and
9(12.86%) clinical pregnancies in a total of 70
cycles in the study group. A total of 74 cycles
in the control group yielded 4(5.4%) pregnan-
cies and 2(5%) clinical pregnancies. There was
a significant overall difference between the two
groups (p=0.0219). When evaluated on the basis of individual patients, 11(27.5%?) pregnancies and 9(22.5%) clinical pregnancies occurred
following two cycles of therapy in 40 patients
of the study group. In the control group of 40
patients, there were 4(10%) pregnancies and 2
(5%) clinical pregnancies following two cycles
of therapy. When compared on the basis of individual patients, a significant difference was
noted (p=0.0231). As a result, the uterine lavage had a positive effect on treatment success
in unexplained infertile subjects. Although this
study was similar to ours, we were unable to
establish a positive effect of pertubation on fecundability. In contrast to a study by Yap&#x000e7;a, the
current study included a larger population (180
vs. 80), where each patient underwent a single
cycle of treatment.</p><p>Lei et al. have reported the effects hydrotubation in 50 formerly proven tubal occlusive patients
(<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The hysteroscopic procedure involved the
passage of a thin plastic canula through the fallopian tube simulatenously using irrigation media
that contained hydrocortisone, gentamycine and
procain. The use of additional therapeutic agents
in hydrotubation might explain their increased rate
of fecundability.</p><p>Edelstam et al. performed out a prospective
randomized study to evaluate the effect of pertubation on pregnancy rates in patients with
unexplained infertility (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Pertubation was performed prior to ovulation. A total of 130 cycles
were investigated. There was a significant difference between the pregnancy rates (14.9 vs.
3.2%) of both groups. The authors concluded
that pertubation could be used in conjuction
with ovulation induction and intrauterine insemination as a first line management protocol
in couples with unexplained infertility.</p></sec><sec sec-type="coclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In sum, results of this study revealed that pertubation prior to insemination did not effect pregnancy rates.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Any company or organization financially supported our study.
