From March 2007 to November 2009, 442 patients were included in this study. Those centers that have the facility and requirements for stenting and also the tendency for research collaboration are included in this trial. The stent type selection was based on the cardiologist opinion. Patients were randomized at least 12 hours before planned PCI to receive a 300 mg loading dose of Plavix or Osvix (1:1) and followed by 75 mg/day for 30 days in BMS and 6 months in DES groups. All patients received daily aspirin therapy before PCI and were continued until one and six months in BMS and DES groups, respectively. External evaluation committee assessed the procedure of the study every six months.</p><p>The study was approved by the ethical committee of the Isfahan Cardiovascular Research Center, a WHO collaborating center and was registered in the Iranian registration clinical trial (IRCT138712111723N1). All patients provided written informed consents for participation.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Study participants</title><p>Patients were eligible for enrollment if they were &#x02265; 18 years of age, had chronic stable angina and selected for stenting in a coronary artery with diameter &#x02265; 2.5mm. Exclusion criteria included previous treatment with a clopidogrel or warfarin for any reason, history of allergy or any contraindication to clopidogrel, high-risk patients (e.g., severe left ventricular dysfunction with ejection fraction less than 30%, stenting of saphenous vein grafts or internal mammary artery), total vessel occlusion without myocardial viability in DES and large thrombus in angiography before PCI.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Study Protocol</title><p>All the patients underwent complete history and physical examination. Baseline and demo graphic information including sex, age, indications for stenting, morphology, length, and diameter of stent, previous cardiac interventions, and left ventricular ejection fraction based on echocardiography reports were recorded according to the patients&#x02019; medical charts. History of smoking, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus and family history of premature coronary heart disease (CAD) in first relatives were also recorded. All the patients underwent electrocardiography and echocardiography before the intervention. Blood samples were drawn from each patient before the intervention to measure the platelet and neutrophil counts as well as liver enzymes. Patients who were selected for stenting were randomly assigned to receive a 300 mg loading dose of Plavix (n = 221) or Osvix (n = 221) (1:1 randomization ratio) 12 hours before the procedure followed by 75 mg/day for 30 days in BMS and 6 months in DES groups. All patients received daily aspirin therapy three days before PCI and were continued until one and six months in BMS and DES groups, respectively. External evaluation committee assessed the procedure of the study every six months. The laboratory assessment was performed for all patients before the study, then one month after PCI for patients with BMS and one and six months after PCI for patients with DES. Follow up to assess clinical end points including MACE were done. Blood samples were taken in one month and six months in BMS and DES groups to measure platelets, neutrophils, alanine ami-notransferase (ALT), and aspartate ami-notransferase (AST).</p></sec><sec id="sec3-4"><title>Angioplasty procedure</title><p>Coronary angiography was performed according to standard techniques. Unfractionated heparin, 100 unit/kg was administered immediately before the procedure. PCI was considered successful when a residual diameter stenosis was less than 20% with thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow less than III. TIMI III means contrast material flows briskly into and clears rapidly from the distal segment or good distal runoff.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></p><p>TIMI grade 3 flows were obtained. Patient's angiographic films were reviewed by two independent cardiologists to collect appropriate data. Coronary angiography lesions were classified into three types. Type A included lesions with the following characteristics: discrete (&#x0003c;10 mm length), concentric, readily accessible, non-angulated segment, smooth contour, little or no calcium, less than totally occlusive, not ostial in location, no major side branch involvement, and absence of thrombus. Type B included lesions of tubular (10-20 mm length), eccentric, moderate tortuosity of proximal segment &#x02265; 45, irregular contour, moderate to heavy circulation, total occlusion, ostial location, bifurcation lesion requiring double guide wire, and some thrombus present. Type C involved diffuse (&#x0003e; 20 mm length), excessive tortuosity of proximal segment, extremely angu-lated segments (&#x02265; 90), with total occlusion &#x0003e;3 months old, inability to protect major side braches, and degenerated side branches with friable lesions.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-5"><title>Study end points</title><p>MACE which is the primary endpoint of this study included death, Q wave and non-Q wave MI, stroke, target lesion revascularization (TLR), target vascular revascularization (TVR), in-stent thrombosis. Cardiovascular death was considered as any death with a cardiovascular cause and included those deaths following a cardiovascular procedure (for example, PCI), cardiac arrest, MI, pulmonary embolus, stroke, hemorrhage or death due to unknown cause. Non- cardiovascular death was defined as death due to a clearly documented non-cardiovascular cause (e.g., trauma, infection, malignancy). MI was defined by symptoms suggestive of infarction, electrocardiographic changes, and positive cardiac enzymes. In-stent thrombosis was classified in three groups; definite: the presence of an acute coronary syndrome with angiographic or autopsy evidence of thrombus or occlusion; probable: unexplained deaths within 30 days after procedure or acute myocardial infarction involving the target-vessel territory without angiographic confirmation; possible: all unexplained deaths occurring at least 30 days after the procedure. Stroke defined as a new focal neurological deficit thought to be vascular in origin with signs and symptoms lasting more than 24 hours. Secondary endpoints included changes of platelet or neutrophil number or liver enzymes, hospitalization for angina, and major bleeding.</p><p>All primary and secondary end points were assessed during hospitalization and after 30 days in BMS and six months in DES group.

Increased platelet activity has been shown to increase cardiovascular complications in acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and subsequent to PCI.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref> Various studies have demonstrated that administration of antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin, ticlopidine and clopidogrel reduce short and long-term cardiovascular events in patients suffering ACS or undergoing PCI.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> We studied the short and long-term cardiovascular complications, including death, myocardial infarction, stroke, TLR and TVR in patients treated with Osvix (300 mg bolus, and 75 mg/daily maintenance) or Plavix (300 mg bolus, and 75 mg/daily maintenance). Assessment of secondary end-points such as angina, heart failure (HF), major hemorrhagic episodes, and reduction of platelet or neutrophil counts and liver enzyme changes revealed no significant difference between the two treated groups. Reduced systolic performance and ageing are among important factors underlying MACE in these patients. However, the frequency distribution of age, sex and left ventricular systolic function were similar in Osvix and Plavix groups. Tavazzi showed that concomitant disease and CVD risk factors can increase MACE.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref> Whereas these risk factors were evenly distributed in the two groups in this randomized clinical trial; a higher frequency of hypertension in the Osvix group was seen (p = 0.001) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Kang and colleagues demonstrated that hypertension does not affect short and long-term cardiovascular complications of PCI.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref> Patients in Osvix group showed nonsignificant lower MACE rate than the Plavix group (p &#x0003c; 0.05). Thus, it can be concluded that Osvix has at least similar CVD complications as Plavix. Ali-doosti and colleagues showed that the type of vessel selected for PCI did not affect the short and long term complications of the procedure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref> In our study, the frequency distribution according to the vessel elected for angioplasty was the same in both groups. Various studies have demonstrated an increase in short and long term post-angioplasty complications in patients with complex lesions: the worse the anatomy and morphology of the lesion, the more difficult the procedure and the poorer the outcomes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref> In our study, the frequency distribution of the type of coronary lesion elected for angioplasty was not significantly different in the Osvix and Plavix groups. In separate studies, Singh and Pompa showed that the length and diameter of stents are directly, and inversely proportional to TLR.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref> In our study, the stent length and diameter, as well as angioplasty technique had similar distribution in both groups, although the rate of TVR was low in our study as shown by results. This may have been due to the short follow-up period (one month for non-pharmacological stents and six months for pharmacological stents). TVR was seen in two of our patients who underwent CABG a day after unsuccessful angioplasty. Based on comparison of frequency distribution of patients according to MACE in the preceding one and six months for BMS and DES stents, respectively, the incidence of MACE including death was similar in the Osvix and Plavix groups. The incidence of MI was 0.4% in the Osvix and 1.4% in the Pla-vix groups with no significant difference. Instent thrombosis occurred in 0.4% of Osvix and 0.5% of Plavix groups. We found the same results regarding stroke, TVR and overall MACE. No significant difference was observed between the two groups in regard to episodes of angina, HF and bleeding which suggest no inferiority of Osvix compared to Plavix. Although the occurrence of events was not significantly different in the two groups, the distribution of findings revealed an up-sloping trend in complications in the Plavix group. Thus, it may be concluded that Osvix was not associated with more complications than Plavix in patients who underwent PCI. Safety of antiplatelet drugs is of great importance and must be assessed against possible side-effects. Gurbel demonstrated that including clopidogrel in the therapy of unstable angina patients, significantly reduced mortality from MACE. Although clopidogrel may significantly increase the risk of bleeding, its benefits have been shown to outweigh the risks.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref> Yusuf and colleagues showed that adding clopidogrel to aspirin reduced MACE but increased the risk of bleeding.<sup>25</sup> However, in our study, the rate of major bleeding in Osvix and Plavix groups who were treated with aspirin too, were not significant. During our follow-up period, mean platelet counts did not change significantly in either groups (Plavix, p = 0.80 and Osvix, p = 0.99) or between them (p = 0.87). However, neutrophil counts were reduced significantly in the two groups (p &#x0003c; 0.001), but the trend of change in counts was not significantly different between the two groups. The above findings showed that adverse hematological effects (thrombopenia or neutropenia) did not increase in the Osvix group as compared to the Plavix group.</p><p>We noted some limitations to our study, the most important of which was the small study population. However, the power of the study was enough to achieve the main and secondary objectives of the study. We recommend future studies to be carried out with larger study population. The other important limitation was that the angiographies were performed by different cardiologists in different centers. Thus, interobserver variability was inevitable.</p><p>In conclusion, our data demonstrated the safety of Osvix in improving clinical outcome compared to Plavix after coronary stenting in BMS or DES using patients. The frequency of MACE, non-cardiac events or adverse hematological changes did not increase with Osvix compared to Plavix patients which suggest it's safety. However, due to more cost advantages of Osvix regimen over Plavix, administration of Osvix among Iranian patients is preferable.</p><p><graphic xlink:href="JRMS-16-640-g007.jpg" position="float"/></p></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>Authors&#x02019; Contributions</title><p>AKH designed the study and drafted this manuscript, MP designed the study, MO, GKM, MN, AKH, MH, FR, SHS, and JK Carried the study, MGH drafted the manuscript and tables, HZ helped in designing the study and carried the study, AAT helped in designing the study, BS data analysis and drafted the tables, MGH helped in designing the study, MRKH and FN helped in statistical analysis, EKH and MJ helped in Data gathering, and NS helped in designing the study, revising the manuscript procedures, and drafting the manuscript.
