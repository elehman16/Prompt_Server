Faster detection can be achieved by using polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) based assays. Among those, the Gene-Xpert system (Cepheid, USA) allows detection of MRSA within 75 minutes from nasal swab samples. This automated system allows random access with immediate processing of each sample when it reaches the laboratory <xref rid="pone.0096310-Robicsek1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>The medical added value and cost effectiveness of implementing routine testing with molecular assays remains debated. Mathematical modelling suggests that molecular MRSA screening embedded in the &#x0201c;search-and destroy&#x0201d; policy should be highly cost-beneficial at hospital level in both endemic and low prevalence settings <xref rid="pone.0096310-Bootsma1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. However, conflicting results have been found in intervention studies on the impact of rapid screening on control of MRSA transmission and infection within hospitals <xref rid="pone.0096310-Jog1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0096310-Harbarth1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. This heterogeneity of reported effect can be related to variation in the quality of study design, with a majority of studies with positive effect using uncontrolled observational designs, and to differences in the epidemiological and patient care context.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Objectives</title><p>We sought to measure the benefit of rapid PCR versus culture for detection of MRSA carriage upon admission to hospital general wards on (1) shortening the delay to isolate previously unknown MRSA carriers and (2) reducing MRSA transmission to other patients admitted to the same ward. As the hospital transmission of MRSA is primarily occurring by indirect contact through care procedures within a patient care unit, a cluster randomised design was chosen with inclusion of high incidence general wards as study clusters. With such an intervention, randomisation of individual participants would be ineffective due to MRSA cross-contamination within a ward. Practically, only ward randomisation was feasible. As the number of wards that were eligible for the trial was small and to adjust for different transmission dynamics due to case-mix heterogeneity between specialty wards, we have chosen a &#x0201c;cross-over&#x0201d; design. The objectives pertain to both individual level and cluster level. Whereas the delay in implementing patient isolation precautions was assessed at the individual participant level, the primary outcome of hospital acquisition of MRSA was analysed at the cluster level.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Methods Section</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0096310.s002">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0096310.s001">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><p>The study protocol was approved by the institutional ethical committee (Ethics committee Erasme hospital) before the study began. All patients admitted to study wards were informed orally and by a written notice explaining the rationale, design, and procedures of the study. The requirement for individual patient informed consent was waived by the ethical committee based on the lack of additional sample collection for the study and provision of standard care to all study participants irrespective of study intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Trial Design</title><p>This observer-blind, cluster randomized intervention trial, used a before-after crossover design with 1&#x02236;1 cluster allocation ratio between intervention and standard practice. The trial started in November 2008 as double centre study in two hospitals in Belgium, discontinued for futility after interim data analysis in one hospital and completed as single centre study in January 2010 in the other hospital.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Participants and Setting</title><p>The study initially included two sites, Erasme hospital in Brussels and St Jan hospital in Bruges, Belgium. It was discontinued for futility after five months in the latter site when interim analysis indicated lower than expected MRSA acquisition rate in the control arm.</p><p>Erasme hospital is an academic tertiary care centre with 864 beds in 33 wards. The seven wards selected for the study (cardiac surgery, cardiology, pneumology, neurology, oncology geriatric care and rehabilitation wards) had experienced the highest MRSA carriage rates on admission and highest hospital acquisition rates in the year preceding the study and represented a range of specialist medical, surgical and rehabilitation care. Patients expected on admission to study wards to stay more than 48 h were eligible for entry in the study and underwent admission and discharge screening for MRSA carriage. Patients readmitted to study wards more than 24 h after discharge or transfer to a non-study ward were counted as new admissions.</p><p>Erasme hospital has a long established MRSA surveillance and control programme in accordance with national guidelines <xref rid="pone.0096310-Belgian1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. For more than a decade before the study, periodic alcohol-based hand hygiene promotion campaigns had been successfully conducted hospital wide. MRSA control policies included targeted screening of MRSA carriers among high risk admissions by selective enrichment culture of nasal, throat and wound sites, computer flagging and pre-emptive isolation on readmission of previously known MRSA carriers, isolation of MRSA carriers in single bed room using gloves, gown and mask for patient care and topical decolonisation therapy of MRSA carriers with nasal mupirocin ointment and chlorhexidine bathing. The rate of MRSA hospital acquisition as detected by clinical cultures had been steadily decreasing for 10 consecutive years prior to the study to reach a mean of 1.3 case/1,000 admission in 2008.</p><p>The study was conducted in four phases. Phase (1) was a three-month baseline protocol implementation phase to achieve a target of 80% compliance with admission and discharge MRSA screening and isolation of MRSA carriers. Phases (2 and 3) spanned an 11-month intervention phase, subdivided into two five-month intervention periods using either conventional admission MRSA screening test by culture methods performed six days a week during working hours (control arm) or rapid admission MRSA screening performed by PCR testing seven days a week during working hours (intervention arm). The sequential order of inclusion of wards as cluster participants in each study arm was randomised by assigning a number to each ward and using a computer generated list of random numbers. Four wards started with intervention phase for the first five-months and followed with control phase for the following five-months whereas the other three wards followed the reverse sequence. A one-month wash out period (4) without intervention by PCR testing was performed between phase (2) and (3) before crossing the study wards over intervention arms. Evaluable patients had to be screened at admission (or within 24 h) and at discharge (or within 72 h prior to discharge) with a 48 h minimum time interval between these two screenings.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Intervention</title><sec id="s3d1"><title>Screening process</title><p>Within the first 24 h after admission and 72 h prior to the discharge but preferably on the day of discharge, whenever possible, eligible patients were screened for MRSA by swabbing anterior nares, throat, perineum, and wounds, bladder or intravenous catheter exit site if applicable.</p><p>Screening swabs of the control arm were processed by conventional testing using selective enrichment culture in 7.5% NaCl Brain-Heart Infusion broth combined with plating on chromID MRSA medium (bioMerieux, France) as previously described <xref rid="pone.0096310-Roisin1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.

id="s3g"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Based on MRSA surveillance data from our institution, a 3% cumulated incidence was the expected baseline rate for the primary endpoint. The expected size of effect in our study was based on the hypothesis that shortening time to detection of MRSA carriage by three days would reduce MRSA nosocomial acquisition by 50%. Based on a 2-tailed test sample size calculation for detecting a reduction in proportions from 3% to 1.5% in two independent samples with 95% confidence and a power of 80%, a minimum of 1664 patients were required in each study arm. The study was interrupted at St Jan hospital site after interim analysis of phase 2 showed a MRSA acquisition rate (0.97%) below expected rate in the control arm. The estimated sample size required for achieving 80% power at Erasme hospital was revised to 1 027 patients per arm based on interim analysis of higher than expected MRSA acquisition rate (4.8%) in the control arm in phase 2 of the study. The actual number of 2 505 patients gave the study 70% power to detect a reduction in overall MRSA acquisition rate from 3.2 to 1.6%, not taking into account cluster effect and crossover matched design.</p><p>Outcome measures were computed for each ward and month for the intervention and control arms and compared. Given the small number of clusters, analysis of nosocomial MRSA acquisition was based on cluster-level summaries taking into account the crossover design (paired analysis). As described by Hayes &#x00026; Moulton <xref rid="pone.0096310-Hayes1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, covariate adjustment was achieved through a two-stage procedure. First, a Poisson regression model, including terms for the matched pairs and for the covariates is fitted to the data in order to obtain the expected number of events and residual for each cluster. Based on these results, in a second step, adjusted rate ratio, confidence interval and significance tests can for this adjusted rate ratio can be obtained. The covariates included the following confounding factors: patient age and sex, monthly number of patient days, monthly MRSA colonisation pressure, staff compliance with hand hygiene, compliance with isolation precautions and total monthly antibiotic use. Participant demographic features, MRSA colonisation pressure and compliance with infection control measures were compared by intervention arm using Chi-square test. Median times from admission to detection of MRSA colonisation and isolation were compared using Wilcoxon rank sum test. Incidence of MRSA infection was compared using Fisher exact test. Analysis was done using STATA version 10.1.</p></sec><sec id="s3h"><title>Cost Data</title><p>The screening costs include: tests, laboratory labor, laboratory equipment and labor for taking swabs.

Previous studies of this intervention have yielded conflicting results. Quasi-experimental studies using historical controls suggested effectiveness of rapid PCR based MRSA screening in preventing MRSA acquisition or infection in surgical, intensive care or general acute care hospital settings <xref rid="pone.0096310-Cunningham1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0096310-Robicsek1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0096310-Jog1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0096310-Keshtgar1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0096310-Harbarth1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. A prospective, cross-over study of PCR based MRSA screening showed a decrease in MRSA transmission in surgical wards attributed to enhanced compliance with decolonisation therapy <xref rid="pone.0096310-Hardy1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. However, two large randomised controlled trials and a meta-analysis showed no measurable benefit of PCR over culture for screening in general wards or in planned surgery patients <xref rid="pone.0096310-Harbarth2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0096310-Tacconelli1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Another study showed no benefit of universal over targeted PCR-based MRSA screening <xref rid="pone.0096310-Leonhardt1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The heterogeneity of effect observed across studies may be related to variation in many factors, including study design, patient population, MRSA prevalence and transmission rates, diagnostic accuracy and turnaround time of PCR and culture methods, compliance with standard precautions, isolation, decolonisation and antibiotic stewardship <xref rid="pone.0096310-Kock1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0096310-Cookson1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>There are several hypotheses to explain the lack of impact of rapid screening in our study. Firstly, in contrast to studies showing a marked effect of introducing carrier screening and isolation as the sole MRSA control measure in hospitals with uncontrolled endemic transmission, our institution had been conducting a multimodal intervention programme including antibiotic stewardship, hand hygiene promotion and active MRSA surveillance and control measures for over 15 years as recommended by national guidelines <xref rid="pone.0096310-Belgian1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and hand hygiene promotion campaigns <xref rid="pone.0096310-Jarlier1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. This infection control program is well implemented in our hospital, as indicated by staff compliance with hand hygiene policy and isolation precautions observed in this study. As part of this baseline control programme, over half of MRSA positive patients at admission to the study hospital were pre-emptively isolated based on computer flagging of history of MRSA colonisation or infection. Secondly, the PCR assay we used had a low sensitivity in our study population. However, the true admission MRSA prevalence was not underestimated due to this low PCR sensitivity as we controlled screening with optimized culture methods performed in parallel with PCR. Despite a marginal increase in proportion of captured isolation days for newly detected MRSA carriers, overall captured MRSA isolation days did not differ. Thus, in our setting, rapid MRSA screening did not enhance the high baseline compliance with isolation and decolonisation procedures.</p><p>In addition, use of PCR screening may result in untoward effects. In our hospital with a relatively low prevalence of MRSA, the PCR assay, despite an acceptable specificity, presented a low positive predictive value when compared to culture <xref rid="pone.0096310-Roisin1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Therefore, the number of isolation days doubled in the intervention arm due to many patients that were reported MRSA positive by PCR but not confirmed by culture. A study examining the clinical and epidemiological significance of only PCR-positive patients found no increased risk of infection compared to PCR-negative patients <xref rid="pone.0096310-Herdman1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Undesirable consequences of over-isolation cannot be ignored as this measure carries a substantial cost burden, increased workload for hospital staff and risk of decreased quality and safety of patient care <xref rid="pone.0096310-Morgan1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. Firstly, only patients staying more than 48 hours were included in the study and therefore shorter stay patients who could serve as MRSA donors were not investigated. Secondly, the cluster-randomised design that assumes no transmission between clusters was to some degree compromised by contact of patients admitted to different wards of the hospital, as transfer of patients and staff between wards occurred during the study. Thirdly, while our PCR screen had the shortest turnaround time reported to date, by providing results within admission day but often during the night shift, it actually took longer to start isolation of patients after reception of test result. This delay is not uncommonly observed in other clinical settings <xref rid="pone.0096310-Robicsek1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096310-Harbarth1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096310-Harbarth2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Patient care processes and diagnostic processes need to fully align to optimise benefit from rapid diagnostic tests.</p><p>In our setting, as costs for PCR testing were at least 4 times higher than by conventional method, and as PCR did not demonstrate any advantage in terms of MRSA transmission, rapid testing by PCR was considered not cost-effective. A PCR-based screening may be effective in other settings. In low MRSA prevalence countries where pre-emptive isolation policy apply to high risk patients admitted to hospital, MRSA screening can help reduce the number of unnecessary pre-emptive isolation days <xref rid="pone.0096310-Uckay1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. However, only culture-based screening by use of chromogenic agar, and not PCR screening, was found to be cost saving <xref rid="pone.0096310-Wassenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0096310-Murthy1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, in a hospital with an active culture-based MRSA surveillance program and good adherence to standard and isolation precautions, the use of a rapid PCR-based system for screening MRSA carriers at admission showed no measurable effect in enhancing infection control measures or reducing MRSA transmission. Decision about use of appropriate technology for MRSA admission screening must take into account the determinants of infection control effectiveness related to the hospital context.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0096310.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>
