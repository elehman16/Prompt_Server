However, in sub-Saharan Africa, many women of reproductive age, especially those living in poor rural settlements, are recognized to have low dietary intakes of essential nutrients, contributing to deficiencies (<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). These nutritional deficiencies are exacerbated during pregnancy, causing risk to both the mother and her unborn infant. Iron and zinc deficiencies are very common. Approximately 56% of women in sub-Saharan Africa are estimated to be anemic, mainly as a result of iron deficiency (<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Although the true extent of zinc deficiency is unknown, &#x02264;80% of women might be at risk of zinc deficiency because of habitual low dietary zinc intake (<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Maternal nutritional deficiency is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes, including low birth weight, small for gestational age, and prematurity (<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Prevention of nutritional deficiency during pregnancy is thus an important public health challenge in such settings. The most widely used strategy is the daily supplementation of iron (60 mg) and folic acid (400 &#x003bc;g) (FeFol). Because many women in resource-poor settings suffer multiple micronutrient (MMN) deficiencies, UNICEF/WHO/United Nations University (UNU) developed an MMN supplement for pregnant and lactating mothers (<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). However, the evidence supporting the advantages of an MMN supplement over FeFol remains limited (<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and alternate ways to improve the nutritional status of pregnant and lactating women are being explored, such as with the use of supplementary lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNSs) (<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). LNSs are a recently developed group of products shown to be a very effective option for the community-based treatment of severe malnutrition if a high dose is given (e.g., reference <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). They may also provide a route for the delivery of micronutrients that may be preferable to and more efficacious than other products (<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In trials of nutritional supplementation, LNSs can also be designed to include varying amounts of protein and energy (from small to large quantities).</p><p>Despite the increasing focus on different intervention strategies during pregnancy, the impact of maternal nutritional status on the regulation of nutrient transport in the human placenta, and hence on fetal supply, is largely unknown. During pregnancy a fetus is entirely dependent on placental transport for its nutrition; nutrients are transported via specialized nutrient transporters located on the placental microvillous and basal membranes (<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Evidence from animal studies indicates that, in the presence of low maternal dietary supply of micronutrients, signals from the fetus can upregulate the expression and activity of micronutrient transporters in the placenta to try to meet its nutritional needs (<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Conversely, the expression and activity of these transporters are lower in the placenta when maternal dietary supply is adequate. Thus placental nutrient transporter response to maternal nutritional status is key in assessing fetal nutritional accretion during pregnancy.</p><p>In a marginally nourished rural population, we investigated the effect of nutritional supplementation during pregnancy on maternal iron and zinc status, the expression of mRNA of iron and zinc transporter proteins in the placentas, and the impact on fetal cord blood iron status.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>This study was nested within the prenatal arm of a randomized trial investigating the effect of prenatal and infancy nutritional supplementation on infant immune development in rural Gambia [the ENID (Early Nutrition and Immune Development) trial; ISRCTN49285450] (<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The ENID trial was conducted in the West Kiang region of The Gambia, a rural subsistence community that farms primarily groundnuts and rice. West Kiang is &#x0223c;145 km (&#x0223c;90 miles) inland from Banjul, the capital of The Gambia, and has a stable resident population of &#x0223c;14,000 inhabitants distributed among 36 villages. The Gambia has a tropical climate with 2 main seasons: a hot, rainy season (June to October) and a cooler, dry season (November to May). The beginning of the dry season is characterized by food availability, whereas the wet season is characterized by food scarcity, increased energy expenditure from farming activities, and an increased incidence of infectious diseases (<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Prenatal intervention and assessments</title><p>The ENID trial was a randomized, partially blind trial of nutritional supplementation in pregnant women and their infants in the West Kiang region of the Gambia. This nested substudy focuses on only the pregnancy intervention, and so we do not describe the infants&#x02019; intervention. Full details of the ENID trial protocol are published elsewhere (<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Briefly, women between 18 and 45 y of age were invited to participate through informed consent. Each month after enrollment, participating women were visited by a member of the study team and completed a short questionnaire asking about the date of their last menstrual period. Women confirmed as being &#x0003c;20 wk pregnant and with a singleton pregnancy were randomly assigned into the trial.</p><p>Upon entering the trial, eligible pregnant women were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 intervention arms: <italic>1</italic>) FeFol supplementation provided 60 mg Fe/d and 400 &#x003bc;g folic acid/d. This arm represents the standard of care during pregnancy, per Gambian government guidelines. <italic>2</italic>) MMNs were provided as a combination of 15 micronutrients specifically formulated for use during pregnancy by UNICEF/WHO/UNU. However, unlike the UNICEF/WHO/UNU formulation, a single MMN tablet in the ENID trial provided twice the RDA of all nutrients except for iron and folate, which were kept at 60 mg/d and 400 &#x003bc;g/d, respectively, as in the FeFol arm. The decision to supplement at twice the RDA was based on evidence from West Africa suggesting that MMNs supplemented at twice the RDA are more effective with regard to birth outcomes (<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Both the FeFol and MMN supplements were formulated as tablets and manufactured by Scanpharm. <italic>3</italic>) Protein-energy (PE), an LNS, provided the same amounts of iron and folic acid as in the FeFol arm, but with the addition of energy, protein, and lipids. <italic>4</italic>) PE and MMNs (PE+MMN), a micronutrient-fortified LNS supplement providing the same amounts of micronutrients as in the MMN arm (including FeFol), in addition to the energy, protein, and lipid content. The 2 LNS products were manufactured by Valid Nutrition, Nairobi, Kenya.

women attended the Medical Research Council (MRC) Keneba clinic for a detailed antenatal assessment. A standard antenatal check, including blood pressure measurement and hemoglobin and urine analyses, was performed at each visit. In addition, data on maternal anthropometry, including weight, height, waist and hip circumferences, and midupper arm circumference, were collected. Gestational age was determined by ultrasound. All measurements were made using standard, regularly validated equipment and following the relevant standard operating procedures. At each visit, after an overnight fast, a sample of venous blood (20 mL) was collected in trace element&#x02013;free tubes (Sarstedt AG &#x00026; Co), and aliquots of plasma were prepared and stored for subsequent analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample collection at birth</title><p>In this community, the majority of women choose to deliver in their homes with the support of a traditional birth attendant. Through a network of field workers, deliveries in both homes and health centers were attended, when possible, by a midwife or traditional birth attendant. For home deliveries, field assistants residing in the village attended the delivery to collect cord blood and the placenta. The sample of cord blood (&#x02264;15 mL) was collected immediately after delivery. The placenta was then sealed in a sterile plastic bag and transported on ice, with the cord blood, to the MRC Keneba laboratory for processing (<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>Within 72 h of delivery, a trained midwife conducted neonatal anthropometry, including weight, length, midupper arm circumference, and head circumference.</p></sec><sec><title>Laboratory analysis</title><sec><title>Assessment of maternal iron and zinc status during pregnancy.</title><p>Whole-blood samples collected from the women at booking and 20 and 30 wk of gestation were used to assess hemoglobin concentration using a Medonic hematology analyzer (Clinical Diagnostic Solutions, Inc.). Plasma samples from the same time points were later assessed for the following panel of iron indicators: ferritin, serum soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), hepcidin, transferrin, unbound iron-binding capacity (UIBC), and iron. Plasma ferritin, transferrin, iron, and UIBC were quantified using an automated multianalyte analyzer (COBAS INTEGRA 400 plus; Roche Diagnostics). Plasma hepcidin was quantified by competitive ELISA [Hepcidin-25 (human) ELISA kit; Bachem), according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instruction. Plasma sTfR was quantified using a Quantikine IVD ELISA kit (R&#x00026;D Systems), according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Cord blood samples were analyzed for only hemoglobin, iron, and ferritin.</p><p>Only maternal blood samples collected at 30 wk of gestation were analyzed for plasma zinc, using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (7700 series; Agilent Technologies). Before inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, the plasma samples were predigested with nitric acid. This involved adding 40 &#x003bc;L ultragrade nitric acid (60% w/w; Merck) and 10 &#x003bc;L hydrogen peroxide (30% w/w; Sigma-Aldrich) to 50 &#x003bc;L plasma. The mixture was heated at 80&#x000b0;C for 40 min on a hot block, allowed to cool to room temperature, then diluted with ultrapure water (1:20). Trace element control (trace elements serum 1; Seronorm; Sero AS) was analyzed alongside the samples as a quality control. Five replicated measures of the samples, control, and standards were analyzed and the mean taken as the concentration of zinc in parts per billion. Measures in parts per billion were converted to micromoles per liter, with the molecular weight of zinc taken as 65.38 g/mol.</p></sec><sec><title>Placental sample processing.</title><p>Placental samples were processed according to a standard protocol adapted from Pasupathy et al.

Total RNA (200 ng) was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using a TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems), according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. The reverse-transcription reaction was carried out using a PTC-100 thermocycler (MJ Research Inc.), under the following conditions; 25&#x000b0;C for 10 min, 37&#x000b0;C for 60 min, 95&#x000b0;C for 5 min, and hold at 4&#x000b0;C.</p><p>RT-PCR reactions were carried out using a 7500 Fast RT-PCR system (Applied Biosystems), and each reaction contained 1.5 &#x003bc;L of primer (Qiagen), 7.5 &#x003bc;L Power SYBR Green PCR Mastermix (Applied Biosystems), and 5 &#x003bc;L cDNA in a 15-&#x003bc;L reaction. The PCR reactions were set at 95&#x000b0;C for 15 min, 60&#x000b0;C for 10 min (40 repeats), an added dissociation stage (95&#x000b0;C for 15 min), then 60&#x000b0;C for 1 min, and finally 95&#x000b0;C for 15 min (1 repeat). The results were obtained as cycle threshold and a single melt curves were obtained for all samples, indicating that a single PCR product was generated. The cycle threshold values were obtained for both the gene of interest (<bold>Supplemental Table 1</bold>) and the normalizing gene, ubiquitin (QT00234430; Qiagen). Gene expression was normalized to ubiquitin, and the relative expression of the gene of interest was expressed as 2<sup>&#x02212;&#x00394;CT</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary outcomes of this substudy were maternal iron and zinc status during pregnancy and mRNA expression of placental iron and zinc transporter proteins. The outcomes according to nutritional intervention arm were analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis, that is, regardless of adherence to treatment. This study was powered to detect a treatment effect of &#x02265;15% on maternal iron and zinc status, assuming a between-subject spread of 25%, at a power of 90% and a significance level of 5%. This required 75 mothers/treatment arm.</p><p>Data regarding maternal iron status were obtained at booking and weeks 20 and 30 of gestation, and were initially analyzed as a repeated-measures 2-factor ANOVA. Because the interaction between nutritional supplementation and week of gestation was significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) for all outcomes, subsequent analyses were based on 1-factor ANOVA for one time point at a time. Maternal characteristics at enrollment and placental and neonatal data were analyzed by 1-factor ANOVA.</p><p>All ANOVAs were adjusted for the following competing effect modifiers or confounders (i.e., variables that neither affected the intervention nor were affected by the intervention, but that could influence the outcomes of interest): gestational age and maternal BMI at booking, season of birth, and maternal parity. For both the repeated-measures 2-factor ANOVA and the 1-factor ANOVA per time point, the maternal iron markers were also adjusted for C-reactive protein, which was log-transformed to avoid the adjustments being driven by outliers. The mean values presented have been adjusted for these confounders. When the effect of nutritional supplementation was significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), post hoc <italic>t</italic> tests, based on the ANOVA findings, were used to explore differences between the nutritional treatment arms.</p><p>The assumptions of constant variation and normality required for ANOVA were assessed from visual inspection of residual plots; where necessary, data were log-transformed before proceeding with the analysis described above. These data are presented as back-transformed means (adjusted for confounders) and their corresponding back-transformed 95% CIs. Binary (yes or no) data such as preterm birth were analyzed using contingency tables; when significant this analysis was followed by post hoc comparisons based on normal approximation. All statistical analyses were carried out using Genstat 17.1 statistical software (VSN International Ltd.); however, GraphPad Prism software was used to present the graphs.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and governance</title><p>The ENID trial and the placental substudy were approved by a joint Gambia Government/MRC unit, The Gambia Ethics Committee (project no.

Our data is, to our knowledge, the first evidence from a human population with marginal nutritional status in which alterations to maternal iron and zinc status, as a consequence of nutritional supplementation, results in changes in the gene expression of transporter proteins responsible for iron and zinc uptake across the placenta. Low maternal iron values in late pregnancy, as a consequence of the unexpectedly low iron values of women randomly assigned to the 2 LNS groups, resulted in higher placental gene expression of the primary iron uptake protein <italic>TfR1</italic> when compared with their corresponding non-LNS equivalent (no MMN and with MMN groups). While fetal (cord blood) hemoglobin and iron data suggest that this placental adaptation (increased <italic>TfR1</italic> gene expression) helped improve fetal iron values, fetal ferritin data indicate lower iron stores for the infants. Furthermore, our data suggest that the absence of prenatal supplemental zinc resulted in high gene expression of zinc importer proteins in the placenta, signaling inadequate fetal zinc acquisition to trigger the placental response to increase supplies.</p><p>During development, the fetus depends entirely on maternal iron supplied through the placenta for its iron requirement (<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>); this supply is facilitated by the primary iron uptake protein, TfR1, located on the placental apical membrane. The ferric iron taken up from the maternal circulation by placental TfR1 is transported across the placenta with the help of a series of iron transporter proteins, including DMT1, FPN1, and ZP, before being incorporated onto fetal transferrin. Thus, regulation of the protein expression and activity of these transporters, most importantly TfR1, is a critical aspect of fetal iron accretion. Research in rats (<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and limited data from human observational studies (<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) has shown increased expression of placental TfR1 in response to maternal iron deficiency. In our study, iron supplementation in LNS format produced an unexpectedly lower maternal iron status in late pregnancy compared with iron supplementation in tablet formulation. The mean plasma concentration of ferritin in the LNS-treated groups was 14.1 &#x003bc;g/L by 30 wk of gestation; 68% of women had a plasma ferritin concentration &#x0003c;15 &#x003bc;g/L, indicating diminished iron stores. In addition, the plasma concentrations of hepcidin and iron were lower during late pregnancy, indicating a greater systemic demand for iron (<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Plasma sTfR, transferrin, and UIBC, however, were higher during late pregnancy in the LNS groups, indicating iron deficiency and increased cellular iron demand.</p><p>Our data indicate that, in situations of reduced maternal iron concentrations, the gene expression of placental <italic>TfR1</italic> protein is higher. Upregulation of placental <italic>TfR1</italic> mRNA expression suggests an increased intrauterine iron demand and a placental adaptation to try and increase supplies to the fetus. Although this placental adaptation to maternal iron deficiency helped improve cord hemoglobin and circulating iron concentrations, cord ferritin status (reflecting infant iron stores) was significantly lower in the groups with lower maternal iron values, suggesting that the adaptation might not be completely successful. Inadequate iron accretion in utero might have an implication on the development of fetal organs such as the brain and kidneys. In the rat iron deficiency model, placental TfR1 expression is increased, together with its protein turnover and cycle rate, suggesting an intrauterine stressor, and the affected fetuses had smaller kidneys than normal and higher blood pressure in postnatal life (<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Furthermore, low iron stores in early infancy may compromise postnatal development, especially in populations with high rates of exclusive breastfeeding, as in The Gambia, given the known low amounts of iron in breast milk.</p><p>Despite consistent concentrations of iron (60 mg/d) in all intervention arms, we observed unexpectedly lower iron amounts at 30 wk of gestation in the 2 groups receiving LNS. A previous trial of LNS against other formulations of micronutrient supplementation in infants had shown LNS to be comparable to iron status (<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Most trials that had used LNS as an intervention used small-quantity lipid-based supplements (typically 20 g/d; &#x0223c;108 kcal) (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In this trial, women receiving LNS were provided with a daily dose of 140 g (&#x0223c;746 kcal). One possible explanation for this finding is that women in the FeFol and MMN arms benefitted from additional iron gained through normal dietary consumption, which might be negated by the high caloric content of the LNS intervention in this trial. In this rural Gambian setting, however, where dietary intake of meat and other foods containing large amounts of iron is low, we do not consider this explanation likely. We think it is more likely a consequence of a poorer compliance to supplementation in the LNS groups. Compliance data collected as part of the main ENID trial indicate higher compliance among women receiving the tablet formulation than among those receiving the LNS formulation (94% compared with 82%, respectively; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001; SE Moore, unpublished results, 2017). This pattern was consistent within the current subgroup of women (94% compared with 81%; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). If women were failing to consume the complete dose of LNS each day, they would not receive the allocated daily iron supply (60 mg/d).</p><p>Whereas the importance of zinc for fetal development has been recognized (<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), less is currently known about the mechanism of placental transport of zinc to the fetus. As in duodenal epithelial cells, however, the placental syncytiotrophoblast is assumed to use the 2 zinc transporter families, zinc importer protein family ZIP (<italic>SLC39</italic>) and zinc exporter protein family ZNT (<italic>SLC30</italic>) to deliver zinc (<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). At the level of the duodenum, some of these transporters are responsive to dietary zinc intake and show a tonic response to changing zinc levels, increasing deficiency and dropping as concentrations are restored (<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Our data suggest that the unavailability of dietary zinc in a prenatal supplement (FeFol and PE) is associated with increased gene expression of zinc uptake proteins in the placenta, presumably to try and meet fetal zinc needs.</p><p>The key strength of our study is that the trial design allowed us to directly interrogate the placental response to maternal iron and zinc concentrations in a population with high rates of micronutrient deficiency. The large sample size and samples collected prospectively during pregnancy and at delivery allowed a detailed investigation of the maternal response to supplementation and the impact this had on placental expression of both iron and zinc transporters. Limitations include the lack of early gestation or cord blood measures of zinc values, and a later infancy measure of both iron and zinc values. Further, whereas we indicate gene expression levels, we were not able to quantify protein levels or to indicate the functional capacity of these transport proteins.</p><p>In conclusion, our data indicate that alterations in maternal iron and zinc concentrations, as a consequence of nutritional supplementation during pregnancy, have a regulatory effect on the gene expression of intrauterine iron and zinc transporter proteins in the placenta, with consequences for fetal nutritional status. Despite placental upregulation of TfR1 in response to maternal deficiency, however, fetal iron markers indicate that infant status may remain suboptimal in situations of maternal iron deficiency. Further work is warranted to replicate these observations and to explore the long-term impact of this apparent placental regulation on both maternal and infant micronutrient status. Continued attention should focus on interventions to improve micronutrient concentrations in women of reproductive age in settings of nutritional vulnerability.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We acknowledge the enthusiastic work of the ENID study team [Medical Research Council (MRC) Unit The Gambia], especially the field workers, midwives, and laboratory technicians who tirelessly collected the data and samples.
