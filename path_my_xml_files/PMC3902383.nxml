Low cardiopulmonary fitness is associated with an increased risk of early post-operative complications and death following elective AAA repair. Therefore, fitness should be enhanced before aneurysm repair. High-intensity interval exercise training (HIT) is a potent, time-efficient strategy for enhancing cardiopulmonary fitness. Here, we describe a feasibility study for a definitive trial of a pre-operative HIT intervention to improve post-operative outcomes in patients undergoing elective AAA repair.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>A minimum of 50 patients awaiting elective repair of a 5.5&#x02013;7.0&#x02005;cm infrarenal AAA will be allocated by minimisation to HIT or usual care control in a 1:1 ratio. The patients allocated to HIT will complete three hospital-based exercise sessions per week, for 4&#x02005;weeks. Each session will include 2 or 4&#x02005;min of high-intensity stationary cycling followed by the same duration of easy cycling or passive recovery, repeated until a total of 16&#x02005;min of high-intensity exercise is accumulated. Outcomes to be assessed before randomisation and 24&#x02013;48&#x02005;h before aneurysm repair include cardiopulmonary fitness, maximum AAA diameter and health-related quality of life. In the post-operative period, we will record destination (ward or critical care unit), organ-specific morbidity, mortality and the durations of critical care and hospital stay. Twelve weeks after the discharge, participants will be interviewed to reassess quality of life and determine post-discharge healthcare utilisation. The costs associated with the exercise intervention and healthcare utilisation will be calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethics approval was secured through Sunderland Research Ethics Committee. The findings of the trial will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, and national and international presentations.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN09433624.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal</kwd><kwd>Vascular Diseases</kwd><kwd>Exercise</kwd><kwd>Rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>Physical Fitness</kwd><kwd>Feasibility Studies</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Background</title><p>Major non-cardiac surgery is associated with a substantial peri-operative risk; the overall mortality rate appears low (<italic>c.</italic> 1&#x02013;2%), but the number of operations performed (<italic>c.</italic> 250 million per annum worldwide) results in a large absolute number of deaths.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Moreover, post-operative complications occur up to five times as frequently,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> with survivors experiencing physical limitations and reduced life expectancy.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Identification of individuals in this &#x02018;at-risk&#x02019; group for death and complications creates a significant challenge to clinicians in the pre-operative period. Objective assessment of cardiopulmonary fitness in the pre-operative period utilising cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is the established gold standard across the UK. It has a developing evidence base in predicting adverse outcome across a variety of high-risk surgical procedures,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and this has contributed substantially to clinicians&#x02019; understanding of the impact of poor cardiopulmonary fitness.</p><p>There is a convincing physiological rationale linking improved cardiopulmonary fitness to a reduction in adverse outcome following surgery. The surgical stress response involves neuroendocrine, metabolic and inflammatory effects leading to a catabolic state and increased basal metabolic rate (up to three times pre-operative values<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). A patient with adequate cardiopulmonary fitness is able to meet these extra demands post-operatively, but patients with inadequate fitness levels might be unable to cope, leading to tissue hypoxia and peri-operative complications. Approximately, half of the patients presenting for intra-abdominal surgery do not have the prerequisite fitness, on objective exercise testing, to be deemed &#x02018;low risk&#x02019; for peri-operative complications.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> It is intuitive that improving fitness levels in the pre-operative period will translate to reduced death and complications following major surgery.</p><p>Little is known about the impact of pre-operative exercise training on post-operative outcomes. In a recent systematic review,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> the authors concluded that pre-operative exercise therapy prior to cardiac or abdominal surgery results in a reduced hospital length of stay and reduced post-operative morbidity, but that more research is required on the impact and long-term benefits. However, of the five studies identified that focused on cardiac and abdominal surgery, four involved inspiratory muscle training with pulmonary complications as the primary outcome. Clearly, this intervention improves respiratory muscle function, which might reduce postoperative pulmonary morbidity. However, this form of training is unlikely to favourably influence the wider range of sequelae of the surgical stress response. Only one study focused on the effect of a more general presurgery exercise training intervention. Arthur <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> reported a reduction in median hospital length of stay of 1&#x02005;day (vs usual care control) following coronary artery bypass graft surgery with an 8&#x02013;10 week exercise training programme plus education reinforcement and social support. The intervention involved 30&#x02005;min of aerobic interval training, performed twice a week at 40&#x02013;70% of functional capacity.</p><p>We believe that a programme of research is needed now to evaluate the benefits of pre-operative exercise training in patients undergoing elective non-cardiothoracic surgery. Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a frequently lethal disease occurring in &#x0223c;5% of men aged 50&#x02013;79&#x02005;years.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Annually, 5000&#x02013;6000 surgical repairs are performed across the UK,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> making this an ideal homogenous high-risk target population. The incidence of comorbid disease is higher than other age-matched surgical populations: cardiac disease 60&#x02013;70%, respiratory disease 40&#x02013;50%, long-term smoking 50&#x02013;80%, renal disease 10&#x02013;12% and diabetes 10&#x02013;12%.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Anecdotal observation from &#x0003e;1000 CPETs confirms that this population is also substantially less fit than other age-matched surgical populations. Findings from two recent publications also support the adverse impact of poor fitness on outcome in patients undergoing AAA repair.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>Intervention for AAA can be performed by either open or endovascular repair (EVAR), with a current ratio nationally of 55:45 in favour of EVAR.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Thirty day mortality for open surgery in the UK in 2008 was 7&#x02013;8%.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Earlier studies from the USA<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and the Netherlands<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> reported major post-operative morbidity of 30&#x02013;40%. Endovascular treatment is less invasive, with mortality and cardiorespiratory morbidity rates of 2&#x02013;3%<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and 10&#x02013;15%,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> respectively. For open surgery, the UK mortality rate was higher than expected with respect to comparable countries, prompting the publication of a quality improvement programme document with the explicit remit of standardising management to improve outcome.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Encouragingly such standardisation has brought about a significant 30-day mortality benefit for both procedures in the Vascular Society's most recent publication: 4.3% and 0.9% for open AAA and EVAR, respectively.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Despite this, there remains significant room for improvement. No information is routinely available on non-fatal complications, which are up to five times more prevalent than mortality and known to affect patient's quality of life and overall life expectancy on hospital discharge. In addition, a key omission from the guidance is evidence or advice in relation to improving pre-operative fitness, despite the fact that one of the main conclusions of the EVAR-2 study was that vascular teams should be focusing on techniques to improve patient's fitness pre-operatively.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>The proposed benefits of exercise &#x02018;prehabilitation&#x02019; are mediated by increases in cardiopulmonary fitness. Two pilot randomised controlled trials (RCTs) undertaken by our research team have documented improvements in cardiopulmonary fitness following moderate-intensity endurance exercise training in patients under surveillance for a small AAA. Kothmann <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> reported a 10% increase in the oxygen consumption at the ventilatory threshold (a submaximal marker of cardiopulmonary fitness of prognostic significance) after 6&#x02005;weeks of moderate-intensity cycling exercise performed for 30&#x02005;min twice weekly. Tew <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> observed a 2.5&#x02005;mL/kg/min (&#x0223c;20%) improvement in the ventilatory threshold after 12&#x02005;weeks of moderate-intensity cycling and treadmill walking exercise performed for 35&#x02013;45&#x02005;min thrice weekly. A recent review of pre-operative exercise training<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> proposed a research agenda, with future directions including the role of prehabilitation in improving fitness levels prior to major surgery, the use of robust study designs with appropriate outcome measures and evaluations of the effects of high-intensity interval exercise training (HIT) as a model for which there is extensive evidence of benefit in other patient groups, including patients with heart failure.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> A recent literature review by Guiraud <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> in cardiac rehabilitation concluded that when compared with moderate-intensity training, HIT has a similar safety profile (low absolute risk) and produces greater and more time-efficient improvements in fitness. For the current proposal, HIT therefore represents a particularly attractive approach, as the time-window for intervention once a patient has been identified for aneurysm repair might be as short as 4&#x02013;6 weeks.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Therefore, an intervention with the potential for more rapid fitness benefits is preferable.</p><p>Our programme of work is aligned to the Medical Research Council's (MRC) guidance for developing and evaluating complex interventions.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Given the limited extent of the evidence base, a feasibility study is clearly required to inform a subsequent definitive trial. The MRC guidance stresses that crucial feasibility work is often absent or insufficient, with &#x02018;definitive&#x02019; trials undermined by acceptability, adherence, and delivery of the intervention, recruitment and retention issues and smaller than expected effect sizes.</p><p>We are conducting a feasibility study to explore the potential benefits of a 4-week HIT programme, delivered prior to surgery for AAA repair. This will be stationary, cycle-based, in-hospital and undertaken three times/week.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Aims</title><sec id="s2a"><title>1 Explore potential primary outcomes for a subsequent definitive RCT</title><p>The physiological rationale suggests a causal pathway between adaptations consequent to exercise training and reduced mortality and morbidity.

Or, they might agree to be randomised but suffer from &#x02018;resentful demoralisation&#x02019; if they end up in the non-preferred arm of the trial, leading to poor adherence. This issue requires examination in a feasibility study, as the preference effects for exercise versus control in this patient population are unknown. Theoretically, the patients might have a preference for the exercise arm due to a belief in the benefits. Notwithstanding the patient's information provided, others might be fearful of engaging in high-intensity exercise prior to surgery and therefore might exhibit a preference for the control arm. These issues could affect the success of a definitive trial.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Objectives</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Aim 1</title><p>To define the characteristics of the potential outcome measures.

In subsequent sessions, power output will be gradually manipulated until the patient reports a perceived exertion of 6&#x02013;7 on Borg&#x02019;s CR-10 scale<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> (ie, hard to very hard) at the end of each work interval. However, for safety reasons, the intensity of exercise will be made easier if systolic blood pressure exceeds 180&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> or if heart rate exceeds 95% of the maximum observed on baseline CPET. In weeks 2&#x02013;4, and for variety, the patient will be allowed to choose between doing four 4&#x02005;min work bouts or eight 2&#x02005;min bouts as the main body of each exercise session, both with a 1:1 work-to-rest ratio. Thus, each session will last &#x0223c;45&#x02005;min regardless of patient's choice, which will include 16&#x02005;min of high-intensity exercise. An experienced physiotherapist will supervise each session and record power output, perceived exertion and blood pressure (manual sphygmomanometer) at the end of each work interval. Heart rate will be recorded continuously at 5&#x02005;s intervals through the entire exercise session (Polar RS400, Kempele, Finland). The collection of such data will permit a detailed quantification of the exercise intervention. The patients who do not undergo surgery in week 5 will complete one HIT session per week up until surgery to maintain fitness.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> All adverse events will be recorded.</p><p>Information in relation to <italic>participant's perceived enjoyment of exercise</italic> is important to monitor. This is of relevance in adherence to the programme, while providing valuable information for planning a definitive study. We therefore plan to assess:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Changes in enjoyment of exercise within sessions and throughout the programme. Perceived or likely enjoyment can change prior, during and after exercise as a consequence of a variety of factors, for example, anxiety, enjoyment and fatigue. We therefore plan to ask participants to assess enjoyment/perceived enjoyment of exercise prior to starting, during and 20&#x02005;min after exercise using a simple validated rating scale.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> This will take &#x0003c;30&#x02005;s to administer on each occasion and will be performed during the first (baseline), 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th sessions to track changes consequent to the programme.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Overall enjoyment of the exercise programme will be assessed during the week 5 assessment, using the validated multidimensional Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES).<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> This will be 2&#x02013;3&#x02005;days following completion of the overall programme, allowing participants&#x02019; reflection and evaluation time (see week 5 assessment below).</p></list-item></list></p><p>Two experienced exercise scientists will be responsible for ensuring treatment fidelity of the exercise programme (GAT, MW).</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Safety considerations</title><p>There are two main safety considerations regarding running a programme of HIT in patients with AAA disease:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>1.&#x000a0;Cardiac risk&#x02014;as previously outlined, 60&#x02013;70% of individuals with AAA disease suffer from comorbid cardiac disease. The baseline assessment of clinical risk profile and CPET will be instrumental in assessing this risk in detail, under the stress of exercise, at the outset. A recent review by Guiraud <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> highlights the safety of HIT in patients with underlying coronary disease, heart failure and patients at risk of cardiovascular disease. We are reassured by their conclusion which states that &#x0201c;there is growing scientific evidence that HIT presents little danger for selected stable cardiac patients, provided that the prescribed protocols are respected.&#x0201d;</p></list-item></list></p><p>In the event of an adverse cardiac event, we will have the following in place:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Staff experienced and Intermediate Life Support-trained;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Resuscitation equipment and oxygen immediately available;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Hospital cardiac arrest team fully informed of time and place of training sessions;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Participants requiring further assessment will be transferred to the accident and emergency unit within the relevant hospital.</p></list-item></list></p><p>All institutions have cardiology expertise immediately available on site.
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Risk of AAA expansion or rupture&#x02014;an intuitive concern regarding exercise testing and training in patients with aneurysms is of excessive rises in the double-product (systolic blood pressure&#x000d7;heart rate) evoking aneurysm expansion and rupture. However, the available evidence suggests that these concerns are unfounded. For example, no aneurysm ruptures or excessive aneurysm growth rates were reported in any of the three studies of moderate-intensity exercise training in patients with early AAA disease (from &#x0003e;4000 exercise sessions<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), two of which were conducted at our institutions.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Further unpublished data from our institutions indicate no ruptures from &#x0003e;1300 maximal exercise tests in patients with large asymptomatic AAA being considered for elective aneurysm repair. Moreover, through national networked connections, and other relevant publications, we believe this position of safety to be correct for &#x0003e;5000 maximal exercise tests. This position is also supported by the European guidelines for the management of AAA disease, which state that physical activity is not associated with AAA growth,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> as well as the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Practice Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Peripheral Vascular Disease,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> which suggest that patients with AAA should not be fearful of vigorous activity. The only reported adverse event we are aware of came from the patients series of Best <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> where a rupture occurred 12&#x02005;h after maximal exercise testing in a patient with a 6.1&#x02005;cm AAA, yielding a rupture rate for this study of 0.4%. However, the causal relationship between exercise and rupture is difficult to establish given the 12&#x02005;h intervening period.</p></list-item></list></p><p>It would therefore appear that the risk of AAA growth or rupture is very low in the context of exercise training for individuals with small and large aneurysmal disease. This risk would appear to be &#x0003c;1:5000. When balanced against national peri-operative mortality/morbidity figures available for surgery in the UK at present, we feel that this represents clear benefit in favour of undertaking the pre-operative exercise as set out.</p><p>In the event of a suspected AAA rupture, patients would immediately be transferred to the accident and emergency department for prompt further evaluation. All clinical institutions have on-site vascular teams able to immediately respond to such a situation.</p><p>Despite this, we see risk minimisation in this context as our primary concern and will implement the following control measures:

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC)&#x02014;the DMEC comprises three academics/clinicians with appropriate expertise who are independent from the running of the study.

In the same week, but 1&#x02013;2&#x02005;days prior to surgery, assessments will be performed on all participants.

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Cardiopulmonary fitness via CPET (to assess fitness changes from baseline);</p></list-item><list-item><p>Maximum AAA diameter via transabdominal ultrasound (to establish safety of exercise in relation to aneurysm growth);</p></list-item><list-item><p>HRQOL questionnaires;</p></list-item><list-item><p>PACES assessment for overall exercise programme enjoyment (exercise intervention group only).</p></list-item></list></p><p>Owing to logistical reasons, it is anticipated that not all participants will undergo surgery in week 5. This will mainly be due to a temporary lack of hospital beds for admission pre-operatively, or critical care post-operatively. In this situation, surgery will be rescheduled, where possible, within 4&#x02005;weeks. A repeat CPET will be undertaken in patients whose surgery is delayed &#x0003e;4&#x02005;weeks, to ensure we have an accurate assessment of pre-operative fitness in all patients. A CPET assessment of those patients who have performed one high-intensity training session per week from week 5 onwards will provide further valuable information of the dose-response nature of high-intensity training in this population.</p><p>An overview of data to be collected for this aspect of the study can be seen on the study case report form (see supplementary file).</p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>Peri-operative period</title><p>The participants will undergo open or endovascular aneurysm repair as determined at the multidisciplinary team meeting.

We will examine the disposition of the 90% CI for the observed effect to the minimum clinically important difference for each variable.

The main focus will be on how to accurately identify, quantify and value the additional costs of delivering the intervention and the potential resource implications versus usual care post-operatively and post-discharge. The costing approach will incorporate a broad analytical perspective (National Health Service and Social Services), which will help to detect cost-shifting between sectors. Resources utilised in the exercise group will be identified in terms of capital equipment and staff time. A staff-reported health economics questionnaire has been developed to facilitate this (available on request). Post-operative resource use will also be explored for all participants in terms of bed days (including critical care bed days). Post-discharge resource use for all treatment/care related to AAA surgery will be assessed retrospectively for 12&#x02005;weeks by piloting the use of a self-report Service Receipt Inventory (patient diary). This will facilitate the development of a reliable and valid tool to capture resource use. Appropriate unit costs to be applied to resource use will be identified. These will be sourced from a combination of local costings and national databases.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>
<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> All costs will be combined to rehearse the methods for total health and social care cost-estimation in a subsequent definitive trial.</p><p>The methods to estimate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for exercise versus usual care in terms of Quality Adjusted Life Years will be rehearsed (using EQ-5D 5L administered at baseline and 12&#x02005;weeks postdischarge). In particular, issues relevant to sensitivity analysis will be explored to help understand how best to deal with statistical imprecision and other uncertainties in the full trial. For example, data will be bootstrapped to account for the expected skewness evident in economic cost data. The data collected as part of this feasibility study could be used to inform subsequent pre-trial modelling.</p></sec><sec id="s4n"><title>Analysis of participant interviews</title><p>We aim to explore the participants&#x02019; post-discharge experience.
