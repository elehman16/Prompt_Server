During these revisions, antibiotic-impregnated polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement is often used to anchor revision implants or to form temporary spacers used for treating the infection. Additional antibiotics are also frequently mixed into the cement to allow greater control over antibiotic type and dosage. These techniques allow for delivery of higher antibiotic concentrations locally than would be tolerated if given systemically.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2046-3758.52.2000412" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr4-2046-3758.52.2000412" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>Unfortunately, despite using both intravenous and local antibiotic delivery methods, persistent infection rates are reported to be 5.5% to 33% for patients who undergo revision surgeries.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2046-3758.52.2000412" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="bibr6-2046-3758.52.2000412" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr7-2046-3758.52.2000412" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>One possible reason for the persistence of infection could be the rapidly decaying antibiotic release profile of the PMMA.

However, these previous LFUS studies either focused on Phase I elution during which antibiotic elution is already elevated, or ranged from 12 hours to 14 days of continuous treatment which is difficult to execute in a clinical setting.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2046-3758.52.2000412" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-2046-3758.52.2000412" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p>We therefore propose a method of combining improved mixing techniques and LFUS treatments to control both elution phases concurrently. Furthermore, we aimed to develop a more clinically relevant LFUS treatment strategy for increasing Phase II elution. We hypothesised that repeated treatments of short time durations of LFUS would increase Phase II antibiotic elution. We also hypothesised that this increase in Phase II elution would still be significant when paired with a delayed antibiotic addition mixing technique.

In theory, both elution time and amount could be controlled, however, they are probably not completely independent of each other.</p><p>We designed this study hoping to develop a more clinically relevant method for increasing antibiotic elution. The findings indicate that it is possible to combine these two elution enhancement techniques and use them in tandem to improve elution in both phases. Given that the delayed mixing technique results in higher elution levels in both elution phases, it may be reasonable to assume that the delayed technique would result in a lower remaining amount of embedded vancomycin. This could then suggest that there would be less vancomycin available to be freed by LFUS treatment compared to the standard mixing technique and thus result in a shortened period over which LFUS would remain effective. However, our results do not support this hypothesis as both mixing techniques showed elution levels to diminish at approximately the same rate. One possible reason for this is that the LFUS treatments may not have been long enough in duration or at a high enough intensity. Exact clinical implementation of such a treatment would depend on the type of revision surgery performed. The general treatment scheme could include a prescribed number of visits by the patient to an outpatient clinic where a clinician provides the treatments utilising currently available LFUS equipment.</p><p>A potential approach designed to eradicate infection might include controlling Phase I elution by choosing an ideal antibiotic dose and adding it at a specific time point during the mixing process (using a delayed mixing technique), then maximising Phase II elution with the appropriate timing and treatment duration of LFUS trials. A single high-power, high-duration treatment could provide a single Phase II elevated release peak that could be on the order of Phase I elution amounts for a short period of time. This type of LFUS treatment could be useful for biofilm disruption or when using an antibiotic that exhibits concentration-dependent bacteriocidal properties.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-2046-3758.52.2000412" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Alternatively, consecutive low-power, short-duration treatments could be used over a series of several days or even weeks to provide a lower but more consistent elevated level of Phase II elution. This type of LFUS treatment could potentially be beneficial for raising Phase II elution to levels above MIC or MBC for antibiotics that exhibit time-dependent antibacterial properties.</p><p>The mechanical testing results indicate that the addition of vancomycin to the cement has a greater effect on the cement&#x02019;s mechanical properties than do the specific mixing technique or LFUS duration. Previous studies have shown that there is a limit to how much vancomycin should be added before mechanical properties are degraded.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-2046-3758.52.2000412" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="bibr27-2046-3758.52.2000412" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> While five grams is on the high side of what has been shown to be acceptable, for the purpose of this study the amount was chosen to help increase elution amount for greater measurement sensitivity. The use of a varied mixing technique and Phase II LFUS treatments coupled with the addition of the antibiotic did not compromise its integrity beyond the referenced ISO standard for peak stress. While there was a reduction in stiffness for the delayed technique compared with the standard technique, the importance of this effect would be dependent on the particular clinical application. Direct weight-bearing cases may be more sensitive to this reduction in stiffness while non-weight bearing ones may benefit more from the potential increases in antibiotic elution being afforded by the delayed technique. Future studies will be necessary to evaluate the effect of combined mixing and LFUS techniques on mechanical properties of clinically relevant cement spacers.</p><p>Several assumptions and simplifications were used for this study. First, the elution environment in which the specimens were kept was not ideal for modeling <italic>in vivo</italic> behaviour. The results are, however, in agreement with previously published works that used similar environmental assumptions.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2046-3758.52.2000412" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr28-2046-3758.52.2000412" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bibr29-2046-3758.52.2000412" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> True characterisation of LFUS effectiveness <italic>in vivo</italic> should include measures of spacer shape, thickness, and surrounding soft tissues. However, the goal of this study was not to prove the effectiveness of LFUS on its own, which has been previously shown, but rather to investigate the effect of combining it with modified preparation techniques.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-2046-3758.52.2000412" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Temperature of the elution environment also likely has some effect on total elution. While the device used for this study did not provide a highly accurate means for controlling the temperature of the LFUS bath during each treatment, the temperature ranges seen were similar to previous studies.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-2046-3758.52.2000412" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p><p>In the treatment of infected prosthetics, MIC or MBC is often used as the reference point which antibiotic concentrations are expected to surpass in order to eradicate the infection. As with the various parameters that affect the antibiotic elution itself, the precise MIC or MBC level for a given infection is completely patient- and site-dependent. This implies that there is not a relevant concentration reference for a controlled, idealised study such as the work presented here. The primary reference used in this study was the LFUS control groups which received no LFUS treatments. While the results did produce significant increases above this point, this does not imply concentrations above (or below) MIC or MBC. Future <italic>in vivo</italic> animal studies are planned to investigate LFUS elution models referenced to true bacterial MIC or MBC in order to validate antibiotic effectiveness.</p><p>While only three repeated trials of LFUS were used in this study, there is likely a limit to how much antibiotic can be eluted by repeat treatments. The results did show a significant decrease in elution amount on the third set of LFUS trials, indicating a reduction in remaining antibiotic with increasing number of treatments. Future studies are planned to investigate methods which maintain elution rates above a targeted level using various combinations of frequency, power, and duration.</p><p>The results of this study have shown that a delayed mixing technique used in conjunction with LFUS treatments shows promise as a means for antibiotic elution control in both elution phases. These findings suggest that the proposed combined treatment approach could be a reasonable and effective means of increasing antibiotic elution to help clear persistent periprosthetic infections.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author Contribution:</bold> A.
