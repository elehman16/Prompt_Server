It is a heterogeneous disorder due to dysfunction of the small and large airways, as well as by destruction of the lung parenchyma and vasculature, in highly variable combinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-copd-3-771">Celli et al 2004</xref>). Breathlessness and reduction in exercise capacity are the main complaints of COPD patients. These symptoms progress relentlessly reducing the patients&#x02019; ability to perform activities of daily living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-copd-3-771">Pitta et al 2005</xref>). Different pathophysiological factors may contribute to exertional dyspnea in COPD patients: increased intrinsic mechanical loading on inspiratory muscles due to the intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure, airflow limitation, inspiratory muscle weakness, increased ventilatory demand relative to capacity, gas exchange abnormalities, cardiovascular factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-copd-3-771">Ambrosino and Serradori 2006</xref>). In COPD, exercise dyspnea correlates with lung hyperinflation, as assessed by inspiratory capacity, which, in turn, results in neuromechanical dissociation.

Patients were randomized 1:1 to either tiotropium 18 &#x003bc;g qd or placebo for 25 weeks. Tiotropium or matching placebo were supplied as a dry-powder capsule delivered by the HandiHaler<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> device (Boehringer Ingelheim; Ingelheim, Germany) and inhaled in the morning. The concomitant regular use of oral (&#x0003c;10 mg/d of prednisone or equivalent) and inhaled steroids, short acting theophylline preparations, and mucolytic agents not containing bronchodilators was allowed during the study if the medication had been started for at least 6 weeks prior to the screening visit. Open-label salbutamol metered-dose inhaler was supplied during the study for as-needed acute symptom relief.

Patients with a history of asthma, allergic rhinitis, eosinophils &#x02265;8% were excluded from the study as well as patients with recent respiratory tract infections. Also, patients with significant diseases other than COPD or a recent history of myocardial infarction, hospitalisation for heart failure and cardiac arrhythmia requiring drug therapy, were not eligible for the trial. Other exclusion criteria included orthopedic, muscular, or neurologic disease that would interfere with regular participation in aerobic exercise or with exercise testing as well as a body mass index (BMI) &#x0003e;30 or &#x0003c;18 kg m<sup>2</sup>.

During an initial screening visit (Visit 1), patients performed pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and performed the 6-minute walking test (6MWT). One week following the initial screening, patients were randomised to tiotropium or placebo for the subsequent 25 weeks. Following randomization, patients entered a 4-week period during which they received study drug but not PR. PFTs and the 6MWT were repeated at the beginning (Visit 2) and end of this 4 week period (Visit 3). Patients then entered an 8-week PR program (Visit 4). After the last PR session (Visit 6), patients continued on study medication for a 12 week follow-up period. 6MWT were performed at the conclusion of the 8 weeks of PR (Visit 6) and after the 12 weeks of follow-up (Visit 9).</p></sec><sec><title>Measurements</title><sec><title>Lung function</title><p>Spirometry was conducted according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-copd-3-771">ATS 1995b</xref>).

The tests were performed at the screening visit; at randomisation (Visit 2); after 4 weeks of treatment (Visit 3); after PR (Visit 6) and after the 12-week follow-up period (Visit 9). Tests were performed prior to and 1 hour after dosing.</p></sec><sec><title>Exercise</title><p>Exercise tolerance was evaluated at the screening visit; at randomisation (Visit 2), which served as the baseline measurement; after 4 weeks of treatment (Visit 3); after PR (Visit 6) and after the 12-week follow-up period (Visit 9) by the 6MWT according to standard guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-copd-3-771">ATS 2002</xref>). The best result of three tests was recorded. Except for Visits 1 and 2, all 6MWTs commenced 90 minutes after inhalation of study drug and approximately 15 to 30 minutes after spirometry. Arterial oxygen saturation was monitored by pulse oximetry throughout testing.</p></sec><sec><title>Dyspnea</title><p>Italian versions of the Baseline Dyspnea Index (Visit 2) and the Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-copd-3-771">Mahler et al 1984</xref>) were used to assess dyspnea (Visits 3, 6 and 9).

Initial treadmill speed was set to attain a targeted heart rate at 80% of the maximum heart rate obtained during the 6MWT at Visit 3. Dyspnea by the modified Borg scale, heart rate, pulse oximetry and treadmill speed was recorded every 10 minutes. Training was maintained for as long as tolerated for at least 30 minutes. For patients unable to complete 30 minutes of continuous lower limb exercise, exercise training sessions could be divided into as many as 4 parts with 5 to 10 minute rests in between.</p><p>Other exercise modalities were encouraged. All patients were encouraged to exercise at home on days when they were not attending the centre. Pulmonary rehabilitation included also upper limb activities as well as patient education. The form of these activities were determined by each centre and was not specified within the protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For the primary analysis, a full analysis set (FAS) that included all patients randomized and treated with a baseline 6MWT value and at least one 6MWT value on treatment available, was considered. In order to be able to include the same patients at each time point in the 6MWT summaries, missing post baseline values caused by a patient&#x02019;s intake of rescue medication or a patient&#x02019;s early discontinuation due to worsening of COPD disease were replaced by the minimum value at the previous visits. For missing values due to other reason were replaced by the median of all nonmissing distance on that visit. The two treatments groups were compared using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model that included terms for center and treatment as main effects and baseline (data at Visit 2) as a linear covariate. Interactions: centers-by-treatment and treatment-by-baseline were also tested adding appropriate terms to the main ANCOVA model.</p><p>Treatment differences are presented as least square means &#x000b1; standard error (SE) and corresponding p-values taken from ANCOVA. Because of the a pre-specified null hypothesis testing procedure (at a 2-sided &#x003b1; level of 0.05) on a single primary variable, no adjustment for multiplicity was required. A sensitivity analysis was performed on the primary variable considering the per protocol set (PPS) that included patients in FAS and without important protocol violations.</p><p>The spirometry measurements (FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC), TDI scores and SGRQ scores were analysed on the FAS using the same main model specified for the primary endpoint with imputation for missing data.</p><p>Continuous baseline characteristics are shown as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD) and were compared between the two treatment groups by using the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test or when appropriate the t-test. Categorical baseline characteristics are expressed as counts and percentages and were compared between groups by using the chi-squared test.</p><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>A sample of 182 patients (91 per treatment group) was calculated as adequate to detect a 54 meter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-copd-3-771">Redelmeier et al 1997</xref>). difference between tiotropium and placebo at 5% significance level, with 80% power using a two-tailed t-test.

Relatively minor changes were observed in the 6MWT in both groups with PR. There were clinically meaningful improvements in dyspnea (ie, TDI focal score &#x0003e;1 unit) in both groups prior to, which improved further after PR. Improvement in HRQL was larger in tiotropium than in placebo group although differences were not statistically significant. In both groups, large changes in the SGRQ total score were observed after PR which were relatively well maintained during the 12 week follow-up period.</p><p>Evidence-based support for PR in the management of COPD patients has accumulated in the last decade, and this comprehensive intervention has been unequivocally demonstrated to reduce dyspnea, increase exercise performance, and improve HRQL. Furthermore, an emerging literature is beginning to reveal its effectiveness in reducing health care costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-copd-3-771">Nici et al 2006</xref>). The hypothesis of this study was that in terms of aerobic conditioning, there might be an advantage of tiotropium administered during a period of exercise training. Tiotropium induces sustained bronchodilation throughout the day and has superior spirometric outcomes in comparison to placebo or ipratropium bromide. In addition, several studies demonstrated sustained reductions in hyperinflation with tiotropium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-copd-3-771">O&#x02019;Donnell et al 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-copd-3-771">Maltais et al 2005</xref>). These outcomes might be enough to allow patients to exercise longer or with a higher intensity thereby leading to improved exercise tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-copd-3-771">Maltais et al 2005</xref>). Furthermore, the benefits gained may have a longer lasting effect due to the higher exercise tolerance attained. However, the relatively modest improvement in exercise tolerance following PR in both groups in the present study appears to be contrary to those of Casaburi et all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-copd-3-771">Casaburi et al 2005</xref>).</p><p>The explanation for the modest improvement in exercise capacity to either PR or to tiotropium in the present study likely relates to methodologic issues including the choice of functional measurement of endurance. A similar rationale also can explain the differing results between the present trial and the Casaburi study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-copd-3-771">Casaburi et al 2005</xref>). In the report by Casaburi, the effect of tiotropium on exercise tolerance in patients with COPD participating in 8 weeks of PR was measured by endurance time during a constant work rate treadmill exercise test, whereas in our study we used the 6MWT. Although strong relationships between different methods of exercise assessment have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-copd-3-771">Turner et al 2004</xref>), the two methods evaluate aspects somehow different of exercise, which may explain the differences in results between the two studies. The relative responsiveness of the 6MWT to detect changes in exercise performance following bronchodilation and PR appears to be lower than other forms of exercise testing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-copd-3-771">Pepin and colleagues (2007)</xref> explored the sensitivity of the 6MWT to acute bronchodilation compared with the endurance shuttle walk test. Despite demonstrating acute spirometric improvements, the 6MWT distance did not improve; however, improvements were evident in the shuttle walk test.</p><p>The results probably were likely influenced by patient selection. At baseline, the patients had a relatively well preserved 6MWT (mean &#x0003e; 400 metres), which could have potentially led to ceiling effect. Another explanation includes variability in the conduct of the test due to the enrolment of multiple sites with variable experience. For example, despite training in the conduct of the study, several centres did not adhere performance of protocol mandated. As well, many centres tended to round the 6MWT results to the closest 10 meter value rather than determine the single digit result. There was also variability in the physical construction of the test (ie, variability in the length of the corridor).</p><p>Twelve weeks after the termination of PR, patients in both groups showed a reduction in exercise capacity without any significant difference between groups. Limited studies suggest that the benefits of PR decline toward baseline after 6 to 12 months, but remain improved compared with control subjects after 1 year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-copd-3-771">Foglio et al 1999</xref>).</p><p>The modest changes observed in the 6MWT appeared to be contrary to the clinically meaningful changes in the TDI focal score. The tiotropium group reported the lowest perception of dyspnea. It might therefore be assumed that tiotropium treated patients could engage in a longer duration and/or more intense physical activity compared to the placebo group. In a subgroup analysis of the study initially reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-copd-3-771">Casaburi and colleagues (2005)</xref>, tiotropium appeared to increased patient self-reported participation in physical activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-copd-3-771">Kesten et al 2008</xref>). In the present study from test week 4 to 13 both treatment groups showed increases in the TDI scores, indicating an improvement in dyspnea, with the tiotropium group showing a significantly larger increase on test week 13 (after the PR period), but not on test week 4 and test week 25. The difference in the TDI focal score from placebo at the conclusion of PR (day 92) exceeded the MCID of 1 unit. It has been suggested that the categorisation of patients with COPD according to the level of dyspnea is more discriminating than staging of disease severity on the basis of airway obstruction with respect to 5-year survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-copd-3-771">Nishimura et al 2002</xref>).</p><p>The observed apparent dissociation of 6MWT and dyspnea was also observed for the SGRQ. In both groups, PR resulted in rather dramatic improvements in SGRQ total score that exceeded the MCID of 4 units. The SGRQ total score was lower on each test day in the tiotropium compared to the placebo group although the differences were not statistically significant. As opposed to the 6MWT, the SGRQ remained stable following PR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-copd-3-771">Figure 4</xref>). This observation has been reported also in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-copd-3-771">Foglio et al 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-copd-3-771">2007</xref>) and probably reflects the comprehensive nature of the PR and the fact that health status depends on more than just exercise capacity. Studies in COPD patients using both the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire and SGRQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-copd-3-771">Ketelaars et al 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-copd-3-771">Tsukino et al 1996</xref>) have shown that HRQL is only partially determined by lung function and exercise tolerance. Therefore, HRQL should be specifically evaluated in addition to physiological measures before and after PR. Furthermore it has been reported that generic and disease specific HRQL are independent risk factors for respiratory and all-causes mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-copd-3-771">Domingo-Salvany et al 2002</xref>).</p><p>The present study documented improvements in spirometry and a trend towards reduced exacerbations. While spirometry is not expected to improve with PR, it was expected that tiotropium would show similar improvements to other published reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-copd-3-771">O&#x02019;Donnell et al 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-copd-3-771">Maltais et al 2005</xref>). Patients receiving tiotropium had larger trough FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC responses than those receiving placebo on all the test days, although the mean difference between the tiotropium and the placebo group was significant only on test day 29. Tiotropium significantly increased patients post-dose FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC on all the test days compared to placebo. These improvements were higher than those observed in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-copd-3-771">Casaburi and colleagues (2005)</xref> in which more severe patients were enrolled. The lack of statistically significant differences in trough values at test days 92 and 176 between the two treatments groups was unexpected and could be explained by a larger variability observed in spirometry outcomes in the present study.</p><p>In summary, tiotropium in combination with PR significantly improved dyspnea at the end of the program but did not show any additional benefit in the 6MWT, compared to PR and placebo. We encountered methodological issues regarding the 6MWT in the present study. The relatively modest changes in the 6MWT with PR in the trial suggest that the use of this field test in multicenter clinical trials may have limitations not fully understood or reported. Alternative tests of functional capacity should be considered in multicenter COPD clinical trials.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank the following investigators and their research staff who participated in this trial.
