In addition, the clinical efficacy of IV fluid warming via commercial devices is well documented in open surgical procedures with a duration of 30&#x02013;120&#x02009;min.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-0300060516638991" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The latest version of the ERAS Society guidelines specifically recommends the routine use of IV fluid warming during elective colonic surgery.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0300060516638991" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> However, the value of its routine use in laparoscopic colorectal surgery is not clear as this type of surgery is associated with reduced heat loss, surgical blood loss and intraoperative fluid requirements compared with open surgery. In addition, its usefulness may be further limited in the setting of laparoscopic surgery incorporating GDFT.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-0300060516638991" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>In the present study, contrary to this hypothesis, the total core temperature drop was significantly less in the warm fluids group than in the control group, even within a 2&#x02009;h study period. Though the median (interquartile range) total infused volume was only 750.0&#x02009;ml (620.0&#x02013;995.0&#x02009;ml), IV fluid warming exerted a beneficial effect on temperature control in the warm fluids group. These results are consistent with theoretical calculations that predict that administration of IV fluids would decrease the mean body temperature by 0.25&#x02103; for each litre of crystalloid given at ambient temperature in a 70&#x02009;kg patient.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0300060516638991" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>However, the difference in the total temperature drop between the warm fluids group and the control group was small. Although it reached statistical significance, such a small difference may have only limited clinical significance. It is noteworthy that the proportion of patients who developed intraoperative hypothermia (a lowest core temperature &#x0003c;&#x02009;36.0&#x02103;) was not significantly different between the two groups.</p><p>One reason for the limited efficacy of intraoperative IV fluid warming in the present study is that the ability of fluid warming to prevent intraoperative hypothermia is mainly dependent on the volume infused.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-0300060516638991" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> This is consistent with a previous study that showed no preventive effect of intraoperative IV fluid warming on intraoperative hypothermia in patients receiving a fixed IV fluid volume of 1&#x02009;l.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-0300060516638991" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>Another possible reason for its limited efficacy may be related to the surgical conditions. In colorectal surgery, the use of laparoscopic techniques reduces the risk of perioperative hypothermia by reducing heat loss associated with bowel exteriorization and/or exposure of the peritoneal cavity to air during open surgery.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0300060516638991" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-0300060516638991" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> In addition, the use of heated and humidified CO<sub>2</sub> gas in the present study may have affected the outcome. A meta-analysis reported that, compared with cold and dry CO<sub>2</sub> gas, pneumoperitoneum using heated and humidified CO<sub>2</sub> gas reduced the risk of perioperative hypothermia.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-0300060516638991" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> However, to date, the only randomized controlled study in laparoscopic colon surgery failed to demonstrate any benefit of heated and humidified CO<sub>2</sub> in preventing intraoperative hypothermia.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-0300060516638991" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Further investigation is therefore needed to clarify whether warming and humidification of insufflated CO<sub>2</sub> gas could have contributed to the limited efficacy of intraoperative IV fluid warming in the present study.</p><p>The major limitation of this study is that the study period was limited to 2&#x02009;h after induction of anaesthesia. Therefore the results cannot be extrapolated to other ERAS cases such as lengthy operations or those with greater intraoperative blood loss. The other major concern may be an absence of blinding of the attending anaesthesiologist. Because of the typical presence of air bubbles in the tubing of a Hotline&#x000ae; fluid warmer, complete double blinding could not be achieved. However, since standardized thermal management protocols were applied to all patients, this should not affect the results.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study showed that intraoperative application of IV fluid warming caused the core temperature to drop less than room-temperature IV fluids in laparoscopic colorectal surgery incorporating GDFT. However, as the magnitude of the core temperature difference was small during the first 2&#x02009;h after induction of anaesthesia, warming IV fluids cannot provide a protective effect on intraoperative hypothermia in laparoscopic colorectal surgery lasting for a relatively short duration and incorporating GDFT. Therefore routine use of IV fluid warming, as suggested by the ERAS guidelines, cannot be justified for an ERAS programme in the setting of laparoscopic colorectal surgery.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="sec12-0300060516638991"><title>Declaration of conflicting interests</title><p>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec id="sec13-0300060516638991"><title>Funding</title><p>This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not for-profit sectors.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-0300060516638991"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gustafsson</surname><given-names>UO</given-names></name><name><surname>Scott</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Schwenk</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
