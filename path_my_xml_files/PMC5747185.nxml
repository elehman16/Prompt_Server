Despite this, significant barriers and challenges remain in optimizing patient risk factors post acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and ensuring patient compliance. Consumer wearable personal activity trackers represent a cost effective and readily available technology that may aid in this endeavour.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">UP-STEP ACS is a prospective single-blinded, two-arm, parallel, randomized control trial with an aim to enrol 200 patients all undertaking cardiac rehabilitation. It will assess the affect that personal activity monitors have on change in exercise capacity in patients post acute coronary syndromes primarily measured by a six-minute walk test (6MWT). Secondary end points will be the improvement in other cardiovascular risk factors, namely; blood lipid and glucose levels, weight, waist circumference, along with mood, quality of life and cardiac rehabilitation adherence. Patients will be randomized to either receive a personal activity tracker or standard post hospital care during their index event. After the 8- week intervention period, patients will return for a clinical review and repeat of baseline assessments including the 6MWT.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The utility and impact on exercise capacity of personal activity trackers in patient&#x02019;s post-acute coronary syndrome has not been assessed. This study aims to add to the scientific evidence emerging regarding the clinical utility and validity of these devices in different patient population groups. If proven to be of benefit, these devices represent a cost effective, easily accessible technology that could aid in the reduction of cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">The trial has been registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR).

However, despite the evidence, the application of these interventions is far from optimal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Coronary heart disease (CHD) still represents the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in Australia with almost 20,000 deaths in 2013 attributed to CHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This is also reflected globally with the World Health Organisation (WHO) attributing 8.76 million deaths, or 15.5% of the estimated 56.4 million deaths in 2015 to CHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Numerous observational studies have shown that there is an increased risk of recurrent cardiac events in patients who are known to have CHD and in particular those who have survived an acute coronary syndromes (ACS), with new events occurring most commonly within the first year following the index event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Australian data has estimated that 34% of all hospital admissions for ACS are repeat events with this representing a significant burden on the health care system economically, and a poor prognostic marker for patients individually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Aggressive secondary prevention is vital in reducing the risk of recurrent events and forms the pillar of secondary risk reduction. From a pharmacological perspective, guidelines are readily accessible and routinely followed immediately post cardiac event, however there remains inherent challenges with compliance and follow-up. The recent TRANSLATE-ACS study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] showed that 31% of myocardial infarction (MI) patients had stopped taking at least 1 medication by 6&#x000a0;months, with other studies showing dosage is often suboptimal post discharge with only 1 in 3 patients within the suggested dosage target and only 25% of patients prescribed a dosage increase after discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Therefore, close patient follow-up, education and appropriate dose titration is vital.</p><p id="Par8">Non-pharmacological secondary prevention is generally targeted at lifestyle modification, with the most common interventions focused around weight loss, smoking cessation, cardiovascular education programs, implementation of a healthy diet and regular physical activity and psychosocial support. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR), a comprehensive evidence based vehicle used to deliver much of the education, engagement and monitoring of lifestyle modifications have been shown to have a significant effect on both mortality and hospital readmission rates with reductions of 41 and 32% respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A recent Cochrane review confirmed this, albeit to a lesser degree, showing a 13% decrease in all-cause mortality and a 26% decrease in cardiovascular mortality in those attending CR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Despite its proven benefits, CR referral and participation rates still remain low. In a recent Australian study looking at 3212 patients undergoing angiography for AMI, only 48% of patients were referred to CR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], with numbers in the UK, USA and Europe ranging between 30 and 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Additionally, attendance attrition rates in CR programs may reach up to 60% over the course of the program and represents a significant ongoing challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Globally there have been cost challenges associated with CR attendance. Suaya JA et al. in the US reported that just over 13% of Medicare patients who had suffered an AMI, and 30% after CABG, received CR services after index hospitalisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Moreover, there may be a particular subset of the population including women, elderly people, those with significant comorbidities and those with inadequate health insurance coverage that are less likely to participate in or receive CR despite its proven protective effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">CR programs play a vital role in the development of personalized weight optimization strategies and education regarding risks of inactivity and reinforcing the positive benefits of regular physical exercise. Despite guideline recommendations of at least 150&#x000a0;min of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity or 75&#x000a0;min of vigorous-intensity activity throughout the week, evidence suggests that the majority of individuals do not meet this target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The recent 2014/15 Australian Health survey found that over 70% of the adult population had sedentary or low levels of physical activity, not meeting guideline recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. There has been efforts to quantify activity levels. Previously published literature has used pedometer-determined physical activity to identify under-activity and suggest daily targets, with an average step count of less than 5000 steps per day defined as sedentary, 5000&#x02013;7499 as low activity, 7500&#x02013;9999 as &#x02018;somewhat active&#x02019; and greater than 10,000 steps per day as &#x02018;active&#x02019;. Individuals who take greater than 12,500 steps per day are classified as &#x02018;highly active&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Numerous studies have shown the significant benefit of regular physical activity with an up to 30&#x02013;40% reduction in CV risk when compared to inactive individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">The new generation of wearable consumer personal activity trackers, incorporating a pedometer and accelerometer, offer unique opportunities to engage and remotely monitor patients engaged in rehabilitation programs with exercise components. These devices, offering sophisticated features such as GPS tracking, heart rate monitoring, activity and sleep tracking with smart phone application integration, give individuals an easy and affordable way to monitor physical activity and energy expenditure with the majority of devices showing acceptable validity of the data recorded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. It is estimated that approximately 25 million of these devices were sold in 2015 with worldwide sales expected to increase to 12.6 billion US dollars by 2018 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Wrist-worn monitors are predicted to account for 87% of the devices sold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">The use of older generation pedometers is well documented in the medical literature. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 8 randomized controlled trials and 18 observational studies with a total of 2767 patients found an increase in physical activity of 26.9% over baseline as measured by step count in patients using pedometers, with significant reduction in body mass index and blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. An important predictor of increased physical activity was having a daily step goal of 10,000. More recently, a systematic review of 11 studies including 1272 participants across 5 countries concluded that wearing electronic activity monitoring systems lead to an increase in physical activity and decrease in weight, suggesting potentially clinically significant benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Indeed, a significant advantage of a mobile device-based study is that participants naturally take the device with them, permitting passive recording of motion however, but its feasibility and validity on a 6-min walk test was questioned in a recent study by McConnell et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. A combination approach with measures of physical activity through a personal activity tracker and formal serial physical assessments of 6-min walking test perhaps is a more accurate assessment.</p><p id="Par13">One of the limitations to these devices is the documented low rates of long-term engagement for many users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Some have suggested that compliance at two years is approximately 40% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, despite these concerns, long-term compliance has not been assessed in patients post acute coronary syndrome. It could be argued that given the often life threatening event spurring behaviour change, engagement and compliance may well be higher.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aim</title><p id="Par14">The aim of this study is to assess the impact of personal activity trackers on exercise capacity, and improvement of cardiovascular risk factors including blood lipids, blood glucose, mood, weight, waist circumference, body mass index, blood pressure, exercise motivation and quality of life (QOL) in post acute coronary syndrome patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation,</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Hypotheses</title><p id="Par15">The primary hypothesis is that the use of a personal activity tracker will improve exercise capacity, as measured by an objective 6-min walk test, compared to standard care alone. The secondary hypotheses are that the use of personal activity trackers will result in the improvement in cardiovascular risk factors, namely; improved lipid profile, blood pressure, BMI, weight and waist circumference, HbA1c (where applicable) as well as an improvement in psychological status, mood, exercise motivation and QOL.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods/Design</title><p id="Par16">UP-STEP ACS is a prospective single-blinded, two-arm, parallel, randomized control trial with an aim to enrol 200 patients (100 in each arm).

Moderate intensity is described as exercise that is &#x02018;neither too hard, nor too easy&#x02019;, with &#x02018;mild shortness of breath, sweating and increased heart rate&#x02019; as per the National Australian Heart Foundation recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Tracking of cardiovascular risk factors</title><p id="Par30">Prior to discharge from hospital patient cardiovascular risk factors will be collected.

Studies have shown patients with pre-existing heart disease have an event rate of one in every 62,000&#x000a0;h of exercise with those without heart disease having a risk of a cardiac event between 1 in 400,000&#x02013;800,000&#x000a0;h of exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Some studies have suggested that strenuous activity is associated with increased risk of cardiac death or complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. However, recent data suggests that near maximal intensity exercise in patients in the week of and thereafter following an uncomplicated acute coronary syndrome is safe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">To minimize any risk to patients, those who have a significantly increased risk of suffering harm from this intervention have been excluded from the study. Should any participant experience or report any adverse events or symptoms at any time during the study period they will be advised on how to manage these symptoms and then to seek medical evaluation initially via their general practitioner or emergency department. Patients will be requested to contact the principal investigator about any reported adverse events or symptoms and these will be promptly recorded and managed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Standard care</title><p id="Par44">Regardless of treatment assigned all patients will receive the same standard of care post their acute coronary syndromes.

All statistical analyses will be performed using SPSS v23 (IBM, USA). Baseline characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Paired Student-t test will be used for all normally distributed continuous variables and will be described as mean with standard deviation.

We plan to submit a full manuscript to a peer reviewed journal, however the initial release may be an abstract at an appropriate scientific meeting.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par49">To our knowledge the UP-STEP trial will be the first study with the primary aim of determining the impact that personal activity trackers have on exercise capacity in patients following an acute coronary syndrome. The benefits of exercise on general health and in particular patients with coronary artery disease is well documented, however there remain many challenges in translating this into patient adherence. Near maximal exercise testing has been shown to be safe in patients post uncomplicated myocardial infarction in the days prior to discharge, and therefore early introduction of exercise should be strongly encouraged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p id="Par50">Personal activity trackers have increased in popularity exponentially in recent years and represent a unique opportunity in aiding the management of cardiovascular risk factors. To our knowledge there are no other studies in the literature assessing their efficacy in post ACS patients, and should the results of our study be positive, their use may represent a cost effective and simple intervention for improving outcomes following acute coronary syndrome. We aim to build the scientific evidence regarding their use in the management of secondary prevention in patients with coronary artery disease.</p><p id="Par51">The primary end point of our superiority study is to assess the improvement of exercise capacity as measured by an objective 6-min walk test, with the trial designed to detect a minimal clinically important difference of an increase of 25&#x000a0;m in a standardised 6&#x000a0;min walk test at 8&#x000a0;weeks post hospital discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Patient motivation, lifestyle and behaviour changes are crucial elements in the success of cardiac rehabilitation and cardiovascular risk factors modification. The time immediately post ACS for patients is vitally important for recovery, education and introspection, representing a unique opportunity for a positive behavioural change. Numerous studies have shown the favourable effects CR has on behavioural change in this regard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. We postulate that the use of a personal activity tracker will increase exercise capacity, increase patient exercise motivation and aid in the management of cardiovascular risk factors. Depending on our findings, future work may also investigate the utility of personal activity trackers in the primary prevention of coronary artery disease by reducing rates of physical inactivity, an emerging and previously unrecognised cardiac risk factor.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par52">The devices are provided by Fitbit Inc.
