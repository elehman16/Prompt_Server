However, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. As stem cells are thought to be the tumor precursor cells, visualizing their behavior is crucial for monitoring tumor progression. Increased tag diversity in inactive genes is indicative of a protracted clonal evolution and consequently, increased risk for tumor formation. Therefore, the effect of sulindac on stem cell dynamics was studied. Normal appearing single crypts were laser microdissected in placebo- and sulindac- treated FAP patient tissue after which the methylation patterns were visualized by Next Generation Sequencing. A significant difference in tag diversity over time was found in the sulindac group compared to the placebo group (*<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;<italic>0</italic>.018), indicative of a shortened clonal evolution treated sulindac. The rate of change in tag diversity over time was correlated with polyp number change over time. No significant difference over time was observed in the percent methylation when comparing placebo vs sulindac. In conclusion, daily sulindac administration in FAP patients significantly altered colorectal stem cell dynamics, which might explain the chemopreventive action of this drug indicating that tag diversity may be used as a predictive biomarker.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">In the intestine, differentiated cells are replaced every 5 days while stem cells can escape this fate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. For this reason, stem cells are believed to be the only cells that survive long enough to accumulate enough mutations to initiate tumorigenesis. Among stem cells, individual stem cell lineages compete for survival and replace other stem cell lineages, eventually resulting in a completely renewed stem cell pool. This continuous process in which a crypt is reconstituted from one single stem cell is called niche succession<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Since these stem cells are the tumor precursor cells, studying their behavior is important. However, no specific stem cell markers are available for routine diagnostics in human intestinal tissue and the tracing methods used in mouse models cannot be applied to humans. This led various scientists to investigate stem cell dynamics by measurement of the diversity of methylation patterns in the intestinal crypt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Since methylation patterns are inherited through cell divisions during which methylation errors occur randomly, methylation patterns in inactive and therefore unregulated genes, can diverge over time. Using this method, Graham <italic>et al</italic>. found that less unique methylation patterns in a crypt indicated that this crypt had undergone a niche succession more recently compared to a crypt with a higher number of unique methylation patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Baker <italic>et al</italic>. found a decreased methylation pattern diversity in adenomatous versus normal crypts in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, indicating an increased stem cell loss/replacement rate in adenomas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Pre-tumor progression is the phase during which there are no visible changes in the colorectal epithelium, but the cells nevertheless have already acquired early mutations for the initiation of tumor progression. The above methylation assay also allows for studying stem cell dynamics during pre-tumor progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), a disorder characterized by the development of numerous colorectal adenomatous polyps between the age of 10 and 20 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, has been used as an important model to study the transit from pre-tumor alterations to tumor progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. FAP is an autosomal dominant hereditary disorder caused by a germline mutation in the Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (<italic>APC</italic>) gene. Additional mutations lead to a virtually 100% lifetime risk of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) development at a mean age of 39 years, only prevented by a prophylactic colectomy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Other treatment strategies such as administrations of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), namely sulindac and celecoxib, are effective in reducing both adenoma number and size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In one study, sulindac intake of 300&#x02013;400&#x02009;mg per day resulted in a 71% reduction in adenoma formation compared to placebo after 4&#x02013;6 months, a stronger treatment response than the average adenoma decrease of 23% in patients treated with 800&#x02009;mg celecoxib a day for 6 months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The number and size of adenomas increased immediately upon withdrawal of sulindac<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, presently, the underlying mechanism of sulindac chemoprevention remains unclear.</p><p id="Par4">A study on methylation pattern diversity revealed that stem cell niche succession occurs every 8.2 years in colorectal crypts of patients without FAP, whereas in FAP patients, stem cell lineage persists for an average of 32 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Our previous work on FAP patients also showed a significant increase in methylation pattern diversity in FAP patients compared to controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. These results indicate that stem cells play a key role in the clinical course and complications of FAP. As sulindac treatment results in a decreased polyp size and number, we questioned whether sulindac treatment could influence stem cell dynamics, and, thereby, underlie the prevention or delay of polyp growth in FAP patients. Our previous study on stem cell dynamics used Sanger sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> which is time consuming and therefore not suitable in a diagnostic is setting. Meanwhile, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has facilitated biomedical research and clinical diagnostics by allowing germline sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, identification of novel genetic alterations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, identification of individual targeted therapy options<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, methylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and stem cell dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">In the current study methylation patterns in FAP patients treated with sulindac were compared to placebo treated patients to study whether chemoprevention with sulindac is associated with changes in stem cell dynamics. Furthermore, methylation patterns were visualized with NGS and Sanger sequencing that was used as a technical control to validate the NGS workflow.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par6">Diversity among stem cell lineages in the intestinal crypt can be investigated by analyzing changes in methylation patterns in the CpG island of the <italic>CSX</italic> gene. This gene is not expressed in the colorectum and changes in the methylation status are expected not to be regulated, i.e. they occur by chance. During cell division, CpG islands can randomly accumulate methylation errors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Therefore, with ageing, methylation pattern diversity increases and drifts within and between individual crypts, which can be used to recapitulate crypt histories<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">To study stem cell dynamics, the diversity of unique methylation patterns per crypt and the percent methylation within a crypt were used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The diversity of methylation patterns is defined as the total number of unique methylation patterns within a single crypt. The diversity reflects the genetic clonal diversity and time since all the stem cells went through a clonal homogenization event; i.e. duration of niche succession. Finding fewer patterns indicates a lower diversity; therefore the crypt is thought to have undergone a niche succession more recently. The percent methylation is defined as the number of methylated CpG sites compared to the total number of CpG sites. It reflects the mitotic age which is the total number of divisions since the zygote stage. Since methylation events accumulate randomly in unregulated genes during cell division, a higher percent methylation is indicative of a cell that has gone through more cell divisions.</p><p id="Par8">Since the amount of methylation events increases with age, we carefully age matched four FAP patients treated with sulindac and four FAP patients treated with placebo (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

</p><p id="Par9">DNA from sulindac and placebo treated FAP patients at three different time points during treatment (t&#x02009;=&#x02009;0, t&#x02009;=&#x02009;4&#x02009;m and t&#x02009;=&#x02009;2&#x02009;y) was laser microdissected from 10 normal appearing crypts for each patient. After sodium bisulfite treatment, PCR and sequencing, methylation patterns were determined. The workflow is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The sequencing can be performed either by NGS or by Sanger sequencing, where with NGS more DNA molecules will be analyzed compared to Sanger sequencing. Furthermore, the Sanger approach contains an extra cloning step, which makes the NGS approach a higher throughput approach and therefore more convenient to study stem cell dynamics.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Workflow of stem cell dynamics assay. The assay is performed on archival paraffin embedded (FFPE) material from normal-looking tissues. Single crypts are laser microdissected, and DNA is isolated. Next, the extracted genomic DNA is treated with sodium bisulphite to convert unmethylated cytosines into uracil; methylated cytosines are protected from this turnover. A nested PCR is performed to target the <italic>CSX</italic> sequence. The PCR products are extended with Iontorrent PGM sequencing adapters and sequenced following the manufacturers protocol. The various methylation patterns per crypt can then be clustered by adapters. Different numbers of reads are found for each pattern including PCR errors which occurred below 1% count. Meanwhile, as a technical control, the same PCR products are cloned into bacterial vectors and enumerated after a sequence analysis of cloned inserts. 10 clones were selected for sequencing so for each crypt, the total number of counts are 10.

</p><p id="Par10">Using NGS, a great number of sequences ranging from 4 to 49360 reads (mean: 13656) were obtained per crypt (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). However, the vast majority of methylation patterns only appeared in a minority of the total number of sequencing reads. It was therefore assumed that these patterns were the result of PCR or sequencing errors, and, therefore, did not represent stem cell lineages within the crypts. A suitable threshold (cut-off point) was described for diagnostics for NGS data of FFPE tissue, where variants with an allele frequency lower than 1&#x02013;5% were omitted from data analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Therefore, we applied a 1% cut-off value for the final data analysis.</p><p id="Par11">The effect of treatment on stem cell dynamics at the different time points was compared between the sulindac and the placebo group. Because the number of methylation patterns shows right skewness, we used mixed effect negative binomial regression that can handle count data and is robust for under- or overdispersion.

This short-lived effect of sulindac on polyp regression might be due to increased prostaglandin levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, retained nuclear accumulation of &#x003b2;-catenin and reduced epithelial COX-2 expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> or the occurrence of mutations such as in <italic>KRAS</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Here we studied whether the short beneficial effect of sulindac treatment is associated with changes in stem cell behavior. Stem cells can acquire somatic mutations, which are either silent or genetically advantageous. These mutations are passed on to daughter cells and may provide a selection force to a stem cell lineage, leading to a stronger dominance and a subsequently higher longevity of the stem cell lineage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. If a stem cell lineage persists longer, the time to visible tumor progression decreases, because neoplastic mutations can accumulate in the stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Also, in the case of FAP, a heterozygous mutation in <italic>APC</italic> may enhance the probability of a symmetrical stem cell division, leading to a larger stem cell pool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. As mentioned, niche succession in FAP takes considerably longer than in the normal colon and consequently the risk of an increased mutational load is higher. This has also been suggested by Kim <italic>et al</italic>., who found an increased stem cell survival in FAP patients compared to controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. An increased number of stem cells in the colorectal crypt is associated with an expansion of the proliferative compartment towards the epithelial surface, which further enhances the risk of relevant carcinogenic alterations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par17">The first study on the role of methylation patterns in SC dynamics used Sanger sequencing, the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; sequencing technique. Despite its accuracy, this method is labor intensive, relatively slow, and has a low throughput<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Furthermore, to identify methylation patterns for individual stem cells, a cloning approach is necessary, making the assay particularly laborious. Recently, NGS has emerged as a high throughput technique that provides reliable sequence data even from sub-optimal starting material like formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. A clonal amplification of each sequencing read is performed as an intrinsic component of the NGS process such that additional cloning steps to identify individual stem cells are bypassed. We detected 96% similarity in methylation events comparing NGS to Sanger sequencing. As expected, due to the higher sensitivity of NGS, more sequences and thereby more methylation patterns were found using NGS analysis. Although errors occur in NGS, a methylation pattern frequency cutoff of 1% adjusted for this. Hence, NGS can not only substitute for Sanger sequencing in studying stem cell dynamics, but also provide additional data.</p><p id="Par18">When comparing the unique number of methylation patterns in the placebo versus the sulindac-treated FAP patients a significant increase is visible after 2 years of treatment in the placebo group. In contrast, a slight decrease was found in the sulindac group, especially after 4 months of treatment. Four months coincides with the time when polyp number is still repressed and resistance only starts to develop after 6 months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. There is a difference between the sulindac and placebo group for the number of methylation patterns at baseline. This occurred by chance and is unfortunate, but the difference in trend between the two groups is striking and is consistent with diminished stem cell lineage longevity due to sulindac (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). It decreases the chance of accumulated mutations and corresponds with the lower number of polyps in the treatment group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par19">Also a significant difference was found in sulindac treated patients with regard to mitotic age, represented by the percent methylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. A higher mitotic age corresponds to a higher number of cell divisions that a stem cell has undergone and is associated with an increased risk of accumulating mutations. We found a slight decrease in the percent methylation between the start of the study and after 4 months of sulindac treatment, and a significant decrease in percent methylation between the start of the study and 2 years of sulindac administration, whereas the placebo group remained at a similar level. The lower percent methylation after 4 months of sulindac treatment corresponds with the lower polyp count observed in previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The effect, however, seems temporary<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and apparently other pathways can be used to circumvent the growth inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. In the sulindac group, a borderline decrease was observed per year. However, there was no significant difference after treatment over time which might be a reason why this effect is temporary.</p><p id="Par20">In the current study archival FFPE tissue was used which results in crosslinking of the DNA and artefacts like deamination of cytosines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Although the deamination might influence the methylation patterns described in this study, it will affect both study groups equally. It will result in changes from a cytosine to uracil, thereby underestimating the amount of methylation. When comparing our numbers to studies that used fresh frozen tissue this seems indeed the case<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. The sulindac and placebo treated patients were age matched in our study and a standardized biopsy site was used, thereby minimizing any bias. This precluded incorporation of a control group of normal subjects in our study. Location in the colorectum and also age are determinants of methylation and therefore confounders in a study like this. We also realize that the numbers are small and that conclusions need to be drawn with caution. However, it is felt that our study suggests that stem cell behavior may indeed be influenced by sulindac.</p><p id="Par21">In summary, we provide evidence that NGS can be applied accurately and efficiently in studying stem cell dynamics. Furthermore, daily sulindac administration significantly altered colorectal stem cell dynamics over time, consistent with decreased stem cell lineage longevity. This effect may contribute to the observed inhibition of polyp numbers in sulindac treated FAP patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Patients</title><p id="Par22">Biopsy materials from eight FAP patients, ranging from the age of 7 to 15 years (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), were selected from the study population of Giardiello <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.
