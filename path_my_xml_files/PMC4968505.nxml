eccentric training on lower extremity muscle activity and balance in stroke patients.
[Subjects and Methods] Thirty stroke patients participated, with 15 patients allotted to
each of two eccentric training groups: one using a slow velocity (group I) and one using a
fast velocity (group II). The virtual reality-based eccentric training was performed by
the patients for 30 minutes once a day, 5 days a week, for 8 weeks using an Eccentron
system. Surface electromyography was used to measure the lower extremity muscle activity,
while a BioRescue was used to measure balancing ability. [Results] A significant
difference in lower extremity muscle activation and balance ability was observed in group
I compared with group II. [Conclusion] This study showed that virtual reality-based

It includes neurological disorders lasting for longer than 24 hours, and the major symptoms
of stroke are sensory loss, motor weakness and loss of balance<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Most stroke patients show muscle weakening because of changes in
the muscle fiber features and a decrease in excitability of the cerebral cortex. Weakening
of lower extremity muscles has a significant correlation with balance and walking ability,
leading to the conclusion that muscle strength training is necessary to improve the
balancing ability of stroke patients<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Eccentric training, among other training methods for muscle strengthening, uses muscle
contractions that involve lengthening. It stimulates the growth and production of muscle
cells by stimulating collagen synthesis in the muscle and tendon system<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Eccentric strength is more preserved than concentric
strength following stroke<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, suggesting
that training with eccentric contractions may provide a more intense training stimulus.
Furthermore, evidence from healthy adults suggests that supraspinal motor systems are
engaged differently by eccentric contractions when compared with concentric
contractions<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, velocity
affects muscle strengthening training. Type II fiber is more dependent on the velocity
compared with type I fiber<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. While
training with a low velocity increases coherence of myosin, training with a high velocity
increases muscle strength by increasing the cross-sectional size of muscles<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. There are difficulties presented regarding
improvements on motor control due to a lack of feedback and a decrease in motivation of the
target in muscular strength training. However, there is an implied need for training based
on virtual reality to complement this<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Training based on virtual reality is used in the rehabilitation training processes of
various diseases such as skeletal and muscular system diseases and nervous system diseases
to provide feedback about the characteristics of movements from situations similar to an
actual environment and is an effective way to improve functional performance<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Studies on virtual reality are being actively conducted, but there is still a lack of
studies that combines it with eccentric training as well as studies that compared the
training effect by velocity. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze the effect
of a virtual reality-based eccentric training intervention on lower extremity muscle
activation and balance in stroke patients and subsequently use it as basic data for the
rehabilitation training of stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was approved by bioethics Committee of Sehan university center (IRB) (Approval
number: 2014&#x02013;06) on July 11, 2014.This study selected 30 patients who satisfied detailed
selection standards targeting patients hospitalized after the diagnosis of hemiplegia
because of stroke. The detailed selection standards included diagnosis of stroke within the
past year, the ability to communicate as indicated by achieving higher than 24 points on the
Korean mini-mental status examination, the ability to walk more than 10&#x02005;m independently, and
the lack of any skeletal or muscular diseases that could affect the experiment. The subjects
of this study were randomly allotted to either a virtual reality-based eccentric training
using a slow velocity group (group I), or a virtual reality-based eccentric training using a
fast velocity group (group II). General physical therapy was conducted including
developmental therapy for the central nervous system before virtual reality-based eccentric
training. For virtual reality-based eccentric training, an Eccentron (BTE Technologies Inc.,
Hanover, MD, USA) was used<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, this system
is comprised of a screen used to narrate the virtual reality and provide feedback during
training and an ergometer with a force plate. With this system, training is performed under
closed kinematic chain conditions, and when negative work is performed at a velocity of
1&#x02013;35&#x02005;rpm, it causes eccentric contraction in the hip joint, knee joint, and ankle joint.
Velocity is categorized as follows: slow velocity, 1&#x02013;12&#x02005;rpm, medium velocity, 13&#x02013;24&#x02005;rpm,
high velocity, 25&#x02013;35&#x02005;rpm. The training was performed for 30 minutes a day, five times a week
for 8 weeks.</p><p>An MP100 surface electromyography (EMG) system (Biopac Systems Inc., Goleta, CA, USA) was
used to measure the lower extremity muscle activation. It was attached to the vastus
lateralis, vastus medialis, and gastrocnemius muscles by bipolar electrode in parallel with
the direction of muscle fibers on each muscle belly. The percentage of reference voluntary
contraction (%RVC) was used to standardize the muscle activation. The Sampling rate was set
1,024&#x02005;Hz, and notch filter and band pass filter were set 60&#x02005;Hz and 30&#x02013;450&#x02005;Hz, respectively,
and the collected signal was processed with RMS. During maintaining 5 seconds a low
squatting position, after it was measured muscle activation of measuring muscle, RVC value
was calculated with analyzing signals with 3 seconds excluding first 1 second and last 1
second and also %RVC value was do with comparing muscle activation value measured during LOS
test. The mean values of 3 measurements were used as the muscle activation data.</p><p>A BioRescue (RM Ingenierie, Rodez, France), which can measure the moving distance and area
of the center of pressure (COP), was used to measure balance ability<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study measured the limit of stability (LOS), which
is the furthest distance weight can be shifted in any direction without loss of balance.</p><p>The PASW Statistics for Windows, Ver. 18.0, statistical software was used for analysis of
the results of this study. Descriptive statistics were used for the characteristics the
subjects, and analysis of covariance (ACOVA) was conducted to examine the differences in
lower extremity muscle activation and balance ability before and after the intervention
between groups. The Statistical significance level was &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group I<break/>(n=15)</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group II<break/>(n=15)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (male/female)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8/7</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8/7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">61.0 &#x000b1; 4.2</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60.9 &#x000b1; 4.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">66.9 &#x000b1; 5.2</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">65.9 &#x000b1; 7.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">167.3 &#x000b1; 6.2</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">168.0 &#x000b1; 4.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stroke duration (months)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.4 &#x000b1; 1.4</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.3 &#x000b1; 1.2</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are shown as the mean &#x000b1; SD.

activation and balance ability as well as to confirm the effect of virtual reality-based
eccentric training on lower extremity muscle activation and balance in stroke patients, this
study confirmed that virtual reality-based eccentric training using a slow velocity resulted
in significant improvements in lower extremity muscle activation and balance ability.
LaStayo et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> divided 21 elderly
participants who had experienced falls into an eccentric resistant exercise group and the
traditional muscular strength exercise group and subjects them to their respective
interventions for 11 weeks. Their results showed a significant increase in BBS scores and
changes in posture when comparing the eccentric resistant exercise group with the
traditional muscular strength training group. Jegu et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> divided 80 patients with kneecap arthritis into an eccentric
training groups and concentric training groups subjects them to their respective
interventions for 6 weeks. The results revealed a significant decrease in changes in posture
tests in comparing of the eccentric training group with the concentric training group.
Tsakils et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> showed significant
decreases in both moving area and speed, focusing on body&#x02019;s center of pressure, in stroke
patients after 4 weeks of balance training based on virtual reality. Groups I and II, which
were subjected to 8-week interventions with eccentric training based on virtual reality in
this study, also showed an increase in their limits of stability, improving their balance
ability. Usually, eccentric shrinkage is activated to control and maintain posture
stability<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, and since training based
on virtual reality is provided with real-time feedback information and it motivates
subjects<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>, it can be deduced that eccentric training based on virtual reality
increases balance ability.</p><p>In an intervention conducted for 6 weeks for 14 stroke patients divided into a muscular
strength training groups using a slow velocity and a muscular strength training groups using
a significant fast velocity, Cha et al.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>
showed a significant decrease in the dynamic balance test in the training groups. Their
study also showed a significant difference in the LOS between virtual reality-based
eccentric training using a slow velocity and virtual reality-based eccentric training using
a fast velocity. Since the balancing ability of stroke patients shows a high correlation
with the muscle strength of the lower extremity and a fast velocity, muscular strength
training of legs leads to a reduction in muscle shrinkage, reducing the crossbridge of actin
and myosin because it causes overload in the tissue<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is thought that eccentric training using a slow velocity that
causes co-contraction of type I fiber and type II fiber results in a significant difference
in improvements of balance ability by increasing the muscle strength of the lower
extremity.</p><p>This study confirmed that virtual reality-based eccentric training using a slow velocity is
effective for improving lower extremity muscle activation and balance ability in stroke
patients. The limitation of this research is that it is difficult to the findings to
generalize all stroke patients due to the small number of subjects. Therefore, additional
study regarding the effects of virtual reality-based eccentric training on cardiopulmonary
function and the quality of life in stroke patients is necessary.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by a research grant of Sehan University in 2016.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Shin</surname><given-names>SH</given-names></name><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name><name><surname>Jung</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Effects of dual-task performance on postural sway of
