We analysed the impact of biomedical, sociodemographic and cultural factors on baseline QL indicators in two International Breast Cancer Study Group trials. Patients with stage II breast cancer were randomized within 6 weeks of primary surgery to various adjuvant treatments. They were asked to assess five indicators of QL at baseline. QL forms were available for 1231 (83%) of the 1475 premenopausal and 989 (82%) of the 1212 post-menopausal patients, who were from nine countries and spoke seven languages. Culture (defined as language/country groups) had a statistically significant impact on baseline QL measures. Premenopausal patients with poor prognostic factors showed a tendency to report worse QL, with oestrogen receptor status as an independent predictor for mood (P = 0.0005). Older post-menopausal patients reported better emotional wellbeing (P = 0.002), mood (P = 0.002), and less effort to cope (P = 0.0009) compared with younger post-menopausal patients. Co-morbidity, type of surgery, treatment assignment and sociodemographic factors showed a statistically significant impact in post-menopausal patients only. Cultural and biomedical factors influenced baseline QL and should be considered when evaluating the impact of treatment on QL in international breast cancer clinical trials.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00005-0130.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="686" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00005-0131.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="687" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00005-0132.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="688" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00005-0133.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="689" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00005-0134.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="690" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00005-0135.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="691" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00005-0136.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="692" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00005-0137.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="693" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
