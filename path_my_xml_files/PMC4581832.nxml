Despite considerable dispute, propofol has gained overall popularity as the sedative of choice by many endoscopists and anaesthesiologists, and has largely replaced the traditional use of benzodiazepines.[<xref rid="pone.0138422.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0138422.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] However, its lack of analgesic property, narrow therapeutic window and absence of a reversal agent have been recognized as the cause of adverse events related to oversedation.[<xref rid="pone.0138422.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>In an attempt to reduce these complications, balanced propofol sedation (BPS) was proposed as a method that would provide safe and effective sedation by combining a low-dose of propofol with an opioid analgesic and/or benzodiazepine.[<xref rid="pone.0138422.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] While the concept of BPS has been generally well received by the medical society, the issue of which and how much opioid analgesic should be combined with propofol is still under debate.[<xref rid="pone.0138422.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0138422.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The conventionally used opioid was meperidine, and many clinicians administered this agent routinely for pain control during endoscopic procedures. However, meperidine is quickly losing its place as an analgesic for interventional procedures due to its many side effects and low efficacy.[<xref rid="pone.0138422.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0138422.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The toxic potential of meperidine renders it inappropriate for use during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), as such procedures are usually accompanied by severe pain and discomfort which may require repeated analgesic<strike>s</strike> administration.[<xref rid="pone.0138422.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] On the other hand, we found in a recent retrospective study that respiratory events were significantly reduced when effective analgesia was provided during ERCP by giving bolus doses of fentanyl as needed.[<xref rid="pone.0138422.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] However, repeated doses of fentanyl may carry the risk of prolonged recovery time, which could be a problem in terms of patient safety and efficiency.</p><p>This randomized, controlled trial was conducted to compare recovery profiles between conventional BPS using a single dose of meperidine and a combination method using repeated doses of fentanyl during propofol-based sedation for ERCP. We hypothesized that a combination method would be able to offer satisfactory sedation without prolonging recovery times compared to conventional BPS. Satisfaction levels of the endoscopists and patients as well as drug requirements, cardiovascular and respiratory events were also assessed and compared between the two groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board and Hospital Research Ethics Committee of Severance Hospital, and registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">http://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> (registration number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01840371">NCT01840371</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Study population</title><p>Adult patients of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I ~ IV that were scheduled for elective ERCP between April 2013 and October 2013 were recruited for this study. All patients provided written informed consent. Pregnant or breastfeeding patients and those with known allergies to eggs, soy beans or sulfites were excluded from this study. Patients that had received sedation for another procedure within 24 hours prior to ERCP, were unable to provide informed consent or were under the age of 20 years were also excluded.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Study design and sedation protocols</title><p>The targeted level of sedation was MOAA/S (Modified Observer&#x02019;s Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale) score 3 to 4 in all patients. Sedation in the Conventional Group was done by administrating 25 mg of IV meperidine (Pethidine, Jeil Pharmaceutical Co. Lt., Daegu, Korea) and 1 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> of propofol (Pofol, Dong Kook Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Seoul, Korea) initially, followed by propofol infusion at a maintenance rate of 60 &#x003bc;g min<sup>-1</sup>kg<sup>-1</sup> using an automated pump (Terufusion&#x000ae; Syringe Pump TE-331, Terumo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Additional doses of 10 mg of propofol were given when patients complained of discomfort/pain, or when the endoscopist demanded deeper sedation. Patients of the Combination Group were given 1 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>-1</sup> of IV fentanyl (Hana pharmaceutical, Korea) and 0.4 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> of propofol initially, followed by propofol infusion at a maintenance rate of 30 &#x003bc;g min<sup>-1</sup> kg<sup>-1</sup>. Additional doses of 10 mg of propofol were given during insufficient sedation, while bolus doses of 0.5 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>-1</sup> of fentanyl were given when additional analgesia was needed. The need for additional sedation and analgesia was judged by the attending anesthesiologist based on the visual observation of patient irritability or excessive movement. Benzodiazepines were not used in our study.</p><p>Enrolled patients were randomly assigned to either the Conventional Group (n = 100) or the Combination Group (n = 102) by means of a table of random numbers generated by 4 block design with the SAS program (SAS institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The allocation sequence was assigned to each patient in sealed envelopes with equal randomization (1:1 for the two groups) at the point of sedation induction. The patients, all study investigators and medical personnel except the attending anesthetist providing sedation were blinded to group assignment. All ERCP procedures were performed by 5 endoscopists of similar experience (who performed more than 300 ERCPs annually for more than 3 years) and sedation was done by a qualified anesthesiology staff member trained for procedural sedation outside the operating theater that was not involved in the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Patient monitoring</title><p>All endoscopic procedures were performed in a room dedicated to ERCP, fully equipped for advanced cardiac life support. Patients arrived at the endoscopy room with secure IV access, and nasal oxygen was supplied at 3 L min<sup>-1</sup>. Patient monitoring included non-invasive blood pressure measurement every 5 minutes, pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>) and electrocardiography. Recovery score assessment using the modified Aldrete score[<xref rid="pone.0138422.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] was initiated immediately after the procedure ended (0 minutes), and was followed at 5, 15 and 25 minutes post-procedure by a nurse that was blinded to the sedation regimen at the endoscopy recovery unit.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Outcome measurements and definitions</title><p>The primary outcome of this study was to compare recovery profiles between the two groups. In addition to assessing recovery based on the modified Aldrete score at the aforementioned time points, time required for full recovery was noted. Recovery time was defined as the time interval between scope withdrawal and the modified Aldrete score reaching 10 points.</p><p>The endoscopists gave a satisfaction score at the end of the procedure, and patients were asked by a nurse that was blinded to the sedation regimen to give a score upon full recovery at the endoscopy recovery unit. Satisfaction scores were <strike>initially</strike> given on a verbally administered numerical rating scale of 0 to 100.</p><p>Procedure duration was defined as the time between scope insertion and scope withdrawal. Adverse respiratory events such as desaturation and apnea were also recorded by the attending anesthetist and compared between the two groups. Desaturation was defined as SpO<sub>2</sub> lower than 90% for more than 10 seconds that required either an increase in O<sub>2</sub> supply, chin lift, jaw thrust maneuver or assisted mask ventilation at the discretion of the attending anesthetist. Apnea was defined as the cessation of voluntary respiration for more than 30 seconds under visual observation. Hypertension due to severe pain or undersedation was defined as more than a 20% increase of mean blood pressure (MBP) from baseline, and hypotension was defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) &#x0003c; 90 mmHg or MBP &#x0003c; 60 mmHg. Bradycardia and tachycardia were each defined as heart rate (HR) &#x0003c; 60 bpm and &#x0003e; 100 bpm, respectively.</p><p>Post-procedure pain scores were recorded on a visual analogue scale (VAS) of 0&#x02013;10 at 6, 12, 18 and 24 hours. The number of times rescue analgesics or antiemetics were administrated were recorded during intervals of 0&#x02013;12 hours and 12&#x02013;24 hours after the procedure.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>
<strike>A</strike> Sample size was calculated based on the recovery times after propofol monosedation reported in a previous study.[<xref rid="pone.0138422.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] To detect a 20% difference in recovery time with a non-inferiority design between groups, 100 patients per group would be required to obtain a power of 85%, assuming a type I error of 0.05. Continuous variables with normal distribution were analyzed with the independent two sample t-test. Continuous variables that were not normally distributed were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U Test and expressed as median and interquartile range (IQR). Categorical variables were analyzed by the Chi-square or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. All statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). A P value of &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data are described as mean &#x000b1; SD or number of subjects.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec013"><title>Results</title><p>The CONSORT flow diagram of this study is shown in <xref rid="pone.0138422.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>.

However, the debate on which regimen should be used is yet to be resolved. Sedation regimens cannot be standardized, but should be tailored according to the characteristics of the procedure such as the target site, duration, the general condition of the patient and nature of the intended procedure. Therefore, the relatively complex nature of ERCP procedures render it even more difficult to choose a safe and effective sedation regimen compared to simpler endoscopic procedures such as colonoscopy or esophagogastroduodenoscopy. We found in the present study that combining repeated doses of fentanyl for adequate pain control with continuous propofol infusion does not seem to prolong recovery times compared to a single dose of meperidine followed by continuous propofol infusion. Moreover, the proportion of endocopists and patients that felt &#x02018;very unsatisfied&#x02019; with the overall sedation method were clearly smaller in the Combination Group.</p><p>Appropriate analgesia has emerged as an important aspect to consider when deciding on a sedation regime. Jeurnink et al.[<xref rid="pone.0138422.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] reported that more discomfort was experienced during and immediately after the procedure in patients that underwent therapeutic ERCP compared to diagnostic ERCP. They also concluded that one-third to one-half of patients undergoing ERCP under conscious sedation experience discomfort and pain, implying that pain was often under-treated during and after these procedures. In the same vein, we found in a recent retrospective study that more opioids were administered during therapeutic ERCP compared to diagnostic procedures when performed under conscious sedation with propofol infusion.[<xref rid="pone.0138422.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The results of these studies point in the same direction&#x02014;a need for more attention towards analgesia during ERCP, and especially during therapeutic procedures.</p><p>The concept of BPS basically involves a single induction dose of opioid and/or benzodiazepine, followed by incremental doses of propofol in order to achieve a targeted level of moderate sedation.[<xref rid="pone.0138422.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] However, it is important to recognize that propofol does not have any inherent analgesic properties and therefore requires an adjuvant drug that will complement this aspect. The main problem with BPS thus seems to be the &#x02018;single induction dose of opioid&#x02019; that is used at the beginning of the procedure in a form of premedication. This overlooks the fact that pain levels and procedure times differ significantly between ERCP procedures, and may be one of the factors leading to oversedation due to excessive doses of propofol. By taking this aspect into consideration, the sedation regimen of the Combination Group of the present study incorporated the repeated administration of an opioid according to the pain or discomfort of the patient during ERCP. Although meperidine has been most commonly used by many gastroenterologists during endoscopy for a long time,[<xref rid="pone.0138422.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] its toxic potential makes it inappropriate for repeated administrations, and doses as low as 46 mg have been reported to produce central nervous system symptoms.[<xref rid="pone.0138422.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The active metabolite, normeperidine, has a half-life ranging between 14 to 21 hours, and its accumulation may precipitate anxiety, hyperreflexia, myoclonus, seizures and mood changes.[<xref rid="pone.0138422.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In order to avoid such side effects, fentanyl was used as the opioid in the Combination Group. Fentanyl has a more rapid onset and clearance, lacks dangerous metabolites or allergenic properties and is therefore commonly recommended as the safe alternative to meperidine for procedural sedation.[<xref rid="pone.0138422.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0138422.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>We found in a recent retrospective analysis that providing analgesia by combining repeated doses of fentanyl with propofol could effectively reduce the risk of respiratory events when compared with propofol monosedation.[<xref rid="pone.0138422.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] This result was attributed to the decreased risk of oversedation by reducing the overall dosage of propofol. However, it could not be concluded that repeated doses of fentanyl would not affect recovery profiles. We found in the present study that the fentanyl combination method did not prolong recovery times or worsen recovery profiles compared to conventional BPS. In other words, repeated administrations of fentanyl did not seem to affect patient recovery when used appropriately for procedural pain control. In addition, considering the suggested doses of propofol for sedation and maintenance of general anesthesia (25&#x02013;75 &#x003bc;g/kg/min and 50&#x02013;150 &#x003bc;g/kg/min, respectively),[<xref rid="pone.0138422.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] the difference in propofol requirements of roughly 55 &#x003bc;g/kg/min between the two groups seem to have clinical significance.</p><p>The present study is notable in that patients were enrolled regardless of ASA class. While most previous studies done on sedation protocols enrolled patients of only ASA class 1&#x02013;3,[<xref rid="pone.0138422.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0138422.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] we also included patients of ASA class 4. However, the incidence of desaturation was very low in both groups, and all events were corrected with a temporary increase in oxygen supply without the need to interrupt the procedure.</p><p>In terms of post-procedural pain, the Conventional Group showed significantly lower pain scores compared to the Combination Group at 6 hours after the procedure, and required less rescue analgesics during the first 12 hours. However, these results should be interpreted carefully. The difference in mean VAS scores between the two groups was only 0.7 (3.2 &#x000b1; 2.4 vs. 2.5 &#x000b1; 2.5), which may have questionable significance in actual clinical practice. This also applies to the results of rescue analgesics administration during the first 12 hours, which is statistically significant, but does not seem to have much clinical significance (0.8 &#x000b1; 0.9 vs. 0.5 &#x000b1; 0.8). Whether the combination method for sedation during ERCP allows lesser post-procedural pain remains unclear in this study.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, this study was conducted in a single institution and enrolled only Asian patients that showed a tendency of a relatively low body mass index (22.9 &#x000b1; 3.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) compared to the average Caucasian. A study including a patient population of diverse ethnicity should provide more insight with regard to drug dosage and adverse events. Secondly, we were not able to detect a difference in respiratory events between the two groups despite the significant reduction in propofol dosage in the Combination Group. Moreover, the incidence of respiratory events observed in the present study was under 3% in both groups, which is much lower than the previously reported 6% in patients that received ERCP procedures under propofol monosedation in a retrospective study.[<xref rid="pone.0138422.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Lastly, patients of the Combination Group were somewhat older that those of the Conventional Group with a mean age difference of 5 years. However, to what extent this difference may have affected the drug requirements and other outcomes are not clear. Overall, these results may imply that the most important factor in performing safe, yet effective sedation for therapeutic endoscopic procedures is not the sedative regimen, but the meticulous and careful monitoring of the sedation provider.</p><p>In conclusion, combining repeated doses of fentanyl for adequate pain control with continuous propofol infusion does not seem to prolong recovery times compared to a single dose of meperidine followed by continuous propofol infusion. The resulting decrease in overall propofol dose may have more significance in patients with poor general conditions which are not uncommon with ERCP. Considering the pharmacologic characteristics of the two opioids and the trend of higher satisfaction levels of the endoscopists and patients, combination sedation using repeated administrations of fentanyl with propofol infusion may be a safer and more effective sedation method compared to conventional BPS with meperidine during ERCP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0138422.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 checklist for reporting a randomiszed trial.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0138422.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0138422.s002"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Clinical research protocol in original language (Korean).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0138422.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0138422.s003"><label>S2 Protocol</label><caption><title>Clinical research protocol in English.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0138422.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0138422.s004"><label>S1 Case Report Form</label><caption><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0138422.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0138422.s005"><label>S1 Informed Consent Form</label><caption><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0138422.s005.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0138422.s006"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><title>Clinical research data of all patients.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0138422.s006.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0138422.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
