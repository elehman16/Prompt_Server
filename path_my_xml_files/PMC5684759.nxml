Neurofeedback provides valuable information derived from real-time brain activity, such as electroencephalography (EEG), and displays the result on an interface of visual, audio, or other modalities. Thus, users can learn to control their brain activities through a neurofeedback apparatus. The control ability of brain rhythms from users often elicits a neural plasticity in the brain then affects their behaviors and cognitive functions as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">The alpha rhythm of 8&#x02013;12&#x000a0;Hz displays in the occipital cortex and its neighboring area under an eye-closed condition. Originally, functional hypothesis of alpha rhythm is related to cortical inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], which may be crucial to lower brain activity. Neurofeedback training (NFT) of alpha rhythm is employed quite frequently as a treatment for several clinical disorders such as anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] or depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, its effectiveness is still debated in clinic (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]). In addition to clinical application, NFT of alpha rhythm is also assessed on cognitive function in healthy subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Numerous studies show positive effect of the alpha NFT on attention or memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However some studies have no enhancement in memory or cognitive function with altered amplitude or peak frequency of alpha rhythm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Several reasons are crucial for these controversial effects. The trainability for an NFT system is the first issue. Previous studies have indicated a short training session being insufficient for cognitive enhancement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Can we develop and validate a possible NFT apparatus for a long-term training with a great usability? That will be very important to increase training sessions of the NFT under laboratory/clinical settings or daily environment.</p><p id="Par17">Additionally, most previous studies are lack of comparable control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] or absence of the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Different experimental designs often cause controversial results in the findings. Identical exposure for a training apparatus and the same protocol between the control and experimental groups are crucial to identify effect of an intervention. To reduce possible selection bias of participants and related internal validity, a sham-controlled experimental design is more appropriate to validate effect of an NFT on memory or cognitive function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Thus, the experimental design with a sham control group is beneficial to determine the NFT effect in a new developed system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Most available neurofeedback systems are laboratory-designed and contain wires to the training machine, resulting in inconvenience or constraints for subjects. Wireless technologies are widely utilized in medical devices and biomedical research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A wireless recording not only improves the system convenience but also reduces the possible artifacts from recording wires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Additionally, the main functions of a neurofeedback training program are easily implemented with a smartphone application. Users can install the application and perform the training procedures on their own devices. Due to the portability brought by the utilization of the smartphone, the proposed system can be easily used in a daily life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">The present study aimed to develop a portable neurofeedback training system for subjects to perform trainings in a flexible training environment. The proposed system comprised an EEG signal analysis device that was wirelessly connected to smartphones by Bluetooth low energy wireless technology. The system illustrated interactive information of current alpha power to training subjects. Subjects learned how to produce and control the alpha rhythm as much as possible through visual feedback indexes. Moreover, both working memory and episodic memory before and after the training were evaluated compared with a sham-controlled group to assess performance of the wireless NFT system.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par20">Thirty healthy participants (age 26&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;3&#x000a0;years) from the National Cheng Kung University were blinded and randomly assigned into two groups (i.e., Alpha, n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;15; control, n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;15).

Based on previous neurofeedback studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], we selected a C3 channel as an active lead with a reference over the contralateral mastoid area (M2) according to the 10&#x02013;20 system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A ground electrode was placed over the Fpz region. The EEG signal was amplified with a gain of 10,000 through an instrumentation amplifier (AD623, Analog Device, Texas) in combination with two non-inverting operational amplifiers (AD8538, Analog Device, Texas) within a frequency range of 0.15&#x02013;50&#x000a0;Hz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The amplified EEG was then positive-biased to an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) of the microcontroller.</p><p id="Par23">The microcontroller module included a MSP430F5438 integrated chip, which embedded with a MSP430 microcontroller unit, 256&#x000a0;kB flash memory, 16&#x000a0;kB RAM, and other peripherals such as an 8-bit ADC and three 16-bit timers. The MSP430 digitized data through an embedded ADC with 128&#x000a0;Hz and transferred sampled EEG data to a Bluetooth module. Afterwards, the Bluetooth module transmitted the data to a smartphone. The core component of this Bluetooth module was a Nordic nRF8001 chip that integrated a fully compliant Bluetooth radio and link layer controller. Bluetooth is designed for short-range and low power wireless communication, and it is widely adopted in personal computers and consumer electronic devices, e.g., mobile phone or media player. The present study used the Bluetooth version 4.0, which aimed at applications in the fitness, healthcare and security areas because it provided lower cost, lower power consumption, and a comparable communication range than a traditional Bluetooth protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Software implementation</title><p id="Par24">The software of the proposed training system contained two parts: control firmware on the microcontroller module and a training application on the smartphone.

In our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], a significant increase in alpha power began in the 8th session. The slight discrepancy between our previous study and the present study may be due to lower threshold to determine alpha rhythm (1.2- vs. 1.5-fold) or short training schedule (12 sessions in 3 or 4&#x000a0;weeks). When we calculated the results using 1.5-fold threshold, there were significant differences in alpha power and duration between the two groups in the 8th&#x02013;12th session (data not shown). Obviously, a higher threshold delays the occurrence of significant difference between the two groups.

The device provides an alternative non-pharmacological intervention for memory enhancement.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ADC</term><def><p id="Par5">analog-to-digital converter</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ANOVA</term><def><p id="Par6">analysis of variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BLE</term><def><p id="Par7">Bluetooth low energy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EEG</term><def><p id="Par8">electroencephalogram</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EMG</term><def><p id="Par9">electromyogram</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EOG</term><def><p id="Par10">electrooculogram</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FFT</term><def><p id="Par11">fast Fourier transform</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MCU</term><def><p id="Par12">microcontroller unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MMSE</term><def><p id="Par13">Mini-Mental State Examination</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NFT</term><def><p id="Par14">neurofeedback training</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>TYW, YDL and FZS performed experiment and prepared materials of the manuscript.
