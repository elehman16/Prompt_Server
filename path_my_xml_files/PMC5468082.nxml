We tested the impact of an ED-initiated coaching intervention on patient engagement and follow-up doctor visits in this high-risk population. We also explored patients&#x02019; care-seeking decisions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a mixed-methods study including a randomized controlled trial and in-depth interviews in two EDs in northern Florida. Participants were chronically ill older ED patients with limited health literacy and Medicare as a payer source. Patients were assigned to an evidence-based coaching intervention (n= 35) or usual post-ED care (n= 34). Qualitative interviews (n=9) explored patients&#x02019; reasons for ED use. We assessed average between-group differences in patient engagement over time with the Patient Activation Measure (PAM) tool, using logistic regression and a difference-in-difference approach. Between-group differences in follow-up doctor visits were determined. We analyzed qualitative data using open coding and thematic analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>PAM scores fell in both groups after the ED visit but fell significantly more in &#x0201c;usual care&#x0201d; (average decline &#x02212;4.64) than &#x0201c;intervention&#x0201d; participants (average decline &#x02212;2.77) (&#x003b2;=1.87, p=0.043). There were no between-group differences in doctor visits. Patients described well-informed reasons for ED visits including onset and severity of symptoms, lack of timely provider access, and immediate and comprehensive ED care.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The coaching intervention significantly reduced declines in patient engagement observed after usual post-ED care. Patients reported well-informed reasons for ED use and will likely continue to make ED visits unless strategies, such as ED-initiated coaching, are implemented to help vulnerable patients better manage their health and healthcare.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Patient engagement is central to many health policy initiatives. <xref rid="b1-wjem-18-743" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b5-wjem-18-743" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Engaged patients make more informed healthcare decisions, avert health crises and incur lower healthcare costs.<xref rid="b6-wjem-18-743" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-wjem-18-743" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Interventions to increase patient engagement increase the use of preventive care, reduce hospital-based care and improve outcomes.<xref rid="b6-wjem-18-743" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b8-wjem-18-743" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b12-wjem-18-743" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The Patient Activation Measure SF&#x000ae; (PAM) is a way to quantify patient engagement, which is defined as patients&#x02019; knowledge, skills and confidence in managing their health and healthcare and the interventions that promote healthy behaviors. <xref rid="b13-wjem-18-743" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Coaching interventions increase PAM scores, reduce hospital use, and improve medication and chronic disease self-management but have not been tested in the ED.<xref rid="b8-wjem-18-743" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-wjem-18-743" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b12-wjem-18-743" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Although ED use is increasing in older adults, those with limited health literacy represent a particularly high-risk group who are often under-engaged in managing their health and frequently turn to the ED for care. <xref rid="b14-wjem-18-743" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b18-wjem-18-743" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Strategies aimed at engaging these patients at the critical ED juncture may help them stay engaged, better manage their health and avert future health crises.

Inverse probability weighting adjusts for bias due to missing data by giving more weight to patients who resemble those lost to follow-up. <xref rid="b31-wjem-18-743" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> The DID approach ensures that background trends in outcomes unrelated to the program are not responsible for treatment effects by comparing outcomes in the treatment group to a group experiencing the same background trends but not exposed to the program. To account for the fact that patient measurements within a site were more likely to be similar than measurements between sites, all models were estimated with standard errors clustered by site.

They are mostly like gas, but then you&#x02019;re having a heart attack.&#x02019; So, I agreed for them to take me to the emergency room because I really wanted to know what it was.&#x0201d;</p></disp-quote><p>For participants attending large community-based clinics (health department or Veterans Affairs), timely contact with a provider usually was not possible. Appointments were viewed as a strategy to &#x0201c;maintain&#x0201d; health through check-ups and refilling prescriptions rather than addressing a healthcare concern. For these participants, ED care was considered a reasonable option.</p><disp-quote><p>[2&#x02013;2]: &#x0201c;If I had called [my primary care clinic] to tell them I had cramps they would have given me an appointment two or three months down the line&#x02026; As a matter of fact, after I went [to the ED in June] and called for a [follow-up] appointment, the earliest appointment they could give me was in August.&#x0201d;</p></disp-quote><p>In contrast to perceived lack of availability of timely outpatient care, participants perceived ED care as immediate and comprehensive because of staffing and availability of ancillary and specialty referral services.</p><disp-quote><p>[1&#x02013;3]: &#x0201c;In the ER they get right on it&#x02026;They won&#x02019;t let me sit back and die.

When patients are more engaged, they have better health outcomes and lower healthcare costs. <xref rid="b1-wjem-18-743" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b5-wjem-18-743" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Unfortunately, interventions aimed at engaging ED patients to help them better manage their health and healthcare have been largely ignored. This study is novel because it focused on chronically ill, older ED patients with limited health literacy, a high-risk population that is often under-engaged in their health and rely on the ED during a health crisis. <xref rid="b14-wjem-18-743" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the impact of an ED-initiated coaching intervention on patient engagement in a vulnerable ED population. The study documented three observations regarding patient engagement. First, chronically ill patients with limited health literacy are most engaged at ED presentation as assessed by PAM scores. Second, engagement falls in the weeks after the ED visit in all patients. Third, the ED-to-home &#x0201c;intervention&#x0201d; significantly reduced the post-ED fall in patient engagement relative to &#x0201c;usual care.&#x0201d;</p><p>Baseline PAM scores were higher in this study than reported in a nationally representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries (64.6 versus 63.4 previously reported) <xref rid="b29-wjem-18-743" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> but fell to a mean of 61.0 in the weeks following the ED visit. Engagement is highest at ED presentation &#x02013; a finding that is consistent with prior work that demonstrates patients use the ED when they feel their condition is emergent and are too worried about their condition to seek care in other settings.<xref rid="b16-wjem-18-743" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="b37-wjem-18-743" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Our in-depth interviews are consistent with these findings and provide insight into the critical individual and health-system factors that contribute to patients&#x02019; decisions to use the ED, which include the onset and severity of symptoms, advice of trusted sources, inability to gain timely access to a provider, and perception that the ED provides immediate, comprehensive care.</p><p>We were unable to identify studies where interventions designed to increase patient engagement led to decreased PAM scores. In this study, the observed decline in PAM scores may have occurred because the baseline survey was conducted in the ED. It is likely patients become engaged to take actions about their health when their symptoms suggest something is wrong that requires emergent attention. Although highly engaged in their health during the health crisis, patients&#x02019; engagement may decline as the crisis resolves without further health system contact. <xref rid="b38-wjem-18-743" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Importantly, the ED-to-home intervention blunted the decline in post-ED PAM scores by approximately two points. The fact that similar longer-term PAM score changes are associated with improvements in physical activity, medication adherence, self-management knowledge, and functional health suggest the clinical significance of these findings. <xref rid="b38-wjem-18-743" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b40-wjem-18-743" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></p><p>Coaches helped participants advocate for themselves to schedule timely follow-up doctor visits but did not make appointments for patients. Most patients did not see a provider within two weeks of ED visit, and between-group differences were not observed. It is possible that even if ED patients attempted follow-up, they were unable to obtain an appointment because of barriers previously described <xref rid="b41-wjem-18-743" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> and noted by our participants. Indeed, a recent systematic review noted that interventions designed to improve post-ED follow-up have variable effectiveness depending on the capacity and willingness of the local primary care network to accommodate ED patients. <xref rid="b42-wjem-18-743" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> It is also possible that although this intervention had a significant impact on patient engagement, it did not motivate individuals to attend follow-up doctor visits if they were not already inclined to do so.</p></sec><sec><title>LIMITATIONS</title><p>Among this study&#x02019;s limitations was the small pilot-sample size. Despite the small sample, statistically significant between-group differences in patient engagement were detected and the mixed-methods design allowed us to confirm quantitative findings through in-depth interviews. Second, the pre-pilot increase in follow-up doctor visits observed in hospitalized patients was not detected. Our study may have been underpowered to detect smaller but potentially clinically meaningful increases in post-ED outpatient follow-up visits. In addition, patients may have attempted but were unsuccessful in scheduling post-ED outpatient follow-up visits because of busy clinic schedules. This intervention was conducted in two EDs and the results may not generalize to other settings. In addition, PAM scores fluctuate over time and this study captures only two time points. <xref rid="b7-wjem-18-743" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> However, the RCT design and DID approach suggests the observed between-group differences were a true &#x0201c;intervention&#x0201d; effect rather than chance occurrence. Finally, the PAM is proprietary, is not available for use without a license and may not be practical as a clinical tool in the time-sensitive, ED setting.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Patient engagement in chronically ill older patients with limited health literacy was highest at the time of an ED encounter and fell in the following weeks. Qualitative findings confirm and extend these findings, demonstrating that patients&#x02019; decisions to visit the ED are the result of engaged decision-making. Our data suggest that an ED initiated coaching intervention reduced the degree of disengagement in healthcare after the ED visit. According to the National Quality Forum, &#x0201c;improved management of transitions of care into and out of the ED has the potential to improve person-centered care, quality, and cost efficiency.&#x0201d; <xref rid="b43-wjem-18-743" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Policy makers and health system managers should consider ED-initiated interventions like this to improve ED-to-home transitions and engagement in high-risk and hard-to-reach ED populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="s1-wjem-18-743"><media xlink:href="wjem-18-743-s001.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e627" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors wish to acknowledge the dedicated teams at the Northeast Florida Area Agency on Aging and Disability Resource Center (Elder Source), as well as the Mid-Florida Area Agency on Aging (Elder Options).</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="fn1-wjem-18-743"><p><italic>Section Editor:</italic> Mark I.
