Patients with type 2 diabetes demonstrate a lack of hypothalamic neuronal response after glucose ingestion, which is suggested to be an underlying cause of the disease. In this study, we assessed whether intranasal insulin can be used to enhance neuronal hypothalamic responses to glucose ingestion. In a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled 4-double cross-over experiment, hypothalamic activation was measured in young non- diabetic subjects by determining blood-oxygen-level dependent MRI signals over 30&#x02009;minutes before and after ingestion of 75&#x02009;g glucose dissolved in 300&#x02009;ml water, under intranasal insulin or placebo condition. Glucose ingestion under placebo condition lead to an average 1.4% hypothalamic BOLD decrease, under insulin condition the average response to glucose was a 2.2% decrease. Administration of water did not affect the hypothalamic BOLD responses. Intranasal insulin did not change circulating glucose and insulin levels. Still, circulating glucose levels showed a significant dampening effect on the BOLD response and insulin levels a significant strengthening effect. Our data provide proof of concept for future experiments testing the potential of intranasal application of insulin to ameliorate defective homeostatic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Worldwide, there has been a rapid increase in the number of patients who have type 2 diabetes mellitus. Type 2 diabetes, found in &#x0003e;90% of all cases of diabetes, is characterized by insulin resistance and a defective secretion of insulin. For several decades, glucose homeostasis was assumed to be regulated primarily via peripheral mechanisms and centered around insulin produced by pancreatic islet cells and its effects on suppression of hepatic glucose production and, stimulation of glucose uptake by adipose tissue and muscle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Recent data however demonstrated that the brain also plays a pivotal role in glucose regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. A key brain area that is involved in glucose homeostasis is the hypothalamus, which regulates metabolic homeostasis via its reciprocal projections to other brain regions and the periphery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The hypothalamus senses, integrates and co-ordinates circulating metabolic cues, thereby aiding regulation of body weight and feeding behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Insulin, a signal reflecting energy availability and reserves, provides direct negative feedback to hypothalamic nuclei that control energy and glucose homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Previous studies have clearly shown that insulin receptors and insulin signaling in the hypothalamus is vital in the regulation on glucose and energy metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Studies on the role of the brain in glucose regulation in humans have been facilitated by non-invasive techniques such as measurement of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) brain responses, which allows quantification of brain activities over time during functional MRI studies. BOLD MRI contrast is a reflection of hemodynamic changes associated with neuronal activity due to changes in local concentrations of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. These BOLD changes can be measured in the hypothalamus, in response to glucose or to other stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In healthy men, a prolonged, dose-dependent decrease in hypothalamic BOLD signal was observed in response to glucose ingestion, showing adaptability of the hypothalamus to nutrient ingestion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Conversely, in patients with type 2 diabetes, a lack of significant decrease in BOLD signal was observed in response to glucose ingestion, implying diabetes- induced failure to inhibit hypothalamic neuronal activity in response to glucose ingestion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Interestingly, in patients with type 2 diabetes, this absent hypothalamic response normalized after a 4-day very-low-calorie diet, indicating that hypothalamic dysfunction to glucose sensing is potentially reversible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">We hypothesize that deficits in central insulin action play a role in defective hypothalamic gluco-regulatory responses and that increasing central insulin levels may potentiate brain responses to glucose. Earlier studies have shown that insulin, and other compounds, can be non-invasively delivered to the CSF and cross the brain barrier via the intranasal route, without spilling over to the periphery, allowing for a specific increase in central insulin levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Several studies have shown that intranasal insulin has an effect on various hypothalamic functions, indicating that the hypothalamus is a target for and is reached by intranasal aplicaition of insulin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled cross-over experiment, we aimed to investigate the hypothesis that intranasal insulin application may potentiate the BOLD response to glucose ingestion in the hypothalamus in young healthy volunteers. First, we applied insulin or placebo using a customized nasal atomizer. Thereafter hypothalamic BOLD signals were measured&#x000a0;for 30 minutes before, during and&#x000a0; after ingestion of 75&#x02009;g glucose dissolved in water, or plain water being the control condition.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subject characteristics</title><p id="Par4">The characteristics of study subjects are summarised in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

The majornew finding of our study is that the decrease in fMRI BOLD response in the hypothalamus after glucose ingestionwas augmented after intranasal application of insulin. Furthermore, we found that circulating glucose and insulin levels did not change after intranasal application of insulin compared to placebo indicating that there was no spill over to the systemic circulation and we were able to target the CNS specifically. Nevertheless, in line with the absence of reduction in hypothalamic BOLD response to glucose previously observed in patients with diabetes type 2 with increased circulating glucose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, we found that in healthy volunteers higher plasma glucose level also lead to reduced hypothalamic BOLD responses.</p><p id="Par12">The hypothalamus plays a key role in the central regulation of food intake and energy metabolism, and specific hypothalamic nuclei are critical for the control of peripheral metabolism by insulin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. We found intranasal insulin administration augmented the decrease in hypothalamic BOLD response to glucose ingestion, with an average decrease in the BOLD signal of 1.2% after intranasal placebo applications and 2.2% when the glucose ingestion was preceded by intranasal application of insulin. Indicating that central insulin can affect the hypothalamic function to maintain glucose homeostasis as is suggested by earlier studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Among patients with type 2 diabetes, the glucose-induced reduction in hypothalamic BOLD signal was absent, suggesting that glucose ingestion failed to inhibit hypothalamic neuronal activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Considering that we found the decreased BOLD signal to ingested glucose was potentiated after intranasal insulin, future experiments might be aimed at testing the potential of intranasally applied insulin to rescue the defective BOLD response that was observed in diabetic patients. Future studies could also be targeted at performing these experiments under conditions of increased adiposity, such as obesity, which has also been implicated to have effects on the hypothalamic response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par13">One limitation of this study is that it was done only in male volunteers and it can be speculated that a sex dimorphism is present since it is known that there are several sex-specific differences in energy metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. This decreases the generalizability of our findings. Another limitation is the indirect measurement of neural activity in the targeted brain area using BOLD measurement technique, as it is unclear what direct functional consequences these signals reflect without additional measurements of downstream functional effects. Furthermore, other pathways could also affect the hypothalamic response to glucose besides the direct sensing of glucose by the hypothalamus. Other studies have shown that dopaminergic pathways also respond to energy ingestion and could thus have an effect on the hypothalamic response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. To determine this interplay BOLD measurements in the limbic system might thus be useful in future studies. The strength of this study is the methodological rigor and the fact that the participants were their own controls, thus ruling out possible dilution of effects that could have been introduced due to differences in individual phenotypes.</p><p id="Par14">Summarily, using a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled cross- over proof of concept experiment, we studied the effects of intranasal insulin application on blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals as proxy for neuronal activity in the key brain area of the hypothalamus that has been implicated in responses to metabolic cues. We found that intranasal insulin augmented the decrease in fMRI BOLD signal in response to glucose ingestion in the hypothalamus. Further research is needed to investigate whether intranasal application of insulin has similar effects on hypothalamic BOLD responses in patients with type 2 diabetes, and what the functional consequences are.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="Par15">The study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of Leiden University Medical Centre under protocol P13.164 and the Dutch competent authority (Centrale Commissie Mensgebonden Onderzoek (CCMO)) under protocol code number NL45043.058.13.

Concealment of treatment allocation was ensured by delivery of experimental medication in same type of vial that was prepared and re-labelled by the hospital pharmacy.

We performed a structural mid brain T1&#x000a0;scan (single slice scan, repetition time 550 ms, echo time 10 ms, field of view 208&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;208 mm, voxel size&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.52&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;0.52&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;14 mm, scan time 1.14&#x02009;min) and a high resolution mid brain single slice fMRI scan (repetition time 120 ms, echo time 30 ms, field of view 208&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;208 mm, voxel size&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.81&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;0.81&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;14 mm, scan time 30&#x02009;min, 700 dynamic volumes). Both of these single slice mid-sagittal scans were planned using third ventricle, the corpus callosum and brain midline as landmarks. Data was pre-processed as described in previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Data was averaged for each set of 4 subsequent volumes, reducing the 700 dynamic scans to 175. The hypothalamus was segmented manually, using the mid brain single slice anatomical image as a guide for delineation. Manual segmentation was performed on the middle dynamic volume of the fMRI scan as described previously using the anterior commissure, the optic chiasm and the mammillary bodies as anatomical landmarks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Example delineation of the hypothalamus, with the anatomical landmarks used for delineation, is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. To correct for scanner drift, all hypothalamic BOLD values were corrected using an internal reference ROI in the grey matter superior of the genu of the corpus callosum.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Segementation of the hypothalamus region of interest (ROI). For the hypothalamus ROI (A), the optic chiasm (1), the mammillary bodies (2), the thalamus (3) the anterior commissure (4) and the top of the cerebral aqueduct (5) were used as landmarks. The reference ROI was drawn superior of the genu to the corpus callosum (6) in the grey matter.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2017_13818_Fig3_HTML" id="d29e657"/></fig>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p id="Par20">For statistical analyses, Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software for windows (version 22.0) was used. Graphs were made using GraphPad Prism version 5 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Descriptive statistics were used to summarise the characteristics of both study groups. All fMRI results are reported as percentage BOLD change, relative to baseline; 0&#x02013;8&#x02009;minute BOLD response before drinking of the test solution. For presentation purposes, the individual 175 dynamic scans time points were pooled into &#x02018;per minute&#x02019; data points: The first 8&#x02009;minutes were considered baseline BOLD response. Data from minute 8 through 11 were omitted from the analysis due to non-physiologic excessive BOLD changes caused by swallowing of the drink. Statistical analysis of the differences in effect between the study stimuli on the overall BOLD response was performed by a single linear mixed model analysis using the study stimulus as a fixed effect, time point as a covariate and subject per occasion as a random factor using the total time series. Differences in treatment effect was deemed significant at p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05. To test for treatment effects over time the same model was used per two minute intervals instead of the entire series. P-values for the analysis per two minute intervals are reported corrected for multiple comparison with a Bonferonni correction of eight (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.00625). To test for the influence of blood glucose and insulin levels and the HOMA-IR index on the response to the study stimuli, additional mixed model analyses were performed, in which these values were added as covariates. These effects of glucose and insulin on the BOLD response are reported as estimated effects in percentage BOLD change.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Data availability</title><p id="Par21">The datasets generated during and/or analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Anna M. van Opstal and Abimbola A.
