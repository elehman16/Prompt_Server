Fear is influenced or exacerbated by a myriad of personal, social, and health system factors including a maternity milieu characterised by increasing rates of obstetric interventions.

</p><p id="Par19">The time frame for this economic evaluation was the duration of pregnancy, with analysis conducted from a health system perspective. The number of caesarean sections prevented (either planned or unplanned) was chosen as the focal outcome of the cost-effectiveness analysis because this was the main clinical outcome produced by a reduction in fear of birth. Increasing caesarean section rates are a large driver of health system costs, being more resource intensive than vaginal births [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Women were surveyed at 6&#x000a0;weeks postpartum about their health service use during pregnancy. All reported health service use during the antenatal period up to the time of birth were included.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par28">Women with high childbirth fear were randomised to receive a brief psycho-education intervention from midwives who had completed a training program developed for this purpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. We have previously reported that in fearful women, two antenatal psycho-education sessions with a midwife reduced high and severe score levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and recommended that regardless of severity, all women fearful of birth should receive individualised support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Additionally we identified that psycho-education provided by midwives resulted in a clinically important 8% reduction in caesarean section numbers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The findings of our current analysis adds to this evidence by identifying the minimal cost incurred by the health system in offering brief psycho-education by midwives. In all, the incremental cost of preventing a caesarean section was AU$145 using this intervention. The cost saving per avoided caesarean section could be between AUS$2449 to $5750.48. Refer to Table <xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table">8</xref> for costs to the health care system per birth mode.<table-wrap id="Tab8"><label>Table 8</label><caption><p>Cost to the healthcare system of different types of birth, based on National Efficient Price weights and Australian Refined Diagnosis-Related Group Codes, 2013</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Birth Type</th><th>Cost to healthcare system</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Unassisted vaginal birth</td><td>AUS $5000.81</td></tr><tr><td>Assisted vaginal birth</td><td>AUS $8301.86</td></tr><tr><td>Caesarean section</td><td>AUS $10,751.29</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>
</p><p id="Par29">Our findings are similar to those of Rouhe and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] who also conducted a randomised controlled trial testing the effect of six psycho-education group sessions with a psychologist on birth outcome in a group of Finnish primiparous women. These researchers reported improved vaginal birth rates without increasing costs compared to conventional treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Health system differences between Finland and Australia make direct comparison difficult, as do the differences in inclusion criteria between the studies. Our results however, are reassuring and demonstrate that with minimal additional cost to health services women can receive individualised midwifery support that improves emotional health, confidence, and increases vaginal birth rates in these women.</p><p id="Par30">A search of the literature revealed only one other study reporting on the cost of treating childbirth fear. Sjogren and Thomassen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], Swedish researchers, provided individualised psychological and obstetric support to 100 women, 68% of whom originally requested caesarean section. Of these women, 57% achieved a vaginal birth. The authors argued that the achieved reduction in caesarean section rates associated with counselling fearful pregnant women was cost neutral. Similarly our work demonstrated that following antenatal midwife psycho-education, women had twice the odds of achieving a vaginal birth, and that midwife psycho-education was cost effective from a health service perspective. With this intervention, five women were required to be treated, for a total cost of AUS$145, to prevent one caesarean section. In addition this outcome raises the prospect of longer term cost benefits potentially impacting on the number of women who would otherwise have a repeat caesarean section in a subsequent pregnancy. The four reported costing studies to date, including our study, show regardless of how costs are attributed, providing psycho-education treatment to women who are fearful of birth does not increase costs to health services and is likely to provide health services with cumulative savings over time.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Implications for practice</title><p id="Par31">Consistent with earlier studies indicating fearful women are more likely to experience a caesarean section, we found fear scores at 36&#x000a0;weeks gestation to be predictive of the woman&#x02019;s birth mode, with higher scores associated to caesarean section. A recent cohort study across six European countries reported that incremental increases to antenatal fear scores are associated with the woman&#x02019;s subsequent birth mode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Interestingly, in our study the highest scores recorded at 36&#x000a0;weeks of pregnancy were by women who spontaneously laboured prior to their planned caesarean section. This is an important finding alerting maternity providers to the level of preparation and support women may require to reassure them of a safe outcome, and explaining that planning a caesarean section alone is not a solution to their fear. Swedish experts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] have previously advised that prescription or agreement for a caesarean section does not alleviate women&#x02019;s fear. Our findings highlight the need for clear birth planning and an exploration of women&#x02019;s understanding of alternate pathways that might occur leading up to the birth. This preparation allows women to anticipate and plan for possible eventualities. One aspect of the BELIEF psycho-education framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] was for midwives to encourage women to envisage how they wanted their birth to be and also what it might look like if other factors impacted and changed their desired course. Taking this approach assisted women to think through strategies they felt they could manage whilst also providing them with a &#x02018;Plan B&#x02019;, and in some cases a &#x02018;Plan C&#x02019; if needed.</p><p id="Par32">The positive effects of this midwife intervention on women&#x02019;s reduced fear levels, higher vaginal birth rates and minimal cost to health organisations to reduce caesarean section rates makes investment in midwife psycho-education attractive to health services. Additionally, combining psycho-education for women with childbirth fear and cost effective midwifery caseload care is likely to produce even higher benefits for maternity service organisations and for women with childbirth fear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. To assist screening of women with childbirth fear the validated two item Fear of Birth scale (FOBs) could also be used, as it is time-efficient for clinicians, and aligns to the widely used and accepted W-DEQ A tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Limitations and strengths</title><p id="Par33">Costs were attributed to health service use and therefore women&#x02019;s personal out of pocket expenditure were not known. Records of service use was reliant on women&#x02019;s self-report; however women carry a personal pregnancy health record and were not reliant on recall alone. We cannot be certain of the generalisability of the findings as approximately 30% of Australian women receive private obstetric care. We recruited from public hospitals only. Also only women who spoke English were included leaving non-English speaking women marginalised and; women of lower education and income were more likely to drop out of the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Lastly, despite a number of engagement strategies only 54% of women returned data at 6&#x000a0;weeks following birth, although this rate is comparable to similar studies involving fearful women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">Although the costs reported from this study indicate the potential for significant cost savings as a result of reduced caesarean sections, a previous study reporting the total costs of this intervention, including the costs of birth mode, did not report a significant difference in total costs between the two arms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This non-significant result may be due to a low sample size yielding insufficient power to detect a difference in cost between the two groups, with the study being powered to detect a difference in fear of birth scores.</p><p id="Par35">The strength of the work, however, is that participants were enrolled from three hospitals allowing for sample diversity. We also did not place exclusions on women&#x02019;s participation in respect of obstetric risk (for example women of any parity, singleton and multiple pregnancies, any type of previous birth). In addition Australian women do not have routine access to treatment for childbirth fear that is available in some other countries. We can be confident, therefore, that the differences between groups were a result of inclusion in the study and were unlikely to be attributable to an alternate childbirth fear intervention. Furthermore, despite women being randomised by a computerised system, women in the psycho-education group (intervention) had higher W-DEQ A scores than controls at baseline making the study result more encouraging.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par36">Following antenatal midwife psycho-education for women with high levels of childbirth fear, vaginal birth rates improved and caesarean section rates decreased compared with women who received standard antenatal care and a decision-aid booklet. For every five women who received midwife counselling, one caesarean section was averted. The incremental healthcare cost to prevent one caesarean section using this intervention was only AUS$145. Based on the result of this study it is recommended that maternity services invest in and support midwives to deliver psycho-education to women with childbirth fear. This will afford fearful women an opportunity to develop positive feelings of anticipation for their birth and subsequently improve their chance of achieving vaginal birth.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AUS</term><def><p id="Par6">Australia</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BELIEF</term><def><p id="Par7">Birth Emotions and Looking to Improve Expectant Fear</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CS</term><def><p id="Par8">Caesarean section</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FOBs</term><def><p id="Par9">Fear of Birth scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICER</term><def><p id="Par10">Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NNT</term><def><p id="Par11">Number needed to treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PEER</term><def><p id="Par12">Population expected event risk</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>W-DEQ A</term><def><p id="Par13">Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire &#x02013; Antenatal</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par37">The BELIEF study was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC Grant ID APP1025099).
