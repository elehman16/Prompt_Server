exercise combined with ultrasound for patients with temporomandibular joint disorders.
[Subjects and Methods] This study enrolled 23 female and 15 male patients who were divided
randomly into two groups. The home exercise group performed a home exercise program
consisting of an exercise program and patient education, and the home exercise combined
with ultrasound group received ultrasound therapy in addition to the home exercise
program. Pain intensity was evaluated using a visual analogue scale. Pain free maximum
mouth opening was evaluated at baseline and 2 weeks after the treatment. [Results] There
was no difference between the two groups in baseline values. After the treatment, the
visual analogue scale decreased and pain free maximum mouth opening scores improved
significantly in each group. Additionally, both values were higher in the home exercise
combined with ultrasound group than in the home exercise group. [Conclusion] The
combination of home exercise combined with ultrasound appears to be more effective at
providing pain relief and increasing mouth opening than does home exercise alone for
patients with temporomandibular joint disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Temporomandibular joint disorders</kwd><kwd>Ultrasound therapy</kwd><kwd>Home exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) include conditions affecting the masticatory musculature,
temporomandibular joint (TMJ), and associated structures<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. TMD affects more than 25% of the general population<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The most common signs and symptoms of TMD
are joint sounds, limited mouth opening, and muscle and joint tenderness. A number of
studies have examined physical therapy for TMJ dysfunction and pain, including massage,
electrotherapy, active exercise, and manipulation therapy<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Physical therapy reduces pain and inflammation and improves mouth
function<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Suggested behavioural
treatments and patient education include self-awareness of the aggravating factors and
lifestyle modification<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The relaxing effect of ultrasound (US) therapy on bone, tendon (ligament), and muscle
tissue has been shown experimentally<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.
However, US treatment alone has been reported to have no significant effect on TMJ disorders
in a few trials, and there is insufficient evidence regarding its effect on TMD<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. To our knowledge, no studies have compared
the combination of US and home exercise therapy (HE+US) versus home exercise (HE) therapy
alone. Therefore, we investigated the effectiveness of HE and HE+US on pain and on pain-free
maximum mouth opening (MMO) in patients with TMD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Initially, the study enrolled 44 patients complaining of pain in the TMJ region during
mandibular movements. Category 1A and 1B unilateral TMD were diagnosed according to the
Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD used by Department of Physical Medicine and
Rehabilitation<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The local ethics committee of Harran University approved this study. Informed consent was
obtained from all patients before treatment. Subjects with a history of trauma to the TMJ or
upper back, inflammatory disorders or other rheumatic diseases, neurological and psychiatric
disorders, other problems related to the masticatory system, or a history of TMD drug use or
physiotherapy treatment within the last 3 months were excluded. Following a detailed
physical examination, a standard evaluation form was completed for each patient. Demographic
information was recorded, such as age, sex, occupation, education level, pain duration, and
affected side.</p><p>A complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and routine biochemical tests were
performed. In both groups, disc displacement was assessed based on the physical examination
and X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the initial visit.</p><p>Patients were allocated randomly to the HE or HE+US group. The HE group received only HE,
which involved patient education and exercise therapy. The patients were informed about
techniques for dealing with TMJ pain through lifestyle changes, coping mechanisms, and
ergonomic regulation. They were given an exercise program consisting of slow active and
passive mouth opening and closing exercises, isometric mouth exercises, mouth stretching
exercises, and resistive mouth exercises, with each exercise to be performed for 6 seconds
with 10 repetitions.</p><p>The exercises were performed twice a day for 4 weeks. The HE+US patients received US to the
TMJ region, in five sessions per week for 4 weeks in addition to the HE program. US (3
minutes, 0.8&#x02013;1 Watt/cm<sup>2</sup>) was applied to the TMJ region and masticatory
muscles.</p><p>In each group, the outcome measurements were made at baseline and 2 weeks after the
treatment. Subjectively perceived TMJ pain was assessed using visual analogue scale (VAS)
(0&#x02013;100&#x02005;mm), and mouth opening was assessed as pain-free maximum mouth opening (MMO)<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS
15.0, Chicago, IL, USA). The normal distribution of the data was assessed using the
Kolmogoro-Smirnov test, histograms, and q-q graphics. The groups were compared with the
independent two-sample t-tests and the Mann-Whitney U-test for quantitative variables and
with &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests for qualitative variables. Within-group comparisons were performed
using the dependent two-sample t-tests and the Wilcoxon test. Data are described as
frequency (percentage), mean &#x000b1; standard deviation, or median (25&#x02013;75th percentiles). A value
of p &#x0003c; 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Initially, 50 consecutive patients who were seen in our Physical Medicine and
Rehabilitation outpatient clinic were considered for this study.</p><p>At the initial visit, six patients refused treatment, and the remaining 44 patients were

treatment, and the decrease in the VAS scores was greater in the HE+US group than in the HE
group. Furthermore, the pain-free MMO in both groups increased after treatment and the
increase was also greater in the HE+US group.</p><p>Structural, behavioural, psychological, and environmental factors play an important role in
the aetiology of TMD. Therefore, the treatment of patients with TMD should be considered
from multiple perspectives<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. A
combination of drugs, physical therapy, patient education, occlusal splints, US, and surgery
treatments is used in the treatment of TMD<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Of these, physiotherapy alone and HE+US combination therapy is
often chosen because they are simple, non-invasive, and inexpensive compared with the other
treatments available for TMD pain and dysfunction.</p><p>A systematic review demonstrated that the use of active and passive oral exercises
decreased symptoms related to TMD<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Passive and active stretching exercises, isometric tension, and relaxation exercises are
effective at increasing mouth opening and improving mandibular movements. Exercise and
patient education are also beneficial in the treatment of TMD.</p><p>Another study found that a patient education program was more effective than an occlusal
splint for relieving the pain of patients with TMD<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Several authors have suggested posture exercises in the treatment of TMD. In our study, the
patients were instructed in posture and in active/passive oral exercises to treat their TMD.
Improvement in the VAS and pain-free MMO was observed after treatment in the HE group,
demonstrating that HE therapy is effective at relieving the symptoms of patients with
TMD.</p><p>Electrophysiological modalities, such as shortwave diathermy, US, laser, and transcutaneous
electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), are commonly used in clinical practice. US is used to
reduce inflammation, promote muscular relaxation, and increase blood flow. It has an
analgesic effect on bone and tendons which is elicited by increasing the temperature in
these tissues compared with surrounding tissue.</p><p>Gray et al. evaluated the effectiveness of short-wave diathermy, US, and laser treatments
for patients with TMD found that no method was superior to the others, but that these
modalities were significantly better than placebo treatment<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In another study, US alone had no significant effect on TMJ
disorders in trials, and evidence regarding the effect of US on TMD is lacking<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our study demonstrated that a combination
of US and HE therapies was superior to HE therapy alone.</p><p>In conclusion, adding US to an HE program may better improve the symptoms of patients with
TMD. Further longitudinal studies are warranted to evaluate the long-term effects of US
treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Okeson</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name></person-group>: Orofacial Pain: Guidelines for Assessment, Diagnosis, and Management.
