Current treatment is compression therapy; however, up to 50&#x000a0;% of ulcers remain unhealed after 2&#x000a0;years, and ulcer recurrence is common. New treatments are needed to address those wounds that are more challenging to heal. Targeting the inflammatory processes present in venous ulcers is a possible strategy. Limited evidence suggests that a daily dose of aspirin may be an effective adjunct to aid ulcer healing and reduce recurrence. The Aspirin in Venous Leg Ulcer study (ASPiVLU) will investigate whether 300-mg oral doses of aspirin improve time to healing.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This randomised, double-blinded, multicentre, placebo-controlled, clinical trial will recruit participants with venous leg ulcers from community settings and hospital outpatient wound clinics across Australia. Two hundred sixty-eight participants with venous leg ulcers will be randomised to receive either aspirin or placebo, in addition to compression therapy, for 24&#x000a0;weeks. The primary outcome is time to healing within 12&#x000a0;weeks. Secondary outcomes are ulcer recurrence, wound pain, quality of life and wellbeing, adherence to study medication, adherence to compression therapy, serum inflammatory markers, hospitalisations, and adverse events at 24&#x000a0;weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The ASPiVLU trial will investigate the efficacy and safety of aspirin as an adjunct to compression therapy to treat venous leg ulcers.

Age-related venous leg ulceration is the most common cause of lower limb ulceration in developed countries, with an overall prevalence between 1.65 and 1.74&#x000a0;% and substantially higher rates in adults of age 65 and older [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. These ulcers become chronic due to the underlying pathophysiology and are associated with pain and heavy exudate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In 2010, an estimated 400,000 Australians were treated for VLUs, translating into costs of more than AU$3 billion per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. People with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) are prone to developing VLUs on the lower legs, which can occur spontaneously or after minor trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Up to 70&#x000a0;% of VLUs will heal within 12&#x000a0;weeks if adequate compression is applied and patients adhere to compression treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. People with VLUs also often suffer from diabetes and obesity, further impacting the healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The natural history of ulceration is a cycle of healing and recurrence, which has considerable impact on an individual&#x02019;s health, quality of life, and socioeconomic costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Increasing life expectancy means that more people will be living with VLUs in the future, increasing the financial and healthcare burden of this already costly chronic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Current treatment of venous leg ulcers</title><p>Best practice VLU treatment is a firm graduated compression bandage to aid venous return [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This assists by reducing venous hypertension, enhancing venous return, and reducing peripheral oedema. Data shows that VLUs heal more quickly with compression than without [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Treatment inconsistencies regarding the bandage application and limited patient adherence to compression therapy have been identified as limiting factors to healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Many healed ulcers recur within 3&#x000a0;months of healing, possibly due to a prolonged inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Aspirin is a widely used and relatively well-tolerated drug. It has the potential to reduce inflammation via generalised COX inhibition.</p><p>Classical signs of inflammation have been observed in biopsies and plasma samples in experimental models of venous disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and evidence supports the hypothesis that, in humans, chronic venous disease is associated with the inflammatory cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The cascade begins with increased vascular permeability and progresses to the adhesion of leukocytes and platelets to the endothelium. Over time, increased cell apoptosis, degradation of the basement membrane and extracellular matrix proteins, and vascular restructuring of the venous varicosities occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. High-level evidence shows larger wounds of longer duration (&#x0003e;10&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup> and&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;12&#x000a0;months old) at the first visit have only a 20&#x000a0;% chance of healing by the 24th week of care, whereas a wound that is smaller than 10&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup> and has been present for less than 12&#x000a0;months has a better (70&#x000a0;%) chance of healing by 24&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A perpetual inflammatory state may contribute to difficult-to-heal chronic wounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. VLUs may achieve better healing and be less likely to occur due to anti-inflammatory effects if the compression bandage is used concomitantly with aspirin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aspirin as a novel treatment in VLUs</title><p>Aspirin has several actions potentially capable of influencing the progression of VLUs through the suppression of inflammation. It inhibits the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), thereby blocking the synthesis of several potent stimulators of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In vivo studies suggest that 300&#x000a0;mg aspirin suppresses inflammatory markers and may promote ulcer healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Aspirin also reduces prostaglandin-2 and thromboxane A2, which are involved in platelet aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The production of these compounds underpins part of the anti-inflammatory effect of aspirin, along with the potential to inhibit both leukocyte activation and platelet function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The effect of low-dose aspirin on serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), is not entirely clear at present. In one study of aspirin in people with VLUs, investigators reported increased fibrinogen and an increased coagulation rate, which increased the healing rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Some publications report little or no effect on the serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, while others show reduced serum IL-6 and TNF-a with 2&#x000a0;weeks treatment using 300&#x000a0;mg/day aspirin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Previous studies of aspirin in venous leg ulcers</title><p>Two small, randomised, controlled trials (RCTs) suggest aspirin may be effective in speeding ulcer healing and may reduce the ulcer recurrence, although the quality of this evidence is low. An RCT conducted in the United Kingdom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20) reported that daily oral administration of aspirin (300&#x000a0;mg) with compression decreased the time to ulcer healing (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) and the proportion of participants healed when compared to placebo with compression bandaging over a 4-month period. Thirty-eight per cent of the aspirin participants reported complete healing compared with 0&#x000a0;% in the placebo group (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.007). Improvement, assessed by a reduction in wound size, occurred in 52&#x000a0;% of the aspirin group compared with 26&#x000a0;% with placebo (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.007). The potential benefits of aspirin as an adjunct to compression were identified, but the sample size was small, and the mechanism by which aspirin improved healing or the effect on recurrence was not reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A more recent Spanish RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;51) compared daily administration of aspirin (300&#x000a0;mg) in addition to the use of a compression bandage with compression alone over a 5-month period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Little difference was observed in the complete healing between the groups (21/28 aspirin and 17/23 compression alone); however, the average time to healing was shorter (12&#x000a0;weeks in the aspirin group versus 22&#x000a0;weeks in the compression-only group), and the average time to recurrence was longer in the aspirin group (39&#x000a0;days (SD 6.0) for aspirin versus 16.3&#x000a0;days (SD 7.5) for compression alone). No information regarding the placebo was reported.</p><p>The ASPiVLU study in Australia will investigate the effects of aspirin in people with VLUs in a large, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. We have selected a daily dose of 300&#x000a0;mg aspirin, as current evidence was derived from studies using this dose.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study objectives</title><p>The primary objective is to determine whether daily aspirin (300&#x000a0;mg) as an adjunct to compression improves the time to healing of the target ulcer in a 12-week treatment period.</p><p>The secondary objective is to determine the effects of aspirin on ulcer recurrence, wound pain, quality of life and wellbeing, adherence to study medication, adherence to compression therapy, serum inflammatory markers, hospitalisations, and adverse events at 24&#x000a0;weeks.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Study design</title><p>ASPiVLU is a randomised, double-blinded, multicentre, placebo-controlled, clinical trial to determine the clinical effectiveness of aspirin as an adjunct to compression in healing venous leg ulcers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Study setting and participants</title><p>The study population consists of adult patients living in Australia.

Patients will have the opportunity to discuss participation with research staff prior to enrolment. Written informed consent will be obtained from each participant prior to randomisation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Screening assessment</title><p>After giving consent, the patients will be screened at wound clinics to verify eligibility. Eligibility will be confirmed by the wound clinic doctor. Prior to randomisation, baseline data, including age, gender, smoking status, ethnicity and employment status, medical history and current medication use, will be recorded. A physical examination by a wound clinic consultant will include an assessment of the target ulcer, measurement of the wound surface area, and digital photography of the wound.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Intervention</title><p>Study participants will be allocated to either active treatment with aspirin at a dose of 300&#x000a0;mg daily or inactive placebo. Study tablets are enteric-coated, un-scored, white tablets with identical appearance, provided by Bayer Pharma AG for the ASPiVLU trial. Participants will be advised to take one tablet each morning approximately half an hour before other medications to avoid potential drug interactions. Participants will continue to take the study medication daily for 24&#x000a0;weeks, regardless of whether or not the target ulcer heals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Compression therapy</title><p>All participants will be treated with compression therapy (the system of choice will be guided by clinician discretion and patient preference) for 12&#x000a0;weeks or until complete healing of the target ulcer occurs. Details of the compression type will be noted in the case report form. Once ulcer healing is achieved, the participants will be fitted with below-knee compression stockings that deliver between 23&#x000a0;mmHg to 32&#x000a0;mmHg compression at the ankle to prevent ulcer recurrence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Patients will be randomly assigned to aspirin or placebo via an electronic data capture system (EDC).

Randomisation codes will be allocated via a password-protected system.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Allocation concealment and implementation</title><p>The study medication will be packaged in identical containers. Each container will be pre-labelled (by an independent drug-packaging group contracted to provide the study medication) with a study identifier according to the randomisation schedule. Allocation will be stratified by wound clinic and wound size as measured by the Margolis index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The Margolis index is a prognostic score for venous ulcer healing derived from dichotomous categorisations of the ulcer area and duration of the current ulcer. Hence, stratification aims to avoid baseline imbalances in the ulcer size and duration, which are highly predictive of outcome. Stratification based on clinic site will avoid variance in any baseline characteristics related to the geographical location or local clinical practice. The study investigators and the research nurses distributing the medication and assessing outcomes will remain blind to the treatment allocation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Un-blinding</title><p>Un-blinding will occur in the event of a clinical emergency in which the knowledge of the medication taken is essential for the participant&#x02019;s clinical management.

Participants will be asked to allow measurement of the target ulcer at routine treatment visits for ascertainment of outcomes. Participants unwilling to continue participation during the follow-up period will be asked for permission to allow investigators to collect information from their medical records.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Follow-up of participants &#x02018;off protocol&#x02019;</title><p>&#x02018;Off protocol&#x02019; is defined as those <italic>study participants who cease trial medications on clinical grounds or commence on aspirin therapy for other reasons</italic>. This may be short-term or for the remainder of the study. Regardless of the decision to continue with study medication, these participants will be asked to participate in all scheduled follow-up contacts, as if they were maintaining full participation. Those who are unwilling or unable to do this will be asked to agree to phone call or mail follow-up, and/or permission for study staff to continue surveillance of their clinical records.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Sample size</title><p>We estimate that 268 participants will be required. Based on a previous compression bandaging study, we expect 50&#x000a0;% of ulcers to have healed at 12&#x000a0;weeks in the placebo group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Aspirin is expected to increase this additively by 20&#x000a0;%; that is, we expect 70&#x000a0;% of the aspirin group to be healed at 12&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Twelve-week survival rates of 0.5 and 0.3 in the placebo and aspirin groups, respectively, translate to cumulative hazard rates of 0.7 and 1.2, respectively, and a hazard ratio of 1.74. For 90&#x000a0;% power to detect this hazard ratio in a two-sided (alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05) test for time to healing, analysed by a log-rank test, we require 121 people per group. Allowing for 10&#x000a0;% loss to follow-up, we will recruit <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;134 participants per group. With this sample size, and the same assumptions about percentage healed, we have 87&#x000a0;% power for a two-sample test of the proportion healed at 12&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>For the secondary outcome of healed at 12&#x000a0;weeks and recurrence free at 24&#x000a0;weeks, we anticipate 60/121 (approximately 50&#x000a0;%) in the placebo group to be healed at 12&#x000a0;weeks and 85/121 (approximately 70&#x000a0;%) in the aspirin group to be healed. Of these participants with healed ulcers, in the placebo group, we expect 24 (40&#x000a0;% of 60) to recur by 24&#x000a0;weeks from baseline, i.e. 36/121 to be healed at 12&#x000a0;weeks and recurrence free at 24&#x000a0;weeks. We have 90&#x000a0;% power to detect a difference between the placebo and aspirin groups if the proportion healed at 12&#x000a0;weeks and recurrence free at 24&#x000a0;weeks in the aspirin group is 51&#x000a0;% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;62) of 121 participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Data management and statistical analyses</title><p>Results from the trial assessments will be recorded in the electronic case report forms (CRF) via an electronic data capture (EDC) system. The REDCap EDC system is a secure, web-based system that is available for free to institutional partners (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.projectredcap.org">www.projectredcap.org</ext-link>). Each clinical site will have a unique password and will enter data directly into the EDC system via a tablet supplied by the ASPiVLU trial.</p><p>The primary and secondary outcomes will be analysed according to intention-to-treat principles, i.e. by the treatment to which they were randomised. The primary outcome will be analysed with a log-rank test to compare the time to healing, up to the 12-week time point, i.e. with censoring at 12&#x000a0;weeks, between the two randomised treatment groups. A secondary analysis of the primary hypothesis will use logistic regression to compare between groups the proportion of participants healed by 12&#x000a0;weeks. The secondary outcome, the proportion of patients healed by 12&#x000a0;weeks and remaining recurrence-free at 24&#x000a0;weeks, will be compared between the two groups using logistic regression. The levels of inflammatory markers in the plasma will be compared between groups using a linear mixed model with a random effect for participants to allow for correlation among each individual&#x02019;s repeat measures over time, adjustment for the biomarker&#x02019;s level at randomisation, and an interaction between the time since randomisation and the randomisation group. The secondary outcomes of pain score and EQ-5D-5L will be analysed in linear mixed models, with a random effect for participant, an adjustment for the measure at randomisation, and an interaction between the time since randomisation and the randomisation group.</p><p>A secondary set of analyses will be performed to adjust for two predictors of healing: (1) ulcer area and ulcer duration at baseline and (2) any baseline characteristics that are found to be imbalanced between the groups to the extent of a 0.25 standard deviation difference in means (quantitative measures) or an odds ratio of 1.5 (binary measures). For time to healing these secondary analyses will use a Cox proportional hazards regression.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Ethics approval</title><p>Full ethics approval has been granted from Alfred Health (HREC/14/Alfred/2 (Project 146/14)), Monash University (Project CF14/2106 - 2014001084), and Austin Health (HREC/14/Alfred/2 Project/15/Austin/55). Recruitment in any individual centre will not commence until local approvals are obtained.

ASPiVLU will allow us to answer the question of whether daily active treatment with 300&#x000a0;mg aspirin improves time to healing of venous leg ulcers. The ASPiVLU sample will be sourced from four states in Australia, thereby providing a broad range of representation from the community. We will provide data on the efficacy and safety of aspirin in this population for a 24-week study period. Low-dose aspirin therapy may improve time to healing and decrease the number of recurrent VLU episodes. If proved effective, the low cost of aspirin therapy as an adjunct to compression would make it an affordable preventive agent for people with VLUs in all countries.</p><sec id="Sec34"><title>Other ongoing aspirin studies</title><p>Two other randomised trials investigating aspirin in people with venous leg ulcers are ongoing: the AVURT (Aspirin for Venous Ulcers: Randomised Trial NCT02333123) and the Aspirin4VLU (Low-Dose Aspirin for Venous Leg Ulcers NTC 02158806). Chief investigators of the currently recruiting aspirin RCTs have formed the Aspirin for Venous Leg Ulcers Collaborative (AVLUC).
