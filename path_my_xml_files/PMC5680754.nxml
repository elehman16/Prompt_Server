Family physicians are the most common first point of contact in the healthcare system for people with back pain, but physiotherapists (PTs) may be able to support the primary care team through evidence-based primary care. A cluster randomized trial is needed to determine the clinical, health system, and societal impact of a primary care model that integrates physiotherapists at the first visit for people with back pain. Prior to conducting a future fully powered cluster randomized trial, we need to demonstrate feasibility of the methods.

</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par5">This pilot cluster randomized controlled trial will enroll four sites and randomize them to implement a new PT-led primary care model for back pain or a usual physician-led primary care model. All adults booking a primary care visit for back pain will be invited to participate. Feasibility outcomes will include: recruitment and retention rates, completeness of assessment data, PT training participation and confidence after training, and PT treatment fidelity. Secondary outcomes will include the clinical, health system, cost, and process outcomes planned for the future fully powered cluster trial. Results will be analyzed and reported descriptively and qualitatively. To explore perspectives of both HCPs and patients, we will conduct semi-structured qualitative interviews with patients and focus groups with HCPs from participants in the PT-led primary care sites.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par6">If this pilot demonstrates feasibility, a fully powered trial will provide evidence that has the potential to transform primary care for back pain.

The burden of back pain on the Canadian healthcare system is further evidenced by frequent healthcare utilization. The Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) suggests that low back pain (LBP) was the sixth most common reason for emergency department visits in 2010&#x02013;2011, with over 150,000 visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Back pain is also associated with a large number of costly and unnecessary specialist consultations and diagnostic procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Back pain is the fifth most common reason for visiting a primary care physician [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. While physicians are the most common first point of contact in the healthcare system for people with back pain, questions remain whether better patient outcomes could be achieved by involving other healthcare providers (HCPs) within the primary care team. For example, the use of physiotherapists (PTs) at the first visit might assist in the delivery of evidence-based treatments, and greater use of pharmacists might help prevent current increases in opioid prescription. Hartvigsen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] argue for new primary care models to support physicians based on physicians only receiving a few hours of musculoskeletal training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and low confidence in managing back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Including PTs in the primary care team is one way of helping address the workload challenge. If more patients with back pain are given the choice of seeing a PT first, it is hypothesized that this could ease the workload on physicians, provide a more focused back pain consultation, and improve outcomes.</p><p id="Par10">Several governments and health organizations have identified team-based primary care as an important strategy to improve the effectiveness and sustainability of healthcare systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Advantages include improved access to appropriate care, care coordination, and self-management support. PTs may be an important team member to integrate into primary care for people with back pain. Evidence suggests that guideline-adherent care for back pain improves function and disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and that PTs can effectively implement recommendations from primary care guidelines for back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], including: screening for red flags and the need for diagnostic imaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]; screening for risk factors for poor recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]; providing reassurance, advice about physical activity, and exercise recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]; and delivering targeted, psychologically informed interventions for those at greater risk of poor recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This body of evidence suggests trained PTs could play a greater role in providing guideline-adherent primary care for people with back pain.</p><p id="Par11">There is growing evidence to suggest that early referral to PTs for back pain can reduce healthcare costs and improve access to appropriate care. For example, a study in the United States by Fritz et al. (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;32,070) demonstrated that early PT referral was associated with reduced diagnostic imaging (odds ratio (OR)&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.34), physician visits (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.26), surgeries (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.45), and use of opioid medications (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.78) over a 1-year period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The mean reduction per person in healthcare costs associated with early physiotherapy has been reported to be from US$1202 to US$2736 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Furthermore, PTs in advanced practice roles have demonstrated accurate assessment, appropriate screening, and guideline-consistent triage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], while reducing spinal surgeon waiting times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Research to date has evaluated a model of care that includes a primary care visit with the physician followed by early referral to a PT. The proposed research will build on this evidence by determining the feasibility of having PTs available to patients as the first point of contact in the primary care team for back pain.</p><p id="Par12">There is emerging evidence from other settings that suggests that PTs can adopt the primary care role with good clinical outcomes and improvements in healthcare efficiency. Studies in the United States military have shown that when PTs provide the first point of contact care for those with work-related injuries this produces high satisfaction ratings, faster access, decreased sick calls, and more appropriate use of PTs and physicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Evidence on the transition from physician referral to direct access physiotherapy in the United Kingdom National Health Service found higher levels of patient and physician satisfaction, shorter physician wait times, fewer work absences, fewer diagnostic images, and lower prescription medication use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. These results are promising, but more rigorous evaluation methods and evidence specific to back pain and the Canadian primary care context are needed.</p><p id="Par13">While PTs can provide effective care for back pain, there are unique features of PTs practicing in primary care that make it critical to rigorously evaluate new models of care that incorporate PTs in primary care teams. First, the majority of primary care visits are for multiple health concerns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. It is important to evaluate how new models of care impact the management of the population most often seen in primary care, people with multimorbidity and complex healthcare needs. Second, PTs in Canada do not have independent prescribing rights. Several centers in Canada have developed medical directives that allow PTs to prescribe nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs under the authority of a physician (e.g., for short-term pain relief in LBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]), but these models need further evaluation. Third, it is unclear whether patients or other HCPs are satisfied with this model. One Canadian survey suggested high levels of satisfaction and confidence in advanced practice PTs, but this study was based on only 1% response to an electronic survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. It is essential to better understand the perspectives of patients and HCPs to inform a PT-led primary care model for back pain.</p><p id="Par14">The overarching aim of this line of research is to evaluate a novel primary care model for back pain that incorporates a PT at the first point of contact within the primary care team for people with back pain. The planned fully powered cluster randomized trial will have the following objectives:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par15">Determine the effectiveness of a PT-led primary care model for back pain on individual health outcomes (function, pain intensity, quality of life, global rating of change, and adverse events) in comparison to usual physician led primary care.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par16">Determine the impact of a PT-led primary care model for back pain on the healthcare system and society (healthcare accessibility, healthcare utilization, and cost-effectiveness).</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="Par17">Prior to conducting the planned fully powered cluster randomized trial, we need to test and demonstrate the feasibility of the trial methods.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p id="Par21">This is a pilot cluster randomized controlled trial at four primary care sites, with two sites randomized to a new PT-led primary care model for back pain and two sites randomized to usual physician-led primary care. A cluster randomized trial was chosen because the intervention includes integrating the PT into the clinical team and clinic processes. This integration would make using a traditional randomized controlled trial design difficult and would introduce a high risk of contamination for the usual care group. See Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for completed SPIRIT checklist. To explore perspectives of both HCPs and patients, we will also conduct qualitative interviews with patients and focus groups with HCPs who participated in the PT-led primary care intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Enrollment and randomization of sites</title><p id="Par22">For the pilot trial, four primary care practices in Kingston, Ontario, Canada (Family Health Teams or Community Health Centers) with a minimum of 2500 registered patients and two physicians each will be enrolled. We will purposefully invite one community health center and three family health teams to determine feasibility of the protocol in both settings. Sites will be sorted in order of size (number of registered patients) and placed into two groups (the largest site and smallest site forming one group and the middle two sites forming the other group). The two groups will then be randomly allocated to intervention or control arms by a statistician independent of the enrollment of sites and collection of data using computer-generated random numbers. The statistician will be blinded to the site names using a concealed list of anonymized codes for each site. We decided to randomize using these two groups in order to balance the group sizes for this pilot study given the large differences in number of registered patients across anticipated sites (ranging from 3000 to 16,000 patients). We anticipate using a stratified block randomization based on the number of registered patients for the full trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Blinding</title><p id="Par23">HCPs and patients will not be blinded due to the nature of the interventions being compared; that is, it is difficult to blind patients or care providers to the models of care being compared. All participants will be informed that the trial is comparing a model of care that involves integrating a physiotherapist within the primary care team at the first point of contact with the team and a usual care model that involves seeing their own family physician or nurse practitioner first. Since the primary outcome measures are self-report measures completed by patients, the assessors will also not be blinded to their allocation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Patient enrollment</title><p id="Par24">Medical secretaries will screen patients for willingness to be invited to participate when they call to book an appointment. Patients who agree to being invited to participate will be booked with an onsite research assistant 30 min before their appointment time. The research assistant will provide information about the study, obtain informed consent, and enroll consenting patients at the time of their initial visit. Enrollment will take place over a 14-week period starting in September 2017.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Inclusion/exclusion of patients</title><p id="Par25">All adult (18 years and over) patients who ask to book a primary care visit related to back pain of any duration at any of the four participating primary care sites will be invited to participate.

Patients in this model will be given the choice of seeing the PT or family doctor. They will be encouraged to book with the PT except when the primary reason for the visit is for medication renewals or when the patient has additional health concerns that need attention from their physician in the same visit. There will be four key components of the PT-led primary care intervention: 1) initial assessment and screening; 2) brief individualized intervention at the first visit; 3) health services navigation; 4) providing additional PT care for people with an unmet need. For the pilot study, we will have one PT providing care for both of the primary care practices in the PT-led primary care model arm.</p><p id="Par28">All participants who see the PT in primary care will be able to book follow-up appointments. However, to avoid duplication of available PT services, only those with an identified need and no financial coverage for physiotherapy services (i.e., no health insurance coverage for PT and not meeting the criteria for PT funded by the ministry of health in Ontario) will be scheduled for a follow-up appointment with the PT in primary care at the end of the initial visit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Assessment and screening</title><p id="Par29">The assessment and screening will include: taking a history; screening for red flags (e.g., signs/symptoms associated with cauda equina syndrome, traumatic fracture, cancer, or widespread neurological symptoms); physical and neurological examination; application of evidence-based tools to identify comorbid health conditions (e.g., depression) that require additional care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]; and using a validated tool (STarT Back [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]) to identify physical and psychosocial risk factors associated with ongoing pain and disability (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Overview of the PT in primary care screening and navigation process. The physiotherapist (<italic>PT</italic>) will help the patient navigate the healthcare system in three stages. First, any red flags identified will lead to emergency, urgent, or soon referrals to the emergency department, physician, and/or imaging. Second, the patient history, examination findings, and validated questionnaires, when appropriate, will be used to determine if other healthcare providers are needed for this patient&#x02019;s care. Third, the PT will use the STarT back risk stratification tool (individuals screened as low, medium, or high risk of ongoing pain and disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]) to guide referral pathways for physiotherapy. The matched low-risk pathway is a brief primary care intervention (reassurance, advice, and exercise) with no referral. The medium-risk pathway involves a referral for usual physiotherapy care in addition to the brief intervention. The high-risk matched pathway includes referral for a combined physical and psychologically informed treatment approach which aims to address barriers to recovery, facilitate increases in activity, and address unhelpful back pain beliefs and behaviors.

First, they will identify any red flags requiring emergency or urgent referrals. Next, they will identify any comorbid conditions that need attention from other members of the healthcare team; for example, people who screen positive for depression will be referred to their physician or a member of the mental healthcare team. Finally, they will make a referral to PT (if appropriate) informed by the patient&#x02019;s score on the STarT Back tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The STarT Back tool effectively categorizes patients with back pain into low, medium, or high risk of ongoing pain and disability based on physical and psychosocial risk factors for poor recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Low-risk patients will receive only the brief individualized intervention at intake, medium-risk patients will receive a referral for standard community physiotherapy, and the high-risk patients will be referred to a PT with specific training in combined physical and psychologically informed practice aimed at reducing risk factors for chronic pain and disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].

However, this stratified approach has been difficult to implement in contexts outside of the UK due to differences in funding models for physiotherapy. For example, people classified as low risk who have extended health insurance often use their coverage for PT care, even though the STarT Back approach suggests these individuals are likely to experience a full recovery without PT intervention. The PT-led primary care model for back pain utilized in this study will aim to overcome this barrier using education and shared decision making with patients classified as low risk. The education will help patients understand that they are likely to recover without additional PT services so that they can make an informed decision about whether or not to seek additional care using this knowledge. Another barrier to using the STarT Back stratified approach to care in the Canadian context is that people classified as medium or high risk often do not have financial coverage for PT. The PT-led primary care model for back pain utilized in this study will address this barrier by providing ongoing PT care for people identified with an unmet need.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Providing additional physiotherapy care to people with an unmet need</title><p id="Par33">The PT in primary care will provide additional physiotherapy care (at the primary care site) to patients who are classified as medium and high risk of ongoing pain and disability (based on STarT Back screening) and who do not have access to physiotherapy coverage through either private or government health insurance plans.
