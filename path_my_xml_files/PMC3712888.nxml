BV can often arise as a chronic or recurrent disease. The reason for such recurrences is not well elucidated. Previous studies have suggested that vaginal vitamin C may be a useful treatment in reducing recurrence rate, by increasing vaginal acidification and thereby making up for the decrease in hydrogen peroxide that results from a reduction in the number of lactobacilli present. Based on the above-mentioned consideration, a study was performed that aimed to evaluate the effect of vitamin C in the prophylaxis of BV relapses.</p></sec><sec id="a2"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial. One hundred and forty-two women, after having been cured from a recent episode of BV by either metronidazole or clindamycin, were randomised to receive vitamin C (74 patients) or placebo (68 patients) as prophylaxis for six monthly cycles, starting within 24 hours of the determination of &#x02018;BV cure&#x02019;. The patients applied one vaginal tablet once a day for 6 consecutive days per month after menses.</p></sec><sec id="a3"><title>Results</title><p>The rate of BV recurrence during the first 3 months was considerably lower in the vitamin C group (6.8%) than in the placebo (14.7%) group. Considering a 6-month treatment period, the recurrence rate in the vitamin C group (16.2%) was significantly lower (P = 0.024) than in the placebo group (32.4%). Moreover, at the same time point, the survival analysis of Kaplan Meyer was significant in favour of the vitamin C group compared with the placebo group (P = 0.029).</p></sec><sec id="a4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The study showed that regular use of 250 mg ascorbic acid vaginal tablets on 6 days per month for 6 months after successful treatment of bacterial vaginosis halves the risk of recurrence from 32.4% to 16.2% (P = 0.024).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Bacterial vaginosis</kwd><kwd>Bacterial vaginosis prophylaxis</kwd><kwd>Vitamin C vaginal tablets</kwd><kwd>Ascorbic acid vaginal tablets</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common condition that affects almost one-third of women of childbearing age (29%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R01">1</xref>]. In Caucasian women, the prevalence is 5% to 15%; in African and black American women, it is 45% to 55%; and in Asian women the prevalence is less well studied, but in general it is around 20% to 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R02">2</xref>].</p><p>The aetiology of BV is still unclear but it is currently considered to be a synergistic polymicrobial syndrome, characterised by depletion of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp and an intense increase (100- to 1,000-fold above normal levels) in vaginal anaerobic bacteria, including <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic>, <italic>Prevotella</italic> spp, anaerobic gram-positive cocci, <italic>Mobiluncus</italic> spp, <italic>Mycoplasma hominis</italic> and <italic>Atopobium vaginalis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R03">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R04">4</xref>], leading to a replacement of lactobacilli and an increase in vaginal pH.</p><p>BV can often arise as a chronic or recurrent disease and the reason for recurrences is not well known. Based on fluorescence in situ hybridisation of vaginal biopsy specimens, Mendling et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R04">4</xref>] have demonstrated that BV is associated with the development of an adherent polymicrobial biofilm that is highly organised and contains abundant <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic> on the vaginal epithelium. Bacterial biofilms have recently been associated with several recalcitrant infections (involving <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R05">5</xref>]. The biofilm enhances bacterial attachment to epithelial surfaces, allows bacteria to reach much higher concentrations than in luminal fluids, and prevents the drugs from reaching the bacteria, which reside in the film in a quiescent, latent state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R06">6</xref>]. This observation might provide an explanation of the high rates of BV relapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R07">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R08">8</xref>]. The presence of <italic>Atopobium vaginae</italic> strictly associated with <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic> in the persistent and adherent bacterial biofilm has been confirmed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R04">4</xref>], and seems to be the main reason for the failure of BV treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R09">9</xref>]. Although some authors suggest that <italic>Atopobium vaginae</italic> may play a role in lowering the vaginal pH level through lactic acid production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], Marconi et al have found that <italic>Atopobium vaginae</italic> content strongly increases if the vaginal pH is 4.9 or higher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Therefore, they suggest that strains of this bacterium may have different capacities of lactic acid production but not to a significant level to safeguard the vaginal microflora.</p><p>Vaginal vitamin C is available as silicon-coated tablets containing 250 mg ascorbic acid. This formulation is able to release the vitamin over hours, allowing a statistically significant vaginal pH-lowering effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. The efficacy of vaginal vitamin C in relieving BV signs and symptoms has been confirmed in two studies by Petersen et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Moreover, Abbaspour et al have showed that the efficacy of vaginal vitamin C in BV treatment is non-inferior to that of standard local metronidazole gel therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>].</p><p>The main goal of BV therapy and, in particular, of BV prevention is to keep the vaginal pH at 4.5 or lower, in order to prevent the overgrowth of pathogens until the normal lactobacilli are re-established and able to maintain the pH themselves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Anaerobes grow poorly at pH 4.5 or lower; the optimum pH for <italic>Prevotella</italic> spp and <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic> growth is 6 - 7. In vitro studies show that the concentrations of these bacteria increase with increasing pH, but both are susceptible to low pH. An ideal way to manage recurrent BV would be to maintain the vaginal pH at 4.5 with a prophylactic treatment that is able to control the overgrowth of bacteria. In this context, a viable therapeutic agent could be ascorbic acid, as it may able to help re-establish and maintain the vaginal ecosystem.</p><p>Based on the above-mentioned considerations, the present study aimed to evaluate the potential effect of vitamin C, well known to have a vaginal pH-lowering effect, in the prophylaxis of BV relapses in patients who have been cured from a BV episode.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics</title><p>The study was fully Good Clinical Practice (GCP) compliant and was reviewed and approved by all relevant Independent Ethics Committees.

The BV diagnosis was based on the contemporary presence of at least three out of four Amsel criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]: vaginal discharge, pH of vaginal fluid &#x0003e; 4.5, amine (fishy) odour of vaginal discharge after addition of 10% KOH (whiff test) and the presence of clue cells (&#x0003e; 20%) on microscopic examination.</p><p>Patients with diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, gonorrhoea, <italic>Treponema pallidum</italic>, <italic>Herpes genitalis</italic>, trichomoniasis and/or candidiasis, or concomitantly treated with immunosuppressant, antibiotics, <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> preparations, acidifying agents, disinfectants, or vaginal douching were excluded.</p><p>Eligible women, cured (confirmed by the absence of three out of four Amsel criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]) from an episode of BV by a course of either metronidazole or clindamycin, were randomly (1:1) assigned to receive 250 mg ascorbic acid vaginal tablets or placebo as prophylaxis for six monthly cycles, starting within 24 hours from the determination of &#x02018;BV cure&#x02019;. The patients applied one vaginal tablet once a day for 6 consecutive days per month after menses. The women were instructed to insert the tablets deep into the vagina at bedtime and were supplied with 250 mg ascorbic acid tablets or matching placebo.</p><p>The overall prophylaxis was set by six cycles of applications but, when the first BV relapse occurred (confirmed by the presence of three out of four Amsel criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]), the patients were discontinued from the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Assessments</title><p>Clinical visits were conducted at the end of each cycle, within 3 days of the end of the treatment, and 1 month after the end of the last cycle (final visit). The diagnosis of BV was documented by collecting two specimens of vaginal discharge: the first sample for microscopic examination (detection of clue cells) of the fresh smear and the second one for the whiff test. Moreover, BV signs and symptoms were recorded (itching, burning, dysuria, odour, erythema, oedema, and fissures) and scored by means of a four-point scale as follows: 0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate and 3 = severe.</p><p>Vaginal pH measurements were performed by the patients themselves using a pH-measuring device, namely pHem-Alert<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Gynex Corporation, USA) during each cycle: before and 12 hours after the first application, 12 hours after the last application and during the application-free period on days 10 and 15.</p><p>The primary efficacy variable of the study was the time to the first BV relapse diagnosed according to Amsel criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>].

Attempts to achieve this via re-colonisation with exogenous lactobacilli have not been successful. Another, more accepted approach is to reduce vaginal pH, in order to create a negative environment for pathogen growth and to achieve long-lasting normalisation of vaginal flora using intravaginal ascorbic acid (vitamin C). The use of antibiotics may induce resistance in the pool of bacteria recognised to cause BV and, conversely, could affect the normal flora of lactobacilli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R09">9</xref>], favouring recurrence within a few weeks in over 70% of women taking antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Ascorbic acid (250 mg, in a silicone carrier that ensures prolonged action) plays a vital role in maintaining low vaginal pH values and enhances healing processes in the vaginal ecosystem - recolonisation with lactic acid bacteria. The mechanism of action is simple: through the lowering of vaginal pH to the physiological level of 3.8 - 4.5, anaerobic overgrowth is inhibited and the conditions for the re-growth of physiological lactobacilli flora are re-established.</p><p>The results of the present study show that 250 mg ascorbic acid vaginal tablets taken 6 days per month safely halves the risk of BV recurrence from 32.4% to 16.2% during a 6-month prophylactic treatment. The O.R. confirms that subjects treated with placebo had a doubled risk of BV recurrence compared with the group of subjects treated with vitamin C. Considering the time to the first BV relapse, treatment of at least five cycles is necessary in order to reduce, at a significant level, the risk of BV recurrence. As this was a prophylaxis study, in women who at the screening visit were healthy and who terminated the study in case of relapse, a between-treatment difference in clinical parameters was not expected. At the same time, differences in pH were not expected but conversely, a reduction in pH was noted for 3-month and 6-month treatment.</p><p>In conclusion, regular use of silicon-coated vitamin C (250 mg) tablets, after the standard antibiotic treatment for BV, protects women by reducing the risk of recurrence probably by re-establishing the normal lactobacilli flora that is able to maintain vaginal pH.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The contribution of the following persons to the investigation is gratefully acknowledged: Medi Service S.r.l., Agrate Brianza, Milan, Italy; R.
