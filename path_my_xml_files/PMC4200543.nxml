The aim of this study is to compare effects of IV ketamine with IM ketamine in children who were admitted to the ED and were in need of sedation for therapeutic procedures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This is a single-blind, clinical trial on 60 pediatric patients who were referred to the ED during 2010. All patients were enrolled after informed consent was obtained from their parents. There was no added cost for the patients due to this study. All the patients were alert, hemodynamically stable, and less than five years old. They were randomized by an allocation software to two groups that received IV ketamine (1 mg/kg) and IM ketamine (4 mg/kg). Information about the patients during and after the procedure, time to reach sedation, severity of sedation, and complications of the drug until discharge were obtained. All drugs had been prepared in 5 mL syringes in the ED and also contained 0.02 mg/kg atropin and 0.05 mg/kg midazolam. All injections were administered under the supervision of the Professor of Emergency Medicine. Exclusion criteria were: (1) Age less than 12 months, (2) age over 5 years, (3) history of known allergy to the drugs, (4) patients with open globe injury, (5) patients with traumatic brain injury, (6) patients with a history of psychiatric disorders, and (7) patients with memory impairment or cognitive impairment. The Ramsay sedation scale was used to assess the level of sedation.</p><p>Ramsay sedation scale:</p><p>

Mean age of the group who received 1 mg/kg ketamine IV was 2.4 &#x000b1; 7.9 years and for patients who recivied 4 mg/kg ketamine IM, it was 2.7 &#x000b1; 7.3 years.</p><p>Average length of time from receiving sedation medication up to the child awakening in ketamine IV and ketamine IM groups was 36.2 &#x000b1; 0.5 and 56.5 &#x000b1; 0.6 minutes, respectively. All children were awake and conscious during the first hour after the adminstaration of the drug. Continued evaluation of all children up to three hours after sedation was done to control side effects such as convulsions, increased salivation, rash, apnea, airway manangement such as the need for intubation, incidence of delirium, hypotension, hypoxia, and tachycardia, but no cases experienced such side effects.</p><p>The only side effect observed in our study was the incidence of nausea and vomiting in both groups. All cases experienced vomiting in the late phase of recovery after sedation, but its incidence according to the age of the patients showed no significant difference (<italic>P</italic> = 0.07). The average length of procedures was similar in both groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). Sedation levels in the two groups at 5, 10, and 15 minutes did not show significant differences (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05), but the study at 30, 35, 40, and 45 minutes showed a significant difference in sedation levels (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03, <italic>P</italic> = 0.04, <italic>P</italic> = 0.03, and <italic>P</italic> = 0.05).

Shorter duration of sedation in patients who received IV ketamine was the most important finding that led to earlier return of consciousness and discharge of the patiens. This finding may lower the anxiety of parents.</p><p>According to a study by Joe E. Wathen <italic>et al</italic>. about the usage of IV ketamine for pediatric sedation (1 mg/kg IV) in the emergency department, it was seen that the incidence of pulmonary complications was 4.5%, vomiting 18.7%, and 7.1% incidence of hallucinations and delusions in patients who received ketamine.</p><p>In another study in 2006 by Roback MG, <italic>et al</italic>., the effects of IM and IV sedation using ketamine in children admitted to the ED with orthopedic trauma were compared. The results show that the incidence of nausea was higher (11.9%) in the group who received IM ketamine.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Our study showed the incidence of vomiting (5 vs. 1.7%) in the ketamine IM group and ketamine IV group. The incidence of vomiting was higher in the patients who received IM ketamine.</p><p>Roback MG <italic>et al</italic>. in a study reported that the duration of sedation by IM ketamine was more than in the IV route; this is similar to our results (36.2 &#x000b1; 0.5 minutes in the IV group vs. 56.5 &#x000b1; 0.6 minutes in IM ketamine group). All the children were awake and conscious during the first hour after adminstration of the drug. Other side effects during evaluation were not observed.</p><p>Considering better control of the sedation of patients and lack of side effects, ketamine is more effective and safer in both IV and IM adminstration. IV administration of ketamine, due to faster results and quicker healing and awakening (shorter-term sedation), can have a relatively better prognosis. It requires minimum serious intervention and is recommended for pediatric sedation, but exact control of the duration of sedation and careful examination of the side effects in patients is necessary and should be scrutinizingly evaluated. No significant difference was seen in vomiting complications between the two groups. On the other hand, the recovery time did not differ neither did the risk of aspiration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>There was no significant difference in complications between the two groups, but a longer duration of sedation was observed in the IM ketamine group which makes IV ketamine more desirable. We recommend that in future studies, the clinical status of patients and its alteration be evaluated precisely to determine the most efficient method of pediatric sedation.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold>
