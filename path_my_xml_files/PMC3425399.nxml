The underlying mechanisms, however, are not clear. Because insulin physiologically facilitates glucose uptake by most tissues of the body and thereby fosters intracellular energy supply, we hypothesized that intranasal insulin reduces food consumption via enhancement of the neuroenergetic level. In a double-blind, placebo&#x02013;controlled, within-subject comparison, 15 healthy men (BMI 22.2 &#x000b1; 0.37 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) aged 22&#x02013;28 years were intranasally administered insulin (40 IU) or placebo after an overnight fast. Cerebral energy metabolism was assessed by <sup>31</sup>P magnetic resonance spectroscopy. At 100 min after spray administration, participants consumed ad libitum from a test buffet. Our data show that intranasal insulin increases brain energy (i.e., adenosine triphosphate and phosphocreatine levels). Cerebral energy content correlates inversely with subsequent calorie intake in the control condition. Moreover, the neuroenergetic rise upon insulin administration correlates with the consecutive reduction in free-choice calorie consumption. Brain energy levels may therefore constitute a predictive value for food intake. Given that the brain synchronizes food intake behavior in dependence of its current energetic status, a future challenge in obesity treatment may be to therapeutically influence cerebral energy homeostasis. Intranasal insulin, after optimizing its application schema, seems a promising option in this regard.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The central nervous system (CNS) gathers information on the body&#x02019;s energy availability from blood glucose and fat stores to adjust food intake behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Specifically, hypothalamic centers control downstream signaling systems, comprising several peripheral hormones, to balance energy homeostasis and body weight regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In this context, peripherally secreted insulin is part of a negative adiposity feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Experimental intracerebroventricular as well as intranasal administration of insulin into the CNS decreases food intake and body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), whereas disruption of the physiologic hormonal feedback loop exerts reverse effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The neurobiologic mechanisms underlying modulatory effects of intracerebral insulin on food consumption and body weight, however, are not entirely clear. Apart from intact brain insulin-signaling, the property of insulin as molecular energy provider facilitating glucose uptake may also be important in this regard because the cerebral energetic status per se seems to play a key role in body weight adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Accordingly, it has been proposed that impairments in brain energy supply induce hypothalamic sensing of an imminent neuroglycopenia that results in chronically activated appetite centers and, ultimately, body weight gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Indeed, we have recently provided experimental evidence for this assumption by demonstrating an inverse relationship between cerebral energy content, such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and phosphocreatine (PCr) levels, and body mass in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Compatible with a potential role of insulin in brain energy homeostasis, in vitro studies in rodents measuring the PCr and ATP content in homogenized brain slices and cultured neurons indicate that pharmacologic inhibition of insulin receptor signaling reduces neuronal ATP and PCr formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and, vice versa, the intracerebroventricular administration of insulin enhances intracellular PCr content in these experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p><p>Against this background, we hypothesized that the anorexigenic effects of intracerebral insulin administration are mediated through an increase in cerebral energy levels due to facilitated insulin-dependent glucose uptake and, hence, deactivation of appetite centers. To test this hypothesis, we measured brain ATP and PCr levels by <sup>31</sup>P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>31</sup>P-MRS) at baseline and repeatedly after the intranasal administration of insulin (40 IU) versus placebo and assessed subsequent food intake in 15 normal-weight men.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Participants.</title><p>Fifteen normal-weight (BMI 22.2 &#x000b1; 0.37 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) healthy men aged 24.6 &#x000b1; 1.3 years (range 22&#x02013;28) participated in the experiments.

Exclusion criteria were acute or chronic internal, neurologic, or psychiatric diseases, diabetes mellitus in first-degree family members, alcohol or drug abuse, smoking, shift work, exceptional physical or mental stress, and any kind of medication. Because sleep restriction subsequently increases food intake, participants were instructed not to go to bed later than 2300 h on the days before experimental testing and to abstain from food and caffeine for 12 h before the experiments.

Notwithstanding, there is evidence that brain glucose uptake partially occurs in an insulin-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), and it is well known that the brain uses glucose as a substrate for energy production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Therefore, one could speculate that intranasal insulin administration may facilitate the brain&#x02019;s energy supply, and hence increases ATP and PCr levels, which, in turn, leads to closure of the ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channels with subsequent food intake reduction. This reasoning is supported by the inverse relationship between brain energy levels and the amount of subsequent free-choice food consumption in the control condition. The negative relation between high-energy phosphate content and caloric intake suggests that the cerebral energy content predicts food intake in humans and is in line with data showing that ATP and PCr levels are distinctly decreased in obese and increased in low-weight subjects compared with normal-weight control subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Further support for the assumption that food intake may depend on brain energy content is provided by the correlation between the rise in cerebral high-energy phosphate content upon insulin administration and immediate calorie intake reduction in our study.</p><p>Data of insulin administration in our study confirm previous observations of an insulin-induced suppressive impact on food intake behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Compared with placebo, intranasal administration of insulin not only reduces total calorie consumption, but specified analysis also reveals that this effect is due to lowered protein and carbohydrate intake. This outcome demonstrates that increasing cerebral insulin levels even exerts an influence on the composition of ingested food. In line with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), hunger ratings remained unaffected by intranasal insulin application in this context, suggesting that the suppressive effects of insulin on food intake occur at an unconscious behavioral level.</p><p>Overall, our findings suggest that brain energy homeostasis represents one of the mechanisms that underlie the control of appetite and food consumption and are in line with previous data indicating an association between cerebral energy content and BMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Hence, the assumption that the brain&#x02019;s own energy status is crucial for body weight adjustment is further substantiated. Our finding that the high-energy phosphate content of the brain has a predictive value for food intake may be of future relevance against a clinical background. For instance, rigorous calorie-reduced dieting may be counterproductive as a treatment of obesity because caloric reduction even worsens the pre-existing cerebral energy undersupply in obese individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), resulting in the frequently observed ravenousness and therefore the undesirable yo-yo effect after diet cessation. On the basis of this assumption, one could speculate that intranasal insulin administration may be applicable to prevent this neuroenergetic decline and thereby the compensatory postinterventional body weight regain.</p><p>Although the results of our study seem to confirm the underlying hypothesis, one could argue that the distribution of intranasally applied insulin within the brain, and therefore its effects on specific brain areas such as hypothalamic appetite centers, are thus far unknown, which may cast some doubt on our reasoning. Nevertheless, the regional distribution of insulin receptors within the CNS argues for more generalized effects of insulin administration on all binding sites identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) and render obvious that the neuroenergetic rise observed here reflects a change of high-energy phosphate content in the whole brain rather than on circumscript brain areas. Also, given that intranasal insulin administration suppresses appetite and food intake, as observed here and in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), the question arises why therapeutic insulin medication in diabetes does not cause the same effect but, right to the contrary, commonly results in body weight gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). This discrepancy may be explained by divergent characteristics in energy storage of brain and peripheral tissue targeted by insulin. Within the brain, insulin is an intracellular supplier of glucose with a negligible function for energy storage, although recent data indeed indicate that insulin promotes glycogen synthesis in human astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). However, the synthesis and degradation of this glucose-storage molecule occur simultaneously and the net brain glycogen amount within the brain is rather small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) compared with the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>) or skeletal muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Peripherally, in contrast, insulin leads to excess glucose uptake by fat tissue and therefore fosters body weight gain, which may override its anorexigenic effects within the brain. Certainly of relevance in this context is also the choice of the administered insulin dosage. To prevent intranasal insulin from entering the peripheral blood circulation, as uncovered by a transient increase in circulating insulin and drop in glucose concentrations, which occurred in previous studies applying 160 IU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), we chose the significantly lower dosage of 40 IU. As expected, peripheral glucose metabolism remained unaffected by insulin administration throughout the experiments in our study.</p><p>In summary, our data provide evidence for a central role of brain energy metabolism in the regulation of food consumption and uncover an important function of cerebral insulin in humans. Our findings support the hypothesis that the brain synchronizes appetite, food-intake behavior, and body weight control in dependence of its current energetic status. Hence, alterations in CNS energy homeostasis may underlie the development of disturbances in body weight regulation such as obesity. Consequently, one future challenge will be to identify interventions that influence brain energy homeostasis and take advantage of this understanding to cure diseases characterized by body weight dysregulation. In this context, intranasally applied insulin, after optimizing its application schema, may be a potential option to combat overweight and obesity as it &#x0201c;refuels&#x0201d; an energy-deprived brain.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>See accompanying commentary, p. <related-article related-article-type="companion" id="d34e823" vol="61" page="2216" ext-link-type="pmc">2216</related-article>.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by funding from the German Research Foundation (DFG, KFO 126) and the University of Luebeck (E11-2011).</p><p>No potential conflicts of interest relevant to this article were reported.</p><p>K.J.-C. conceived and designed the study, collected, analyzed, and interpreted the data, wrote and edited the manuscript, and approved the final version for submission.
