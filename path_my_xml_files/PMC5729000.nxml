Since dabigatran is not absorbed orally, its prodrug, dabigatran etexilate (DE), which is rapidly absorbed and converted to dabigatran by esterase-catalyzed hydrolysis, is often used <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Similar to other non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants, routine biological monitoring is not usually required in patients receiving dabigatran therapy owing to its predictable pharmacokinetics with limited drug-drug interactions <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. However, monitoring of the anticoagulant activity might be useful in certain clinical settings <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The dilute thrombin time test was reported to show a high degree of linearity at blood dabigatran concentrations (DC) &#x0003e; 50 ng/mL and was useful for quantitation across the entire on-therapy range <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is relatively insensitive because the curvilinear response at higher drug levels does not permit accurate quantitation <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. DE is often co-administered with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) because of its adverse effects on the gastrointestinal tract <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. It is known that co-administration of PPI may affect the absorption of DE by raising the gastric pH because an acidic environment is required for the dissolution of DE <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, drug-drug interactions between DE and PPI have not been fully elucidated in daily clinical practice.

In this study, co-administration of PPIs significantly decreased DC at both the trough and peak times.</p><p id="p0040">Results of the RE-LY trial showed that patients cotreated with a PPI exhibited a 12.5% decrease in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve at steady state <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Similarly, co-administration of pantoprazole decreased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve and the maximum plasma concentration at steady state by 20&#x02013;24% in healthy elderly subjects <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Although these previous studies depended on the comparison between two groups (with and without PPI administration), their results are consistent with our findings that showed that PPI administration decreased the bioavailability of dabigatran.</p><p id="p0045">Regarding the interactions between DE and PPIs, PPIs are known as moderate inhibitors of the efflux transporter, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, and DE is a substrate of P-gp <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Theoretically, PPIs are expected to increase DC, similar to other drugs that strongly inhibit P-gp <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. However, since PPIs increase the gastric pH, they decrease the dissolution and absorption of DE, which are promoted in the acidic environment <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Therefore, PPI administration could decrease DC by affecting its solubility. In healthy subjects, the mean percentage of time maintained with intragastric pH &#x0003e; 4 on day 5 was 61, 76, and 62 for the extensive metabolizer (rabeprazole 20&#x000a0;mg), poor metabolizer (rabeprazole 20&#x000a0;mg), and esomeprazole 20&#x000a0;mg, respectively. For lansoprazole (30&#x000a0;mg), the mean percentage of time maintained with intragastric pH &#x0003e; 4 on day 5 was 48&#x02013;53 in healthy subjects <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p id="p0050">PPIs significantly reduced the trough and peak DC in the present study, the latter mechanism seems to control the interaction between DE and PPIs. Contrary to our results, Ollier <italic>et al.</italic> found no significant interactions between PPIs and DE in a single-center, randomized, open-label study <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In this previous study, nine healthy male Caucasian volunteers (median age, 23 years; median weight, 73&#x000a0;kg) were evaluated using a single-dose regimen of DE. The obvious difference in the backgrounds of patients in the present study and those in this previous study, as well as the protocol of repeated-dose DE administration in the present study could explain the different results. Furthermore, in the present study, the DC values were higher with PPI than without PPI in three patients at the trough time and six patients at the peak time. Although the number of patients was too small to clarify their clinical characteristics, the former mechanism might control the interaction between DE and PPIs in a few patients in the present study.</p><p id="p0055">DE contains tartaric acid to increase the extent of absorption, which results in gastrointestinal symptoms (the most frequent adverse effect) <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. PPIs could be used for prevention of these symptoms. Therefore, when prescribing PPIs with DE in clinical settings, it is necessary to consider the possibility that the bioavailability of dabigatran might decrease.</p><p id="p0060">The clinical outcomes of the interaction of PPIs with DC are not known. In a previous study, co-administration of PPIs resulted in minor to moderate effects, and only minor effects were considered likely in clinical settings <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In the present study, the average trough and peak DCs with and without PPI were within the therapeutic range determined in the Japanese subgroup analysis of the RE-LY trial <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Thus, the decrease in DC by PPIs might be moderate enough to maintain the efficacy of dabigatran; however, further investigations are needed to confirm the clinical outcomes of the co-administration of PPIs in patients with NVAF receiving dabigatran therapy.</p><p id="p0065">In the present study, the dilute thrombin time was measured to calculate DC because it showed a high degree of linearity at drug levels &#x0003e; 50 ng/mL <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. This assay is still not available in all clinics; thus, aPTT, the routine and sensitive biomarker of the anticoagulant activity of dabigatran, was also measured <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Based on the results of the present study, aPTT could be also useful to evaluate the effect of PPIs on DE to a considerable degree.</p><p id="p0070">The present study had several limitations. This study was performed at a single institution for a short observation period and included a limited number of subjects. Since the results of the present study were analyzed at low statistical power owing to the small number of subjects, further studies including a greater number of patients are required to confirm the present results. The clinical outcomes were not compared between the two periods because there were too few events to analyze. One patient had bloody phlegm during the period 1 when he took DE co-administration with a PPI, and another had acute arterial embolism in the lower limb during the period 2 when he took DE co-administration with a PPI. Although dabigatran has a stable pharmacokinetic profile, intra-patient variability in the peak and trough DCs can occur. In a previous study, the intra-patient geometric coefficients of variation in the trough and peak DC over 6 months were 32&#x02013;40% <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Thus, repeated measurements of DC during both periods may be needed to confirm the present results. The peak time was defined uniformly as 2&#x000a0;h after DE administration; however, the actual peak concentration may differ among individual patients. In the present study, the peak DC was slightly lower than the trough DC in one patient during the period of co-administration of PPI and in three patients during the period without PPI. In these patients, it is possible that the increase in DC 2&#x000a0;h after DE administration was not strong enough.</p></sec><sec id="s0040"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0075">In conclusion, PPI co-administration was found to significantly decrease the trough and peak DC measured using the plasma-diluted thrombin time in patients with NVAF in a randomized, crossover study.
