Consequently, some patients with type 2 diabetes will inevitably require insulin therapy at a certain point of disease progression in order to achieve glycated hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) targets<xref rid="jdi12569-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, <xref rid="jdi12569-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>. An increase in the number of patients with type 2 diabetes has recently been seen in Japan, as well as worldwide. The reason is considered to be lifestyle changes, primarily related to diet and exercise, leading to a higher prevalence of overweight and obesity, which is a high risk factor for glucose intolerance<xref rid="jdi12569-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="jdi12569-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>. It has been shown that glucose intolerance is associated with reduced secretion of insulin in Japanese individuals<xref rid="jdi12569-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="jdi12569-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>. Together with the high carbohydrate content in the Japanese diet, this can be the reason why the addition of mealtime insulin is often considered as a treatment option for Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.</p><p>An optimal biphasic insulin product would mimic the normal physiological insulin secretion in response to a meal and at the same time provide full 24&#x02010;h basal coverage. Thus, it should consist of a rapid&#x02010;acting bolus component with short duration of action, and a basal component with a stable profile and a long duration of action. Most biphasic insulin products do not fully meet these criteria as a consequence of interference between the two components, leading to a glucose&#x02010;lowering effect from the bolus component lasting longer than required for mealtime control. Furthermore, the basal fraction of biphasic insulin products shows larger variation and shorter duration of the glucose&#x02010;lowering effect in comparison with current basal insulin analogs<xref rid="jdi12569-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>.</p><p>Insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) is a soluble combination of long&#x02010;acting insulin degludec (IDeg; 70%) and rapid&#x02010;acting insulin aspart (IAsp; 30%)<xref rid="jdi12569-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>. IDegAsp is formulated so the IDeg and IAsp components retain their individual pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics<xref rid="jdi12569-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>. Hence, IDegAsp provides separate prandial and basal glucose&#x02010;lowering effects<xref rid="jdi12569-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, with a more distinct split of the components relative to biphasic insulin aspart 30 (BIAsp 30)<xref rid="jdi12569-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>.</p><p>Based on previously published results, the pharmacological properties of IDegAsp result in clinical advantages reflecting the separate action of the IDeg and IAsp components. In a phase 3 trial in insulin&#x02010;experienced Asian patients with type 2 diabetes, including Japanese patients, IDegAsp administered twice&#x02010;daily improved glycemic control and provided greater reduction in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels with no statistically significant differences in rates of overall and nocturnal hypoglycemia compared with BIAsp 30<xref rid="jdi12569-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>. In a global phase 3 trial in insulin&#x02010;experienced patients with type 2 diabetes, twice&#x02010;daily IDegAsp provided a similar HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction and superior reduction in FPG compared with BIAsp 30, with statistically significantly lower end&#x02010;of&#x02010;trial insulin dose and rates of overall and nocturnal hypoglycemia<xref rid="jdi12569-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>. A pooled analysis of these two phase 3 trials<xref rid="jdi12569-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="jdi12569-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> provides further support of the benefits of IDegAsp compared with BIAsp 30 regarding FPG control and hypoglycemia risk<xref rid="jdi12569-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>.</p><p>When switching from a current insulin product to a new insulin product, the potential risk of hypoglycemia in the period immediately after the switch could be a point of concern. In the present phase 2 trial, we investigated the safety related to a unit&#x02010;to&#x02010;unit switch from twice&#x02010;daily basal or pre&#x02010;mix insulin therapy to twice&#x02010;daily IDegAsp treatment in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes, with specific focus on the incidence of hypoglycemia. The current exploratory trial also formed the basis for proceeding with therapeutic confirmatory trials in Japanese patients in the IDegAsp clinical development program.</p></sec><sec id="jdi12569-sec-0006"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="jdi12569-sec-0007"><title>Trial design and participants</title><p>The present trial was a 6&#x02010;week, open&#x02010;label, randomized, parallel&#x02010;group trial carried out in Japan (8 sites) between January 2009 and June 2009 (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00842361). The trial was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki<xref rid="jdi12569-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>, and the Ministry of Health and Welfare Ordinance on Good Clinical Practice<xref rid="jdi12569-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>, and was approved by appropriate local institutional review boards. All participants gave written informed consent before any trial&#x02010;related activities.</p><p>Eligible participants were Japanese men and women with type 2 diabetes aged &#x02265;20 years, with HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels &#x0003c;10.0% and body mass index (BMI) &#x0003c;30.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and who had been treated with twice&#x02010;daily insulin for &#x02265;12 weeks using the same basal insulin (except insulin glargine) or pre&#x02010;mix insulin (except BIAsp 30) throughout this period. Patients were excluded if they received a current total insulin dose of &#x0003e;100 U/day, if they had been treated with oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) within the past 12 weeks, if they had any clinically significant disease or disorder (renal or hepatic impairment, serious heart disease, uncontrolled hypertension, cancer or medical history of cancer, proliferative retinopathy or maculopathy requiring treatment, or history of recurrent severe hypoglycemia or hypoglycemia unawareness) or if they were pregnant or breastfeeding.</p></sec><sec id="jdi12569-sec-0008"><title>Trial procedures</title><p>Randomization to either IDegAsp or BIAsp 30 treatment (1:1) was carried out using a remote registration system (BELLSYSTEM24 Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Randomization was stratified by pre&#x02010;trial insulin treatment (pre&#x02010;mix human insulin, pre&#x02010;mix insulin analog and basal insulin). IDegAsp (70% IDeg and 30% IAsp, 100 U/mL; NovoPen<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 300; Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsv&#x000e6;rd, Denmark) or BIAsp 30 (NovoMix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 30, 100 U/mL; FlexPen<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Novo Nordisk A/S) was taken twice daily (before breakfast and before dinner) by subcutaneous injection for 6 weeks. For each participant, the total daily starting dose in units was the same as the pre&#x02010;trial total daily insulin dose, and the daily dose was divided into two approximately equal doses as judged by the investigator.</p><p>During the 6&#x02010;week treatment period, insulin doses were adjusted weekly at telephone or site visits based on pre&#x02010;breakfast and pre&#x02010;dinner self&#x02010;measured plasma glucose (SMPG) values with a target of 4.4&#x02013;7.2 mmol/L (80&#x02013;129 mg/dL). The breakfast insulin dose was adjusted based on the pre&#x02010;dinner SMPG, whereas the dinner insulin dose was adjusted based on the pre&#x02010;breakfast SMPG. As a guide to the investigator, the corresponding insulin dose was to increase by 1 U or 2 U in the case of pre&#x02010;breakfast or pre&#x02010;dinner SMPG values of 7.2&#x02013;8.8 mmol/L (130&#x02013;159 mg/dL) or &#x02265;8.9 mmol/L (&#x02265;160 mg/dL), respectively, whereas the corresponding insulin dose was to decrease by 1 U in the case of pre&#x02010;breakfast or pre&#x02010;dinner SMPG values &#x0003c;4.4 mmol/L (&#x0003c;80 mg/dL). Symptoms of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, previous responses to dose adjustments and other indicators of glycemic control were also taken into consideration during dose adjustment.</p></sec><sec id="jdi12569-sec-0009"><title>Assessments</title><p>FPG was assessed at baseline, 2 weeks and 6 weeks, and measured at a central laboratory (SRL Inc., Tokyo, Japan). A nine&#x02010;point SMPG profile (before and 120 min after the start of each meal, at bedtime, 03.00 h and pre&#x02010;breakfast the next day) was recorded at baseline and at the end of treatment. SMPG was measured by participants on capillary whole blood using supplied glucose meters and test strips providing plasma calibrated glucose values: Glutest AceR<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Glutest PRO R<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (both Sanwa&#x02010;Kagaku, Nagoya, Japan), Glucocard Diameter or Glucocard Diameter &#x003b1; (both Arkray KDK Corp, Kyoto, Japan).</p><p>The main safety assessment was hypoglycemia, classified as severe (if the participant was not able to treat him/herself), confirmed non&#x02010;severe (non&#x02010;severe and verified by a plasma glucose [PG] measurement of &#x0003c;3.1 mmol/L [&#x0003c;56 mg/dL]) or symptoms only (no PG measurement or PG &#x02265;3.1 mmol/L [&#x02265;56 mg/dL]). Nocturnal hypoglycemia was defined as an episode occurring between 23.00 h and 05.59 h (both inclusive). Additional safety measures included other adverse events, hematology and biochemistry laboratory tests carried out by a central laboratory (SRL Inc.), bodyweight, blood pressure, physical examination, and electrocardiogram.</p></sec><sec id="jdi12569-sec-0010"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary objective of the trial was to investigate the safety of switching unit&#x02010;to&#x02010;unit from twice&#x02010;daily basal or pre&#x02010;mix insulin therapy to twice&#x02010;daily IDegAsp treatment, with specific focus on hypoglycemia. Short&#x02010;term glucose control was included as a secondary objective. The sample size for this exploratory trial was small, and not based on statistical considerations. This should be taken into account when interpreting treatment differences and results of statistical analyses.</p><p>Safety evaluations were based on data from all randomized participants who received at least one dose of trial product (safety analysis set). The overall number of hypoglycemic episodes was analyzed and compared between treatments using a generalized linear model based on a negative binomial distribution. The model included the treatment group and pre&#x02010;trial insulin as fixed factors, and observation time as an offset variable. Rates of hypoglycemic episodes occurring each week as well as over a 24&#x02010;h period were calculated as the total number of hypoglycemic episodes divided by the overall exposure for all participants in the given time&#x02010;period. Rates of hypoglycemic episodes per week as well as over a 24&#x02010;h period were not analyzed statistically because of the small sample size.</p><p>Efficacy evaluations were based on data from all randomized and exposed participants with at least one time&#x02010;point of FPG or nine&#x02010;point SMPG profile after the start of treatment (full analysis set). The following end&#x02010;points were derived from the nine&#x02010;point SMPG profiles: PG at each time&#x02010;point, mean PG and mean postprandial PG increment for the three main meals together. The change in these end&#x02010;points and in FPG from baseline to end of treatment was analyzed using an analysis of variance (<sc>anova</sc>) model with treatment group and pre&#x02010;trial insulin as fixed factors, and baseline value as a covariate. The same statistical model was used to analyze change in insulin dose from baseline to the end of treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="jdi12569-sec-0011"><title>Results</title><sec id="jdi12569-sec-0012"><title>Patient disposition and baseline characteristics</title><p>Of the 69 patients screened, 66 patients were randomized to receive IDegAsp or BIAsp 30.

Thus, 33 patients were exposed to IDegAsp, and 32 patients were exposed to BIAsp 30. One patient in each treatment group withdrew during the first week of treatment, thus a total of 32 patients in the IDegAsp group and 31 patients in the BIAsp 30 group completed the trial (Figure <xref rid="jdi12569-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><fig fig-type="Figure" xml:lang="en" id="jdi12569-fig-0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Trial flow diagram.

Most of the participants used either pre&#x02010;mix human insulin (~62%) or pre&#x02010;mix insulin analog (~25%) before the trial, and the insulin dose split between breakfast and dinner was close to 50%/50% in both groups.</p><table-wrap id="jdi12569-tbl-0001" xml:lang="en" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demography and baseline characteristics</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><thead valign="top"><tr style="border-bottom:solid 1px #000000"><th align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">IDegAsp (<italic>n</italic> = 33)</th><th align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BIAsp 30 (<italic>n</italic> = 32)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="3" rowspan="1">Sex, <italic>n</italic> (%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10%" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male</td><td align="char" char=" " rowspan="1" colspan="1">24 (72.7)</td><td align="char" char=" " rowspan="1" colspan="1">18 (56.3)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10%" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Female</td><td align="char" char=" " rowspan="1" colspan="1">9 (27.3)</td><td align="char" char=" " rowspan="1" colspan="1">14 (43.8)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="char" char=" " rowspan="1" colspan="1">64.3 (8.4)</td><td align="char" char=" " rowspan="1" colspan="1">64.7 (11.2)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Bodyweight (kg)</td><td align="char" char=" " rowspan="1" colspan="1">61.2 (9.9)</td><td align="char" char=" " rowspan="1" colspan="1">57.3 (7.9)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</td><td align="char" char=" " rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.2 (2.9)</td><td align="char" char=" " rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.9 (2.3)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Duration of diabetes (years)</td><td align="char" char=" " rowspan="1" colspan="1">18.3 (9.1)</td><td align="char" char=" " rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.3 (8.7)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HbA<sub>1c</sub> (%)</td><td align="char" char=" " rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.4 (0.9)</td><td align="char" char=" " rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.4 (0.8)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FPG (mmol/L) (mg/dL)</td><td align="char" char=" " rowspan="1" colspan="1">

Overall rates of confirmed hypoglycemia and nocturnal confirmed hypoglycemia across the 6 weeks of treatment were not statistically significantly different between IDegAsp and BIAsp 30. No participants experienced severe hypoglycemia. There were no apparent differences between IDegAsp and BIAsp 30 with respect to adverse events and standard safety assessments. IDegAsp, as compared with BIAsp 30, was associated with improved glycemic control in terms of a statistically significant reduction in FPG and pre&#x02010;breakfast SMPG levels after 6 weeks of treatment, whereas the apparent reduction in postprandial PG increments did not differ statistically significantly between IDegAsp and BIAsp 30. Change in total daily insulin dose during the trial was not statistically significantly different between IDegAsp and BIAsp 30.</p><p>The present trial included a focused investigation of the safety associated with switching unit&#x02010;to&#x02010;unit from twice&#x02010;daily basal or pre&#x02010;mix insulin therapy to twice&#x02010;daily IDegAsp, with particular attention to hypoglycemic events. Hypoglycemia might occur more frequently at the point of switchover and in the period immediately after, and could therefore be a point of concern when patients switch from a current to a new insulin product. Thus, the results of the present trial are reassuring, indicating that the rate of all hypoglycemic episodes for IDegAsp was constant over the first 6 weeks of treatment, and that patients appeared to experience comparable rates of all hypoglycemic episodes for IDegAsp vs BIAsp 30 during each of the first 6 weeks of treatment after switching from their current insulin. There was no obvious indication that results on hypoglycemia or adverse events were dependent on pre&#x02010;trial insulin. However, it is important to emphasize that such subgroup summaries in a relatively small study should be interpreted with great caution.</p><p>In a study in Asian patients with type 2 diabetes, including Japanese patients, there were no statistically significant differences between IDegAsp and BIAsp 30 in confirmed hypoglycemia (rate ratio IDegAsp/BIAsp 30 of 1.00) and nocturnal confirmed hypoglycemia (rate ratio of 0.67)<xref rid="jdi12569-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>.

In the current study, estimated hypoglycemia rate ratios for IDegAsp vs BIAsp 30 were in between the aforementioned studies, and with no statistically significant treatment differences (Table <xref rid="jdi12569-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap">2</xref>). The observed discrepancies between studies could be due to the different populations, but might also reflect that the sample size determination of each individual study did not target the analysis of hypoglycemia. When including two of the studies<xref rid="jdi12569-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="jdi12569-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> in a pooled analysis, thereby increasing the sample size, rates of confirmed hypoglycemia and nocturnal confirmed hypoglycemia were statistically significantly lower by 19 and 57%, respectively, for IDegAsp vs BIAsp 30<xref rid="jdi12569-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>. Risk of hypoglycemia is a substantial point of concern when treating patients with diabetes. In a survey carried out globally among insulin&#x02010;treated patients with diabetes, also including Japan, approximately 70&#x02013;80% of physicians reported that their treatment aggressiveness is limited by the risk of hypoglycemia, that management of both efficacy and safety is difficult to accomplish at the same time, and that aggressive treatment of diabetes would be facilitated if their hypoglycemia concern was alleviated<xref rid="jdi12569-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>.</p><p>The statistically significantly greater reductions in FPG and in pre&#x02010;breakfast SMPG levels for IDegAsp vs BIAsp 30 observed in the present study are in accordance with results of a trial in Asian patients with type 2 diabetes, including Japanese patients<xref rid="jdi12569-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, as well as with findings from global studies in patients with type 2 diabetes<xref rid="jdi12569-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>, <xref rid="jdi12569-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>. It might seem contradictory that FPG and pre&#x02010;breakfast SMPG levels were significantly reduced with IDegAsp compared with BIAsp 30 when the titration target was the same for the two treatment groups. However, this might be explained by the differences in pharmacodynamic properties between IDegAsp and BIAsp 30. Thus, as a result of the shorter duration of action of BIAsp 30, titration of the dinner dose based on pre&#x02010;breakfast SMPG expectedly led to a greater dinner BIAsp 30 dose. Still, the dose increase with BIAsp 30 might have been somewhat limited by the &#x02018;shoulder&#x02019; effect of BIAsp 30 in the late evening hours. The findings overall show the full 24&#x02010;h basal coverage provided by IDegAsp compared with BIAsp 30. This is in accordance with the long duration of action of the IDeg component in IDegAsp compared with the protaminated fraction of IAsp in BIAsp 30<xref rid="jdi12569-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>. Along these lines, it is important to note that the rate of nocturnal hypoglycemia in the present study was generally low with IDegAsp. Thus, the statistically significantly greater reduction in FPG for IDegAsp than for BIAsp 30 was achieved concurrently with a low rate of nocturnal hypoglycemia. These combined benefits of IDegAsp are likely due to the long action, the flat and stable glucose&#x02010;lowering effect profile, and the low within&#x02010;subject day&#x02010;to&#x02010;day variability of the IDeg component<xref rid="jdi12569-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref>, <xref rid="jdi12569-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>.</p><p>Being an exploratory study, the current trial inherently carried some limitations, in particular the limited sample size, which implied that the results should be regarded as exploratory and hypothesis generating. Because of the exploratory nature of the current study, the applied titration guidance was conservative (pre&#x02010;breakfast and pre&#x02010;dinner SMPG target 4.4&#x02013;7.2 mmol/L) in comparison with the titration procedure used in the subsequent phase 3 trial in Asian patients (pre&#x02010;breakfast and pre&#x02010;dinner SMPG target 4.0&#x02013;4.9 mmol/L)<xref rid="jdi12569-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>. In light of this, it is reassuring that the subsequent larger phase 3 trial has confirmed the results of the present trial<xref rid="jdi12569-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>. Another limitation was the short treatment and observation period, implying that change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels during the trial could not be used as an efficacy end&#x02010;point, thus glycemic control in the present trial was based on FPG and SMPG assessment. Furthermore, the trial was open&#x02010;label because of the different appearance of the IDegAsp and BIAsp 30 formulations. Consequently, the possibility of underlying reporting bias could not be completely excluded, as it is likely that investigators are more cautious, and that patients are more alert when using a new treatment. Finally, we cannot exclude potential underestimation of nocturnal hypoglycemia, as hypoglycemia reporting was based on PG self&#x02010;measurement rather than continuous glucose monitoring. This should, however, have affected the treatment arms similarly.</p><p>In conclusion, in the present study, switching unit&#x02010;to&#x02010;unit from a basal insulin or pre&#x02010;mix insulin to IDegAsp twice daily was not associated with any safety concerns in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes. IDegAsp appears to be a safe and effective option for insulin treatment in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes. The findings of the current exploratory trial have been confirmed in larger trials with Japanese patients.</p></sec><sec id="jdi12569-sec-0018"><title>Disclosure</title><p>Yukiko Onishi has received clinical research grants from AbbVie, Astellas, Boehringer&#x02010;Ingelheim, Bristol&#x02010;Myers Squibb, GlaxoSmithKline, Novo Nordisk, Daiichi&#x02010;Sankyo, Sanwa Kagaku Kenkyusho, Shionogi and Taisho, and has received lecture honoraria from Astellas, AstraZeneca, Boehringer&#x02010;Ingelheim, Eli Lilly, Kyowa Hakko Kirin, MSD, Novo Nordisk, Sanofi and Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma.
