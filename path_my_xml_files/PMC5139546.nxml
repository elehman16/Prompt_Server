Herein, we compared the outcomes of tPRK with those of conventional PRK with respect to the postoperative pain, healing time and visual acuity recovery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>In this prospective, non-randomized, controlled trial, patients with mild to moderate myopia with or without astigmatism who underwent PRK between January 2013 and May 2013 were enrolled. Patients were divided into two groups; the case group for whom tPRK was performed and the age-matched control group who received conventional alcohol-assisted PRK. Mild myopia was defined as a spherical equivalent refraction of &#x02212;0.50 to &#x02212;3.00 D and moderate myopia as a spherical equivalent refraction between &#x02212;3.25 and &#x02212;6.00 D in at least one eye.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of Baqiyatallah university of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran and signed informed consent was obtained from all patients.</p><p>Patients were excluded if they failed to meet any of the above inclusion criteria or for the following reasons: unstable standard cycloplegic refraction, preoperative best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) less than 20/20, eyes unsuitable for PRK based on preoperative assessment of ocular topography e.g. corneal dystrophy with topographic irregularity, pellucid marginal degeneration, forme fruste keratoconus, corneal warpage, severe dry eye syndrome, previous corneal or intraocular surgery, history of current eyelid disease, or any form of keratitis. Patients were requested to discontinue contact lens wear for a minimum of 4 days (soft lenses) or a minimum of 3 weeks (rigid gas permeable lenses) prior to the preoperative evaluation.</p><p>All patients had a complete preoperative eye examination including uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) and BCVA assessment, manifest and cycloplegic refraction, slit lamp biomicroscopy (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG G&#x000f6;schwitzer Stra&#x000df;e, Jena, Germany) to evaluate the anterior segment and the fundus, and applanation tonometry.</p><p>All surgical procedures were performed by a single surgeon (M-N). After povidone iodine scrub was applied on the lashes and eyelids, a closed loop lid speculum equipped with suction was placed. One drop of proparacaine 0.50% was instilled in the eye. In the case group, laser ablative surgery was performed in a single step using the tPRK nomogram (Amaris laser's ORK-CAM software, SCHWIND eye-tech-solutions, Kleinostheim, Germany).</p><p>In the control group, 17% ethyl alcohol in an 8&#x02013;9 mm well was placed on the cornea for 15 seconds. Cornea was irrigated using balanced salt solution and dry polyvinyl alcohol sponge (Merocel; Beaver-Visitec International, Inc., Waltham, USA) was used to peel off the epithelium. Subsequently, laser ablation was done in both groups using ablation profile of the laser's software. The optical zone varied between 6.5 mm and 7mm in both groups, and the transition zone was calculated based on the patient's age, refractive error, and keratometric readings using the nomogram. Then, mitomycin C 0.02% was applied on the ablated stroma in corneas with an ablation depth of more than 30 &#x003bc;m. The duration of mitomycin C application was approximately 35 seconds.</p><p>After laser ablation, a high water content bandage contact lens Senofilcon A (Acuvue &#x000ae;; Johnson and Johnson Vision Care, Inc., Jacksonville, USA) was placed on the cornea and topical antibiotic and corticosteroid eye drops were instilled. Postoperatively, patients received betamethasone and chloramphenicol eye drops four times a day and preservative free artificial tears every two hours. Chloramphenicol eye drops were discontinued after one week, but betamethasone eye drops were tapered off over 4 to 6 weeks. Patients were followed up daily until the corneal epithelium completely healed. Epithelial healing was assessed daily at the slit lamp, with fluorescein staining when needed. The therapeutic contact lens was removed if there was no epithelial defect.</p><p>Postoperatively, visual acuity (expressed in logMAR) and refractive outcomes were analyzed at months 2 and 6. Furthermore, an examiner who was masked to the type of surgery performed postoperative examinations including manifest refraction and slit lamp examination. Moreover, a masked nurse interviewed the patients to record the pain score they had experienced at the postoperative day 1 using a 5-point Present Pain Intensity (PPI) scale of the standard long form McGill Pain Questionnaire (LF-MPQ). Accordingly, pain severity was scored as follows: 1 = mild, 2 = discomforting, 3 = distressing, 4 = horrible, 5 = excruciating. Corneal haze was graded according to a study by Fantes et al[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] as follows: 0 = no haze; 0.50 = trace haze on oblique illumination; 1 = corneal cloudiness not interfering with the visibility of fine iris details; 2 = mild dimness of fine iris details; 3 = moderate obliteration of iris details, 4 = details of the lens and iris not discernible.</p><p>Safety of the procedure was defined as the percentage of eyes losing more than 2 lines of BCVA. Safety index was considered as mean postoperative BCVA/mean preoperative BCVA ratio. Efficacy was defined as the percentage of the eyes achieving a UCVA of 0.50 LogMAR (20/40) or better postoperatively. Efficacy index was defined as mean postoperative UCVA/mean preoperative BCVA ratio.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software (version 18.0, SPSS, Inc., IBM, Chicago, IL, USA). An unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare the mean spherical equivalent (SE) refraction. The postoperative data were analyzed using Mann&#x02013;Whitney U test to compare the epithelial healing time and the postoperative pain scores between the study groups. P- values less than 0.05 were considered as significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Three hundred and forty eyes of 170 patients were enrolled in the study including 170 eyes of 85 patients in each group. The case group included 31 (36.5%) male and 54 (63.5%) female subjects with a mean age of 28 &#x000b1; 7 (range, 19&#x02013;51) years. The control group consisted of 28 (33%) male and 57 (67%) female patients, with a mean age of 28.3 &#x000b1; 7 (range, 19&#x02013;50) years. Mean preoperative spherical equivalent refraction was &#x02212;3.06 &#x000b1; 1.5 diopters (D) in the case group and &#x02212;2.9 &#x000b1; 1.9 D in the control group. There was no statistically significant difference in the baseline manifest refraction between the two groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.62). Mean preoperative BCVA (LogMAR) was 0.01 &#x000b1; 0.05 (&#x02243; 20/20) in the case group and 0.00 &#x000b1; 0.04 (&#x02243; 20/20) in the control group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.81).</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> show the postoperative results.

Mean efficacy index was 0.20 &#x000b1; 0.16 in the tPRK group and 0.13 &#x000b1; 0.9 in the conventional PRK group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01).

Despite this significant difference, the safety index approached 1.00 in the control group postoperatively, indicating that the visual outcome was satisfactory in this group. None of the patients were lost to follow-up. There were no early postoperative complications such as infection or recurrent erosion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The present study assessed the visual outcomes and safety of tPRK versus conventional PRK for low to moderate myopia. We found that tPRK was better than conventional PRK regarding epithelial healing time, postoperative pain, safety and efficacy indexes and visual acuity recovery.</p><p>In a recent study comparing tPRK and conventional PRK, the average period to complete healing was 2.5 days in the transepithelial group versus 3.7 days in the conventional PRK.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Similarly in the current study, the epithelial healing period was shorter in the cases than in the controls. It could be due to the difference in epithelial denuding area and ablation area between the two groups; in tPRK, the epithelial removal size is equal to the ablation size, whereas in the conventional PRK, the epithelial removal size is more than the ablation size that could defer re-epithelialization.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Patients&#x02019; perception of pain was another indicator for better postoperative outcome in the tPRK group in the present study. Fadlallah et al[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] found lower difference of pain score in the tPRK method compared to the conventional PRK. However, the pain score in their study was lower than our study. The major reason for the higher pain score in our study is the fact that we checked pain on the first postoperative day, while they reported pain score 48 hours postoperatively.</p><p>The rate of visual recovery was investigated and compared between the study groups. Fadlallah et al[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] reported significantly better UCVA in the tPRK group than in the PRK (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01) and LASIK (<italic>P</italic> = 0.008) groups. We found similar results as the tPRK group was superior to the conventional PRK group regarding UCVA at postoperative month 2. Lee et al[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] reported 27 patients who had laser epithelial keratomileusis (LASEK) in one eye and conventional PRK in the other eye for low to moderate myopia. Mean UCVA was 20/25 or better in 56% of patients three months after PRK. In our study, we noticed the UCVA of &#x02265;20/25 in 84.7% of patients in the control group two months after PRK. It may be concluded that better visual acuity and faster visual recovery after tPRK in the present study were seemingly due to the absence of epithelial removal in this group.</p><p>Carones et al[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] reported lower corneal haze at one month and better corneal regularity index at 3 months in eyes in which the epithelium was removed using 20% alcohol. Similar method was used in our study in the conventional PRK group. However, when the mean change in the postoperative UCVA was compared with the preoperative BCVA, a significant difference was noticed after tPRK compared with conventional PRK. These results suggest that tPRK may give slightly better overall visual outcomes than conventional PRK for low to moderate myopia.</p><p>There was a significant difference between the safety and efficacy indexes between the two groups at 2 months which showed superiority of tPRK group versus conventional PRK group in short term period. Conversely, the conventional PRK group showed a slightly better UCVA than the tPRK group at 6 months; however this difference was not statistically significant.</p><p>The current study had a few limitations. We evaluated pain intensity only on postoperative day one. Pain typically peaks during the first 24 hours after PRK surgery, and subsides after approximately 3 days, coinciding with corneal re-epithelialization.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Secondly, the size of epithelial defects and the rate of epithelial healing were not assessed by an image analysis software which could be more reliable. Thirdly, we did not randomize the patients into two groups; the type of the procedure was chosen based on the patient's preference (after detailed description of the methods and procedures). The strengths of our study included a large sample size, stability of vision after six months and no reports pertaining adverse events in patient associated with any of the treatment methods.</p><p>In conclusion, this study highlighted the advantages of tPRK technique using Schwind Amaris nomogram over conventional PRK. Transepithelial PRK seems to be a safe and effective technique for treatment of mild to moderate myopia. A randomized prospective study with a longer follow-up period is required to confirm the results of the current study.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial Support and Sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Trokel</surname><given-names>SL</given-names></name><name><surname>Srinivasan</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Braren</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Excimer laser surgery of the cornea</article-title><source>Am J Ophthalmol</source><year>1983</year><volume>96</volume><fpage>710</fpage><lpage>715</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">6660257</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Seiler</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Holschbach</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Derse</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Jean</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Genth</surname><given-names>U</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Complications of myopic photorefractive keratectomy with the excimer laser</article-title><source>Ophthalmology</source><year>1994</year><volume>101</volume><fpage>153</fpage><lpage>160</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8302549</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gartry</surname><given-names>DS</given-names></name><name><surname>Kerr Muir</surname><given-names>MG</given-names></name><name><surname>Marshall</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy;
