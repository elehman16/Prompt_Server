Dystonia is characterised by motor manifestations, primarily sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal, often repetitive, movements, postures or both.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Cervical dystonia (CD), the most common form of focal dystonia, is characterised by sustained involuntary muscle contraction and/or twitching of cervical musculature resulting in abnormal postures and repetitive movements of the head.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Depending on the muscles involved, the following head positions or combination of head positions, may occur: torticollis (rotation), laterocollis (tilting), anterocollis (flexion) and retrocollis (extension).<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> CD may be accompanied by pulling or stiffness, pain and sensory symptoms in the affected area.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The diagnosis of CD is based on clinical signs and symptoms: deviation in head/neck posture; involuntary neck movements resulting in turn, tilt and/or shoulder elevation; and neck pain.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Besides the clinical problems of involuntary abnormal postures and repetitive movements frequently associated with pain, patients with CD present with a wide range of social disabilities and impairments in health-related quality of life (HRQOL).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> HRQOL is defined as the subjective perception of the impact of health status, including disease and treatment, on physical, psychological and social functioning and well-being.</p><p>Recognising the critical link between physical and psychological health allows a more holistic approach to patient care. By measuring HRQOL, we can ascertain the effects of a disease on individuals from the patient perspective and, thereafter, to some extent, be able to judge the benefit of therapeutic interventions. With CD, several physical and emotional factors such as reduced mobility, pain, low self-esteem, embarrassment, depression, anxiety and limited social interaction may be present. Pain is a predominant feature of CD and is reported in up to 75% of patients<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and is associated with reduced HRQOL. A study conducted by Degirmenci <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> evaluated anxiety and depression in dystonia patients using the Hospital Anxiety Depression (HAD) scale and assessed quality of life using the SF-36 Health Survey (SF-36), a general measure widely used to assess HRQOL. Mean Anxiety and Depression subscale scores were higher in patients with dystonia when compared with the control group. Moreover, patients with dystonia had worse (lower) SF-36 scores for all domains when compared with controls.</p><p>AbobotulinumtoxinA (Dysport) 500 U was compared with placebo in two multicenter, double-blinded, randomised trials: one international<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and one in the USA.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The international study included the SF-36 to evaluate treatment benefit with 500 U abobotulinumtoxinA compared with placebo as a secondary end point. As a result of the tremendous amount of research conducted using the SF-36 over the past two decades, population norms are available that can facilitate the interpretation of research results across a wide variety of patient populations, putting specific study data into &#x02018;larger context.&#x02019;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In order to understand the HRQOL impairment unique to CD, SF-36 scores for the study sample were compared with other published scores for populations with various neurological conditions, in particular Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis; like CD, these conditions are generally progressive and affect motor and non-motor function. Specifically, because the HRQOL impairment of Parkinson's disease and that of multiple sclerosis have been well established,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> these conditions were deemed appropriate comparisons in evaluating the unique nature of HRQOL impairment due to CD.</p><p>Botulinum toxin (BoNT), a treatment with established safety and efficacy, has been recommended as first-line treatment for symptoms of CD.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> No botulinum toxin is indicated for improving HRQOL in CD. The reported benefits from BoNT are relief from pain, increased range of free movement and improved resting posture.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> BoNT injections typically offer temporary relief, and the symptoms gradually return. For CD, as for most other neurological disorders, more data exist regarding the efficacy of the Botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) compared with type B. BoNT-A and BoNT-B have been shown to reduce both symptom severity and pain.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Currently, there are three major commercially available preparations of type A toxins: abobotulinumtoxinA (Dysport (Ipsen Biopharm Ltd, Wrexham, UK)), onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox (Allergan, Inc; Irvine, California, USA)) and incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin (Merz Pharmaceuticals GmbH; Frankfurt am Main, Germany). The potency units of abobotulinumtoxinA are specific to the preparation and assay method utilised. They are not interchangeable with other preparations of botulinum toxin products and, therefore, units of biological activity of one BoNT product cannot be compared to or converted into units of any other botulinum toxin products. Accordingly, information regarding the specific benefits of a particular BoNT-A preparation and the impact on HRQOL would be valuable.</p><p>The objectives of this article are to describe the HRQOL burden of CD, as measured at baseline in a previously reported randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pivotal clinical study,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> as well as report on the HRQOL and treatment benefits of abobotulinumtoxinA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>The study design has been reported previously.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> An international, multicenter (movement disorder clinics in the USA (n=16) and Russia (n=4)), double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial was conducted between 10 October 2005 and 7 September 2006 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single injection of abobotulinumtoxinA for the treatment of CD. To be eligible for study entry, patients had to have a diagnosis of CD with symptoms for at least 18&#x02005;months, as well as the following baseline Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) scores: a total score of at least 30; a Severity domain score of at least 15; and a Disability domain score of at least 3. The TWSTRS is an assessment of CD that includes a total CD rating score and three domain scores (Torticollis Severity, Disability and Pain).</p><p>Key exclusion criteria were standard for efficacy trials of BoNT and included treatment with BoNT-A or BoNT-B within 16&#x02005;weeks of enrolment, any disease of the neuromuscular junction, previous phenol injection to the neck muscles, myotomy or denervation surgery in the neck/shoulder region, cervical contracture, suspected secondary non-responsiveness or a history of poor response to BoNT-A, pure anterocollis or retrocollis, symptom remission at screening, symptoms that could interfere with TWSTRS scoring or BoNT-A neutralising antibodies.</p><p>A total of 120 patients were to be recruited in the study to allow for 47 patients per treatment group to be evaluable on the primary efficacy end point (TWSTRS).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Patients were randomised using a pregenerated randomisation code in a 1:1 ratio to receive an intramuscular injection of either 500 U abobotulinumtoxinA or placebo. Study medication was administered in a double-blind manner by intramuscular injection into two, three or four clinically indicated neck muscles during a single dosing session at baseline. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was reviewed by the ethics committee responsible for each site. All patients provided written, informed, institutional review board&#x02013;approved consent before participation.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Assessments</title><p>Assessments have been described previously.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The TWSTRS was determined at week 0 (baseline), at week 4 (primary), and at weeks 8 and 12 (post-treatment) by investigators trained in TWSTRS scoring. Pain was evaluated with the pain domain of the TWSTRS and a self-reported visual analogue scale (VAS) assessing pain in the past 24&#x02005;h. Participants completed the pain VAS at baseline and week 4.</p><p>HRQOL was assessed using the SF-36, V.1.0. The SF-36 is a commonly used health profile that contains 36 items and includes multi-item domains to measure health status across eight dimensions: Physical Functioning, Role Limitations due to Physical Health Problems (Role Physical), Bodily Pain, Social Functioning, General Mental Health, Role Limitations due to Emotional Problems (Role Emotional), Vitality and General Health Perceptions. Responses to questions within each domain are summed and transformed to a scale ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores suggesting better functioning. Participants completed the SF-36 at week 0 (baseline; prior to dosing) and at week 8 (post-treatment). SF-36 scores were generated according to published algorithms.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>Safety assessments included incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, ECG, neurological and physical examinations and vital signs.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Statistical analyses</title><sec id="s2c1"><title>Burden of CD</title><p>Population norms are available for the SF-36 that can facilitate the interpretation of research results across a wide variety of patient populations.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The unique burden of illness associated with CD was assessed by comparing patients&#x02019; baseline domain scores (regardless of enrolment location) to age-adjusted and gender-adjusted SF-36 domain scores for the US population norms.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The 95% CI was computed for the baseline SF-36 scores relative to the age-adjusted and gender-adjusted US population norms.</p><p>For comparisons relative to other neurological conditions, baseline SF-36 scores for the study sample were compared with other published scores for populations with Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis.

Similarly, patients with CD reported experiencing significantly more pain than the age-adjusted and gender-adjusted US norm on study entry, with Bodily Pain scores that were 23% points lower (worse) for patients with CD than the US norms (47.7 vs 71.3, p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2014005150TB2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Mean SF-36 scores for the normative US population and patients with cervical dystonia, Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SF-36 domain</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cervical dystonia<break/>study sample<break/>(n=116)<break/>Mean (SD)*</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">US normative<break/>sample&#x02020;<break/>Mean</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Parkinson's<break/>disease&#x02021;<break/>(n=150)<break/>Mean</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Multiple<break/>sclerosis&#x000a7;<break/>(n=300)<break/>Mean (SD)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Physical Functioning</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">67.2 (22.2)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">79.7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">50.4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">40.5 (30.2)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Role Physical</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">52.4 (29.5)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">76.6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">24.0 (36.8)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Bodily Pain</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">47.7 (21.6)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">71.3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">59.9</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">59.5 (27.2)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">General Health</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">61.4 (19.7)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">68.6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">51.5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">51.7 (24.1)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Vitality</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">50.6 (18.1)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">60.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">46.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">35.1 (21.7)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Social Functioning</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">64.8 (24.6)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">82.0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">57.3 (27.6)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Role Emotional</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">68.8 (27.1)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">80.6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">49.0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">56.1 (44.9)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mental Health</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">64.1 (18.4)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">74.8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">67.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">67.1 (20.8)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>*Baseline domain scores significantly lower than age-adjusted and gender-adjusted general US population norm for all domains (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p></fn><fn><p>&#x02020;Age-adjusted and gender-adjusted US norms.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p></fn><fn><p>&#x02021;Damiano <italic>et al.</italic><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p></fn><fn><p>&#x000a7;Hopman <italic>et al.</italic><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p></fn><fn><p>SF-36, SF-36 Health Survey; US, USA.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Like individuals with CD, patients with Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis report substantial impairments in HRQOL relative to US norms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2014005150TB2">table 2</xref>).

Camfield<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> conducted a survey of 150 patients with CD that included the SF-36 and the Beck anxiety and depression indexes. Patients with CD had lower scores in all eight SF-36 domains compared with controls in the UK, particularly in the Role Physical (41.6 vs 85.8), Bodily Pain (54.6 vs 81.5) and General Health (46.2 vs 73.5) domains. Domain scores were comparable to data from patients with mild-to-moderate multiple sclerosis and moderate epilepsy. Our results are similar to those of Camfield,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> in that baseline scores for patients with CD were lower (worse) than for US normative data, particularly for the Role Physical (52.4 vs 76.6) and Bodily Pain (47.7 vs 71.3) domains. Our findings support the implication that CD has a significant impact on health status that is comparable with other neurological disorders of high morbidity. CD appears to have a disproportionate negative impact on patients&#x02019; physical role limitation, despite their good physical functioning. One possible explanation is that pain limits such activities. Another possibility is that patients with CD consciously limit activities that make their dystonia visible to others to avoid mockery.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>A few studies have investigated the impact of CD on HRQOL and factors modifying a patient's ability to cope with this disease. Slawek <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> conducted an HRQOL survey study in 101 patients previously treated with BoNT-A using the TWSTRS, a pain VAS (0&#x02013;100%), the SF-36 and the Montgomery-&#x000c5;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Patients&#x02019; baseline SF-36 scores were worse than those of healthy controls in all eight SF-36 domains. Improvements were observed 4&#x02005;weeks after the single BoNT-A injections in all SF-36 domains, and in the VAS, TWSTRS and MADRS scores. The TWSTRS results did not correlate with any of the SF-36 domains. Longer treatment with BoNT-A was associated with better scores. Hefter <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> conducted a prospective, open-label study of abobotulinumtoxinA in 516 de novo CD patients using the TWSTRS, the Craniocervical Dystonia Questionnaire (CDQ-24), patient diaries and a global assessment of pain. In contrast with the SF-36, which is a general measure of HRQOL, the CDQ-24 is a disease-specific questionnaire that evaluates HRQOL in patients with CD.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The CDQ-24 has five subscales: Stigma, Emotional Well-being, Pain, Activities of Daily Living and Social/Family Life. At week 4, significant improvements were observed in CDQ-24 total and subscale scores that were sustained up to week 12. Significant reductions in patient diary item scores for activities of daily living, pain, and pain duration at week 4 and 12 were observed. Sixty-six per cent of patients reported pain relief (less or no pain) at week 4 and 74% at week 12. Improvements in quality of life and pain intensity for up to 12&#x02005;weeks in patients with CD were observed after treatment with abobotulinumtoxinA.</p><p>Likewise, in our findings, patients treated with abobotulinumtoxinA reported significantly greater improvements in TWSTRS total mean scores at weeks 4, 8 and 12 (p&#x02264;0.019) compared with placebo.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Improvements from baseline to week 8 were observed for all eight SF-36 domains in the abobotulinumtoxinA group, whereas the placebo group either stayed the same or became worse (with a decline in physical functioning). In this study, the SF-36 results did correlate with the TWSTRS for the Role Physical and Bodily Pain domains across treatment groups and time periods. AbobotulinumtoxinA was well tolerated in this study, as previously published.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Our study is not without limitations that should be considered. First, the exclusion of those with suspected secondary non-responsiveness or a history of poor response to BoNT-A may have excluded those who might not experience a positive change in their HRQOL. Second, the size of this study was small. Studies with a larger sample size are required to demonstrate the outcomes of abobotulinumtoxinA treatment in a study population that is more representative of the general population. Lastly, there were quite a few withdrawals from the study, which could affect overall findings. There were a total of 33 patients (abobotulinumtoxinA n=10; placebo n=23) who discontinued the study, two-thirds of whom were in the placebo group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>CD has a marked impact on HRQOL for patients.
