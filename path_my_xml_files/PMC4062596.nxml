Primary antibodies employed were CRH rabbit polyclonal (Abcam) and SFTPB rabbit polyclonal (Millipore). Unstained paraffin sections were deparaffinized in four changes of xylene for five minutes each and rehydrated through a series of graded alcohols with a final rinse in distilled water. Endogenous peroxidase was quenched by soaking sections in two solutions of 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in methanol for 10 min at room temperature. Prior to staining, antigen retrieval was performed to facilitate antibody binding to antigen. Slides were incubated at 99&#x000b0;C under pressure for 30 min in either Tris-EDTA buffer pH 8.0 (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO). No antigen retrieval step was required for staining with anti-SFTPB. Slides were then allowed to cool down for 10 min in the same solution, rinsed in three changes of distilled water, and placed in Tris Buffered Saline with Tween 20 pH 7.4 (Signet Pathology Systems, Inc., Dedham, MA) for five min to decrease surface tension and facilitate coating by the subsequent reagents. The PolyVue HRP/DAB non-biotin polymer detection system (Diagnostic Biosystems, Pleasanton, CA) was used in the immunostaining protocols for CRH, while the Rabbit-on-rodent Detection System (Biocare Medical, Concord, CA) was used for SFTPB. Incubations occurred at room temperature unless otherwise specified, and for each step the sections were coated with 200 micro-liters of reagent. Tris buffered saline with Tween 20 pH 7.4 was used to rinse the sections between each of the immunohistochemistry steps. Background Sniper solution (Biocare Medical, Concord, CA) was used to block non-specific staining for 10 min at room temperature. The Primary antibody was diluted using Renaissance antibody diluents (Biocare Medical, Concord, CA), at a dilution of 1:400 for CRH, and 1:2000 for SFTPB. Slides were incubated with the primary antibody solution overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Sections were then incubated in the universal secondary antibody provided with the kit for 15 min, followed by the HRP label reagent. Afterwards, Stable DAB Plus (Diagnostic Biosystems, Pleasanton, CA) was applied for 5 minutes as chromagen.

We have demonstrated that administration of antenatal glucocorticoids (dex) and postnatal surfactant significantly improve neonatal RDS and survival in an <italic>Erk3</italic> null murine model.</p><p id="P21">These studies have necessitated several technical innovations which are of likely interest to translational investigators, including neonatal drug inhalation. In a pilot study to determine the best method of surfactant administration, we initially tested three distinct techniques. The only published literature of drug instillation techniques in mice employs significantly larger juvenile or adult animals (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Intubation and tracheostomy proved infeasible due to the newborn pups&#x02019; small size. Drug administration itself could also be fatal. We initially attempted to modify the tracheal installation technique used in adult mice on our pups (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) using a syringe with an 26 gauge needle to inject surfactant through the neck directly into the trachea, but found that mortality was high with this technique. The use of nasal instillation, wherein surfactant or saline is administered through the nares, was similarly unsuccessful. Administration time was 60 min for half of the dose, and the pups became hypothermic and many died during the treatment. Finally, we modified the inhalation intubation technique (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Using a micropipette, we placed the semiflexible blunted pipette tip as close to the trachea as possible through the pups&#x02019; open mouths and administered the solution (saline or surfactant). We found that if the administered solution was delivered to the lungs, bubbles would arise from the nares. To further confirm pulmonary surfactant delivery, we stained the saline or surfactant solution with indigo carmine and were able to visualize the color at the level of the lungs through their skin. While we found that the inhalation intubation technique is reproducible, we cannot verify that all of the dosage reached the lungs. In published studies using this technique in adult mice, approximately 85% enters the lungs (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). These results are comparable to intratracheal injection (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p id="P22">We used Survanta, a pulmonary surfactant suspension from natural bovine lung extract containing phospholipids, neutral lipids, fatty acids and surfactant-associated proteins SFTPB and SFTPC. It does not contain SFTPA (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). We chose this solution because Survanta has the lowest concentration of surfactant protein B. Survanta contains 25 mg phospholipids per ml of solution (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Current published studies reference surfactant dosages from 50 to 200 mg/kg in adult mice and there is no significant difference in dose response (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). We therefore selected the lowest recommended dose, 50 mg/kg of the phospholipid component, in order to administer the lowest possible volume (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) as it is less traumatic to the pups. Similarly, we moved the administration of antenatal glucocorticoid from E16.5 and E17.5 used in previous studies (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) to E17.5 and E18.5 to more closely correspond with the saccular stage of lung development. This is the same stage when glucocorticoids are used in human development to improve lung maturity for preterm infants (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p><p id="P23">We have previously demonstrated uniform neonatal lethality due to lung immaturity by 6 hours of age among <italic>Erk3</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> pups <sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. With the introduction of surfactant among all groups of Erk3 null pups, neonatal surfactant with antenatal dexamethasone resulted in enhanced survival. Our observation of partial phenotypic abrogation with antenatal glucocorticoid administration and postnatal surfactant administration provides strong evidence for an <italic>Erk3</italic> pathway of type II pneumocyte differentiation and maturation.</p><p id="P24">In our previous publication, histological analysis of <italic>Erk3</italic>-deficient lungs revealed that overall organogenesis of the lungs was preserved and there were no obvious defects in branching morphogenesis (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). We therefore sought to now assess the differentiation of type II pneumocytes by analyzing the expression of pulmonary surfactant associated protein C (SFTPC) and measuring the content of cytoplasmic glycogen, which serves as a substrate for surfactant phospholipids (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), in lungs from E18.5 embryos. Immunoreactive SFTPC was not altered in <italic>Erk3</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. This is in accordance with our prior ultra-structural analysis by electron microscopy revealing that type II pneumocytes from <italic>Erk3 null</italic> mutant mice contain abundant glycogen granules (qualitative and quantitative) as compared to controls. Antenatal glucocorticoids partially rescued type II pneumocyte differentiation restoring glycogen levels to those of normal WT mice. Nevertheless, they had no effect on neonatal morbidity nor did they rescue <italic>Erk3</italic>-mediated modification of fetal growth potential.</p><p id="P25">In this publication we have further characterized lung histology of <italic>Erk3</italic> null mice demonstrating that their lethality is related to the classic histology described in RDS in humans. The replacement of surfactant in this mouse model, restored the glycogen content of type II pneumocytes to normal levels, and improved their architecture. The discrepancy between the data presented herein (showing no difference between dexamethasone alone and saline controls in terms of airspace area) compared to our prior published data (demonstrating distinctions in the airspace area between dexamethasone and saline in WT lungs) likely relates to the time of collection of the neonatal lungs. Specifically, in our prior study, pups were delivered by cesarean at E18.5 and sacrificed immediately in order to study the <italic>in utero</italic> variation. In the current study, our aim was to allow for surfactant administration and thus pups were delivered vaginally and tissue was collected at the time of scheduled postnatal/neonatal sacrifice (<italic>i.e.,</italic> 3 hours of age and greater). Thus the pups insulflated their lungs, resulting in the equivalency shown herein. Although the surfactant effect on survival nadirs after 24 hours, taken together these findings suggest that <italic>Erk3</italic> is integral to terminal differentiation of type II cells, SFTPB production, and fetal pulmonary maturity in the immediate perinatal interval.</p><p id="P26">The association of the attenuation of pulmonary CRH by administration of glucocorticoids is consistent with data from an unrelated mouse model of CRH deficiency (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) suggesting a fetal glucocorticoid requirement for lung maturation (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Postnatally, the CRH KO mice demonstrated normal growth and longevity, suggesting that the major role of glucocorticoid is during fetal rather than postnatal life. The attenuation of pulmonary CRH in our <italic>Erk3</italic> null mice combined with published data in humans showing high levels of CRH in maternal serum correlating with fetal lung maturity suggests the existence of a feedback loop between CRH and fetal lung maturation. Moreover it indicates that CRH is a significant molecular mediator of pulmonary maturation.</p><p id="P27">CRH has been put forward as a key neuroendocrine modulator of pregnancy and parturition (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). During mid-gestation there is a rapid increase in the concentration of CRH in the maternal plasma (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). This occurs alongside production of surfactant in the fetal human lung beginning after week 24 of gestation, which corresponds to the saccular stage of lung development and the earliest consistently documented threshold of viability. The second peak in CRH concentration occurs during the last few weeks of pregnancy (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). In groups matched by gestational age in proximity to term, larger mean values of CRH are observed among neonates in which the lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio was greater than 2 or the phosphatidylglycerol test for lung maturity was positive (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). These could explain a possible relationship between the peaks in CRH in human maternal plasma with the attenuation of CRH in the lungs that we find in our murine model. Further work is needed to discover what cells are producing or expressing CRH at the level of the lung and to continue to discover other molecular mediators of glucocorticoid-induced lung maturation.</p><p id="P28">In sum, we have demonstrated that neonatal surfactant combined with antenatal glucocorticoids enhances neonatal RDS-free survival in a murine model of <italic>Erk3</italic>-dependent pulmonary maturation and neonatal survival. Therefore, a likely explanation (but not mechanistically demonstrated <italic>per se</italic>) is that the treatment with antenatal dexamethasone partially restored functional fetal lung maturation by accelerating the down regulation of pulmonary CRH (<italic>Erk3</italic> indirect or independent effect because we also demonstrated attenuation in <italic>Erk3</italic> WT) and administration of postnatal surfactant partially rescued endogenous production of SFTPB (<italic>Erk3</italic> dependent). Collectively, our results suggest a functional role to the elusive atypical MAP kinase Erk3, demonstrating its essential function in terminal functional differentiation of type II pneumocytes and SFTPB production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p id="P29">To date, no treatment completely prevents nor ameliorates RDS, and therapy is both costly and of limited benefit. Thus, there is a need to explore additional pathways to facilitate new therapeutic developments in this arena. Ongoing work to further elucidate the relationship of Erk3 with the development of RDS and SFTPB is one pathway which may lead to these developments. It is also unclear to what extent regulatory networks involved in type II cell maturation are involved in alveolar repair and reconstitution of surfactant homeostasis (<italic>i.e.</italic> bronchopulmonary dysplasia). Our described work herein will lay the foundation for these and future studies.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="conflict"><p id="P30"><bold>Disclosure statement:</bold> No financial ties to products in the study or potential/perceived conflicts of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ack id="S17"><p id="P31"><bold>Statement of Financial Support:</bold> This work was supported by National Institute of Health (NIH) Director New Innovator Pioneer Award (Kjersti Aagaard), USA and National Institute of Child Health and Human Development NICHD-March of Dimes Reproductive Scientist Development Program (Kjersti Aagaard), USA.

id="P32">In the time line the green squares demark the time point for interventions. With the verification of pregnancy indicated by the presence of vaginal plug on E0.5, timing of antenatal administration of dex/saline as thereafter designated. Birth uniformly occurred on E19&#x02013;19.5, and deliveries were attended in order for the pups to be weighed, marked, and precise timing for rate of live birth survival to be calculated. The initial dose of surfactant or saline control was administered at the time of birth. Ongoing direct investigator observation and identification of neonatal demise versus survival occurred at the indicated time points (black lettering). As noted, this occurred every 2 hours for the first 6 hours of life, then at 6 hour intervals through 48 hours. The light blue squares list each group definition. In all groups dams received dex or saline then newborn pups of group 1 and 2 received 1 dose of surfactant, but in group 1 organs were harvested at 24 h and in group 2 organs were harvested at 72 h. In contrast group 3 received 3 doses of surfactant/saline every 12 h and organs were harvested at 1 week. Rate of survival was calculated at 24 hours (Group 1), 72 hours (Group 2) and 7 days (Group 3). Genotyping occurred at the time of neonatal sacrifice, thus investigators were blinded to genotyping during the course of the experiment.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms560357f1"/></fig><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Enhanced free-RDS survival of <italic>Erk3</italic> KO with dexamethasone/surfactant administration</title><p id="P33">Survival curves where Y axis represents survival in percentages and X axis represents time in hours, green represents saline/saline, orange is dex/saline and light blue is dex/surfactant. <bold>(A)</bold>
