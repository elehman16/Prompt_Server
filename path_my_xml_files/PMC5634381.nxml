It is incurable and has significant psychosocial and economic impacts on the affected individuals. AD etiology has been linked to deficiencies in the skin barrier protein, filaggrin. In mammalian skin, <sc>l</sc>-histidine is rapidly incorporated into filaggrin. Subsequent filaggrin proteolysis releases <sc>l</sc>-histidine as an important natural moisturizing factor (NMF). In vitro studies were conducted to investigate the influence of <sc>l</sc>-histidine on filaggrin processing and barrier function in human skin-equivalent models. Our further aim was to examine the effects of daily oral <sc>l</sc>-histidine supplementation on disease severity in adult AD patients. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, nutritional supplementation pilot study to explore the effects of oral <sc>l</sc>-histidine in adult AD patients (n=24). In vitro studies demonstrated that <sc>l</sc>-histidine significantly increased both filaggrin formation and skin barrier function (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01, respectively). Data from the clinical study indicated that once daily oral <sc>l</sc>-histidine significantly reduced (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.003) AD disease severity by 34% (physician assessment using the SCORingAD tool) and 39% (patient self-assessment using the Patient Oriented Eczema Measure tool) after 4 weeks of treatment. No improvement was noted with the placebo (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.32). The clinical effect of oral <sc>l</sc>-histidine in AD was similar to that of mid-potency topical corticosteroids and combined with its safety profile suggests that it may be a safe, nonsteroidal approach suitable for long-term use in skin conditions that are associated with filaggrin deficits such as AD.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>atopic dermatitis</kwd><kwd>eczema</kwd><kwd>filaggrin</kwd><kwd><sc>l</sc>-histidine</kwd><kwd>amino acid</kwd><kwd>skin barrier</kwd><kwd>nutritional supplement</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common, incurable, chronic inflammatory skin condition with a high prevalence in infants that causes considerable reduction in quality of life.<xref rid="b1-ccid-10-403" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b4-ccid-10-403" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Despite its prevalence and morbidity, few targeted therapies currently exist for AD.

Immunosuppressants such as cyclosporin A and azathioprine also have serious potential side effects including hematological abnormalities, predisposition to life-threatening infections, liver and renal failure, therefore requiring intensive monitoring by the supervising doctor.<xref rid="b5-ccid-10-403" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b36-ccid-10-403" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Given the high prevalence of AD (up to 16% of children<xref rid="b1-ccid-10-403" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and 10% of adults<xref rid="b2-ccid-10-403" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> worldwide), these adverse effects impose a considerable burden on the individual patient and a high financial cost for health care systems and society. Clinical trials are currently being undertaken with biologic agents acting on elements of the immune system, but if effective, these will be expensive and are likely to be limited to the most severe and treatment-resistant AD. Concerns over the safety of this class of agents continue, particularly over increased infection risks and malignancy.<xref rid="b5-ccid-10-403" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b36-ccid-10-403" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> A large unmet clinical need therefore remains for safe, convenient, targeted nonsteroidal interventions suitable for long-term use in the management of AD, particularly in children.</p><p>HaCaT monolayers grown in <sc>l</sc>-histidine-enriched media were associated with significantly increased expression of the 37 kDa filaggrin monomers relative to the 120 kDa filaggrin intermediate. No increase in the expression of the filaggrin monomers was seen with media enriched with <sc>l</sc>-lysine and <sc>d</sc>-histidine, the structurally similar but biologically inactive isomers of <sc>l</sc>-histidine. The mechanism by which <sc>l</sc>-histidine enhanced filaggrin processing in an enantiomer-specific manner is unclear, although <sc>l</sc>-histidine is a common participant in enzymatic reactions<xref rid="b37-ccid-10-403" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> owing to the amphotericity of its imidazole side chain.</p><p>The 37 kDa filaggrin monomers are intermediate products of filaggrin proteolysis which are further degraded into smaller filaggrin peptide fragments by proteases including calpain-1 and caspase-14 and finally into free amino acids by bleomycin hydrolase.<xref rid="b38-ccid-10-403" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Increased formation of the 37 kDa filaggrin monomers by <sc>l</sc>-histidine would be expected to improve keratin aggregation and lead to increased levels of free amino acid NMF components. <sc>l</sc>-histidine is hygroscopic, and this ability to capture and retain water makes it an important component of the NMF.<xref rid="b14-ccid-10-403" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The ability of <sc>l</sc>-histidine to increase filaggrin processing with consequent enhancement of skin barrier function is supported by our finding that skin equivalents grown in <sc>l</sc>-histidine-enriched media were more resistant to penetration by Lucifer Yellow fluorescent dye. The observed effect may be due to either improvement in keratin aggregation or increased level of NMF in the skin models due to increased substrate (i.e., more filaggrin monomers) availability for proteolytic degradation, or both. In individuals with wild-type <italic>FLG</italic> or heterozygous loss-of-function <italic>FLG</italic> mutations, <sc>l</sc>-histidine may improve the disease symptoms by enhancing filaggrin formation and supplement NMF production, whilst in patients with homozygous <italic>FLG</italic> mutations, <sc>l</sc>-histidine may increase the amount of NMF in the skin. In all cases, enhancement of filaggrin formation and/or supplementing NMF would be expected to enhance skin barrier function and reduce the disease burden of AD.</p><p>The use of primary human keratinocytes instead of HaCaT cells for the barrier function assay may be argued to be more &#x0201c;physiological&#x0201d;. However, our in-house skin-equivalent model is an adaptation of the technique demonstrated by Schoop et al,<xref rid="b39-ccid-10-403" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> who have shown that HaCaT cells, cultured at an air&#x02013;liquid interface on various matrixes serving as dermal equivalents, can be used to generate highly differentiated organotypic skin-equivalent structures in vitro. Unlike primary keratinocytes which are normally derived from human foreskin samples, the HaCaT cell line is of standardized quality as it is independent of donor variations.</p><p>The clinical nutritional supplementation pilot study suggests that oral <sc>l</sc>-histidine, administered once daily over a period of 4 weeks, is associated with improvement in the clinical signs and symptoms of adult AD patients. In both clinician-scored (SCORAD) and patient-scored (POEM) measures of disease severity, there was an ~40% decrease in AD activity over 4 weeks of treatment which is similar to that reported from using mid-potency (Group III) topical corticosteroids.<xref rid="b40-ccid-10-403" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> The beneficial effects seen in Group A patients persisted for several weeks following crossover from <sc>l</sc>-histidine to the placebo suggesting a prolonged benefit of the <sc>l</sc>-histidine treatment. Importantly, no adverse events were reported that were attributable to <sc>l</sc>-histidine supplementation.</p><p>We have demonstrated, in vitro, a <sc>l</sc>-histidine-concentration dependent increase in 37 kDa filaggrin monomer formation and <sc>l</sc>-histidine-associated improvement in the barrier function of a skin-equivalent model. This observation correlates with evidence from the clinical nutritional pilot study that oral <sc>l</sc>-histidine may have therapeutic benefits in AD. Although there are limitations relating to the sample size of our pilot study, if consistent, the results suggest that once-a- day oral <sc>l</sc>-histidine has similar effects in AD to those reported for mid-potency (Group III) topical corticosteroids.<xref rid="b40-ccid-10-403" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></p><p>These observations, when combined with its established safety profile, suggest that <sc>l</sc>-histidine nutritional supplementation may be a safe, convenient, nonsteroidal intervention suitable for long-term use in the management of AD, particularly in children.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by grants from the Scottish Overseas Research Student Award, University of Edinburgh College of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine PhD Scholarship, and the University of Manchester.
