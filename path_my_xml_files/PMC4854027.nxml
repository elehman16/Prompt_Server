Its incidence in the general population is less than 3% but in high-risk patients such as those with renal failure or diabetes reaches up to 50%.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Although contrast-induced nephropathy is reversible in most cases, even a transient increase in serum creatinine leads to longer admission period.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Sometimes these patients require dialysis, which also causes increased hospital length of stay, increased healthcare costs and an increase in hospital mortality rate to 12%&#x02013;37%.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] There are several risk factors for contrast-induced nephropathy of which diabetes is one of the most important and common ones.</p><p>A variety of measures are suggested to prevent and reduce the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy, including adequate hydration of patients before, during and after treatment, discontinuation of nephrotoxic drugs before treatment and prescribing sodium bicarbonate and some antioxidants such as ascorbic acid N. Acetylcysteine (NAC).[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Possible effects of antioxidants in the prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy are inhibiting the direct toxic influence from contrast-induced on renal epithelial cells. Renal epithelial cell damage was induced by free radicals reducing their uptake, and results in lipid peroxidation damage to kidney cells which are vascuolization of epithelial cells inflammatory interstitial cells and cell necrosis.</p><p>The effect of antioxidant drugs has not been proven yet[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Vit C as an inexpensive and available and feasible administrate antioxidant drug that is orally taken by patients had been proposed for the prevention of CIN. Ascorbic acid is an antioxidant that is easily absorbed by the digestive system and reaches the required serum level in a short period of time (2 h). It has liver metabolism and it is excreted through the kidneys. Maximum permissible dose is 2 g per day.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Therefore, considering the specific features of ascorbic acid, it has been proposed as an appropriate medication for the prevention of CIN, but enough research has not been done yet in this area and various results have been reported in previous studies. This study aims to investigate the effect of vitamin C on the prevention of CIN in diabetic patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>In this double-blinded randomized controlled trial, 90 patients with diabetes who were referred to Afshar Hospital and undertook coronary angiography for catheterization were randomly divided into two arms of Vit C (A) and placebo (B). Patients with acute and chronic renal failure, patients treated with mannitol or the ophyline and vitamin C that underwent re-catheterization over the past 5 days were excluded.</p><p>Details are given contain patients&#x02019; demographic data, duration of diabetes, medications, heart condition (patient's EF by echocardiography or angiography), BUN-Cr (urea - creatinine) before treatment, BUN-Cr 2-3 days after treatment, and the volume and type of contrast agent used for each patient were given in registration form. Subsequent follow-up was performed on all patients by telephone. For some patients who needed prolonged hospitalization due to heart surgery, if possible, necessary test was requested before the next procedure. According to their previous heart condition, all patients underwent rehydration with 0.5&#x02013;1 cc/kg normal saline serum from 6 h before to 12 h after treatment. Furosemide and metformin was stopped 24 h before the treatment and restarted after that, depending on the patient's condition.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] About 2 hours before catheterization, group A received 2 g of oral vitamin C and group (B) received 2 g of oral placebo (choice of dose and time of administration was based on pharmacokinetic properties of vitamin C). Bun-Cr was measured before and 3 days after catheterization. Afterwards, GFR was calculated according to the following formula and the results were compared (GFR formula = [weight &#x000d7; (140-age)] &#x000f7; (72 &#x000d7; Cr), for women the result was multiplied by 0.85).</p><p>Drug and placebo were supplied by Osveh pharmaceutical company based on a specific order, which were prepared in two separate packages labeled A and B in the same color and same shape pills. During the study, neither the patient nor the person who gave the drug was aware of the content of the packet. After collecting the data, the information in the questionnaires were coded and entered into SPSS software table (CIN was considered as a 25% rise in creatinine level or an increase of 0.5 mg/dl in earlier creatinine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In this study, three patients in group A (7.7%) and seven patients in group B (16.7%) had CIN which was tested using Fisher's Exact Test.

In our study, perhaps due to the low number of samples, especially in the group consisting of patients with GFR &#x0003c;60, this difference was not significant in other groups.

In a study conducted in Switzerland, hypertension with <italic>P</italic> = 0.016 was considered as an independent risk factor. In our study this difference was not significant in group B because generally in this group the mean GFR before and after treatment did not change independent of other risk factors. Studying the effect of nephrotoxic drugs, there was a significant difference between GFR before and after treatment in Vit C patients who were taking metformin and ACEI (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.003 respectively). But also in those in the group B and in those who were taking NSAID in both groups, this difference was not significant.</p><p>Nephrotoxic drugs with <italic>P</italic> = 0.03 had a significant relationship with the incidence of CIN and was proposed as an independent risk factor. This difference was not significant in our study in the NSAID group because sample size was low.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Oral vitamin C before angiography and angioplasty can be a protector of GFR of diabetic patients who receive angiographic contrast agent.
