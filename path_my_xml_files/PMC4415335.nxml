Physical restraining in the dental office affects the image of the pediatric dentist and may harm the self-respect of the child at a very young stage of psychological development not to mention the legal implications of harming a vulnerable human being.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Dental General Anesthesia (DGA) might save the child from the psychic trauma he/she might get in the dental office and may help deliver better quality of dental treatment; however, when a pediatric dentist decides to expose his/her patient to the calculated risk of general anesthesia, the decision should not substitute psychic trauma in the dental office with another psychic trauma in the operating theater in the form of parental separation anxiety with the added psychic trauma of physical restraining during induction of anesthesia. A survey conducted by Homer and Bass in 2010[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] showed that up to 60% of anesthetists frequently use physical restraints on resistant and fearful children.</p><p>In 2009, Sheta and AlSarheed[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] studied the anxiolytic effect of different doses of Midazolam on 60 children aged 2&#x02013;6 years undergoing DGA. They reported that satisfactory anxiolytic effect can be achieved with higher doses which raised the potential risk of some adverse effects.</p><p>In 2011, Mountain <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] conducted a study to compare the effects of Midazolam versus Dexmedetomidine premedication on preoperative anxiety and postoperative emergence delirium (ED) on 41 children aged 1&#x02013;6 years and concluded that the latter has an advantage of reducing the incidence of postoperative ED.</p><p>The uniqueness of dental situation where children are already suffering dental fear with substantial need for dental treatment added to the fear of operating room atmosphere merits more investigation on the topic on a larger scale.</p><p>The aim of this work was, therefore, to investigate the possible effect of preoperative oral Midazolam given to children undergoing full dental rehabilitation under general anesthesia (DGA), on parental separation anxiety, ease of anesthesia induction, ED, and post-anesthesia care unit time (PACUT).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>The flow chart of the study design is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>.

Children were randomly allocated to two groups. Group A, the intervention group, consisted of 39 children who were premedicated with 0.5 mg/kg (maximum total dose was 20 mg) of oral Midazolam (Dormicum<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Roche, Brussels, Belgium) in 20 ml of 10% sodium citrate solution, 30 min prior to induction.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Children of the control group, group B (39 children), were premedicated with 20 ml of plain 10% sodium citrate solution. Premedication was done 10&#x02013;15 min prior to separation from parents and 20&#x02013;25 min prior to intubation, by a blinded anesthesia assistant.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Sampling and standardization</title><p>A child undergoing DGA was to be interviewed 1 or 2 days prior to the operation day for preoperative anesthesia assessment by an anesthetist. During these interviews, the anesthetist randomly allocated the children to one of the two groups using the stratified random selection method. With the aid of a biostatistician, some alterations were made to ensure that the two groups had no statistically significant demographic differences.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Anesthesia protocol</title><p>Same anesthesia protocol was applied on both groups. Children were not allowed to eat or drink for at least 6 h before the procedure. Induction was carried out via a facemask with 8% Sevoflurane (Abbott Co. North Chicago, Illinois, USA) in 100% oxygen. After loss of consciousness, an intravenous line was established through which Propofol (Diprivan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; AstraZeneca Co. London, UK.) was administered to allow nasotracheal intubation. Anesthesia was maintained with 2&#x02013;3% Sevoflurane<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide. All children were nasally intubated to allow the pediatric dentist to check occlusion. An oropharyngeal pack was inserted to prevent aspiration of water and dental material fragments into the patient's airway. Intraligamental local anesthesia was administered prior to extractions and steel crown insertions, while intrapulpal route was used for pulpotomies in order to help control physiologic pain reaction during the procedure.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] With the exception of three asthmatic children, all children were given approximately 1&#x02013;2 mg/kg diclofenac sodium (Voltaren<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Basel, Switzerland) in the form of 12.5 or 25 mg suppositories 15 min before extubation to help reduce postoperative pain.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Study tools</title><p>Parental Separation Anxiety Scale (PSAS) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>], developed by Dashiff and Weaver[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and validated by Mountain <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and Kaviani <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] was used.

The results are in agreement with those of Sheta and AlSarheed,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Mountain <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and Kaviani <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>The time spent in the operating room holding area prior to surgery is often traumatic to children's psychology,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] especially for children who already suffer dental fear. This may contribute to extreme anxiety during the induction of anesthesia. In 1999, Kain <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] demonstrated that extreme preoperative anxiety is associated with the occurrence of negative postoperative behavioral changes. The lack of effect on postoperative ED may appear contradictory to Kain <italic>et al</italic>.'s report;[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] however, they demonstrated that reducing preoperative anxiety does reduce the incidence of postoperative behavioral changes, but not postoperative ED. Our study does support this conclusion and may resolve the controversy on the effect of Midazolam on postoperative ED.</p><p>Points of strength in the current study worth noting are related to the randomization process, double blinding, and the implementation of updated study tools (scales) that were relatedly validated by several authors and standardized for ease of reproduction in further studies.</p><p>An optimal dosage of Midazolam based on a balance between safety and efficacy in pediatric dentistry has not been well established. The current study is in agreement with Mountain <italic>et al</italic>.'s[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] report that a dose of 0.5 mg/kg significantly reduces preoperative anxiety and helps in anesthetic mask acceptance by children. They compared Midazolam to Dexmedetomidine as preoperative anxiolytic medications and reported that the latter has an advantage of reducing postoperative ED. However, the current study was limited to Midazolam because till now, the US Food and Drug Administration has not approved the use of Dexmedetomidine for children. Other studies[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] demonstrated a better anxiolytic outcome with higher doses of Midazolam up to 1.0 mg/kg. However, in the current study being done in a private hospital, a decision was made to adhere to Midazolam manufacturer's recommended dose of 0.5 mg/kg. It is worth noting that while using this dose, no adverse effects that might be attributed to the drug were observed among children of the study group. In 1992, McMillan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] reported no beneficial effect using higher doses of 0.75 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg compared to 0.5 mg/kg. They also reported more side effects with higher doses, such as prolonged postoperative recovery time and undue over sedation. The potential for adverse effects is a major concern regarding routine preoperative medication. Consequently, before suggesting routine use of Midazolam premedication, more studies on a larger scale are recommended to identify patients who might not benefit from Midazolam preoperative medication. In that context, Finley <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] demonstrated that Midazolam has no anxiolytic effect on children with impulsive temperament.</p><p>In the current study, the time selected to separate the child from his/her parents was 10&#x02013;15 min after Midazolam administration. This was guided by Levine <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] who reported that 10 min after premedication was the minimum time needed for smooth separation from parents. The same authors reported that the peak sedative effect of Midazolam was achieved 20&#x02013;30 min after administration; consequently, the peak-effect time was reserved for induction time which was 20&#x02013;25 min in our study.</p><p>On using the PAEDS to assess postoperative emergence delirium, no favorable effect of oral Midazolam on postoperative ED was found in our study. Although the PAEDS used in the study is reported to be the most comprehensive and validated scale currently available to measure ED, it lacks an appropriate cut-off value to actually diagnose ED,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] which might be considered a limitation of the study. However, it might be worth noting that dental surgeries constituted 52% of the number of surgeries included during the development of the scale by Sikich and Lerman.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Other limitations may be related to the study being conducted in a private hospital where due to medico-legal concerns, we had to stick to Midazolam manufacturer's dose recommendation and avoid including higher doses in the study. Another limitation is that the study did not include assessment of the possible effect of Midazolam on postoperative behavior due to certain factors confined to the Saudi and Gulf communities where parents are not necessarily the primary child care givers. To conduct such a study, the researcher would rely on the primary care giver as a source of information. In Saudi Arabia and Gulf countries, the primary care giver might be a recruited domestic helper or a step mother in addition to the biological mother, which may render obtaining such information unreliable, especially in an environment that restricts inter-gender communication. Further studies are needed to investigate the possible effect of the drug on long-term postoperative child's behavior and toward testing new agents that might have an effect on postoperative ED and PACUT. Such investigations may lead to adopting routine practices that may render dental anesthesia costs more affordable by parents and insurance companies as well.</p><p>Many agents have been tested to flavor oral Midazolam, including orange juice, cola drinks, and pomegranate juice. The current study is in agreement with Isik <italic>et al</italic>.'s[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] report that adding 10% sodium citrate solution to Midazolam enjoys high acceptance by children, as in our study only one child in the test group (A) was reported to resist the intake of the drug due to its taste.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>
