<article-title>The Challenge of Producing Skin Test Antigens with Minimal Resources Suitable for Human Application against a Neglected Tropical Disease; Leprosy</article-title>
</related-article><abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>New tools are required for the diagnosis of pre-symptomatic leprosy towards further reduction of disease burden and its associated reactions. To address this need, two new skin test antigens were developed to assess safety and efficacy in human trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A Phase I safety trial was first conducted in a non-endemic region for leprosy (U.S.A.). Healthy non-exposed subjects (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10) received three titrated doses (2.5 &#x000b5;g, 1.0 &#x000b5;g and 0.1 &#x000b5;g) of MLSA-LAM (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5) or MLCwA (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5) and control antigens [Rees MLSA (1.0 &#x000b5;g) and saline]. A randomized double blind Phase II safety and efficacy trial followed in an endemic region for leprosy (Nepal), but involved only the 1.0 &#x000b5;g (high dose) and 0.1 &#x000b5;g (low dose) of each antigen; Tuberculin PPD served as a control antigen. This Phase II safety and efficacy trial consisted of three Stages: Stage A and B studies were an expansion of Phase I involving 10 and 90 subjects respectively, and Stage C was then conducted in two parts (high dose and low dose), each enrolling 80 participants: 20 borderline lepromatous/lepromatous (BL/LL) leprosy patients, 20 borderline tuberculoid/tuberculoid (BT/TT) leprosy patients, 20 household contacts of leprosy patients (HC), and 20 tuberculosis (TB) patients. The primary outcome measure for the skin test was delayed type hypersensitivity induration.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>In the small Phase I safety trial, reactions were primarily against the 2.5 &#x000b5;g dose of both antigens and Rees control antigen, which were then excluded from subsequent studies. In the Phase II, Stage A/B ramped-up safety study, 26% of subjects (13 of 50) showed induration against the high dose of each antigen, and 4% (2 of 50) reacted to the low dose of MLSA-LAM. Phase II, Stage C safety and initial efficacy trial showed that both antigens at the low dose exhibited low sensitivity at 20% and 25% in BT/TT leprosy patients, but high specificity at 100% and 95% compared to TB patients. The high dose of both antigens showed lower specificity (70% and 60%) and sensitivity (10% and 15%). BL/LL leprosy patients were anergic to the leprosy antigens.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>MLSA-LAM and MLCwA at both high (1.0 &#x000b5;g) and low (0.1 &#x000b5;g) doses were found to be safe for use in humans without known exposure to leprosy and in target populations. At a sensitivity rate of 20&#x02013;25% these antigens are not suitable as a skin test for the detection of the early stages of leprosy infection; however, the degree of specificity is impressive given the presence of cross-reactive antigens in these complex native <italic>M. leprae</italic> preparations.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrails.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01920750">NCT01920750 (Phase I)</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00128193">NCT00128193 (Phase II)</ext-link>
</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Clinically useful skin test reagents should be safe and sufficiently sensitive to detect infection prior to physical manifestations of leprosy disease. While in these small scale human studies, leprosy reagents were safe for use in humans, they failed in respect of sensitivity at a rate of 20&#x02013;25% in the key indicator group, BT/TT leprosy patients. Specificity in terms of leprosy vs. tuberculosis at a rate of 95&#x02013;100% was surprisingly high in light of the extensive presence of cross-reactive antigens in the complex native <italic>M. leprae</italic> preparations.

A sensitive and specific test would facilitate early detection, allowing treatment prior to manifestation of physical disease, and reduced transmission, reactions, and patient disabilities. Such a test should be sensitive to the earliest immunological response to <italic>M. leprae</italic>, inexpensive for use in leprosy endemic regions, and simple to implement. Intradermal skin testing through measurement of a delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction could meet the sensitivity attributes, and does so with Tuberculin DTH in the context of tuberculosis. <xref rid="pntd.0002811-Snider1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002811-Huebner1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> Earlier skin test antigens for leprosy (Lepromin A, Rees Antigen, and Convit's antigen) <xref rid="pntd.0002811-Convit1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002811-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> proved safe when used in humans.

In the present context, two new skin test antigens, <italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic> soluble antigens (MLSA) devoid of glycolipids particularly lipoarabinomannan (LAM) called MLSA-LAM and MLCwA (<italic>M. leprae</italic> cell wall associated antigens), were generated, reflective of those of Convit and Rees in that they were derived from <italic>M. leprae</italic> grown in armadillos, but prepared under rigorous current good manufacturing practices (GMP) <xref rid="pntd.0002811-FDA1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002811-FDA2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The primary goal of the application of these antigens in a clinical trial was to determine if the products were well tolerated in humans and if they exhibited diagnostic potential that would justify larger trials and eventual clinical implementation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The Colorado State University (CSU) Institutional Review Board (IRB) for the protection of human subjects and the Nepal Health Research Council (NHRC) approved the protocols and informed consent forms, and certified that the studies were ethically cleared to proceed. All subjects provided written informed consent; no children were enrolled in the study. The Phase I safety non-endemic trial (registration number: NCT01920750) and Phase II safety and efficacy endemic trial (registration number: NCT00128193) were registered with ClinicalTrials.gov. The Phase I trial was not registered prior to implementation, because the trial was completed (February, 1999), before ClinicalTrials.gov registry was made available to the public (February, 2000). Retrospective registration of the Phase I trial was requested and obtained for publication by PLoS Tropical Diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Intervention and Control Products</title><p>Test antigens were MLSA-LAM and MLCwA at 2.5 &#x000b5;g, 1.0 &#x000b5;g, and 0.1 &#x000b5;g/0.1 ml dose <xref rid="pntd.0002811-Rivoire1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Control antigens were Rees MLSA <xref rid="pntd.0002811-Smelt1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, 20&#x000d7;1.0 ml vials at 1.0 &#x000b5;g dose received as a gift from Philip Draper and the late Joseph Colston (National Institute Medical Research, Mill Hill, UK) in Phase I; 0.9% sterile saline, approved for human use (Abbott Laboratories Inc., Abbott Park, IL) in Phase I and Phase II, Stage A; Tubersol Tuberculin PPD, 5 TU dose (Aventis Pasteur Inc., Swiftwater, PA) in Phase II Stage A and B and preliminary testing of Stage C-1a; and, Tuberculin PPD RT 23, 2 TU dose, solution for injection (Statens Serum Institute (SSI), Copenhagen, Denmark) in the remainder of Stage C-1 a/b. Strong reactions to the 5 TU dose of PPD prompted unblinding and SMC review for this one product. The outcome was a recommendation from the sponsor to use a lower dose for the remainder of Stage C-1 studies; this change was not expected to significantly impact the study results. The lower dose was not available from the same vendor; therefore, a new vendor was used.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study Design</title><p>The Phase I clinical trial was conducted on MLSA-LAM and MLCwA in a non-endemic region for leprosy, while the Phase II clinical trial was conducted on both antigens in an endemic region for leprosy. The Phase II clinical trial included compulsory testing for safety and efficacy in healthy subjects without known exposure to leprosy and in target populations: borderline tuberculoid/tuberculoid (BT/TT) and borderline lepromatous/lepromatous (BL/LL) leprosy patients, household contacts of BL/LL leprosy patients (HC), and tuberculosis patients (TB).</p><p>Prior to initiation, the protocol was amended: 1) to allow testing in smaller group sizes (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;20) to assure safety before ramping and to improve the likelihood of recruiting the requisite number of subjects; 2) to decrease the number of injections for subject comfort; and, 3) to add comparative <italic>in vitro</italic> assays to maximize the potential of this study (unpublished work). Stage C was divided into Stage C-1 for small scale studies and Stage C-2 for ramping to achieve statistical significance. Stage C-2 was not feasible, due to cessation of dedicated funding. Stage C-1 was divided into two parts, a and b, to test the high dose (1 &#x000b5;g) and low dose (0.1 &#x000b5;g) of each antigen. This protocol change enabled both the reduction of sample size and number of injections per subject, while remaining within the scope of the original protocol.</p><p>Participants in the Phase I safety trial (U.S.A.) were between the ages of 18 and 40 years, with a weight greater than 100 lbs (45 kg) for females and 140 lbs (64 kg) for males. In the Phase II trial, there were 68% male and 32% females enrolled in the study. The mean age of the subjects was 29 y, with a range of 18 to 60 y. Age did not vary significantly across study groups in Stages A, B, and C-1b, but there was a significant difference in age across study groups in Stage C-1a, p&#x0003c;0.05. Phase II participants had a weight greater than 30 kg for females and 38 kg for males.</p><p>The method for antigen administration and measuring induration was adapted from &#x0201c;Guidelines for Conducting Skin Test Surveys in High Prevalence Countries,&#x0201d; issued by the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease <xref rid="pntd.0002811-Arnadottir1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In the Phase I clinical trial, each participant received five 100 &#x000b5;l intradermal injections of titrated doses (2.5 &#x000b5;g, 1.0 &#x000b5;g, and 0.1 &#x000b5;g) of one of the two skin test antigens, one injection of 0.9% sodium chloride, and one injection of Rees MLSA control leprosy skin test antigen at a 1.0 &#x000b5;g dose, between both forearms. Participants in the Phase II, Stage A/B clinical trial, each received four injections of titrated doses (1.0 &#x000b5;g and 0.1 &#x000b5;g) of one of the two skin test antigens, one injection of 0.9% sterile saline (Stage A only), and one injection of Tuberculin PPD Tubersol 5 TU, between both forearms. Stage C-1a/b subjects received three injections of the high dose (1.0 &#x000b5;g) or low dose (0.1 &#x000b5;g) of each intervention and control antigen.</p><p>DTH responses were read at &#x0223c;15 min, 48 h and 72 h post injection in the Phase I and Phase II, Stage A studies; prior to Stage B, the 48 h reading was dropped and a 7 day reading was added for convenience and safety. The 15 min observation was primarily a safety measure to gauge for immediate adverse events, such as anaphylaxis and a 30 min observation was added to the Stage C-1 studies to assure that subjects were not adversely affected from an added blood draw for <italic>in vitro</italic> testing (unpublished work). If a subject was observed to have an induration greater than 10 mm at any injection site, at either subsequent study visit, he/she was asked to return at 25&#x02013;31 days for a final induration measurement. Any persistent reaction was followed-up until resolved or stabilized.</p><p>Each antigen site was evaluated for reactogenicity, defined as a reaction at the site of injection that is common and reasonably expected for the intervention being studied. Specifically, the maximal diameter of induration and erythema, and presence of pain, pruritus (itching), bleeding, urticaria (hives), infection, or blistering were possible reactions based on the history of Tuberculin skin testing <xref rid="pntd.0002811-Arnadottir1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002811-Sanofi1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Classification of reactogenicity by grade was outlined in the Clinical Study Reactogenicity Assessment Table included in the Phase II Clinical Protocol. Reactions were graded as mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3), or life-threatening (4). Severe reactions were recorded as adverse events, while life-threatening reactions were recorded as severe adverse events. Adverse events (AEs) were coded by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) <xref rid="pntd.0002811-ICH1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> for preferred term and system organ class (SOC).</p><p>The Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) <xref rid="pntd.0002811-FDA3" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> for the Phase I study consisted of two off-site leprologist physicians. The Phase II, Stage A/B study SMC consisted of 4 physicians: two off-site leprologists, one off-site infectious disease doctor, and one on-site tuberculosis doctor who served as the independent safety monitor (ISM).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Phase I Safety Trial - Non-Endemic U.S.A</title><p>Phase I study commencement was December 1998 and study completion was February 1999. The total sample size of 10 subjects was divided between two antigen groups; 5 subjects received titrated doses of MLSA-LAM or MLCwA, plus control antigens. Healthy subjects without any known contact with tuberculosis or leprosy patients were recruited from the student body at CSU. All subjects were Tuberculin skin test negative when tested 3 weeks prior to study initiation. Subjects were assigned to either the MLSA-LAM or MLCwA antigen group based on a random sequence of integers. Study objectives were two-fold: to determine if MLSA-LAM and MLCwA were safe to use in humans as skin test antigens; and, to determine that the range of concentrations chosen for skin testing did not elicit a reactive response in a negative control group of human subjects from a region non-endemic for leprosy. The expected outcome for the Phase I clinical trial was that all three concentrations of the two leprosy skin test antigens, saline, and control Rees MLSA leprosy antigen would not evoke a skin test antigen response. Any untoward local reaction, such as severe erythema or necrosis, would result in those antigen doses being dropped from further testing.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Phase II Stage A/B Safety Trial - Leprosy Endemic Area in Nepal</title><p>The Phase II, Stage A study commenced in April 2002 and was completed in July 2002; Stage B study commenced in May 2003 and was completed in January 2004. The Phase II, Stage A and B clinical study was similar in design to the Phase I clinical trial, in that 100 subjects were divided between two groups; 50 subjects received titrated doses of MLSA-LAM and MLCwA, plus control antigens. Stage A was a preliminary safety screen with 10 subjects from a leprosy endemic region, whereas Stage B completed the safety trial with 90 subjects. Healthy subjects without any known contact with tuberculosis or leprosy patients were recruited from the Lalitpur Nursing Campus, Sanepa, Kathmandu and the Dhulikel Medical Institute, Dhulikel, Nepal, following delivery of a recruitment talk by a senior member of the research team from Anandaban Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal, using the local Nepali language or English with immediate translation to Nepali.</p><p>To assess eligibility, volunteers were asked a series of health related questions, given a general physical exam and standard examination for signs of leprosy <xref rid="pntd.0002811-Britton1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002811-2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.

Demographic information was collected, and BCG scar measured across the largest diameter (if present). Familial relationships were recorded for HC of leprosy patients only.</p><p>Phase II subjects were assigned an antigen and administration template based on a fixed block randomization sequence provided by the Data Coordinating Center (DCC; The EMMES Corporation, Rockville, MD). Antigens were concealed by antigen codes randomized for each antigen and antigen dose; both randomization schemes were sent to the clinical study principal investigator in the event that unblinding was necessary. Antigen codes were provided in separate envelopes, such that if only one antigen required unblinding, the others were not compromised.</p><p>The Phase II, Stage A and B clinical trials were performed by staff from Anandaban Hospital at the two sites. Study objectives were to evaluate the safety and to select a dose of MLSA-LAM and MLCwA causing minimal induration in healthy subjects without known exposure to clinical leprosy or tuberculosis that are living in a region endemic for leprosy.

For the Phase II, Stage A clinical study, both antigens and antigen doses were expected to show minimal reactions, if any, and therefore a sample size of 10 subjects was expected to uncover any major safety concerns. For the Phase II, Stage B clinical study, the sample size was increased by 40 subjects for each antigen, to generate statistically significant data. Sample size consideration analysis indicated that the study would be able to meet the primary statistical objectives should up to 10% of the subjects be lost to follow-up. The Phase II, Stage C-1a/b trial was designed to assess the safety and primary response measure of induration resulting from skin test antigen DTH responses in small numbers (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;20) of participants within each of four different groups that theoretically may be at higher risk of serious adverse responses to novel antigens. The probability of observing one or more serious adverse events related to antigen administration was calculated. If the true serious adverse event rate is 10%, then there is an 85% chance of observing one or more serious adverse events in any one of the four groups with loss during follow-up of 10% of the subjects, or 88% if there is no loss during follow-up.

Induration measurements at 48 and 72 h were very similar and since the 48 h reading was dropped from the Phase II study, only the 72 h values are reported.

The high doses of both leprosy skin test antigens elicited a greater response in HC and TB patients than BT/TT leprosy patients. One BL/LL subject in the MLSA-LAM high dose group reacted with an induration of 20 mm. This subject was a 46 year old male with LL leprosy, who had been treated with MDT for a period of one month before enrolling in the high dose study. This participant was smear positive, had a bacterial index of 4.0, did not have a history of Type I or ENL reactions, had a single BCG scar, and, was using a topical steroid ointment for the treatment of mild eczema on two fingers. Comparison of mean induration measurements across all subjects showed a higher response in the BT/TT leprosy patients compared to HC with both antigens at the low dose. Antigens at the high dose showed a lower response in BT/TT leprosy patients compared to HC and TB patients. A significant increase in the number of responders and mean induration in TB patients and HC was seen with PPD, with fewer BL/LL leprosy patients responding overall.</p><table-wrap id="pntd-0002811-t002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0002811.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Number of positive responders and mean induration compared to ECs.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pntd-0002811-t002-2" xlink:href="pntd.0002811.t002"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Antigen</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Dose</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group</td><td colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">Number of Subjects</td><td colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">Mean Induration</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No. Pos/Total (%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ratio (Test/EC)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean (mm)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ratio (Test/EC)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MLSA-LAM</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Low</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">EC</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2/50 (4)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">na</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">na</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BT/TT</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4/20 (20)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20/4 (5.0)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.8</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.8/0.2 (14.0)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BL/LL</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0/19(0)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0/4 (0.0)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.0/0.2 (0.0)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HC</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2/20 (10)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10/4 (2.5)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.1/0.2 (5.5)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TB</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0/20 (0)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0/4 (0.0)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.0/0.2 (0.0)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MLCwA</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Low</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">EC</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0/50 (1<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt103">a</xref>)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">na</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.1<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt103">a</xref>

Detection of BT/TT leprosy patients who were under treatment or completed treatment (51%) may have affected sensitivity results in these studies.</p><p>At the high dose compared to the low dose, both antigens elicited a response in a higher number of HC, TB, and EC subjects, but the number of BT/TT responders remained the same. These phenomena may be related to that observed when Leprosin A (Rees antigen) was shown to immunologically suppress the skin test response to PPD in both BT/TT and BL/LL leprosy patients <xref rid="pntd.0002811-Sengupta1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. These data support the idea that there may be a difference in the antigenic profile that stimulates a response in pre-symptomatic, but not symptomatic leprosy.</p><p>The immunological environment of early leprosy is unknown; however, advances have been made in understanding the innate and adaptive immune mediated pathways that promote and control disease pathology <xref rid="pntd.0002811-Ottenhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002811-Modlin1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. In tuberculosis, the infection delays onset of adaptive immunity, which provides a window to establish a successful infection. Disease progression in tuberculosis, like leprosy, is then dependent on the immunological status of the host <xref rid="pntd.0002811-Bhat1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Striking similarities of the immunology and pathology between these two diseases suggest that TT leprosy could be a latent form of disease, under the control of the immune system, whereas LL leprosy is known to be the active form of disease with T-cell hyporesponsiveness <xref rid="pntd.0002811-Kumar1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> Borderline forms are immunologically unstable and can downgrade depending on the immunological position of the host <xref rid="pntd.0002811-Scollard1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. This continuum of immunological events probably occurs prior to and during manifestation of clinical symptoms, providing opportunities for an early clinical diagnostic tool.</p><p>Antigen specificity at the low dose was thought to be related to the removal of lipoglycans, including the immunosuppressive and cross-reactive LAM, lipomannan (LM), and phosphatidylinositol mannoside (PIM), and other lipids and lipoproteins <xref rid="pntd.0002811-Chatterjee1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0002811-Barnes1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Remaining proteins were numerous, but many shared sequence homology with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>
<xref rid="pntd.0002811-Marques1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Nonetheless, of the 100 EC tested, 77% had been vaccinated with BCG and 67% reacted with PPD, while only 2% reacted to the low dose leprosy antigens (2 with MLSA-LAM and 0 with MLCwA). This suggests that the leprosy antigens are detecting specific CMI responses resulting from an infection with <italic>M. leprae</italic>, implying that transmission has occurred in these few healthy subjects. Of the 20 TB subjects tested in the Phase II, Stage C-1b study, 95% (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;19) reacted to PPD, but only 10% (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2) reacted to MLCwA and none reacted to MLSA-LAM. Another possibility is that the dose alone, or in combination with the removal of lipoglycans, resulted in high specificity. At the low dose, <italic>M. leprae</italic> specific proteins may be available for recognition, whereas at the high dose, those same proteins may be overpowered by ubiquitous mycobacterial proteins lending to cross-reactive responses with TB patients and EC exposed to environmental mycobacteria or vaccinated with BCG <xref rid="pntd.0002811-Fine1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>The strength of these studies was in the verification that new refined leprosy skin test antigens were immunologically active in BT/TT leprosy patients, anergic in BL/LL leprosy patients, and highly specific in BT/TT leprosy patients. The skin test method was simple, easy for field use, and minimally invasive, potentially affording a feasible early diagnostic test tool. Limitations of these studies were difficulties in shipping materials through customs, lengthy document review and approvals, multiple stages in the Phase II protocol; prolonged duration to complete the study; political turmoil in the endemic country; intermittent communication services; and above all, unacceptably low sensitivity to warrant the larger scale trial originally planned.</p><p>Our findings do not support further work on the skin test method with MLSA-LAM and MLCwA. The future of diagnostic tests for pre-symptomatic leprosy needs to be specific, but foremost, must be sensitive to detect early infection with <italic>M. leprae</italic>. Focus on the early T-cell response using multiple <italic>M. leprae</italic> specific antigens and immunological biomarkers may be required to enhance sensitivity. Promising proteins and peptides using cellular biomarkers to detect leprosy <xref rid="pntd.0002811-Geluk1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002811-Geluk2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> and tuberculosis <xref rid="pntd.0002811-Aggerbeck1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> have been recently reported. Comparable dose-dependent <italic>in-vitro</italic> studies with MLSA-LAM and MLCwA, as native antigens, would be expected to offer specificity and may improve sensitivity. Adding serology tests with specific antigens such as phenolic glycolipid-I (PGL-I) may increase early detection rates for BL/LL leprosy patients <xref rid="pntd.0002811-Spencer1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002811-Sampaio1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Despite the choice of test method, identification of the target population for pre-symptomatic leprosy, i.e. HC as identified in the COLEP study <xref rid="pntd.0002811-Moet1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0002811-Feenstra1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, will need to be determined. Testing in a large scale randomized study with follow-up will undoubtedly be required to reveal whether a future diagnostic test could tip the balance toward interrupting transmission.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0002811.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
