We used the OraQuick Rapid HIV-1/2 antibody test (OraQuick) in the Bangkok Tenofovir Study, an HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis trial among people who inject drugs.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>The Bangkok Tenofovir Study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. We tested participants&#x02019; oral fluid for HIV using OraQuick monthly and blood using a nucleic-acid amplification test (NAAT) every 3 months.

Among 447 with reactive results, 436 (97.5%) were confirmed HIV-infected, 10 (2.2%) HIV-uninfected, and one (0.2%) had indeterminate results. Two participants with non-reactive OraQuick results were, in fact, HIV-infected at screening yielding 99.5% sensitivity, 99.7% specificity, a 97.8% positive predictive value, and a 99.9% negative predictive value. Participants receiving tenofovir took longer to develop a reactive OraQuick (191.8 days) than participants receiving placebo (16.8 days) (p = 0.02) and participants infected with HIV CRF01_AE developed a reactive OraQuick earlier than participants infected with other subtypes (p = 0.04).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Discussion</title><p>The oral fluid HIV test performed well at screening, suggesting it can be used when rapid results and non-invasive tools are preferred. However, participants receiving tenofovir took longer to develop a reactive oral fluid test result than those receiving placebo.

Five participants were diagnosed with HIV infection using EIA and Western Blot testing and did not have a reactive oral fluid HIV test result reported. Final blood specimens collected from two participants tested positive for HIV using NAAT; one was confirmed, while the other could not be confirmed because there was insufficient blood and the participant could not be reached for repeat testing (<xref rid="pone.0145859.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).</p><p>Among the 50 participants with confirmed incident HIV infection, 10 were lost to follow-up for more than 3 months and returned HIV-infected.

Staff reported reactive test results for 8 (20.0%) participants more than 3 months after the positive NAAT. The eight participants came from six clinics, and the first positive NAAT results occurred between March 2006 and June 2010 and on study visits ranging from month 9 to month 54. In addition, 5 (11.9%) participants with non-reactive OraQuick results were diagnosed with HIV infection using EIA and Western Blot testing. Censoring these five participants the day of their final OraQuick test, the median time from the NAAT to the mid-point between the last non-reactive and first reactive oral fluid HIV test for the 40 participants evaluated was estimated to be 17.4 days (i.e., 62% of a 28 day month; interquartile range [IQR], 2.8&#x02013;131.3 days).</p><p>The HIV RNA level was higher among participants receiving placebo (median = 227,863 copies/ml) at the time the NAAT was reactive than among participants receiving tenofovir (median = 5532 copies/ml; p = 0.02).

The negative predictive value was 99.9% suggesting that when used to screen for HIV infection, care providers and people who inject drugs can have confidence that a negative oral fluid HIV test result, in the absence of a recent HIV exposure, is accurate.</p><p>The oral fluid HIV test was reactive within 3 months (i.e., 84 days) of the first positive NAAT in 27 (67.5%) participants with incident HIV infection. Falsely reactive oral fluid HIV test results did not cluster by clinic, time on study, or calendar time. Consistent with a previous study showing that antiretroviral therapy can decrease the sensitivity of the oral fluid HIV test,[<xref rid="pone.0145859.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] we found that participants receiving tenofovir took longer to develop a reactive test result than participants receiving placebo. We also found that participants infected with subtype CRF01_AE developed a reactive oral fluid HIV test faster than participants infected with other subtypes. Participants with CRF01_AE infection had higher, but not statistically different, plasma HIV RNA concentrations the day the NAAT was positive than participants with other subtypes. Another larger study found that those infected with CRF01_AE had significantly higher plasma RNA concentrations during the first 3 months of infection than those infected with other subtypes.[<xref rid="pone.0145859.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Higher HIV RNA levels among participants with CRF01_AE infection may speed or increase the antibody response, decreasing the time to a reactive oral fluid HIV test result.</p><p>This study has several limitations. Oral fluid specimens must be evaluated within 40 minutes and cannot be preserved; therefore, we were unable to re-test specimens to confirm the results. Oral fluid HIV tests were done monthly but blood was collected every 3 months. Thus, when NAAT testing of blood showed that HIV infection occurred before a reactive oral fluid HIV test, we had to estimate the time from HIV infection until the oral fluid test was reactive. Also, only 8 participants had positive HIV NAAT results more than 3 months before a reactive oral fluid test, limiting analysis of falsely non-reactive results.</p><p>Thailand&#x02019;s Ministry of Public Health has recognized the importance of increasing HIV testing, and has issued guidance for HIV testing with same day results.[<xref rid="pone.0145859.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The OraQuick test is easy to use, does not require a blood draw, and provides a result in 20 to 40 minutes, attributes that make it a useful tool for HIV screening in settings where laboratory facilities are not available, and a rapid result and non-invasive tools are preferred. However, oral fluid-based tests are less sensitive than blood-based assays in people with early HIV infection.[<xref rid="pone.0145859.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145859.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145859.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145859.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] During the Bangkok Tenofovir Study, staff reported non-reactive monthly oral fluid HIV test results for 8 participants for more than 3 months (84 days) after HIV infection. Thus, in a setting where repeat HIV testing will be done among people at high risk of HIV infection, for example among people receiving pre-exposure prophylaxis, a blood-based test or fourth generation test that simultaneously detects HIV-1 p24 antigen and antibody, may be a more appropriate choice.[<xref rid="pone.0145859.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145859.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec012"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0145859.s001"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><title>Data used for Kaplan-Meier estimates and proportional hazards analysis.</title><p>If the first positive HIV NAAT occurred the same day as the first reactive oral fluid HIV test, we estimated the time from positive NAAT to reactive oral fluid HIV test was 0 days.
