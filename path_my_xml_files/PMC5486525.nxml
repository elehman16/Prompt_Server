Among these, median (95% confidence interval) percentage change from baseline in mean urinary free cortisol was &#x02212;82.6% (&#x02212;89.0, &#x02212;41.9) and &#x02212;81.8% (&#x02212;89.8, &#x02212;67.4) at months 12 and 60. Eleven patients had mean urinary free cortisol &#x02264; upper limit of normal at month 60. Improvements in clinical signs were sustained during long-term treatment. The safety profile of pasireotide at 5 years was similar to that reported after 12 months. Fifteen of 16 patients experienced a hyperglycaemia-related adverse event; glycated haemoglobin levels were stable between months 6 and 60. Adverse events related to hyperglycaemia, bradycardia, gallbladder/biliary tract, and liver safety were most likely to first occur by month 6; adverse event severity did not tend to worsen over time.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">This represents the longest prospective trial of a medical therapy for Cushing&#x02019;s disease to date.

Untreated, Cushing&#x02019;s disease is associated with significant morbidity (including metabolic, cardiovascular and psychiatric disorders), impaired quality of life and increased mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Transsphenoidal resection of the causative pituitary adenoma is first-line therapy for most patients with Cushing&#x02019;s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, many patients require pharmacological intervention in order to reduce excess levels of cortisol. With an increasing number of therapeutic agents available, clinicians face the challenging task of selecting the most appropriate therapy for each patient. Tailoring treatment to meet the individual patient&#x02019;s characteristics along with a consideration of the benefit:risk profiles of the various medical therapies is recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Given that Cushing&#x02019;s disease often requires chronic medical treatment, medications with favourable long-term efficacy and safety profiles are required to meet the needs of patients and their clinicians.</p><p id="Par7">Twice-daily pasireotide (Signifor)&#x02014;a multireceptor-targeted somatostatin analogue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]&#x02014;has been approved for the treatment of adult patients with Cushing&#x02019;s disease with persistent or recurrent hypercortisolism after surgery or for whom surgery is not an option [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Earlier reports from a large Phase III study (NCT00434148) showed that pasireotide reduced urinary free cortisol (UFC) levels and provided clinical benefit for up to 24 months in patients with Cushing&#x02019;s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

To date, published data on the efficacy and safety of pasireotide beyond 24 months of treatment have been limited to individual case reports or small patient series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. While these reports have shown disease control to be sustained for several years in individual patients, prospective data in a cohort of patients with Cushing&#x02019;s disease have not been available.

Patients with a mean urinary free cortisol (mUFC) level not exceeding the upper limit of the normal range (ULN) or who were considered by the investigator to be achieving clinical benefit from pasireotide at month 12 could continue receiving pasireotide in an open-label phase. If treatment benefit persisted and pasireotide was well tolerated, patients could continue to receive pasireotide until it became commercially available. Increase and decrease of dose was permitted during the open-label phase for efficacy and tolerability issues (permitted dose range, 150&#x02013;1200&#x02009;&#x000b5;g bid).

As routine monitoring of patients was performed less frequently after month 12, it is possible that some AEs could be under-reported at later time points. As this analysis did not take into account repeat episodes or prolongation of AEs in individual patients, changes in the severity of these AEs over time were also assessed. The severity of AEs related to hyperglycaemia and the gallbladder/biliary tract did not increase after first occurrence in over half of patients on long-term pasireotide treatment, while the severity of AEs related to bradycardia and the liver did not tend to increase after the first reported event.</p><p id="Par35">Hyperglycaemia is a well-characterised side effect of pasireotide treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

For patients on long-term pasireotide treatment who initiated antidiabetic medication during the study (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;11/16), median HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels increased soon after initiation of pasireotide and plateaued at month 6 through to month 60. However, given the small number of patients who reached month 60, these results should be interpreted with caution. Blood glucose levels should be monitored in patients treated with pasireotide so that prompt action can be taken if levels rise. No specific recommendations for treatment of hyperglycaemia were included in the study protocol. As such, it was not possible to assess the effect of individual medications on glycaemic parameters. A clinical trial is ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of various antidiabetic therapies in controlling pasireotide-induced hyperglycaemia in patients with Cushing&#x02019;s disease or acromegaly (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02060383).</p><p id="Par36">A number of other medical therapies have demonstrated efficacy in patients with Cushing&#x02019;s disease, which exert their effects by inhibiting cortisol production at the adrenal glands (adrenocortical steroidogenesis inhibitors), blocking cortisol action at peripheral tissues (glucocorticoid receptor antagonists), or inhibiting ACTH release from the pituitary adenoma (dopamine receptor agonists) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].

In a retrospective study of 200 patients with Cushing&#x02019;s disease, 51 patients were treated with ketoconazole for at least 24 months (mean, 109 months). At last assessment, 64.7% of these patients achieved normalised UFC, while 23.5% had at least a 50% decrease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Discontinuation of ketoconazole because of intolerance occurred in 20.5% of patients. In a retrospective series of 195 patients with Cushing&#x02019;s syndrome, 38 patients were treated with metyrapone for a mean duration of 18 months; &#x02265;64% achieved normalisation of cortisol secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Metyrapone was generally well tolerated, and potential side effects of hypokalaemia, hypertension, and hirsutism were rarely reported. Unlike pasireotide, adrenal-directed agents cannot reduce ACTH levels or influence pituitary tumour volume. Finally, mifepristone is approved in the USA to control hyperglycaemia secondary to hypercortisolism in patients with Cushing&#x02019;s syndrome who have type 2 diabetes mellitus/glucose intolerance and have failed/are not candidates for surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Mifepristone has been shown to provide clinically significant weight loss in patients with Cushing&#x02019;s syndrome over 2 years of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Patients receiving mifepristone should be closely monitored for increase in circulating ACTH and cortisol levels and pituitary tumour enlargement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par38">The chronic nature of hypercortisolism associated with Cushing&#x02019;s disease necessitates, in some patients, a durable and effective medical treatment with a favourable safety and tolerability profile. Patients who were benefiting from treatment with pasireotide at month 12 of the core study continued to derive long-term benefit, as evidenced in the current study. Reductions in mUFC and improvements in clinical signs of Cushing&#x02019;s disease with pasireotide were maintained for up to 5 years, with a safety profile similar to that reported after 1 and 2 years of treatment. These data represent the longest duration of treatment in a prospective clinical trial of any medical therapy for Cushing&#x02019;s disease and support pasireotide as a viable long-term therapeutic option for some patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec17"><p>
