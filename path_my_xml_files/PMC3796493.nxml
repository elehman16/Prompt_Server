A combination of peripheral and central mechanisms contribute to the earlier volitional exertion during endurance exercise in hypoxemic humans [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], although the interaction between these mechanisms remains complex. Closed-loop-design tests offer a relevant model to study these physiological changes as the task outcomes are known beforehand. Therefore, participants can continuously select their force output, depending on peripheral and central perturbations, as they attempt to complete the task as maximally and/or quickly as possible. For instance, it has been shown that the central motor output, as indicated by changes in power output and muscle electromyographic (EMG) activity, is reduced (and performance time is lengthened) during most of a high-intensity cycling time trial performed in moderate hypoxia, compared with normoxia, but that the amount of peripheral muscle fatigue developed at end-exercise (assessed via quadriceps twitch force) is similar in both conditions [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This muscle de-recruitment by the central nervous system (CNS) in anticipation of the end of the exercise could limit the development of locomotor muscle fatigue, and, presumably, increase the likelihood of optimal performance [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Combined, these observations have led to the theoretical proposition that peripheral muscle fatigue may be regulated during whole-body, high-intensity exercise (for review see <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>The presence of a putative threshold for peripheral muscle fatigue has mostly been investigated (but still not demonstrated as part of an intervention trial) during endurance exercise [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, many sport disciplines (e.g., football, basketball, hockey, soccer, rugby, etc) require athletes to perform short, all-out bouts of exercise (~300% maximal O<sub>2</sub> uptake) interspersed with relatively short recovery intervals. Repeated-sprint exercise (RSE) can also be considered as a closed-loop-design test in which the number of sprints to be performed is known beforehand. Participants select their force output as they attempt to complete the highest mechanical work possible over the given number of sprints [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This suggests a link between peripheral perturbations and the regulation of muscle recruitment. The succession of efforts and incomplete recovery that characterises RSE typically induces large metabolic perturbations within active muscles [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and results in large decrements in mechanical indices from the initial to the last sprint during prolonged protocols (e.g., &#x0003e;25% reduction in mechanical work with 10+ sprints) [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, few studies have examined the regulation of muscle recruitment during RSE [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The causes of the reduction in central motor output (i.e., power output and EMG activity) during intermittent tasks may be multiple [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. For example, a ~4% reduction in arterial O<sub>2</sub> saturation has been correlated with the attenuation in EMG activity of main muscles and with the reduction in muscle mechanical output during 20 x 5-s cycle sprints [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Although a correlation is not indicative of cause and effect, it is well supported by the observation of larger RSE performance decrements in hypoxia than in normoxia, associated with varied metabolic and neuromuscular perturbations [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>-<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. To date however, it is not known whether or not peripheral and central factors interact during RSE. In addition, the use of RSE (as compared with endurance tasks) would provide a further challenge of the hypothesis claiming the existence of a fatigue threshold during intense exercise [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Given the above findings, hypoxia offers a relevant manipulation of peripheral and central mechanisms to examine how the CNS interacts with active skeletal muscles during intermittent sprint tasks.</p><p>Based on the observed effects of hypoxemia on RSE and time-trial endurance performance, it is likely that the development of peripheral and central fatigue is inter-related during RSE. We hypothesised that hypoxia would induce a lower level of central motor output and performance than normoxia so that the magnitude of peripheral muscle fatigue is similar at end-exercise. </p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Participants</title><p>Ten male athletes from the university and local sports clubs (soccer, Australian Rules football, basketball, track and field sprinting, martial arts), with some sprint cycling experience (5 athletes cycled as part of their cross training), volunteered for the study (mean &#x000b1; SD: age 22.8 &#x000b1; 4.4 y, height 180.7 &#x000b1; 10.7 cm, body mass 83.2 &#x000b1; 14.2 kg, physical activity 6.8 &#x000b1; 2.1 h.week<sup>-1</sup>). All subjects were healthy and with no known neurological or cardiovascular diseases. After being fully informed of the requirements, benefits, and risks associated with participation, each participant gave a written informed consent. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from The Victoria University Human Subject Research Committee.</p><sec id="s2.1.1"><title>Experimental design</title><p>Athletes visited the laboratory three times (one familiarisation and two trials). During the first visit, stature and body mass were recorded. Then, athletes were familiarised with sprint cycling until fully confident of producing an all-out effort from a stationary start, and performed a torque&#x02013;velocity test to determine the optimal cycling cadence, which was subsequently used in the two main trials. Briefly, after a 5-min self-paced warm-up (~60&#x02013;120 watts), athletes performed five maximal 5-s cycle sprints against different resistances and interpsersed with 5 min of passive recovery. Sprints were initiated with the dominant lower limb, from the same position (crank arm located 45&#x000b0; forward to the vertical axis), and athletes remained seated and were strongly encouraged to reach maximal pedalling rate as quickly as possible. The individual power&#x02013;velocity relationships were obtained, and the optimal cycling cadence was defined as the cadence for which maximal cycling power output was reached. </p><p>Following the familiarisation session, athletes were randomised in a single-blind, cross-over design and asked to perform a RSE in normoxia (F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> 0.209, inspired PO<sub>2</sub>: 149.0 mmHg) and in acute normobaric hypoxia (F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> 0.138, inspired PO<sub>2</sub>: 98.4 mmHg). The study was conducted in Melbourne, Australia at an altitude of 60 m, and all trials were performed in an environmental chamber at Victoria University in which enriched nitrogen produced normobaric hypoxia. Athletes entered the chamber to be equipped with necessary instrumentation, and left the chamber after all instrumentation had been removed at the end of the trial. Trials were conducted at the same time of day for every athlete and were separated by a minimum of 4 days. Temperature and humidity were maintained constant throughout all testing at 21.4 &#x000b1; 0.3&#x000b0;C and 41.2 &#x000b1; 3.1%. </p></sec></sec><sec id="s2.2"><title>Repeated-sprint exercise</title><p>Testing was performed on an electronically-braked cycle ergometer (Excalibur, Lode, Groningen, the Netherlands) that was set in isokinetic mode. The pedalling rate was the same for every sprint in both trials so that exercise-induced changes in physiological responses and mechanical output would not be influenced by changes in pedalling rate between the two trials. The selected pedalling rate was the pre-determined individual optimal cycling cadence (128.7 &#x000b1; 12.5 rpm) as this specific cadence allows athletes to produce the maximal amount of mechanical work output during the sprints [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The software provided instantaneous, average and peak values for power (watts), and time at 4 Hz. Mechanical work performed (J) was calculated by integrating the power curve over the entire duration of the sprint for every sprint. Absolute work (total work, J) was calculated as the sum of the 15 sprints mechanical work values. The relative (% decrement) score was then calculated as the percent difference between total and ideal work (calculated as the first sprint work value x 15). Athletes were instrumented with necessary electrodes and sensors (~10 min), and were then asked to rest in the exercising position on the ergometer for 2 min. After a 7-min self-paced warm-up (~60&#x02013;120 watts cycling and two 5-s warm-up sprints separated by 1 min), athletes rested for another 1 min, and the RSE (three sets of five 5-s sprints with 25 s of passive rest between sprints and 120 s between sets) was initiated. This experimental protocol was used to i) mimic the changing effort-rest pattern of team sports and ii) investigate the relationship between peripheral and central fatigue in an exercise model different than the &#x0201c;classical&#x0201d; continuous series of sprints used in the repeated-sprint literature [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Athletes were instructed to cycle as &#x0201c;hard as you can go&#x0201d; from the start of every sprint, and were verbally encouraged throughout each sprint to promote a maximal effort. Athletes remained seated during every sprint and recovery period. The handlebars and seat were individually adjusted to each athlete&#x02019;s characteristics, which was replicated for all three trials, and their feet were secured to the pedals using straps. Visual feedback of power output was not available to the athletes during any sprint.</p></sec><sec id="s2.3"><title>Physiological and perceptual responses to exercise</title><sec id="s2.3.1"><title>Arterial oxygen saturation (<italic>S</italic>

Blood was drawn (2 mL) at rest and immediately after the 5<sup>th</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> sprints and 5 min post-exercise. Samples were immediately analysed using automated analysers (YSI 2300 STAT plus, YSI Inc, Yellow Springs, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s2.3.3"><title>NIRS measurements and analysis</title><p>Subjects were instrumented with two pairs of NIRS probes to monitor absorption of light across cerebral and muscle tissue (Oxymon MKIII, Artinis, The Netherlands), as previously described [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Briefly, one NIRS emitter and detector pair was placed over the left prefrontal lobe, between Fp1 and F3 (international EEG 10-20 system), and placement was further adjusted (less than 5 mm) to obtain strong signal strength on every subject. Spacing between optodes was fixed at 40 mm using a black, plastic spacer held in place via double-sided, stick disks and a black, tensioning headband to reduce the intrusion of extraneous light and the loss of transmitted NIR light from the field of investigation. Pictures of the optode position were taken to ensure accurate replacement on subsequent visits. A second NIRS pair was fixed on the distal part of the right vastus lateralis muscle belly (approximately 15 cm above the proximal border of the patella) using a black, plastic spacer with optode distance of 40 mm. Skinfold thickness was measured between the emitter and detector using a skinfold calliper (Harpenden Ltd.) to account for skin and adipose tissue thickness covering the muscle. The skinfold thickness (6.0 &#x000b1; 1.1 mm) was less than half the distance between the emitter and the detector in every case. Probes were secured to the skin using double-sided, stick disks and shielded from light using black bandages. An indelible pen was used and pictures were taken to mark the position of the optode for subsequent visits.</p><p>A modified form of the Beer-Lambert law was used to calculate micromolar changes in tissue oxy- ([O<sub>2</sub>Hb]) and deoxy-haemoglobin ([HHb]) and total haemoglobin ([THb]) across time using received optical densities from two continuous wavelengths of NIR light (763 and 855 nm). An age-dependent differential optical pathlength factor for cerebral cortex (range: 5.57&#x02013;6.14) and of 4.95 for muscle were used. The tissue saturation index (TSI = [O<sub>2</sub>Hb] / [THb], expressed in %), which reflects the dynamic balance between O<sub>2</sub> supply and O<sub>2</sub> consumption in the tissue microcirculation and is independent of near-infrared photon pathlength in tissue, was used as an index of tissue oxygenation [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. NIRS data were acquired at 10 Hz, and averaged over the last 2.5 s within every sprint to obtain one value per sprint.</p></sec><sec id="s2.3.4"><title>Surface electromyography (EMG) acquisition and analysis</title><p>The EMG signals of the <italic>vastus lateralis</italic>, <italic>vastus medialis</italic> and <italic>rectus femoris</italic> were recorded from the dominant lower limb (right in all instances) via surface electrodes (Noraxon dual electrodes, Noraxon Inc., USA, 10-mm electrode diameter, 20-mm inter-electrode distance). Recording electrodes were fixed longitudinally over the muscle bellies (vastus lateralis and medialis: distal placement, rectus femoris: proximal placement). Electrode site preparation was thoroughly performed before the beginning of every test and electrode location was measured and then marked with a waterproof felt-tip pen to ensure reliable electrode replacement in subsequent testing sessions. To ensure low levels of movement artefact, electrode cables were fastened to the athlete&#x02019;s limb with medical adhesive tape and wrapped in elastic bandage. The raw EMG signals were pre-amplified (gain = 1000) and sampled at 1 kHz (DTS Noraxon System, Noraxon Inc., USA). Changes in amplitude of the EMG signals were analysed in reference to the crank angle position. A custom-made reed switch was used to detect the time at which the left crank crossed the top dead centre. The signal from the reed switch was recorded on a channel of the EMG system and thus synchronised with EMG signals. During post-processing, the EMG signals were rectified and filtered (bandwidth frequency = 12&#x02013;500 Hz) to minimise extraneous noise and possible movement artefacts in the low-frequency region and to eliminate aliasing and other artefacts in the high-frequency region. The root mean square (RMS) of each of the three muscle signals was calculated across 5 consecutive crank cycles in every sprint. Then, total EMG activity (RMS<sub>sum</sub>) was calculated by summing the RMS values across the three muscles for every sprint [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. RMS<sub>sum</sub> is reported as a percent of the initial sprint value.</p><p>The surface EMG electrodes were also used to assess the magnetically-evoked compound muscle action potentials (M-waves) for the quadriceps muscles to evaluate changes in M-wave properties pre- <italic>versus</italic> post-exercise. Membrane excitability was assessed before and immediately after exercise using M-wave properties evoked by supramaximal magnetic stimuli (see procedure below). The peak-to-peak amplitude and duration were measured [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and the values for the three muscles were averaged. During each maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), EMG signals of the three muscles were quantified by using RMS calculated over a 1-s period after the torque had reached a plateau. The RMS<sub>MVC</sub> was then normalized to the corresponding M-wave amplitude (M<sub>amp</sub>) by using the ratio RMS<sub>MVC</sub>/M<sub>amp</sub>, and the values for the three muscles were averaged. A reduction in the RMS<sub>MVC</sub> without a reduction in M<sub>amp</sub> may be interpreted as a central activation failure [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Due to technical difficulties during data collection (EMG electrodes not secured properly on the skin), we report the values for 7 subjects only.</p></sec><sec id="s2.3.5"><title>Peripheral magnetic stimulation</title><p>Athletes lay supine on a custom-made bench with the right lower-limb knee joint angle set at 90&#x000b0; (0&#x000b0; = knee fully extended) of flexion and the arms folded across the chest. A magnetic stimulator (Magstim RAPID<sup>2</sup>; JLM Accutek Healthcare, Homebush, NSW) and a double 70-mm coil (producing two overlapping circular fields) were used to stimulate the quadriceps muscle and femoral nerve [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The quadriceps force responses were obtained at 1 kHz from a calibrated load cell (Extran 2kN &#x0201c;S&#x0201d; beam, model SW1, Applied Measurement, Melbourne, Australia) connected to a non-compliant strap, which was attached around the subject&#x02019;s leg just superior to the malleoli of the ankle. Care was taken to ensure that the knee angle did not change, the ankle strap and load cell were parallel to the floor, and the ankle strap position remained constant throughout the experiment. The area of stimulation associated with the largest quadriceps twitch (Q<sub>tw</sub>) and M-wave amplitudes was determined by positioning the coil head high onto the thigh, between the quadriceps muscle and the femoral triangle [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This position was kept the same for all trials. A plateau in baseline Q<sub>tw</sub> and M-wave amplitudes with increasing stimulus intensities was confirmed in nine of the ten subjects by using a progressive increase in stimulator output (from 70% to 100%), indicating maximal depolarization of the femoral nerve [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Nonetheless, we decided to include the tenth participant in the data analysis as the changes observed in neuromuscular function were similar to the other nine participants.</p><p>With the stimulus power set at 100% of maximum, single stimuli were delivered. Three potentiated Q<sub>tw</sub> (Q<sub>tw,pot</sub>) were obtained 5 s after a 4-s MVC of the quadriceps. This procedure was performed two times at baseline (60 s of rest in between) such that six Q<sub>tw,pot</sub> values are obtained, but was only performed once at end-exercise to reduce post-exercise assessment time and limit recovery as much as possible.

The remaining Q<sub>tw,pot</sub> were averaged and analysed for peak force, contraction time, maximal rate of force development, one-half relaxation time, and maximal relaxation rate.</p><p>The area between the quadriceps and femoral nerve was also stimulated (superimposed single stimuli) during the MVCs to determine the completeness of muscle activation [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].

As hypothesised, however, the magnitude of quadriceps fatigue induced by the sprints (i.e., &#x02206;Q<sub>tw,pot</sub> from pre- to post-exercise) was similar in the two F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4.2"><title>Interaction of peripheral and central factors</title><p>We tested the hypothesis that muscle fatigue development in hypoxia would be limited by a concomitant reduction in central motor output and exercise performance. The original finding was that, during RSE in which athletes can determine their second-by-second muscle force output, the magnitude of peripheral muscle fatigue (&#x02206;Q<sub>tw,pot</sub>) developed at end-exercise (~54%) was similar in both normoxia and hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077297-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The metabolic state of the muscles (as assessed non-invasively via muscle NIRS and blood [Lac<sup>-</sup>]) also appeared to be similar in the two F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> conditions, despite lower work produced in hypoxia [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, these variables are indirect measures, and other studies have demonstrated greater metabolic perturbations and anaerobic energy release after sprint exercise in hypoxia, suggesting greater peripheral fatigue [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. These discrepancies could be due to different measurement techniques and sprint protocols. In fact, the 5-s sprint used in the present study has a much lower glycolytic contribution than a 30-s sprint [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], which may explain the greater lactate production observed in longer sprints, compared with shorter sprints that rely more on the phosphagen system [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. </p><p>Similar findings concerning fixed, end-exercise peripheral muscle fatigue have been reported during high-intensity, constant-workload cycle exercises to exhaustion [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and cycling time trials [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In the present study, we found lower muscle recruitment (RMS<sub>MVC</sub>/M<sub>amp</sub> and Q<sub>CAR</sub>) and cycling performance in hypoxia than in normoxia, confirming earlier studies [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. One may speculate that if mechanical work output during the RSE performed in hypoxia had been maintained equal to that in normoxia (~8% difference in total mechanical work between normoxia and hypoxia), the rate of peripheral fatigue development would have been accelerated. Rather, muscle recruitment and cycling performance appeared down-regulated in anticipation of the end of the exercise, and were concomitant to a greater central activation failure in the presence of moderate hypoxemia (~82% S<sub>p</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], which resulted in a similar magnitude of peripheral fatigue in both environments. That said, the current study design does not robustly allow determining the causality between central regulation and muscle fatigue development, and, therefore, we must acknowledge the possibility that the two events could have only been temporally related.</p><p>These concomitant declines in muscle recruitment and performance may indicate that the recruitment of fewer motor neurones and/or lower motor unit discharge rate have caused the work output of the muscles to fall [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In fact, a closer look at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077297-g001">Figure 1A</xref> reveals that performance in hypoxia reached its lowest in sprint 10; it was not reduced further in sprints 11&#x02013;15. One may speculate that performance had reached a low-enough level that could be maintained without causing large, additional metabolic and/or functional disturbances. Overall, this interpretation is in keeping with the strong theoretical framework that centrally-mediated restriction in the development of peripheral locomotor muscle fatigue might help prevent excessive disturbance of muscle homeostasis and potential harm to the organism [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. For instance, the encephalography-detected activity of the mid/anterior insular cortex, responsible for processing sensory information and for signalling forthcoming physiological threats, was found to increase during fatiguing cycling exercise [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The authors further reported a fatigue-induced increase in the interaction between the insular and motor cortices, suggesting greater communication between neural structures at the point of exhaustion and ultimately providing a basis for cortical mechanism for supraspinal fatigue [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Therefore, by exposing the interaction between locomotor muscle recruitment, mechanical output and fatigue during intermittent, short cycling sprints, the present study further highlights the integrative (peripheral and central) nature of the regulation of performance [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>The above interpretation of the interaction between muscle fatigue development and central adjustments during RSE is in accordance with studies that have investigated anticipatory regulation and pacing during sprint exercise. Although evidence is scarce, the performance that a participant is consciously or subconsciously willing to give during a maximal task appears to depend on the duration of the sprint [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and the number of sprints to be performed [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], two factors that contribute directly to exacerbating peripheral muscle fatigue. Therefore, the present study adds to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying pacing and avoidance strategies [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] by demonstrating that the rate of development of peripheral muscle fatigue contributes to influence muscle recruitment and performance during all-out exercise. It is important to note that in the present study athletes were not informed of the general purpose of the study and were blind regarding the environmental condition they were in; only two athletes were able to correctly identify the order of treatment. Consequently, the lower performance observed in hypoxia compared with normoxia was likely due to the effects of the environment <italic>per se</italic>, and not caused by a reduction of the effort that the athletes were willing to do (i.e., a belief effect).</p></sec><sec id="s4.3"><title>Effects of oxygen availability on peripheral muscle factors</title><p>For performance to be continuously adjusted necessitates that peripheral perturbations in the working muscles, which were changed in the present study through manipulation of F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, be monitored and that feedback pathways relay critical information to higher-order centres to subsequently influence motor output (for more details see <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Arterial O<sub>2</sub> desaturation is well known to contribute to locomotor muscle fatigue and thus to performance during high-intensity exercise. Constant-load exercise that caused a progressive S<sub>p</sub>O<sub>2</sub> desaturation to ~91%, resulted in a reduction of muscle force output immediately following exercise at all stimulation frequencies (1&#x02013;100 Hz) that averaged 33% below baseline. When this desaturation was prevented and S<sub>p</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was held at resting levels, the reduction in force was still significant but was only one half of that observed in the presence of desaturation [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Thus, the prevention of arterial desaturation reduced the amount of exercise-induced quadriceps fatigue, and was accompanied by a lower rate of rise in arterial blood lactate concentration [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These findings were extended by showing that reducing F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accelerated the rate of peripheral muscle fatigue development during constant-load cycling exercise of equal workloads and durations [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and led to lower power output and longer performance time during a time trial compared with normoxic control exercise [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, few studies have reported the effect of changing F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on RSE performance [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Collectively, these studies also show that arterial hypoxemia induces greater metabolic perturbations and reduces performance (~8&#x02013;18%) during ten sprints repeated with an incomplete recovery period [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>-<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These laboratory-based data are in good agreement with the observation that rugby athletes&#x02019; ability to perform endurance work during a 20-m shuttle run decreased significantly along with their ability to produce repetitive explosive power at altitudes of 1550 to 1700m [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. </p></sec><sec id="s4.4"><title>Effects of oxygen availability on muscle recruitment</title><p>The above data implicate an effect of reduced O<sub>2</sub> saturation on locomotor muscle fatigue and on exercise performance, but they do not rule out a direct effect of O<sub>2</sub> desaturation on reducing motor output to the locomotor muscles during exercise. For instance, the markedly lower cerebral oxygenation observed when exercising under hypoxia in the present study could have also contributed to the lower RSE performance. It has already been shown that arterial hypoxemia (~76% S<sub>p</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) reduces pre-frontal cortex oxygenation during RSE, which contributes to curtail muscle recruitment and performance [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. That being said, while hypoxic-sensitive sources of inhibition of central motor output exist outside any influences related to peripheral muscle fatigue and its associated afferent feedback, their relative role in performance decrement appears more important in severe hypoxia (&#x0003c;75% S<sub>p</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and ~53-55% cerebral tissue oxygenation index) [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Interestingly, while the present study was performed under moderate hypoxemia (~82% S<sub>p</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), cerebral TSI decreased to ~53% in the third sprint and remained low until the end of the protocol. In such conditions of oxygenation, a direct effect of hypoxia in reducing the central motor output to working muscles is possible [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This requires further experimentation during RSE in particular using circulatory occlusion to better distinguish between peripheral and central influences.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although we cannot robustly discard the possibility that the two events regulating performance were not causally related, we interpret the present findings to suggest that the CNS regulated the development of peripheral locomotor muscle fatigue during sprint exercise, which we manipulated via F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, via reductions in muscle recruitment and exercise intensity. The lower cycling performance in hypoxia, despite similar functional muscle conditions (as shown by twitch and M-waves responses), may indicate an anticipatory central regulation of exercise performance, which could provide a basis for the observation of a pacing strategy during sprint exercise [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, our results also do not rule out a direct effect of O<sub>2</sub> desaturation on reducing motor output to the locomotor muscles during exercise. Nevertheless, by using an original experimental approach (sprint exercise vs. endurance task), this work extends previous findings of the controlling role of the CNS in the regulation of performance during high-intensity, whole-body exercise.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We sincerely thank Ian Fairweather for his valuable technical support and assistance with data collection.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
