Quality improvement efforts have demonstrated that electronic health record (EHR) prompting can improve pediatric weight-related assessment and intervention as integral components of primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that intervention intensity via contact frequency of behavioral family lifestyle interventions predicted greater weight improvement (based on body mass index (BMI) z score reduction) in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].

Despite the strong evidence that intensive family-based interventions can reduce obesity and its co-morbidities, implementation of such programs is limited especially in low income predominately minority communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and attrition rates are frequently greater than 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Surveys by the Children&#x02019;s Hospital Association found that only 40% of hospitals reported having established procedures for identifying children for whom obesity was a potential health risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and that low-income parents, who had dropped out of family weight management programs/clinics, indicated that transportation and inflexible program/clinic schedules were barriers to their participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Other social and environmental barriers and challenges that low-income minority families face include unsafe streets, poor neighborhood recreational facilities, lack of sports options, abundance of fast food and street vending outlets, limited number and poor quality of grocery stores, long work hours, influence of extended family, and promotion of high calorie foods as inexpensive treats/rewards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

Our aim was to compare the efficacy of providing a bilingual weight management intervention as a high quality Standard Care Alone delivered by two primary care pediatricians, versus providing the Standard Care + Enhanced Program, which added skills-based core modules and post-core support from a multidisciplinary team to facilitate intervention tailoring. We hypothesized that children from families randomized to the Standard Care + Enhanced Program would have greater improvements in body mass index (BMI) Z-scores and metabolic parameters than children from families randomized to the Standard Care Alone.

Recruitment and enrollment occurred from 27 July 2009 through 30 December 2011 in collaboration with primary care providers. All study materials were available in English and Spanish; the study staff communicated in the language preferred by the families. The study recruitment was designed to interface with the EHR System, which prompts primary care providers to measure height and weight at each visit and flags children with a BMI&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;85th percentile for primary provider review. A study assistant used the EHR flagging system to identify eligible children (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1579). Each primary care provider received a list of his or her potentially eligible patients to review, and children (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;299) were ineligible based on feedback from the primary care provider. For the study pediatricians who provided the Standard Care weight management consults, patient enrollment was limited to new patients. These (embedded) pediatricians had already referred their overweight patients to the designated weight management service sessions. Therefore, their ongoing patients with a BMI&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;85th percentile would have received weight management services within the past 2 years, making them ineligible. After review of eligibility with primary care providers, study staff provided a brief study overview to the parent/guardian of eligible children and addressed questions. Additionally, flyers were posted in the clinic area to reinforce the recruitment efforts and stimulate self-referrals. Written consent was obtained from all parent/guardian, and assent was obtained from child(ren) entered into the study. Study staff opened sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes to randomize families based on a computer generated 1:1 allocation schedule created by the data unit.

While 85% of families completed all of the 8 modules, only 22% of families had &#x0003e;6 contacts. The trend for greater BMI Z-score improvement is consistent with Janicke et al. meta-analysis which found that increasing the number of contacts was a strong predictor of BMI Z-score improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par47">The Standard Care + Enhanced Program achieved significantly greater improvements in metabolic parameters than Standard Care Alone. The unanticipated rise in triglyceride concentrations in Standard Care Alone arm was likely related to hormonal changes associated with pubertal development, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] rather than any adverse effect of the intervention. Although there were no significant baseline differences between the randomization arms, the Standard Care Alone arm tended to have a higher proportion of boys. The predictors of BMI Z-score improvement included being a girl and older. Predictors of metabolic changes will be addressed in a future manuscript considering the sexual maturation and the earlier age of pubertal development in girls than boys as potential contributors to metabolic improvement in relations to BMI Z-score improvement.</p><p id="Par48">The program evaluation suggests that the parents/guardians found most of the intervention components helped their child/children change eating or physical activity habits. Components that were less frequently used included meeting (via physician referral) with a social worker or dietitian and learning about websites. Parents/guardians reported that barriers to making positive changes in diet quality and physical activity included time constraints, higher cost of healthy foods, transportation difficulties, and inadequate family support. Nearly 40% of the parents/guardians indicated that their family had food insecurity (worry about running out of money to buy food), which was associated with a greater likelihood of pressuring their child(ren) to eat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Study limitations</title><p id="Par49">Generalizability of our findings may be limited by the demographic characteristics of study population, institutional characteristics, enrollment of about half of eligible families, and reliance on make-up sessions. However, the need to leverage publically funded health-care resources to address the burden of excess body weight in ethnic minority and low-income youth is universal and should be explored further [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par50">The study may have been under powered, potentially because the effect of the Standard Care quarterly consults provided by the experienced and highly skilled study pediatricians was greater than anticipated. Although we did not have a minimal intervention control arm, our study demonstrated the benefit of primary care pediatricians systematically addressing weight management care recommendations on a quarterly basis. Achieving frequent intervention contact appears to be particularly challenging. Despite making changes to accommodate the needs of the parents/guardians, delivering the intervention in eight contact sessions proved difficult. An average of one-and-a-half modules had to be addressed during each Skill Building Core contact session. Prior research has suggested frequency of weight management intervention contacts is a key predictor of change in BMI Z-score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Digital technology has the potential for increasing contact frequency, but less than 20% of the parents/guardians indicated learning about websites was helpful in changing eating or physical activity habits. Text messaging may be more acceptable as a venue for maintaining frequent contact in weight management programs for low-income families with Spanish-speaking parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">Self-reported data may be biased due to the effects of socially desirable responses. The highly favorable program evaluation limits the lessons learned and insights for improving weight management services, but the low usage and potentially low interest in using websites posed issues that need further refinement. Our program evaluation survey did not assess the perceived helpfulness of intervention delivery by telephone or the potential use of other digital technology or social media to promote healthier eating and physical activity. Input from youth with a BMI&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;85th percentile and their parents/guardians could provide valuable insights with regard to using digital platform and social media in weight management. Stakeholder feedback needs to address the facilitators and barriers to healthier eating and physical activity. The mandated annual Community Health Needs Assessment provides a venue for eliciting the opinions of parents/guardians about weight management services delivered by telephone calls, texting, or use of other digital technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec32"><title>Study strengths</title><p id="Par52">Study strengths include collaborative goal-setting to empower parents/guardians and children to make informed lifestyle choices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], focusing on an underserved high risk largely Hispanic population, using electronic health records to identify eligible children, and retaining &#x0003e;80% of participants. During enrollment some parents declined study enrollment due to time and other commitments that prevented them from participating in a more intensive weight management program. Therefore, increasing the internal validity (80% retention) based on explanatory trial criteria may have reduced the external validity (generalization) of findings based on pragmatic trial criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par53">Our findings suggest that safety-net care settings can address weight management standards in quarterly family consults to achieve a modest BMI Z-score improvement in children whose BMI is &#x02265; the 85th percentile. Adding an enhanced program may achieve greater metabolic improvement that may be independent of weight change since the Enhanced Program did not achieve a greater reduction in BMI Z-score. Pediatric overweight and obesity should be managed as a chronic condition in public hospital safety-net ambulatory care programs and other primary care settings. Including weight-management services in publically funded primary care programs could address the needs of low-income families to help prevent as well as treat excess weight gain.</p><sec id="Sec34"><title>Clinical implications</title><p id="Par54">Children who are &#x02265;85th BMI percentile for age and sex can be readily identified in public hospital setting using EHR data, and their families can be recruited to participate in a weight management program in collaboration with primary care providers. Embedding family weight management services within pediatric primary care practices makes such services more readily available without complex referral procedures, which can be a barrier for families with few resources and may not speak the dominant culture language. However, hospital-based weight management programs may need greater community engagement to address barriers to achieving healthy eating and physical activity habits in low resource communities when children from immigrant families are at risk for becoming obese. Questions about weight management program delivery need to be incorporated into hospital community health needs assessment. The Affordable Care Act mandates that not-for-profit hospitals in the United States update assessments and service plans annually, and hospitals and other health service providers need to address the more complex issues that contribute to low resource community health disparities including obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p id="Par55">Future research should engage non-English speaking parents/guardians as stakeholders in developing, implementing and evaluating weight management programming for immigrant families whose child/children are at risk for or have gained excess body weight. Their input may provide valuable insights for how to increase contact frequency, such as offering healthy lifestyle programs in convenient locations to minimize travel time and considering digital options that are more likely to engage families who are least likely to participate.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec35"><p>
