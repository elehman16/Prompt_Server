This study evaluated the efficacy of oral propranolol comparing to oral steroids in management of pediatric hemangiomas.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS</title><p>In North India from January 2012 to January 2015, sixty children &#x0003c;6 years old with superficial hemangiomas were divided into 2 groups; oral propranolol vs. oral prednisolone. All participants were assessed for electrocardiogram, heart rate, blood pressure and sugar and initial therapy was started using 1 mg/kg and in absence of adverse effects, 2 mg/kg was administered after 2 weeks. The hemangioma Activity Score (HAS) was used for scoring and patients were followed up for 6 months.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>The propranolol group mostly showed early response to the drug and needed the drug for less time compared to corticosteroid group. In propranolol group, 16.5%, 23% and 59% needed the drug to be continued for 8-12, 4-8 and 4 months. In corticosteroid group, the therapy was continued for 8-12, and 4-8 months in 76.8% and 16.5% and in 6.6% was stopped within 4 months. In propranolol group, the response was 70% compared to 40% in other group. The mean HAS decreased significantly in propranolol group when compared to steroid group.

Although most lesions proliferate and then involute with minimal consequence, a significant minority can be disfiguring, functionally significant, or, rarely, life-threatening.<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>
</p><p>Leaute-Labreze <italic>et al.</italic> reported incidental decrease in size of infantile haemangiomas on propranolol with dramatic results.<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Potential explanations for this effect given by them were vasoconstriction, which is immediately visible as a change in color, associated with a palpable tissue softening. Other included suggestions are a down-regulation of angiogenetic factors such as VEGF and bFGF and an up-regulation of apoptosis of capillary endothelial cells.<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> There are also data published which indicate a selective role of propranolol in inhibiting the expression of MMP-9 (angiogenic and extracellular matrix degrading enzyme) and HBMEC (human brain microvascular endothelial cells).<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>

Although it is benign and self-limiting, severe complications can arise due to fast growth. It is difficult to pin point one event in pathogenesis of hemangioma, rather there are several mechanisms which act together, although local hypoxia seems to be the most important factor. Three main hypotheses have been proposed, namely (i) the theory of tissue hypoxia, (ii) the theory of embolization of placental endothelial cells, and (iii) the theory of increased angiogenic and vasculogenic activity.<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Though most of the cases occur in head and neck region, it can occur in airway, perineum and even body cavities.<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> There is confusion whether infantile hemangioma is an isolated entity or a spectrum of vascular anomalies including rapidly involuting congenital hemangioma (RICH ) and Non-involuting congenital hemangioma (NICH). RICH and NICH have similarities in appearance, location, size, equal sex ratio, and both have overlapping radiologic and histologic features with infantile hemangioma. However, neither type of congenital tumor has immunostains for glucose transporter-1 protein, a marker of infantile hemangioma.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>
</p><p>Prior to use of propranolol for management of hemangiomas, corticosteroids were the first line of treatment;<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> other options included interferon alfa<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and vincristine.<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Propranolol hydrochloride, a nonselective &#x003b2;-adrenergic blocking agent, has been used for years in infants and children with congenital heart disease, arrhythmias, hypertension, thryotoxicosis, migraines, and behavioral disorders. It has recently been used in the treatment of infantile hemangiomas (IHs) after growth arrest of an infant&#x02019;s hemangioma was incidentally noted when propranolol was started for obstructive hypertrophic myocardiopathy by Leaute-Labreze <italic>et al.</italic><sup>17</sup></p><p>These authors initiated propranolol therapy to 2 children who had severe or disfiguring capillary haemangiomas on a dose of 2 mg/kg, after encouraging results they further gave the drug to another 9 patients. In all patients, after 24 hours of initiation of treatment, they observed a change in the haemangioma from intense red to purple. After these initial changes the haemangiomas continued to improve until they were nearly flat, with residual skin telengectasias.<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The therapeutic effect of propranolol on infantile capillary hemangiomas is because of vasoconstriction leading to immediate improvement and decreased expression of VEGF and bFGF genes through the down-regulation of the RAF&#x02013;mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> and the triggering of apoptosis of capillary endothelial cells<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> leading to long term improvement. </p><p>Holmes <italic>et al.</italic> prospectively assessed the safety and efficacy of propranolol for problematic haemangiomas. Propranolol in a dose of 3 mg/kg was given to 31 consecutive patients who had rapidly proliferating infantile haemangiomas with functional impairment or cosmetic disfigurement. A rapid halt in haemangioma proliferation was seen in 100% patients and significant reduction in 87% of patients.<sup><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Leaute-Labreze <italic>et al.</italic> performed a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, adaptive, phase 2&#x02013;3 trial assessing the efficacy and safety of a pediatric-specific oral propranolol solution in infants 1 to 5 months of age with proliferating infantile hemangioma requiring systemic therapy.<sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>
</p><p>Of 460 infants who underwent randomization, 456 received treatment. On the basis of an interim analysis of the first 188 patients who completed 24 weeks of trial treatment, the regimen of 3 mg of propranolol per kilogram per day for 6 months was selected for the final efficacy analysis. The frequency of successful treatment was higher with this regimen than with placebo (60% vs. 4%, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). A total of 88% of patients who received the selected propranolol regimen showed improvement by week 5, versus 5% of patients who received placebo.<sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>
</p><p>In our study, also propranolol has been found to be very safe at dose of 2 mg/kg except for mild side effects in two patients (6.7%). In our study, 84% patients showed response to propranolol treatment of which 70% (21 patients) had complete resolution. Once we analyzed the non-responders to propranolol, we found that that those who presented after 1 year of age are more likely to show less response (80 % non responders in &#x0003e;1 yr of age Vs 20 % non-responders in &#x0003c;1 year of age), probably because of cessation of proliferative activity of tumor beyond infancy. </p><p>While many authors believe good response is expected when the therapy is started within the first 12 months of life,<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> there are studies contrary to this, which state that the involution seems not to depend on the location of the hemangioma or the age at initiation of therapy.<sup>23</sup> Razon <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that the involutive phase of IH involves high apoptosis and low proliferation of endothelial and hence efficacy of propranolol will decrease as proliferation has decreased after 1 year of age.<sup><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p><p>We did not observe any severe adverse effect in our patients effects except for transient flu like illness and mild brochospasm in one patient each which resolved by itself. Though safety of propranolol has been established by large randomized controlled trials,<sup><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> however, still there are few case reports of severe side effects with use of propranolol like hypoglycemia, hypotension, bronchial asthma, flu like illness, somnolence, gastroesophageal reflux, respiratory syncytial virus exacerbation and rash.<sup><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup><sup>-</sup><sup><xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>
</p><p>An important way to avoid complications with propranolol therapy is to start it at low dose of 1 mg/kg and gradually escalate it to 2-3 mg/kg. Basic investigations (like ECG, heart rate, blood pressure and blood sugar) should be done at beginning and repeated at regular intervals to monitor therapy. Other oral beta-blockers such as atenolol, nadolol and acebutalol have also been used in hemangioma, however they are less studied, but may offer similar efficacy.<sup><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>
</p><p>No trials have compared safety and efficacy of different &#x003b2;-blockers in management of hemangiomas. Topical 0.5% timolol maleate has been recently tried and shown good results in superficial haemangiomas with the added advantage of very minimal systemic absorption. There are also case reports of use of ACE inhibitors for IH with good results.<sup><xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> As has been mentioned in several articles, there is a chance that IH successfully treated with propranolol may recur 0&#x02013;6 months after therapy withdrawal. The frequency of recurrences in patients treated with propranolol has not been well-characterized. In the series of cases reported by Sans <italic>et al.</italic>,<sup><xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> two of 25 patients (8%) had recurrences after treatment withdrawal. The overall response to retreatment with propranolol was satisfactory. These relapses occurred before the age of 11 months, which might mean that the treatment was withdrawn before the proliferative phase of the haemangioma was over. There was no reported recurrence of haemangioma on stopping therapy in our study, even after a follow up of 6 months. </p><p>We conclude that oral propranolol in a dose of 2 mg/kg significantly decrease the HAS, when compared to oral prednisolone, with good parent satisfaction, minimal adverse effects and no recurrence/relapse of haemangiomas after a follow up period of 6 months following completion of therapy. Starting propranolol therapy in proliferative phase of hemangioma yields better results, than when it is started after infancy. However, propranolol for hemangiomas is an off-label-indication and the parents have to be well informed about its side effects. In all, propranolol appears to be an effective treatment for pediatric haemangiomas in the proliferative phase and can be considered as a first-line treatment in hemangiomas when intervention is required.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
