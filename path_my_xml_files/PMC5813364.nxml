In total, 210 adults (aged 18&#x02013;75 years) diagnosed with an AUD will be invited to participate in a 12-week intervention. The primary study outcome is alcohol consumption measure by the Timeline Follow-back method and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). Secondary outcomes include: depression, anxiety, perceived stress, sleep quality, physical activity levels, fitness, self-efficacy, health-related quality of life, and cognition.

Key features include an inability to control the amount of alcohol consumed, consumption that results in social or work-related problems, and tolerance or the need to drink increasing amounts of alcohol to obtain a desired effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Rates of help-seeking for AUDs are typically low and traditional treatments, such as medication and counseling, are often perceived as stigmatizing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Treatment outcomes are also highly variable with many patients relapsing into the dependence syndrome following a period of abstinence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Available evidence suggests that many people with an AUD are insufficiently active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and have impaired cardiorespiratory fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]; factors contributing to a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Of particular concern, even individuals with milder forms of AUD experience an excess mortality rate twice as high than those without the disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Physical exercise is known to benefit mental and physical health synergistically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and may be effective in the treatment of AUDs where multimorbidity &#x02013; the presence of two or more health problems &#x02013; is common. A growing body of evidence suggests that individuals with substance use disorders are interested in exercising and may derive benefits from regular exercise, both in terms of general health/fitness and dependence recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Cross-sectional and prospective studies have consistently shown that physical activity is associated with better mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and recent studies indicate that exercise may help reduce tobacco cravings and cigarette use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">The effects of exercise on alcohol consumption remain understudied and poorly understood. A recent meta-analysis identified 21 studies published between 1972 and 2016 examining physical activity interventions for AUDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The results indicated positive effects of exercise on depression and physical fitness, but no significant changes on measures of consumption; however, all analyses for this outcome were limited to three studies. Considerable study heterogeneity was observed, and no interventions had examined the effects of exercise alone with traditional treatments for AUDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In a recent narrative review, Giesen et al. concluded that exercise is both safe and feasible for patients with alcohol dependence, but called for larger controlled trials with comparisons of different types of exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">One issue that remains unclear is how different types of exercise influence treatment response. In mental health research, both aerobic exercise and strength training are effective in the treatment of mood disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], with effect sizes comparable to medication and psychological therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, these interventions may not be suitable for all patients with an AUD, especially those with little or no exercise experience. With its focus on flexibility, balance and posture, yoga is an increasingly popular form of exercise that could be particularly suitable for those with an AUD. Yoga meets the formal definition of &#x0201c;physical exercise&#x0201d; because it is purposeful, repetitive, and engaged in to improve fitness and/or health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, most forms of yoga include additional core elements, such as mindfulness, a focus on controlled breathing, and relaxation techniques. These features are known to have an influence on depressive symptoms and wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Moreover, previous studies found significant heterogeneity in trials incorporating these mind-body approaches when compared with conventional aerobic or strength exercises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. For these reasons, it is important to compare the effects of yoga with conventional aerobic training.</p><p id="Par14">This project builds on recently published data demonstrating the feasibility of yoga as an adjunct treatment for alcohol dependence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Extending this work, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine the effects of two 12-week, supported physical activity interventions (yoga and aerobic training) on alcohol consumption in physically inactive adults with an AUD. A comparison group will receive standard treatment, described below.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Key research questions</title><p id="Par15">

The clinic opened in 2011 and is staffed by physicians, psychologists, and allied health workers with expertise in the treatment and management of addictive behaviors, including AUDs. All participants will have a diagnosed AUD, based on <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, version 5</italic> (DSM-5) criteria. In addition to this criteria, participants must also meet the threshold for hazardous drinking, which is defined by the Swedish National Institute for Public Health as either (a) consumption of 9 or 14 standard drinks per week for women and men, respectively, or (b) binge drinking at least once during the past month (that is &#x0003e;4/5 standard drinks for men and women, consumed on a single occasion).&#x000a0;Recruitment will occur through advertisements placed in waiting rooms in primary and occupational healthcare centers in Stockholm, and media outlets, e.g., local newspapers. Participants will not be recruited directly from the specialist outpatient clinic (Riddargatan 1) because these are individuals already seeking and expecting to receive specialized treatment. Recruitment will commence in January 2018 and continue throughout the year. The study will conclude in December 2019.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design, randomization, and blinding</title><p id="Par26">This is a three-group, parallel, single-blind, RCT to compare the effects of three 12-week interventions (yoga, aerobic training, and treatment as usual (TAU)) on alcohol consumption. The proposed flow of participants through the trial is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Assessments will be made at baseline (pre randomization) and post treatment (week 13). The randomization sequence will be computer generated and performed externally by a statistician at the Karolinska Institutet. A researcher not involved in the trial, but located at the clinic where the study will be managed, will then receive the allocation in sequentially numbered, opaque envelopes. In this way, the allocation sequence will be concealed from the person responsible for randomizing study participants. Trained research assistants, including a qualified nurse or psychologist, will administer each assessment in person at Riddargatan 1. The 12-week &#x0201c;treatment&#x0201d; will commence approximately 1&#x000a0;week after the baseline assessment when participants begin training/treatment (baseline physical activity levels will be measured for 1&#x000a0;week before this, see description below). To optimize recruitment and minimize dropouts, those randomized to TAU will be offered the 12-week exercise intervention after they have completed the follow-up assessment. The study endpoint is week 13 (post-treatment). All participants will be aged 18 to 75&#x000a0;years and residents of Stockholm County. Treatment allocation will not be concealed from either participants or the researchers conducting the baseline assessments. However, as a different research assistant will perform the post-treatment assessments, follow-up assessors will be blind to group allocation. Unblinding will only occur in the event that a participant chooses to withdraw from the study.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Participant flow diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2435_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Procedure</title><p id="Par27">Prior to starting the RCT, a pilot study (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;15) will be conducted involving an intervention identical to that used in the main study. The purpose will be to test the study protocol and obtain feedback from participants on the feasibility of the interventions. Interested participants will be advised to contact the project coordinator (a qualified nurse and clinician) for information about the trial. An initial telephone-based screening interview will be performed by the coordinator to determine eligibility based on age, health status, exercise participation history, and alcohol use.

Accelerometry is a non-invasive method of monitoring human rest/activity cycles, and the device will estimate gross motor activity during the intervention. This data will enable more sophisticated analyses of the associations between exercise, physical activity, sedentary behavior, and alcohol consumption to be explored. To obtain an objective intensity measure of the prescribed physical activity sessions, data on heart rate will be collected by providing Polar heart-rate monitors to participants randomized to yoga or aerobic training. Because it is not feasible to gather heart-rate data from all participants for the entire duration of the trial, the monitors will be worn for 1&#x000a0;week during the middle of the participant&#x02019;s 12-week treatment, thereby providing an &#x0201c;average&#x0201d; indicator of activity intensity.

One advantage of this approach, is that participants will have a greater selection of times and locations for their training. Removing this choice could make the intervention impractical for some participants and reduce adherence.

At 12&#x000a0;weeks, participants receiving the exercise intervention will be encouraged to continue the regimen but without follow-up or monitoring. In addition, participants will be offered three 45-min sessions (at weeks 1, 4, and 8, approximately) with a SATS personal trainer to monitor progress and help maintain motivation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Treatment as usual (TAU)</title><p id="Par47">Participants randomized to TAU will be asked to contact by phone an alcohol information service &#x0201c;Alcohol Help&#x0201d; (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.alkoholhjalpen.se/">www.alkoholhjalpen.se</ext-link>). A qualified alcohol treatment specialist &#x02013; nurse, psychologist or similar &#x02013; will advise participants about the availability of different treatment options for their alcohol-related problem. These options include referral to a general medical practitioner, brief telephone counseling, referral to Alcoholics Anonymous or an Internet self-help website, or to a specialist alcohol treatment clinic. Participants may choose to pursue any (or none) or these treatment options. The treatment specialist will be given the participant&#x02019;s AUDIT scores to facilitate feedback, and will contact each TAU participant on three occasions (once a month) to follow up their treatment progress. The researchers will have no influence over the treatment choices made by those randomized to TAU.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Follow-up assessments and qualitative study</title><p id="Par48">All participants will be contacted by a research assistant at week 6, about half way through the intervention, and invited to attend a short meeting. The purpose will be to (1) hand out the heart-rate monitors with instructions for use and (2) to assess changes in alcohol consumption. Participants who indicate a 50% or more increase in the total volume of alcohol consumed during the past month assessed by the TLFB will be removed from the trial and offered additional clinical support. This assessment will be made by a research assistant with qualifications in nursing or psychology. Participants will be contacted again during week 13 and invited to attend a final follow-up interview. Those who decline will be invited to complete a phone interview or given a shortened baseline questionnaire to return via mail (TLFB, HAD, and physical activity only). Participants will be contacted using a combination of phone calls, emails, and text messaging up to six times over a 2-week period. In addition to collecting quantitative data, we propose to complement these data with a qualitative study. At the post-treatment assessment we propose to conduct semi-structured interviews with participants to determine which aspects of the study, including the exercise intervention, assisted them (or not) and why. During this process, we also propose to assess the acceptability of the interventions among men and women, and younger and older participants. Initial selection will be based on the order of inclusion into the trial. Since we aim for an even distribution across treatment groups, age, and gender, this will also be considered in the selection process. This is a purposive sample; interviews will be analyzed continuously during the data collection period, and the exact number of participants will be determined when &#x0201c;saturation&#x0201d; is reached and no new themes emerge from the interviews. The qualitative part of the study, i.e., developing the interview guide, selecting the participants, data collection, and analyzing the interviews, will be supervised by an experienced qualitative researcher.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Statistical analyses and power calculation</title><p id="Par49">Baseline participant characteristics stratified by treatment group will be presented. Group differences will be tested using <italic>t</italic> tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical outcomes. Parametric test assumptions will be examined and reported. Non-parametric data will be transformed or alternatively analyzed using non-parametric statistical tests. Multiple imputation will be used to replace missing internal values where appropriate. Within-group changes in the primary outcome (alcohol consumption) and secondary outcomes (depression, anxiety, cognitive ability, etc.) will be analyzed using paired-sample <italic>t</italic> tests. To address the primary research question, intention-to-treat analyses will be performed. The effect of group allocation on alcohol consumption and all secondary outcomes at 3-month follow-up will be assessed using mixed linear regression models (logistic for binary outcomes), using both the mean difference (baseline to 3&#x000a0;months) and total scores as dependent variables. Where the total score is used as the outcome, baseline group differences in covariates will be adjusted. As adherence may be sub-optimal, per-protocol analyses will also be presented. Data from individual accelerometers will be pooled to objectively assess changes in physical activity levels before and after treatment. We propose to conduct sub-group analyses based on participant gender and age to assess the effects of these variables on alcohol consumption. All analyses will be performed using SPSS 22.0. All tests will be two-sided and <italic>P</italic> values of less than 0.05 considered statistically significant.</p><p id="Par50">Our sample size calculation is based on a preliminary study of the effects of exercise on alcohol consumption by Brown et al., 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Using this study as a guide, we anticipate a standardized mean difference (effect size) of around 0.3 favoring the yoga and aerobic exercise groups equally, compared to TAU. Our recent meta-analysis identified a pooled dropout rate of 40% from exercise for AUD studies. Due to the incentives in our trial, we estimate a slightly lower dropout of around 30%. Based on these parameters, with an 80% power, two-tailed significance of 2.5% to allow for two primary between-group comparisons (yoga versus TAU, and aerobic exercise versus TAU), and 1:1:1 allocation, we estimate that a total sample size of 210 participants will be required (i.e., 70 in each group). We used the program G*Power to determine sample sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par51">The alcohol treatment clinic &#x0201c;Riddargatan 1&#x0201d; is currently trialing new treatment options for AUDs with an understanding that alcohol misuse is part of a spectrum of lifestyle imbalance; a notion that resonates well with many patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Viewed this way, changing one&#x02019;s drinking behavior and taking up regular exercise is a natural progression towards a healthier lifestyle. An added advantage of this approach is that it avoids the &#x0201c;complete abstinence&#x0201d; message and it makes treatment a more attractive and less stigmatizing option for patients. This is important, as premature termination of treatment and non-adherence are factors consistently associated with worse patient outcomes, yet both are common problems in alcohol treatment regimes. A meta-analysis of alcohol treatment outcome studies found that average short-term abstinence rates were 21% for untreated individuals, compared to 43% for treated individuals, suggesting that current therapies are more effective than no treatment, but there is considerable opportunity for improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p id="Par52">Also relevant is that around 75% of those diagnosed with an AUD report mild-to-moderate drinking problems (two to five DSM-5 criteria fullfilled), with a much smaller proportion having severe problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. A Swedish study found that the majority of people who met the DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence did not drink at the highest consumption levels, were not living alone, and were not unemployed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Most of those surveyed had few diagnostic criteria fulfilled and few social problems. This large majority with &#x0201c;moderate&#x0201d; alcohol dependence are also an under-treated group that is less inclined to seek professional help [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Currently, the individuals ultimately treated in specialist clinics tend to have more severe drinking problems, and reach out for help as a last resort, in part due to the perceived stigma of specialist clinics and the treatments currently offered.</p><p id="Par53">Recent studies show that people with AUDs are interested and willing to engage in exercise interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. We suggest that broadening the array of effective, non-stigmatizing treatment options for AUDs could increase help-seeking, particularly among the majority with less severe drinking problems, and potentially reduce treatment non-adherence and dropout. The high prevalence of comorbid somatic and psychiatric problems in this population is another area where prescribed physical exercise could be of value. Previous reviews indicate that exercise is feasible for those with AUDs and will likely have positive effects on physical fitness and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A potential source of bias &#x02013; one that exists in many RCTs &#x02013; is that the trial may attract a disproportionate number of people with positive expectations about physical activity. Where possible, characteristics of those who decline to participate will be compared to the active participants. However, the results will be generalizable to adults seeking treatment for alcohol-related problems through primary healthcare settings.</p><p id="Par54">Our meta-analysis of exercise interventions for AUD suggests that participant attrition (dropout) may be high. Indeed, non-compliance with new exercise regimens is common in the general population. To minimize the risk of treatment non-adherence, all participants will be offered three free sessions with a qualified personal trainer who will be instructed to help participants identify and overcome obstacles to regular exercise. In addition, participants will meet with a research assistant half way through the study (week 6) to give out heart-rate monitors, and to briefly discuss their progress. All exercise sessions will be monitored electronically, and those who do not attend any sessions for 1&#x000a0;week will be contacted by their assigned trainer and encouraged to continue. We provide all training facilities free of charge, and those who complete the post-treatment assessment will receive feedback on changes in their test scores (e.g., fitness and cognition).</p><p id="Par55">This large community-based trial will add clinically relevant information about the effects of acute exercise on mood, anxiety, and alcohol craving, and the effects of two popular physical activities (yoga and aerobic training) on alcohol consumption and health-related outcomes. Of importance, the trial will be one of the first to explore the effects of physical activity as standalone treatment for AUD. Policy and treatment implications of the findings will be discussed in future papers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec19"><p>
