A pilot study was done to estimate the variations of malaria incidence among villages, combined with entomological collections and an assessment of susceptibility to insecticides in malaria vectors.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A cohort of 5309 residents from four <italic>kebeles</italic> (the lowest government administrative unit) in 996 households was followed from August to December 2013 in south-central Ethiopia. Blood samples were collected by a finger prick for a microscopic examination of malaria infections. A multilevel mixed effect model was applied to measure the predictors of malaria episode. Adult mosquitoes were collected using light traps set indoors close to a sleeping person, pyrethrum spray sheet catches and artificial outdoor pit shelters. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to detect the sources of mosquito blood meals, while mosquito longevity was estimated based on parity. The World Health Organization&#x02019;s tube bioassay test was used to assess the insecticide susceptibility status of malaria vectors to pyrethroids and carbamates.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The average incidence of malaria episode was 4.6 per 10,000 person weeks of observation. The age group from 5 to 14&#x000a0;years (IRR&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2.7; 95&#x000a0;% CI 1.1&#x02013;6.6) and <italic>kebeles</italic> near a lake or river (IRR&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;14.2, 95&#x000a0;% CI 3.1&#x02013;64) were significantly associated with malaria episode. Only 271 (27.3&#x000a0;%) of the households owned insecticide-treated nets. Of 232 adult <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes collected, <italic>Anopheles arabiensis</italic> (71.1&#x000a0;%) was the predominant species. The average longevity of <italic>An. arabiensis</italic> was 14&#x000a0;days (range: 7&#x02013;25 human blood index days). The overall human blood index (0.69) for <italic>An. arabiensis</italic> was higher than the bovine blood index (0.38).

A worldwide coordinated effort achieved a 47&#x000a0;% reduction of deaths from malaria since 2000 by using the existing interventions. However, in its 2014 report, the World Health Organization (WHO) indicated that malaria continues to be a major cause of morbidity with 198 million cases globally, of which 82&#x000a0;% were from Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>In Ethiopia, malaria is one of the major public health problems. The dominant malaria parasites are <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (77&#x000a0;% of all reported malaria cases) and <italic>P. vivax</italic> (33&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], with <italic>Anopheles arabiensis</italic> being the main vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The transmission is seasonal, and determined by altitude, rainfall and temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], in addition to local epidemiology. The first malaria prevention and control strategies in Ethiopia began as pilot projects in the 1950s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and are now integrated into the national basic health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Early diagnosis and treatment of cases, LLINs and IRS are currently the main malaria prevention and control tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Despite the successes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and efforts made thus far, malaria in Ethiopia remains the main cause of morbidity (3,331,599 confirmed cases) and hospital admissions (59,370 cases) in 2012/13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>In Ethiopia, IRS and LLINs are commonly used, both separately or in combination, in the same households [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The individual effect of both IRS and LLINs on malaria incidence is quite well documented, but evidence is scarce and contradictory as to the effect of combining them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A cluster-randomized controlled trial examining the utility of each intervention, as well as their combined potential to prevent malaria transmission, will be carried out in Ethiopia to help provide useful information for policymakers and health service managers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In order to effectively implement the trial, measuring baseline data related to the existing vector species composition, density, infectivity, insecticide susceptibility status and malaria incidence were of paramount importance. Therefore, a pilot study was carried out in 2013 to collect epidemiological and entomological data from the trial area to assess variation in malaria episodes and local vector populations within and among study <italic>gares</italic> (a &#x0201c;<italic>gare</italic>&#x0201d; is a local name for village), and to determine insecticide susceptibility status.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study area</title><p>This pilot study was conducted in the Adami Tullu part of the Adami Tullu-Judo-Kombolcha district (hereafter referred to as the Adami Tullu district) located 160&#x000a0;km south of Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, and described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Briefly, the size of the district is 1403 square kilometres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and administratively divided into 48 <italic>kebeles</italic> (the lowest government administrative unit). Each <italic>kebele</italic> is further divided into <italic>gares</italic>, with each <italic>gare</italic> having an average of 35 households. The geographic location of the district and the selected <italic>kebeles</italic> are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The major rainy season is from June to August, whereas the minor rainy season is from February to March. Malaria is a major health problem, and the shores of Zeway Lake and the Bulbula River provide the main mosquito breeding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Malaria transmission is seasonal, with the majority of cases occurring from September to December each year. There is one health post in each <italic>kebele</italic> staffed by two health extension workers, who provide comprehensive preventive services to the community, including malaria diagnosis and treatment.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Geographic location of selected <italic>kebeles</italic>, Adami Tullu district, Ethiopia</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12936_2016_1199_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>A cohort of 5309 residents from 996 households in 29 <italic>gares</italic> selected from four <italic>kebeles</italic> was followed from August to December 2013. The study participants were selected through the following procedure: A preliminary mapping and census of 24 <italic>kebeles</italic> (sampling frame) in the Adami Tullu district was done in March and April 2013, with four <italic>kebeles</italic> selected from the enumerated 24 <italic>kebeles</italic> based on their distance from the main mosquito breeding sites (the Zeway lakeshore and the Bulbula River) and malaria burden (district health office malaria report). Two of the <italic>kebeles</italic>, Bochesa and Anano-Shisho, were located within 5&#x000a0;km and the other two, Elka-Chelemo and Gallo Raphe, which were beyond 5&#x000a0;km from the Zeway lake-shore and Bulbula River. To make access easy for patients with clinical sign of malaria, 29 <italic>gares</italic> within a 3-km radius from the community health posts were included. All the residents (5309) in these villages were invited to participate in the baseline survey in August 2013, and were followed-up weekly for 16&#x000a0;weeks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Weekly home visits and identification of malaria infection</title><p>Households were visited weekly (active surveillance), and household members with fever (body temperature &#x02265;37.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and/or history of fever in the last 48&#x000a0;h) were identified and referred to health posts. In addition, residents were asked to visit the health posts if they developed a fever when the project staff was not available (passive surveillance). Blood samples were collected by a finger prick of all febrile cases reported to the health posts, and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and microscopic slide examination were performed. Patients with positive RDT were treated at the health posts with anti-malarial drugs (CoArtem<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and chloroquine for <italic>P. vivax</italic>) according to the national malaria treatment guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Microscopic slides were prepared according to WHO guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and the slides were read by two expert microscopists elsewhere (one in Adama City, the capital of the East Shewa Zone and the other in the Bulbula Health Centre, Adami Tullu district), and the agreement of the two was reported. Discordant slides were read for a third time by a senior microscopist. Data on exposure variables such as socio-economic and demographic variables, ownership and use of insecticidal treated nets (ITNs), whether IRS had been carried out during the past year, history of fever and malaria treatment in householders were all collected using interviewer-administered questionnaires. Information on ITN use was obtained from household heads&#x02019; response to a question whether anyone in the households had slept under a mosquito net the night before the survey. Data were collected by diploma graduates, while the questionnaires were modified from a malaria longitudinal study tool used in southern Ethiopia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Entomological data collection</title><p>The entomological study was conducted from June to October 2013, and a total of 36 <italic>gares</italic> (12 per <italic>kebele</italic>) from each of the three <italic>kebeles</italic> (Bochesa, Elka Chelemo and Gallo Raphe) were randomly selected for adult mosquito collections. Households were selected at random from the 36 <italic>gares</italic>, and indoor and outdoor mosquito collections were undertaken every month. For indoor host-seeking mosquito collections, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention light traps (CDC-LTs) were set in one house per <italic>gare</italic> and allowed to operate from 6:00&#x000a0;pm to 6:00 am. The traps were hung approximately 45&#x000a0;cm above the floor near the feet of occupants protected by LLINs. Indoor and outdoor resting mosquitoes were collected using standard pyrethrum spray catches (PSC) and artificial pit shelters from 6:00 am to 9:00 am, respectively. The PSC was carried out from one randomly selected house per <italic>gare</italic>, while pit shelter collections were performed from six pits per <italic>kebele</italic> from a total of 18 <italic>gare</italic>s.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Processing of mosquito samples</title><p>Mosquitoes were identified to species by morphological characteristics using an identification key [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> sibling species identification was carried out through the use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The head and thorax of each mosquito was separated from the abdomen and tested for the presence of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. vivax</italic> circumsporozoite protein (CSP) by direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>The sources of mosquito blood meals were determined by the direct ELISA procedure using human and bovine antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].

Insecticide susceptibility tests were conducted on two species, <italic>An. arabiensis</italic> and <italic>An. pharoensis</italic>. The test for the former species was done in August 2013, a time when the aquatic forms are abundant. In October and November of the same year the tests for the latter species were undertaken. The WHO tube test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] was employed, and the insecticides included four pyrethroids (0.05&#x000a0;% deltamethrin, 0.75&#x000a0;% permethrin, 0.05&#x000a0;% alphacypermethrin and 0.05&#x000a0;% lambdacyhalothrin) and two carbamates (0.1&#x000a0;% bendiocarb and 0.1&#x000a0;% propoxur). The pyrethroids were impregnated in June/July 2013 and expired in June/July 2014, while bendiocarb was impregnated in May 2012 and expired in May 2015.

Each replicate contained 20 mosquitoes, and for each insecticide and control, five to six replicates varying from 100 to 120 mosquitoes were tested. After transferring to holding tubes, mosquitoes were kept for 24&#x000a0;h in a ventilated and humid box free of insecticides. A favourable temperature and humidity were created by placing a damp towel on top of the box. Mortality counts were taken at the end of 24&#x000a0;h, and when control mortality was between 5 and 20&#x000a0;%, the percentage mortality of the experimental was corrected using Abbott&#x02019;s formula.

Descriptive statistics including percentages, mean and standard deviations, were used to summarize the data. A multilevel mixed effects Poisson regression model was fitted to measure associations between response and predictor variables. Malaria incidence (count data) was assumed to follow a Poisson distribution based on random and independent occurrence. Hence, a three-level mixed effects Poisson model with log link was considered to account for malaria episodes, with clustering according to individuals, households and <italic>kebeles</italic>. Wald Chi square test was used to check the fitted model against an intercept-only model. After bivariate analysis, those variables with P&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.25 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and main factors were included in the multivariate analysis.

Fourteen variables were included: electricity, watch, radio, television, mobile telephone, separate kitchen, bike, animal cart, bank account or credit association, water source, latrine, window, materials used for a wall and the roof of the house. The first principal component represented 22.8&#x000a0;% of the variance in the sample with an eigenvalue of 3.2. Households were then ranked into three wealth categories (poor, medium, rich).

However, the incidence varied between the <italic>gares</italic>, and in <italic>gares</italic> closer to the lake or river, the incidence rate was close to eight cases per 10,000 person-weeks of observation. <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> was the dominant species, and a higher malaria incidence was observed in a <italic>kebele</italic> with overall higher mean host-seeking density of <italic>Anopheles</italic>.</p><p>The observed malaria incidence in this study was higher (4.6 versus 3.6 episodes per person weeks) than what has been reported from southern Ethiopia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], which could be due to the short (16 versus 101&#x000a0;weeks) follow-up period in the current study.</p><p>In line with previous studies from other parts of the country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], <italic>P. vivax</italic> was the dominant species in the study area, representing about 85&#x000a0;% of the positive cases. The 2011 malaria indicator survey also reported <italic>P. vivax</italic> as the main (60&#x000a0;%) causative agent in the Oromia region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Although all of the study <italic>kebeles</italic> were located below 2000 metres above sea level, which is defined as the threshold for being a malarious area, differences in malaria distribution were observed among the <italic>kebeles</italic> and <italic>gares</italic>. Those <italic>Kebeles</italic> near to the lake or river had more incidences of malaria and a higher mean indoor host-seeking density of <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquito, with similar observations done in other parts of Ethiopia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The persistent presence of infectious <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes and of water bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] could have resulted in high number of malaria cases in the lakeshore and river areas.</p><p>Comparable to other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], children in the age group of under 5s and from 5 to 14-year were more likely to develop malaria than older people. It has been reported that children are more at risk of developing malaria than adults in lowland areas (area &#x0003c;2000&#x000a0;metres above sea level) or malaria-endemic areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. It is a well-known fact that children have a lower immunity to malaria than adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>Families&#x02019; welfare, as measured by the wealth index, was not associated with the probability of malaria episodes in this study. The inclusion of villages close to a health post (within 3&#x000a0;km), as well as weekly home visits to identify residents with clinical symptoms of malaria, could have motivated febrile cases to seek early treatment and reduce the risk of transmission to other family members in both poor and rich families. The ownership of ITNs in this study (27.3&#x000a0;%) was much lower than the WHO recommendations and the national goal (100&#x000a0;% coverage) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], and also lower than what is reported from other parts of the country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p><italic>Anopheles arabiensis</italic> and <italic>An. pharoensis</italic> were the predominant species in Adami Tullu <italic>kebeles.</italic> These findings were consistent with Abose et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], who reported <italic>An.arabiensis</italic> as the primary- and <italic>An. pharoensis</italic> as secondary vectors in the area. The results also showed that the monthly average precipitation peaked in July and sharply declined from August to October, whereas <italic>Anophele</italic>s abundance rose in September and sharply dropped in October. This was expected since <italic>Anopheles</italic> population dynamics and malaria transmissions are driven by seasonal precipitation in Ethiopia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. <italic>Anopheles</italic><italic>arabiensis</italic> proliferates in rain-fed residual pools after months of heavy rain in the country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and the populations expand during this time; however, excessive rainfall may flush out breeding pools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Therefore, the peak <italic>Anopheles</italic> abundance may not coincide with peak precipitation months.</p><p>Results indicate that the overall mosquito density captured by the different mosquito sampling methods was low compared to previous studies in the area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The reason for the low <italic>Anopheles</italic> density could be the rapid scale-up and intensive use of vector intervention measures, particularly ITNs and IRS in the country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and elsewhere in eastern Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Besides, global climatic changes, particularly changes in hydrologic and climatic factors such as precipitation, humidity, temperature and wind [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], may have adversely impacted the <italic>Anopheles</italic> population controlling breeding and survival.</p><p>The other key potential reason for the low mosquito catches could be the lack of efficient mosquito sampling tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Efficient indoor and outdoor collection tools are required, especially for vectors such as <italic>An. arabiensis,</italic> which have behavioural plasticity in host preferences and shifts in peak biting time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]; hence, there is a need to address the inefficient catching techniques. Because adult mosquitoes occur at a certain radius from their breeding sites, a district-wide random sampling of adult mosquitoes without referring to any mosquito breeding sites could also have a potential impact on the occurrence and abundance of mosquitoes, and needs to be revisited.</p><p>The overall HBI (0.69) for <italic>An. arabiensis</italic> was higher than the BBI (0.38) for the same species. This finding contrasts prior studies that found a higher BBI for <italic>An. arabiensis</italic> than the HBI in the country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, the present finding is in line with [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], which found a higher HBI for <italic>An. arabiensis</italic> compared to the BBI in the country. It should be noted that the present study used similar mosquito sampling methods than the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], thus the potential influence of mosquito trapping on HBI is not expected. But the present finding was similar to the other study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], that relied on the CDC light trap alone for mosquito collection, which is evidence that the trapping methods used did not impact the HBI. The HBI for <italic>An. arabiensis</italic> was higher indoors (0.73) than outdoors (0.21), but the BBI was higher when collected outdoors (0.53) than indoors (0.21). These results are generally in agreement with prior studies, which observed the opportunistic feeding behaviour of <italic>An. arabiensis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. <italic>Anopheles pharoensis</italic> showed anthropophilic and endophilic behaviour in the area, but more blood-fed females should be tested to reach such conclusions. Furthermore, the average longevity of <italic>An. arabiensis</italic> ranged from 7 to 25&#x000a0;days in the villages, thereby implying that the vector had a sufficient longevity for malaria transmission during the study period.</p><p>Overall, the relative increase in the abundance of mosquitoes in September and the beginning of October, compared to the other study months, coincides with an increased incidence of malaria episodes in the same and subsequent months. In the entomological study, an overall high mosquito density was observed in Elka Chelemo kebele, although the malaria incidence for the <italic>kebele</italic> was low. This could be due to some of the <italic>gares</italic> being located near the lakeshore in this <italic>kebele,</italic> where a higher mosquito abundance was not followed for malaria episodes. In <italic>kebeles</italic> where the two studies overlapped, high malaria episodes were observed in those with a higher indoor host-seeking density of <italic>Anopheles.</italic></p><p><italic>Anopheles arabiensis</italic> was highly resistant to all the tested pyrethroids, including deltamethrin, but susceptible to bendiocarb and propoxur. The insecticide susceptibility study showed a resistance of <italic>An. arabiensis</italic> to the pyrethroids, which is the current insecticide of choice for the treatment of LLINs. This resistance may compromise the efficacy and effectiveness of ITNs. On the other hand, <italic>An. arabiensis</italic> is currently susceptible to the carbamates, which is useful and will be beneficial for the main trial.</p><p>The use of weekly active case detection, which was supplemented with passive surveillance, would have maximized the number of cases captured by the study. In addition, the active monitoring of the occurrence and the abundance of adult mosquitoes through house-to-house surveys during the major malaria transmission season in the area is also another strength. Weaknesses of the study include a lack of efficient mosquito sampling methods for the local vectors, the overestimation of malaria incidence due to the inclusion of the major malaria transmission season and the self-report of sleeping under ITNs (difficult to observe), which may have affected the reported ITN usage.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This pilot study showed a high variation of malaria incidence and <italic>Anopheles</italic> among <italic>gares</italic>. Younger age groups and households located near lakes and rivers were significantly associated with malaria infection. <italic>Anopheles arabiensis</italic> had a high HBI (high human contact) and a sufficient longevity for malaria transmission. The observed susceptibility of the malaria vectors to propoxur warrants using this insecticide for indoor residual spraying, and results from this study will be used as a baseline for the trial.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>BL, WD, EL, MB, HJO, TG, OK and BR and TGM conceived the study, and were involved in the proposal writing and design of the study.
