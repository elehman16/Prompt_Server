visual biofeedback training for prevention of falling in the elderly. The Tetrax system
was used for visual biofeedback training. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty elderly persons
(experimental group=15, control group=15) who were above 70 and under 80&#x02005;years of age
participated in biofeedback training. They were trained for 15 minutes a day, three times
per week. We measured the weight distribution index, stability index, and fall index in
the subjects using the Tetrax system, and paired t-tests were used to evaluate the changes
before and after intervention. The difference between the groups was compared using an
independent t-test. [Results] The experimental group showed significant differences in
weight distribution index, stability index, and fall index. The control group showed no
significant differences. According to the comparison of training effects between the two
groups, the variables of stability index and fall index revealed a statistically
significant difference. [Conclusion] The method of visual biofeedback training used in
this study should be considered a therapeutic method for the elderly to improve weight
distribution, stability, and effectiveness in preventing falls.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Biofeedback</kwd><kwd>Elderly</kwd><kwd>Fall prevention</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In general, aging is accompanied by stamina reduction and overall physiological
malfunctioning, and as a result, the elderly are destined to suffer from deterioration of
control of eye direction or physical balance due to pose unbalance, increasing the risk of
falling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Falling happens when a part of the human body touches the floor due to loss of balance or
stability without any external shock in daily life<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup> or due to loss of consciousness, and this results in physical
injury, reduction of activity, loss of self-confidence, and lifestyle changes in the victim,
especially in the elderly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Past research has revealed postural control ability
reduction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, postural change
increase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, dynamic balance ability
reduction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, walking speed and reduction
of mobility<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, reduction of strength of
lower extremities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, and ability to stand
up from chairs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup> as reasons why the
elderly fall.</p><p>Elderly individuals who have fallen before have been reported to be reluctant to perform
daily life activities due to the limitations of daily life motions and fear of falling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this case, exercise is absolutely
indispensable, since such unwillingness to move deteriorates muscular strength, balance
ability, and stamina while raising the falling risk, which ultimately results in a vicious
cycle. Elderly individuals with a lack of exercise may develop amyotrophia or low bone
density<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup> and lose their stamina
rapidly, including muscular strength, flexibility, quickness, and balance, causing enormous
trouble in their daily lives<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. On the
other hand, exercise is effective not only for reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases,
diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity but also for increasing bone density and muscle
mass<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, movement control
induces a response to the course of feedback and feedforward. We found that it is necessary
to coordinate the sensory and motor by synthetic interaction of the musculoskeletal system
and nervous system for movement control and also that the sensory input affects balance in
the elderly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. In conclusion, to improve the postural control capability to
prevent falling, an all-purpose exercise program that provides accurate information via
sight, vestibular senses, and somesthesia is desperately needed to seek the most suitable
posture for the nervous system and simultaneously improve exercise response and
musculoskeletal flexibility.</p><p>The aim of this research was to verify that visual biofeedback training is effective for
preventing age-initiated muscular strength deterioration and flexibility loss, because they
can increase the risk of falling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The subjects for this study were elderly individuals above 70 but under 80&#x02005;years of age.
A total of 30 people were selected. The subjects were divided randomly into two groups to
minimize selection bias. The subjects fully understood the objectives of the study and
voluntarily consented to participate. They also met the inclusion criteria: no problems
with their musculoskeletal system, capable of independent walking, and no problems with
vestibular and cognitive ability. The study period was 6 weeks from April 2013 to June
2013. Prior to participation in the study, written informed consent, accepted by the local
ethics committee, was obtained from all subjects. General characteristics of the subjects

of risk of falling or the status of physical balance using a force plate, was used in this
research. It was able to support the weight in each force plate and could be used to
inspect a subject&#x02019;s balance and to execute biofeedback training using a monitor situated
in front of the subject. In this research, the individuals in the experiment group
selected a biofeedback program, Skyball, Gotcha!, Speedball, Tag, Speedtrack Horizontal,
Speedtrack Vertical, Maze, Freeze, Target, or Immobilizer, at his or her discretion and
exercised for 15 minutes, while the individuals in the control group exercised one leg
while standing for 15 minutes and then switched legs. Next, their weight distribution
index, stability index, and fall index were evaluated. The experiment was conducted 3
times a week over a 6-week period. It appeared that the fluctuation of the weight % on the
force plate increased as the weight distribution increased and that the degree of
imbalance increased as the stability index increased. The fall index values were
classified as 0&#x02013;35=low risk, 36&#x02013;57=moderate risk, and 58&#x02013;100=high risk. SPSS version 12.0
was used for statistical analysis. The paired t-test was performed to examine changes
within each group after treatment. The independent t-test was used for inter-group
comparison. The level of statistical significance was &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In regard to the changes observed in the subjects, the experimental group showed

a critical factor involved in the daily lives of the elderly. Judge et al. reported that
functional capabilities like walking, motility, and instrumental daily life motions are
closely related to balance ability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
other words, balance ability and falling are dependent on how the body copes with sudden
imbalance. When the body experiences loss of balance suddenly, the quickness and balance
ability of the upper and lower parts of the body interact, and muscular strength plays a key
role in maintaining balance ability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.
With advancing years, muscular strength is decreased, and falling occurs more frequently. In
addition, the elderly lose muscular tissue, bone mass, and energy and suffer from
deterioration of mobility and abnormal musculoskeletal systems, eventually losing balance
ability. In particular, it has been reported that deterioration of the strength of the lower
extremities quadruples the risk of falling and that a shortage of falling experience,
walking, and balancing ability triples the risk of falling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been reported many times in previous research that muscular
strength and balance are deeply involved in falling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, other studies revealed
that age is inversely proportional to the balance ability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to the research of Choi<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref><sup>)</sup>, Tai Chi exercise contributed to significant improvement in the
prevention of falling for the elderly over the age of 60, and according to the research of
Nelson et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref><sup>)</sup>, Tai Chi exercise at home
for 6 continuous months contributed to improving the balance of the elderly over the age of
70. Also, when we had elderly individuals over the age of 65 perform exercise for 12 weeks
with a seniorobic program, the strength of their lower extremities increased, the interval
between standing up and sitting down was reduced, and flexibility was significantly
improved, supporting the results of the research mentioned above<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. The elements for balance improvement are sight,
vestibular sense, and somesthesia organization for the control of stability, musculoskeletal
system flexibility<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. Visual biofeedback
training is thought to help improve balance by sensory integration because it generates
righting reflex and trunk reactions via visual information, and uses feedback and
feedforward against body movement.</p><p>This research has a limitation in that it only surveyed general citizens without regard to
their individual levels of muscular strength even though balance is closely related with
muscular strength. In future research, it is recommended to verify the visual biofeedback
training effects in elderly individuals who have experience falling.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Gauchard</surname><given-names>GC</given-names></name><name><surname>Gangloff</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Jeanel</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Physical activity improves gaze and posture control in the
