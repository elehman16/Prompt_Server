We hypothesized that addition of clonidine at 3 &#x000b5;g/kg as an adjuvant to bupivacaine for local infiltration analgesia did not improve the quality and duration of postoperative analgesia. The sample size of 50 in each group based on statistical power analysis arrived.</p><p>Patients of age 18&#x02013;60 years and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II posted for elective total abdominal hysterectomy with a Pfannenstiel incision are included in this study. The following patient category is excluded: ASA III and above, emergency surgery, expected duration &#x0003e;2 h, body mass index &#x0003e;35, previous abdominal surgeries, incision other than Pfannenstiel, malignancy, individuals with chronic pain, Reynaud's disease, hepatorenal insufficiency, bronchial asthmatics, or receiving adrenoreceptor agonists, antagonists or narcotics before operation were excluded. Duration &#x0003e;2 h is the expected drop outs.</p><p>All the patients underwent a thorough preoperative assessment on the previous day of surgery, and written informed consent was obtained for participation in the study. Randomization is by computer-generated random numbers and concealed by sealed envelope technique. The patients were randomly allocated into two groups. Group A&#x02013;Patients received 45 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine with 3 &#x000b5;g/kg clonidine for wound infiltration by a three-layer technique. Group B&#x02013;Patients received 45 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine for wound infiltration by the three-layer technique. The person who prepared the study drugs was blinded of the study protocol and is not involved in data collection.</p><p>Anesthesia was induced with propofol 2 mg/kg and fentanyl 2 &#x000b5;g/kg. Tracheal intubation was facilitated by vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg. Anesthesia was maintained by isoflurane 2% and 66% nitrous oxide in oxygen. The patients were monitored using Nihon Kohden Life Scope A, BSM-5100 India Pvt. Limited. Intraoperative monitoring included an electrocardiogram (lead II and V5), noninvasive blood pressure (at 5 min intervals), pulseoximetry, end-tidal carbon dioxide, and nasopharyngeal temperature. The patient lungs were ventilated by intermittent positive pressure ventilation using a circle system to maintain normocapnia. Fluid management is done with maintenance rate of ringer lactate infusion and transfusion as needed appropriately.</p><p>Heart rate and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were maintained within 20% of the preoperative value. Hypotension (MAP 20% of baseline or 60 mmHg) was treated with infusion of normal saline (NS) and if required injection ephedrine 6 mg intravenous (i.v.) boluses. Bradycardia (heart rate &#x0003c;60 beats/min) was treated with atropine 0.5 mg bolus.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Technique of study drug infiltration</title><p>Infiltration is done by the primary surgeon after the removal of the uterus. This surgeon is blinded to the group assignment. After the closure of the peritoneal layer 45 ml of the study drug is infiltrated with a 25-gauge Quincke spinal needle in layers covering the skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscle layers and sprayed over the peritoneal reflection. About 30 ml of the drug is used for the first three layers and 15 ml for the peritoneal reflection.</p><p>All the patients received i.v. infusion of ketorolac 0.5 mg/kg in a 100 ml NS and ondansetron 0.1 mg/kg i.v., half an hour before the completion of surgery. At the end of surgery, residual neuromuscular block was reversed with neostigmine and glycopyrrolate. Tracheal extubation was performed on meeting the standard criteria for extubation. Pain score was recorded immediately after extubation. The patients were shifted to the postanesthesia care unit where they were observed by an anesthesiologist who is blinded for the group assignment for 24 h. Pain score assessed by visual analog scale (VAS) (0 = no pain, and 10 = worst possible pain). Pain score recorded at immediate extubation (taken as 0 h) and after 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h later. Postoperative analgesia was provided with i.v. ketorolac 0.5 mg/kg diluted in 100 ml of NS infused over 10 min every 8<sup>th</sup> hourly.</p><p>Rescue analgesia was given with tramadol 1 mg/kg slow i.v. boluses on demand or whenever VAS pain score was &#x02265;3. Tramadol was not given more than four doses per 24 h and not more than one dose per 6 h. The pain score was assessed 30 min after each rescue analgesic dose, and if pain score is still &#x02265;3, injection fentanyl 1 &#x000b5;g/kg i.v. bolus was given. The total duration of study is 24 h from the time of extubation.</p><p>The primary outcomes measured are duration of effective analgesia (time for the first rescue analgesia); pain score at 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h; percentage of patients that required rescue medication during various time intervals; number of doses of tramadol each patient received over 24 h; and number of doses of additional fentanyl boluses each patient received in the postoperative period over 24 h. Duration of effective analgesia is the time from extubation until the first rescue analgesic is administered by the anesthesiologist or demanded by the patient as per the study protocol. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows the flow diagram of the progress of the clinical study.

Hence, with a 30% expected drop rate, we arrived at 50 numbers in each group for this study. The expected drop outs are need for extension of incision from surgical point of view, duration &#x0003e;2 h, and patient refusal after participation.</p><p>The collected data were analyzed with SPSS Inc., for windows, version 16.0, Chicago, IL, USA.

We have used a multilayer infiltration technique including the preperitoneal instillation, muscle and subcutaneous infiltration in patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy with Pfannenstiel incision. Addition of clonidine has prolonged the duration of effective analgesia before the need for the rescue analgesia improved pain scores and reduced amount of rescue analgesic-tramadol in the first 24 h into the postoperative period.</p><p>Local infiltrative analgesia with local anesthetics is an established method of providing postoperative analgesia. At present, intraarticular local infiltrative analgesia following knee arthroplasty[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] has been gaining importance among anesthesiologist for postoperative analgesia. A recent study has shown that clonidine is an effective adjuvant to bupivacaine in wound infiltration as a part of multimodal analgesia in patients following open cholecystectomy.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The authors believe that open cholecystectomy is equally as invasive as abdominal hysterectomy, and hence the degree of postoperative pain and discomfort. However, the previous study[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] investigating the clonidine as an adjuvant to bupivacaine in wound infiltration and ilioinguinal nerve block in patients with inguinal hernia repair has shown that clonidine did not reduce postoperative analgesic consumption. In this study, they have given both local wound infiltration as well as direct ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve blocks during the surgery. The authors have reasoned that the enhancement of pharmacological action of local anesthetic by clonidine would have been concealed by the prolonged analgesia provided by the block itself. Moreover, the dosage of clonidine and volume of bupivacaine used for wound infiltration is less compared to our study. We used 45 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine and clonidine 3 &#x000b5;g/kg while they have used 29 ml of 0.25% of bupivacaine and 150 mcg of clonidine in their study.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] We have to notice that the amount of bupivacaine used is well within the recommended dosage to avoid toxicity. Thus, clonidine is an effective adjuvant to bupivacaine in local infiltration analgesia for a variety of surgical procedures.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>The precise mechanism of topical clonidine is not yet established. It has been attributed to the fact that sympathetic neural activity and norepinephrine have an excitatory effect on nociceptive discharge after cutaneous injury.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Since clonidine inhibits the norepinephrine release from prejunctional &#x003b1;2-adrenoceptors in the periphery, it may inhibit nociceptive pathway activity.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Other possible mechanisms are enhancement of effect of local anesthetics by selectively blocking the A&#x003b4; and C fibers, and also by release of enkephalin-like substances.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] One study[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] in mice has shown that topical clonidine has antinociception action by blocking the emerging pain signals at peripheral terminals through &#x003b1;2 receptors without producing the undesirable central effects of systemic administration. In our study, we had no incidence of hypotension and bradycardia similar to an earlier study comparing systemic and topical clonidine.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title>The limitations of our study</title><p>We have studied only the first 24 h of the postoperative period. Furthermore, we did not study the effect of this analgesic modality on the wound infection rate, role in early ambulation, and discharge from the hospital. We did not compare varied doses of clonidine as adjuvant to bupivacaine. We took the dosage what the earlier study[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] had used. These are the limitations of our study.</p><p>The clinical importance of our study is that it has proved that clonidine is an effective adjuvant to bupivacaine for local infiltrative analgesia ensuring improved postoperative analgesia which can be recommended for adoption in clinical practice in these groups of surgical population.</p><p>Our study also leads the scope for further research. The role of clonidine for local infiltrative analgesia and its influence on postoperative ambulation and hospital discharge rate are the area of interest and scope for further research.</p><p>To conclude, clonidine is an effective adjuvant to bupivacaine for local infiltrative analgesia in improving the quality and duration of postoperative analgesia in patients who have undergone total abdominal hysterectomy.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of
