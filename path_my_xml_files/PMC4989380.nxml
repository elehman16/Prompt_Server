Smokers frequently experience tobacco-related issues including risky alcohol use, post-cessation weight gain, and depressive symptoms that may adversely impact their likelihood of quitting and maintaining abstinence. Telephone-based interventions that simultaneously address these issues may help to increase treatment access and improve outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study was a two-group randomized controlled pilot trial. Participants were randomly assigned to an individually-tailored telephone tobacco intervention combining counseling for tobacco use and related issues including depressive symptoms, risky alcohol use, and weight concerns or to treatment provided through their state tobacco quitline. Selection of pharmacotherapy was based on medical history and a shared decision interview in both groups. Participants included 63 rural Veteran smokers (mean age&#x02009;=&#x02009;56.8&#x000a0;years; 87&#x000a0;% male; mean number of cigarettes/day&#x02009;=&#x02009;24.7). The primary outcome was self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 12&#x000a0;weeks and 6&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Twelve-week quit rates based on an intention-to-treat analysis did not differ significantly by group (Tailored&#x02009;=&#x02009;39&#x000a0;%; Quitline Referral&#x02009;=&#x02009;25&#x000a0;%; odds ratio [<italic>OR</italic>]; 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval [<italic>CI</italic>]&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.90; 0.56, 5.57).

The reasons for greater tobacco use in rural communities are complex and likely include a combination of personal characteristics (e.g., higher prevalence of low socioeconomic status) and social or community-related factors such as targeted marketing by the tobacco industry, economic dependence on tobacco growing in certain farming communities, greater social acceptance of smoking, and lax policies restricting smoking in private and public locations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Health care-associated factors including limited access to treatment also appear to contribute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Being uninsured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], infrequent visits to and/or lack of a personal physician [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], a lower likelihood of being counseled about tobacco use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and insufficient knowledge about available treatment resources also likely play a role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Considering that approximately 5.3 million Veterans, representing 24&#x000a0;% of all Veterans living in the US, reside in rural areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], this represents a substantial group of individuals who are at increased risk for smoking-related health problems.</p><p>Tobacco quitlines are often advocated as a strategy to improve treatment access. Proactive telephone counseling is efficacious [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Unfortunately, these services are underutilized, with only 1&#x02013;5&#x000a0;% of eligible smokers receiving this form of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Many referred patients cannot be reached or are reluctant to enroll in quitline counseling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], suggesting that additional efforts are needed to connect smokers with treatment resources.</p><p>There are also several health-related factors that may adversely affect cessation outcomes once patients are enrolled in treatment including depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], risky alcohol use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and concerns about weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, standard cessation interventions are typically not designed to treat these concerns, leading for calls to develop strategies that more effectively address these issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Traditionally, depression, alcohol use, and weight management have been addressed independently of tobacco use, often using behavioral health and nutrition specialists. Unfortunately, requiring separate treatment by specialists for each of these conditions may exacerbate problems related to access for rural smokers. Further, such efforts tend to be poorly coordinated, resulting in fragmented care that does not take advantage of the synergies and increased efficiencies provided by addressing these issues in an integrated fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Coordinated treatment models led by a care manager and in which mental health care experts serve as consultants to primary care have been shown to improve outcomes in patients with depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, such approaches have not been adequately evaluated in the context of treatment for tobacco use. Further, evidence suggests that this model may not be as effective in small rural primary care practice settings which do not have on-site mental health care providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Taken together, these findings suggest that comorbid issues related to depressive symptoms, risky alcohol use, and weight concerns are common among smokers and may interfere with quitting, but are not typically addressed in treatment. The goals of this pilot trial were to determine the feasibility and potential efficacy of an individually-tailored cessation intervention for rural Veteran smokers that simultaneously addressed these issues.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was a randomized controlled pilot trial of two treatment approaches (tailored telephone counseling to address cigarette smoking and concomitant depressive symptoms, risky alcohol use, and/or weight concerns [Tailored] vs. referral to the participants&#x02019; state tobacco quitline [Quitline Referral]). The primary outcome was 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 12&#x000a0;weeks and 6&#x000a0;months after participants&#x02019; target quit dates.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants included rural Veteran daily cigarette smokers aged&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;18&#x000a0;years who were interested in quitting and received care at a Midwestern VA Medical Center. Individuals were excluded if they did not have telephone access, were unable to provide informed consent, or did not have a stable residence. Those with a history of dementia or other significant cognitive impairment or a serious mental illness that would interfere with their ability to participate in phone counseling (e.g., catatonic or disorganized schizophrenia) were also excluded based on diagnoses contained in the electronic medical record (EMR). We also excluded patients with markedly elevated depressive symptoms and/or suicidal ideation (see below).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Procedures</title><p>Potentially eligible participants were identified from the EMR based on (a) documented cigarette use or (b) recent (within 2&#x000a0;years) prescription for nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion, or varenicline and (c) an address indicating rural residence, determined using Rural&#x02013;urban Commuting Area codes based on zip code [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Patients meeting basic eligibility criteria were sent a letter offering them participation in the trial, to which they could respond by returning a self-addressed postcard or contacting study staff by phone. Those expressing interest were mailed an informed consent document and baseline questionnaire, which included screening items to assess for eligibility for the supplemental behavioral counseling modules (described below). Upon their return, participants were randomly assigned to treatment conditions based on a computer-generated algorithm on a 1:1 allocation ratio using simple randomization without blocking. The computerized random allocation sequence was generated by the study data manager. Participants were enrolled and informed of their treatment assignment by the Project Coordinator (AJC). The study was approved by the University of Iowa Institutional Review Board. Reporting of the trial conforms to CONSORT 2010 Guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Interventions</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Quitline referral</title><p>Participants assigned to the comparison condition were referred via fax by the Project Coordinator (AJC) to the tobacco quitline for their state of residence. Quitlines subsequently contacted participants to initiate treatment. In order to best approximate standard care, no special arrangements were made with the quitlines to modify their treatment protocol.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Tailored tobacco intervention</title><p>The core component of the Tailored intervention, which was consistent across all participants in this condition, was based on standard cognitive behavioral approaches involving problem solving and coping skills training. The intervention was delivered by phone over six sessions lasting approximately 20&#x02013;30&#x000a0;min each and consisted of four phases: 1) preparing to quit; 2) going through the quitting process; 3) maintaining short-term abstinence; and 4) relapse prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Further details about the smoking cessation intervention are provided in an additional table [Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>]. Calls were conducted approximately 1&#x000a0;week apart, although the timing could be adjusted to accommodate Veterans&#x02019; schedules.</p><p>As noted above, the baseline survey included items to screen for conditions that have been associated with a reduced likelihood of cessation. These included elevated depressive symptoms, risky alcohol use, and concerns about weight gain. Elevated depressive symptoms were determined using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] based on scores of 5&#x02013;19; those who scored&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;20 and/or who endorsed suicidal ideation were referred to their primary care or mental health care provider, as appropriate, and were excluded from the trial. Risky alcohol use was identified based on a score of&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;4 on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Concerns about post-cessation weight gain were determined based on a score of &#x0003e;5 on a 10-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 10 (most ever) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Participants in the Tailored condition could be eligible for anywhere from zero to three of the supplemental treatment modules, but participation in each was voluntary and left up to the individual. Counseling related to each of the supplemental modules was delivered concurrently with the smoking cessation intervention. Each module is briefly described below, with further details provided in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Mood management</title><p>The intervention for elevated depressive symptoms was based on behavioral activation (BA) treatment for depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. BA is a brief, structured approach that focuses on increasing exposure to rewarding activities that are consistent with one&#x02019;s values and life goals. In a prior study, BA was associated with higher quit rates and greater reductions in depressive symptomatology relative to standard cessation treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The BA approach used in the present study was adapted from the work of Lejuez and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Alcohol risk reduction</title><p>The alcohol intervention followed VA/Department of Defense Clinical Practice Guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] for addressing risky alcohol use along with recommendations from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Participants were encouraged to adopt low risk drinking patterns (i.e., &#x02264; 2 drinks/day for men and&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;1 drink/day for women) but were allowed to set their own goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Participants who demonstrated evidence of alcohol abuse or dependence, based on a score of&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;8 on the AUDIT-C, or who scored&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;4 (for men) or&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;3 (for women) on the AUDIT-C and reported a history of prior alcohol treatment, were offered referral to the hospital&#x02019;s substance abuse treatment program but were allowed to continue with the study and intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Weight management</title><p>The weight management intervention was based on a self-regulation approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and focused on accepting and minimizing the weight gain that typically accompanies smoking cessation rather than targeting weight loss. Small, manageable changes in diet and physical activity were encouraged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Prior to initiating physical activity, participants were screened using the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>Interventions were delivered by a Ph.D. level social worker with expertise in substance abuse and a masters level counselor. Interventionists underwent training consisting of seven didactic sessions (lasting 1&#x02013;1.5&#x000a0;h each) with the principal investigator (MWV). These sessions included a study overview, the smoking cessation counseling protocol, pharmacotherapy, medication selection, and each of the supplemental counseling modules. Prior to interacting with participants, interventionists practiced treatment with a standardized patient, who provided feedback on their delivery. In addition, the PI and interventionists met weekly to review participants and discuss treatment strategies using a case management approach. A small number of calls (~5&#x000a0;%) were randomly selected for review by the PI for purposes of assessing fidelity and providing feedback.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Pharmacotherapy</title><p>The approach to pharmacotherapy was the same for both groups. Medication options were based on the Clinical Practice Guideline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and the VA formulary and included several forms of NRT (patch, gum, lozenge), bupropion, and varenicline. Combination therapy was also available as appropriate. An initial review of participants&#x02019; EMRs was conducted by a study nurse to identify potential contraindications related to the medications as well as to review prior history of pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation. Results were summarized in an electronic grid which highlighted precautions and contraindications for each medication, along with other pertinent health information. The study physician (DAK) reviewed the grid and the participant&#x02019;s EMR as needed and identified medications for which the participant was eligible.</p><p>Considering that limited information is available regarding which medication is likely to be most effective for a given patient, study staff then conducted a shared decision interview with participants to arrive at their medication preference. The interviewer engaged the participant in a discussion of prior experiences with smoking cessation medications and solicited ratings regarding the importance of eight separate medication attributes. This information was used to help the participant choose a medication. Those who selected varenicline or bupropion completed a brief screen for hopelessness and suicidal/homicidal ideation. For participants selecting bupropion, additional queries were made to assess for potential contraindications (e.g., history of seizures or head trauma) to supplement information obtained from the EMR. Participants&#x02019; medication choices were communicated electronically to the study physician and a standard 12-week supply of pharmacotherapy was mailed from the pharmacy. As required by VA policy, participants receiving varenicline were screened over the phone for neuropsychiatric side effects every 28&#x000a0;days while on the drug. Participants were allowed to request a change in their medication one time due to perceived lack of efficacy or side effects. Pharmacotherapy was provided free-of-charge.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Measures</title><p>Measurements were obtained at baseline and at 12&#x000a0;weeks and 6&#x000a0;months after participants&#x02019; target quit dates. Follow-up data were collected through phone interview by study staff who were blinded to participants&#x02019; treatment conditions.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Primary outcome</title><p>Cessation was determined based on self-reported 7-day point prevalent abstinence (PPA). To meet criteria for abstinence, participants had to report no tobacco or e-cigarette use during the prior 7&#x000a0;days.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Exploratory outcomes</title><p>The frequency of depressive symptoms over the prior 2&#x000a0;weeks was measured using the PHQ-9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The PHQ-9 has good sensitivity and specificity with regard to identifying those with major depression, and is a reliable and valid measure of severity of depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Alcohol use over the previous week was assessed using the 7-day Alcohol Timeline Follow-back Calendar (TFLC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The TFLC has been found to possess adequate test-retest reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and good validity when compared to collateral report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p>Dietary intake was assessed using the Starting the Conversation (STC) questionnaire, an eight-item dietary assessment tool designed for clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The STC assesses the frequency with which various foods were consumed over the past few months including fruit, vegetables, soda, fast food meals or snacks, and added fats. Despite its brevity, the STC has demonstrated temporal stability, adequate construct validity, and sensitivity to change following dietary intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>Physical activity level was measured using the Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity (RAPA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The RAPA assesses the level and intensity of physical activity as well as strength and flexibility training. The RAPA has demonstrated good criterion validity based on correlations with established activity measures, and discriminates well between those who do versus do not engage in regular activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Quitline counseling</title><p>For participants in the Quitline Referral condition, contact by their state quitline, enrollment in counseling, and the number of calls completed were assessed by self-report.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Descriptive variables</title><p>Additional measures were obtained to characterize the sample. Sociodemographic variables included age, sex, race and ethnicity, education, marital status, employment, and household income. Health-related items included self-reported height, weight, and self-rated health. Participants were also asked about their history of tobacco use, prior quit attempts lasting&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;24&#x000a0;h, and the presence of other smokers in their household. Motivation to quit smoking and to change drinking patterns was assessed using the Contemplation Ladder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Nicotine dependence was measured using the Fagerstr&#x000f6;m Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Sample size</title><p>An initial sample size of 50 participants (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;25 per group) was determined to be adequate to evaluate the feasibility of the tailored tobacco intervention approach. Because enrollment accrued more quickly than anticipated, a total of 63 rural smokers were ultimately enrolled and randomized to treatment conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Baseline group comparisons were conducted using chi-square tests and independent samples t-tests. Twelve-week and six-month quit rates were compared using binary logistic regression. Because of the small sample size and missing data for some variables, multivariable regression analysis was not performed. The primary analysis was based on an intention-to-treat/penalized imputation approach in which participants who were lost to follow-up were assumed to be smoking. Results from complete case analyses are also presented.</p><p>Exploratory analyses examined the impact of the supplemental behavioral interventions on depressive symptoms, weight, alcohol use, and dietary intake using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA).

The proactive recruitment strategy identified a sizeable number of smokers who were interested in receiving cessation treatment that simultaneously addressed health concerns previously associated with reduced quitting success/relapse, suggesting that smokers are generally receptive to receiving assistance with other health behaviors in the context of tobacco treatment. However, while 40&#x000a0;% of Veterans in the intervention group qualified for the alcohol risk reduction intervention, only 1/3 of these agreed to participate in the module. Rural Veteran smokers with risky alcohol use may be less amendable to alcohol reduction strategies than interventions that address mood or concerns about weight gain. Participants also reported a high level of satisfaction with the individually-tailored treatment approach.</p><p>Tailored tobacco counseling and referral to a state tobacco quitline were associated with comparable cessation outcomes at 12&#x000a0;weeks and 6&#x000a0;months. Although the odds of quitting were 90&#x000a0;% higher in the Tailored condition at 12-weeks, this difference was not statistically significant and was not maintained at 6&#x000a0;months. It may be, therefore, that standard tobacco quitline counseling is as effective as a tailored approach, although it should be noted that those assigned to the Quitline Referral condition received more intensive medication management tailored to their history and preferences that differs from what is typically provided through US tobacco quitlines. Self-reported 7-day PPA rates in both groups were encouraging overall and generally comparable to or slightly higher than reported in prior studies involving quitline counseling (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]). These quit rates are particularly promising given the sample&#x02019;s high prevalence of medical and mental health comorbidities, heavy smoking, and socioeconomic disadvantage.</p><p>Exploratory analyses revealed no differences in depressive symptoms, weight, or dietary intake by treatment group. However, these results should be considered preliminary due to the small sample sizes. Conclusions regarding the effectiveness of either intervention approach at managing these issues and improving cessation outcomes will require further study.</p><p>Strengths of the study include the proactive recruitment strategy, focus on an underserved group of smokers (rural Veterans), patient-centered approach that included optional supplemental interventions to aid with smoking cessation and associated concerns, and the novel strategy for selecting pharmacotherapy using shared decision making. The broad eligibility criteria, which allowed the enrollment of patients with medical or mental health conditions who are typically excluded from smoking cessation studies, was another strength.</p><p>Limitations include the modest sample size, which precluded definitive comparisons of tobacco use and other outcomes by group. The reliance on self-reported measures of tobacco use, body weight, and alcohol intake is another limitation. Although self-reported smoking status is generally considered valid in the context of most observational and many types of intervention studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] there is evidence that medical patients, particularly those with smoking-related illnesses, are more likely to misreport abstinence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Considering that quitline users who are lost to follow-up are more likely to be smokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] and that a greater proportion of participants in the Tailored relative to Quitline Referral condition did not provide follow-up data, results of the complete-case analyses may have been biased in favor of the Tailored group. Data pertaining to treatment received from the tobacco quitline for those in the Referral condition was also based on self-report, and may therefore be subject to memory lapse or recall bias. It should also be noted that exploratory analyses were restricted to those who were eligible for and accepted the supplemental interventions in the Tailored condition (and who were therefore motivated to address these issues), but included all participants in the Quitline Referral group who met eligibility criteria. Consequently, these analyses may also have been biased in favor of the Tailored condition.</p><p>In addition, we did not have access to information regarding the receipt of counseling for chronic health conditions and mental health concerns among patients in the Quitline Referral condition. Considering that many tobacco quitlines attempt to at least partially tailor intervention content based on certain smoker characteristics or needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], it is quite possible that some participants assigned to the Quitline Referral condition also received a form of tailored intervention. Unfortunately, we do not have data from the state tobacco quitlines about the intervention content provided to participants. Furthermore, the fact that participants in the Quitline Referral condition were also asked questions about mood, alcohol use, and weight concerns may also have prompted them to think about or otherwise address these issues even if they were not a formal part of their smoking cessation intervention. Measurement reactivity could also have prompted changes on these outcomes in the absence of additional intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Consequently, differences in outcomes between groups that might otherwise have resulted from a tailored intervention approach may have been attenuated.</p><p>Additionally, although we obtained information regarding participants&#x02019; choice of pharmacotherapy and the prescriptions they were given, data pertaining to medication adherence was not collected. Although telephone is generally regarded as a valid and cost-effective mode of data collection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], this approach may have adversely affected data quality, particularly among older and ill participants, due to increased response burden, diminished hearing, difficulty concentrating, and impaired recall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The fact that only 7&#x000a0;% of those sent recruitment letters were ultimately consented for the study also raises questions regarding the viability and potential reach of this approach. However, this enrollment rate compares quite favorably to community- and population-based smoking cessation studies, for which recruitment averages approximately 2&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Finally, as this was a study of rural Veterans who were primarily male and white, non-Hispanic, generalizability to other smokers is uncertain.</p><p>The lack of standardization regarding the receipt of the supplemental treatment modules and provision of pharmacotherapy may also be viewed as a limitation. Decisions regarding whether to receive treatment for depressive symptoms, alcohol use, and weight concerns were based on positive screens and self-selection. The choice of pharmacotherapy was also left up to the participant, although it was restricted to medications for which they were medically eligible as determined by the study physician. While this approach is admittedly inferior to more traditional clinical trials with regard to maximizing internal validity, it more accurately reflects the decisions facing patients and providers in routine practice, and better takes patients&#x02019; preferences into account.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>An individually-tailored tobacco cessation intervention which combined pharmacotherapy, behavioral counseling for smoking cessation, and supplemental treatments for related concerns was feasible and well-received by participants. Self-reported cessation rates were encouraging but did not differ significantly from referral to a tobacco quitline. Further work with larger samples is needed to determine whether shared decision making for medication selection and tailored counseling that addresses multiple risk factors for relapse is associated with better outcomes than standard smoking cessation treatment. Given the lack of differences in cessation outcome at 6&#x000a0;months, it may be that standard quitline counseling is equally effective and more easily disseminated on a large scale.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec28"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12889_2016_3493_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>Intervention components.
