Increased risk of developing T2DM was defined by the Australian T2DM Risk Assessment Tool (AUSDRISK). Fasting serum/plasma total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C, TG, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), glucose and insulin were measured at baseline and after 6 weeks. Effects on acute and chronic postprandial blood lipids, glucose and insulin were measured over 4-h in 39 individuals with T2DM following a mixed meal challenge without and with added 2&#x02009;g/d PS at week 6.

Managing CVD risk factors such as dyslipidemia is critically important as CVD is the major cause of death in T2DM patients. Many individuals at risk of developing or with T2DM have dyslipidemia characterized by lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities such as elevated fasting and non-fasting triglycerides (TG) and TG-rich lipoproteins, e.g., chylomicrons and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and often also elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations, in the form of increased small dense LDL particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The underlying abnormalities in postprandial and fasting lipid and lipoprotein metabolism contributing to diabetic dyslipidemia are beginning to be understood such as reduced hepatic uptake of chylomicrons and their remnants and impaired VLDL secretion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Furthermore, insulin resistance in adipose tissue contributes to diabetic dyslipidemia by failure to suppress lipolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Lowering LDL-C below 2.6&#x02009;mmol/l is the primary target of blood lipid lowering therapy in T2DM. For that reason, individuals with established T2DM are advised to use statin therapy to control elevated LDL-C and reduce cardiovascular risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. An additional lowering of elevated TG concentrations can further contribute to reducing residual CVD risk. A healthy diet pattern can also help to improve diabetic dyslipidemia and control elevated total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C and, TG concentrations as is emphasized in clinical guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">Amongst dietary strategies to control blood lipids, plant sterols (PS) or stanols have been shown to lower LDL-C concentrations by comparable magnitudes in individuals with T2DM as in hypercholesterolemic, but otherwise healthy people<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. A meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled studies with patients diagnosed with T2DM concluded that PS or stanols at intakes of 1.6&#x02013;3.0&#x02009;g/d significantly lowered TC and LDL-C concentrations by 0.26 and 0.31&#x02009;mmol/L, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. While the LDL-C lowering effect of PS and stanols in individuals with T2DM has been established, evidence for an additional TG lowering effect is still scarce. Available evidence is based on studies that primarily investigated the LDL-C lowering effect of PS or stanols, while a TG effect was always a secondary study outcome and therefore may be underpowered to detect a significant lowering of TG concentrations. Previous meta-analysis pooling data from 12 studies found a significant 6% TG lowering effect with a PS intake ranging between 1.6 and 2.5&#x02009;g/d; this effect was more pronounced in individuals with higher baseline TG concentrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Similarly, a TG lowering effect of plant stanols, with the largest reductions seen in individuals with higher baseline TG concentrations, was also reported in the meta-analysis of Nauman et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, a TG lowering benefit of PS or stanols has so far not been explicitly studied in individuals at risk or with established T2DM. The meta-analysis of Baker et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> found no apparent effect of PS on TG concentrations among patients with T2DM, which is possibly related to the small number of participants in the limited number of studies. Furthermore, many previous studies excluded individuals with high basal TG and therefore a TG-lowering benefit of PS and stanols may have been overlooked.</p><p id="Par8">Summarizing the available study evidence, Plat et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> concluded that in T2DM patients with relatively low TG levels, TG were lowered by 0.06&#x02009;mmol/l or 3.7% with an average PS/stanol intake of 1.85&#x02009;g/d. Studies enrolling individuals with the metabolic syndrome who had basal TG concentrations exceeding 1.7&#x02009;mmol/l found however a TG lowering effect of 0.66&#x02009;mmol/l or 13.9% with an average intake of 3.2&#x02009;g/d of PS/stanols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par9">As individuals with T2DM or at risk of developing T2DM are at increased risk for CVD and often have elevated TG and LDL-C, PS could lead to a potential dual blood lipid benefit in lowering both LDL-C and TG in these populations. So far, studies explicitly investigating such a dual lipid lowering effect of PS have not been performed in these populations.</p><p id="Par10">Moreover, the capacity of PS/stanols to attenuate the known atherogenicity of postprandial lipids and glucose increases remains unclear. It has recently been voiced that there is a need for studies exploring the effects of acute and chronic PS or stanol intake in affecting postprandial response in populations at risk of developing T2DM or with established T2DM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Two recent studies that measured postprandial TG concentrations after a meal challenge including added PS or stanols showed no effect on postprandial TG concentrations during 4 to 8&#x02009;h in healthy individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. A limitation of these studies is that study participants were not pre-selected based on their baseline TG concentrations, which were consequently in a healthy range of 1.1 to 1.3&#x02009;mmol/l.</p><p id="Par11">The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of PS intake on fasting and acute as well as chronic postprandial blood lipids (TG, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C) in individuals at risk and with established T2DM. To our knowledge this is the first study to investigate a dual blood lipid lowering benefit, i.e., lowering of fasting LDL-C and TG of PS in this study population. Also, the effects on fasting and postprandial blood glucose and insulin were explored.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p id="Par12">This study took place from November 2014 to September 2016 at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Food and Nutrition group, in Adelaide and Sydney, Australia.

The intervention period lasted 6 weeks and was preceded by a run-in period of 2 weeks during which all study participants consumed the placebo spread allowing to get familiarized with consuming the study products and for blood lipid concentrations to stabilize. At the end of the run-in (i.e., baseline) and intervention phases, fasted blood samples were drawn on two consecutive days for measuring serum lipid, insulin, and plasma glucose concentrations. On all test days, participants came to the study center in a fasted state (12&#x02009;h of neither food nor drinks except water) and received breakfast after all measurements were performed.</p><p id="Par14">At the end of the intervention after 6 weeks, postprandial blood lipids, glucose and insulin were measured over 4&#x02009;h after a mixed meal in a randomly selected sub-group of study participants all with established T2DM.

The nutrient composition of the test meal was as follows: 4232&#x02009;kJ (1001&#x02009;kcal) energy, 50% from fat, 43% from carbohydrate, and 7% from protein. The total fat content was 58&#x02009;g of which 19&#x02009;g were saturated fatty acids (SAFA), 12&#x02009;g polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), 25&#x02009;g monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA). The test meal was prepared by the research dietitian on the morning of the test day. For the subgroups who underwent the mixed meal challenge, 50% of those who received the PS-added spread during the 6 weeks of intervention, were challenged with the PS-added spread and the other 50% were challenged with the placebo spread. For those who received the placebo spread during the 6-week intervention, 50% were challenged with the PS-added spread and the other 50% with the placebo spread.

Plasma Lp(a) concentrations were measured using a commercial kit (Randox Pty Ltd, Parramatta, NSW, Australia) on a Beckman AU480 auto-analyzer (Beckman, Fullerton, CA, USA). Serum insulin was measured using a commercial ELISA kit (Mercodia AB, Uppsala, Sweden). All blood measurements were carried out at CSIRO. Non-HDL-C (TC minus HDL-C) and remnant C defined as TC minus (HDL-C and LDL-C) were calculated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical analysis and sample size calculation</title><p id="Par25">Originally it was planned to recruit a total of 214 study participants. This study size calculation was based on the primary objective of the study, i.e., an effect of PS on blood TG concentrations. In total 194 subjects were needed (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;97 per study arm), based on two TG measurements at baseline and after 6-week intervention, using a 2-sided alpha of 0.10, a power of 0.8 and an effect size equivalent to a 10% reduction in TG in the PS-added spread intervention group. The 10% reduction in TG was based on a baseline TG concentration of 2.3&#x02009;mmol/l in individuals with T2DM as obtained from the literature. Considering a dropout rate of 10%, in total 214 subjects were required, 107 subjects per treatment group. The original study sample size could not be met due to limitations finding eligible study participants, esp. individuals with established T2DM even after intensified recruitment strategies. Hence, it was decided to reduce the number of study participants to 150 (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;75 per study arm) to ensure the study was completed. It was re-calculated that a total of 150 completers based on two TG measurements at baseline and after 6-week intervention, using a 2-sided alpha of 0.10, would still provide a power of 0.8 and an effect size equivalent to detect a 11.5% reduction in TG concentration in the PS-added spread intervention group. The increase in lowering TG to 11.5% (instead of the original 10%) was justified based on recent findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and the fact that screening TG concentrations of participants already enrolled in the study (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;126) at the time of revising the sample size was above 2.4&#x02009;mmol/l.</p><p id="Par26">The postprandial blood lipid and glucose/insulin response, was originally planned to be executed in a randomly selected subgroup of 46 individuals. Ultimately, 39 study participants, all with established T2DM, underwent the mixed meal challenge.</p><p id="Par27">All statistical analyses were performed by Unilever R&#x00026;D with the statistical software package SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat (ITT) and the per-protocol (PP) principle, i.e., excluding data from study participants who had been noncompliant with the protocol (i.e., low test product compliance, not being weight stable, or use of prohibited drugs). Here, the results based on the PP analysis are reported. Non-compliance was defined as having consumed less than 90% of total margarine intake, having gained or lost more than 5% of body weight, or not having been compliant with the diet and medication restrictions as judged by the study team during the blind review.</p><p id="Par28">For TG, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, non-HDL, remnant C, Lp(a), glucose and insulin, changes from baseline after intervention with PS were compared to placebo and analyzed using an ANCOVA model. The predefined, basic ANCOVA model used log (change from baseline) as response variable and contained log (baseline value) and treatment as predictors. Additional a priori predictors were added to this basic model, amongst others age, gender, site identifier (Adelaide or Sydney), risk-group (established T2DM or at risk of T2DM), and risk-group*treatment interaction. Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) as a goodness-of-fit criterion was used to assess the contribution of these additional predictors in the model by exploring all possible combinations; more than 1000 models were generated by this approach. The results of the model with the smallest BIC, i.e., the &#x0201c;best&#x0201d; model was selected and is reported. Working on a log scale for the response allowed to represent the resulting treatment effect (LS-means) as a percentage change relative to the placebo treatment and an associated 95% confidence interval (CI).</p><p id="Par29">The differences in shape between the postprandial curves for blood lipids, glucose and insulin response were explored using a repeated measures ANOVA model. The ANOVA model contained as predictors (all class variables): time, the 6-week intervention product (PS-added or placebo spread), type of meal challenge (PS-added or placebo spread), time*intervention product-interaction and the time*type of meal challenge-interaction. Other a priori predictors included in the model were e.g., gender and age; different covariance structures were also evaluated. A significant contribution of time*intervention product-interaction and/or time*type of meal challenge-interaction indicates a different shape of the response curve created by intervention product and/or type of meal challenge. A significant contribution of 6-week intervention product, type of meal challenge or any other predictor indicates a vertical shift of the curves while the shape remains the same. The contribution of the predictors in combination with covariance structure was assessed based on BIC and the results of the &#x0201c;best&#x0201d; model (smallest BIC) is reported. In addition, for post prandial curves of glucose the positive incremental area under the curve (piAUC) and for insulin the total area under the curve (tAUC) were calculated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Participant characteristics and dietary compliance</title><p id="Par30">In total, 1232 individuals completed the pre-screening questionnaire.

Notably, in these studies, individuals were not selected based on having elevated TG concentrations, which may explain the much lower TG lowering effect found in these diabetic study populations as compared to our finding. In contrast, based on four studies with a total of 185 individuals with the Metabolic Syndrome who consumed an average intake of 3.24&#x02009;g/d of PS or plant stanols, TG were lowered by &#x02212;0.66&#x02009;mmol/l or 13.9%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Basal TG concentrations exceeded 1.7&#x02009;mmol/l in this Metabolic Syndrome study population which is comparable to the population investigated in this study. In the present study, no differences in blood TG responses between individuals with established T2DM compared to those at risk of developing T2DM were found. This further supports that elevated baseline TG concentrations (2.48&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.13&#x02009;mmol/l for those at risk of T2DM and 2.41&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.88&#x02009;mmol/l for those with established T2DM) are responsible for the observed lowering of TG concentrations rather than the health or diabetic status of individuals as such.</p><p id="Par42">Consistent with findings from various meta-analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, this study again demonstrates that an intake of 2&#x02009;g/d of PS lowers TC and especially LDL-C and non-HDL-C concentrations. The magnitude of change in LDL-C, i.e. the 4.6% lowering seems to be on the lower end of what one would have expected for a daily PS intake of 2&#x02009;g. Nevertheless, the 95% CI (&#x02212;8.0 to &#x02212;1.2%) partly overlaps with those reported in the meta-analysis by Ras et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Based on studies performed in T2DM patients, Plat et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> concluded that a large inter-individual variability in the extent of LDL-C lowering exists. At an average intake of 1.85&#x02009;g/d of PS and plant stanols, the average LDL-C reduction in T2DM patients was 0.23&#x02009;mmol/l or &#x02212;6.3%. This finding is consistent with the average LDL-C effect of 0.18&#x02009;mmol/l or &#x02212;4.6% observed in our overall study population.</p><p id="Par43">Patients with T2DM and those with the Metabolic Syndrome, who are at increased risk of developing T2DM, are known of having a high cholesterol synthesis efficiency coupled with a low intestinal cholesterol absorption efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. A reason for this variation in cholesterol metabolism is related to altered insulin resistance suggesting that better insulin sensitivity is linked to a higher cholesterol absorption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Furthermore, it was also shown that body weight regulated cholesterol metabolism in T2DM patients and that with increasing body weight and BMI, cholesterol absorption was low and cholesterol synthesis high<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Whether indeed individual variation in cholesterol absorption/synthesis efficiency due to the degree of obesity and insulin resistance explains the variability in the LDL-C lowering response and the overall lower effect remains speculative. Nevertheless, a potential association with blood glucose concentrations and/or insulin resistance on the responsiveness to cholesterol-lowering interventions that affect intestinal cholesterol absorption such as PS and stanols has been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. For instance, de Smet et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> found that healthy individuals who had a more pronounced basal postprandial glucose response experienced a smaller LDL-C lowering after 3 weeks of plant stanol intake.</p><p id="Par44">In the present study, there was however no evidence that the treatment effect could be differentiated by gender, BMI and by diabetes status; in other words, those at risk of developing T2DM showed the same benefits as those with established T2DM. No effects of PS intervention were found for Lp(a) concentrations. This is not unexpected since so far, no dietary interventions have shown a meaningful effect on lowering Lp(a) including at least three studies that showed PS or plant stanol interventions have no effect on Lp(a)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. PS intervention had further no effect on fasting blood glucose and insulin concentrations, which is in line with previous evidence in T2DM patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par45">Regarding the postprandial responses, no differential effects were found for postprandial TG, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, and remnant C and the postprandial response of glucose and insulin. However, a substantial variability between individuals was seen with both the acute and chronic meal challenge which could possibly be as the limited number of participants a reason for not seeing statistically different effects in postprandial responses. The finding that individuals, who chronically consumed the PS added spread for six weeks, had higher absolute concentrations in their postprandial TG responses, suggests that liver driven mechanisms may have contributed to these subtle differences. There is increasing evidence suggesting that particularly elevated postprandial TG may be an early feature of dysregulation in glycemic control and may even be predictive of the development of T2DM as well as atherosclerosis over time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, two recent studies measuring postprandial responses after a meal challenge containing 3&#x02009;g plant stanols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> or 4&#x02009;g PS or stanols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> also did not find any effects on postprandial TG concentrations during 4 to 8&#x02009;h in healthy individuals. In these studies, baseline TG concentrations of study participants were in a healthy range (1.1&#x02013;1.3&#x02009;mol/L)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>) as compared with elevated basal TG concentrations of 2.5&#x02009;mmol/l of study participants in this study. Other studies relying on different postprandial study designs also did not find an effect of plant stanols on postprandial cholesterol and TG concentrations after a high- or low-fat breakfast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Whether adding just 2&#x02009;g PS to the challenge meal instead of higher amounts as used in the previous studies and using a 4.2 MJ test meal as compared to 3.2&#x02013;3.3 MJ used in other studies may have impacted the outcome of the postprandial response remains conjectural.</p><p id="Par46">While the (LDL-) cholesterol lowering effect of PS or stanols is known to result from the inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, the underlying mechanism by which they lower TG concentrations is still not well understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Considering the lack of effect on postprandial lipids, especially TG, raises the question about the mechanism(s) that causes the observed lowering of fasting TG concentrations after PS intake. Based on mostly animal study evidence, it is suggested that PS or stanols may lower circulating TG concentrations via multiple mechanisms, including intestinal derived, i.e. absorption site effects like reduced intestinal TG and fatty acid (FA) absorption and increased fecal FA excretion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. There is further evidence that PS and stanols affect hepatic FA and TG metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. However, human studies investigating postprandial fat handling in normo-triglyceridemic individuals have not found that PS or stanols interfere with intestinal fat digestion and absorption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. This may explain the lack of an effect of PS on postprandial TG as well as on postprandial cholesterol carried in different lipoproteins. It was hypothesized that the fasting TG lowering mechanism of PS is of hepatic origin based on a reduction in hepatic very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion reported in mice fed a PS or stanol enriched diet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> and a reduction in circulating (large and medium size) VLDL particles after consuming 2&#x02009;g/d of plant stanols in dyslipidemic individuals with the Metabolic Syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. However, the concept that PS may reduce hepatic TG secretion can be challenged as Nakajima et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> demonstrated that hepatically derived TG-rich lipoproteins, i.e. VLDL and VLDL remnants account for about 80% of the increase in postprandial TG.</p><p id="Par47">A limitation of this study is that the postprandial responses were only studied in a subgroup and only for 4&#x02009;h after consuming the challenge meal. Clearly, postprandial TG did not return to baseline after 4&#x02009;h and therefore a longer time, e.g., 6&#x02009;h would have been more desirable, revealing the effect of PS on TG catabolism in the late postprandial stage. Another limitation is that we did not measure serum apolipoprotein (apo) concentrations either in the fasted or postprandial state. Such data could have given some more insights into possible underlying mechanisms, especially related to apo B carrying lipoprotein particles. A strength of this randomized controlled study is that we included a large number of individuals who were followed up under well-controlled, double-blind conditions making this the first PS intervention study that enrolled individuals at risk of and with established T2DM, and who also had both elevated baseline LDL-C and TG concentrations.</p><p id="Par48">The rise in the global prevalence of T2DM is metabolically associated with dyslipidemia and an increased risk of CVD. Therefore, the dual lipid lowering effect of PS could be of great benefit for individuals with or at risk of T2DM. LDL-C is already recognized as a causal risk factor for arteriosclerotic CVD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> and a reduction in LDL-C concentration as achievable with PS intake would be expected to contribute to reducing the risk of CVD. Moreover, evidence has emerged that elevated TG concentrations are also an independent risk factor for CVD with a modest association between elevated fasting TG concentrations and increased CVD risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. A meta-analysis of prospective studies concluded that per 1.0&#x02009;mmol/l increase in fasting TG, the risk of major cardiovascular events increases by 27%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Human genetic studies further support a causal relationship between TG and CVD risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par49">In conclusion, this study demonstrates that 2&#x02009;g/d of PS can lead to a dual benefit of lowering TG and LDL-C concentrations in individuals at risk of and with established T2DM as well as elevated TG and LDL-C concentrations, and even when taking statins. No effects were found on HDL-C, non-HDL-C, remnant C, fasting glucose and insulin, and on postprandial blood lipids and glycemic response after acute and chronic PS intake. The TG next to the LDL-C lowering benefit of PS can be considered of clinical relevance and may help to further reduce the risk of CVD as part of a healthy diet and lifestyle approach.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's note:</bold> Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors wish to thank the study participants for their willingness to take part in the study.
