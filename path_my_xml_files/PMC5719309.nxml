Treatment of neonatal hypoglycaemia with oral dextrose gel has been shown to reverse hypoglycaemia and reduce admissions to neonatal intensive care for hypoglycaemia. An evidence-based clinical practice guideline was written to guide the use of dextrose gel to treat neonatal hypoglycaemia in New Zealand. However, it is unclear what clinical discipline might most effectively lead the implementation of the guideline recommendations.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>To determine if midwife or doctor local opinion leaders are more effective in implementing a clinical practice guideline for use of oral dextrose gel to treat hypoglycaemia in babies on postnatal wards.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>A cluster-randomised, blinded, controlled trial. New Zealand maternity hospitals that care for babies born at risk of neonatal hypoglycaemia will be randomised to having either a local midwife or doctor lead the guideline implementation at that hospital. The primary outcome will be the change in the proportion of hypoglycaemic babies treated with dextrose gel from before implementation of the guideline to 3&#x02009;months after implementation.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Approved by Health and Disability Ethics Committee: 15/NTA/31.

These are the majority of babies who experience neonatal hypoglycaemia, and they may potentially avoid NICU admission if this new treatment were widely adopted, with substantial benefits in terms of family separation, costs of care and breastfeeding rates. A New Zealand evidence-based clinical practice guideline has been written as a first step in implementing this new treatment approach, as a change in midwifery and neonatal practice is unlikely to occur rapidly without an active implementation strategy.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
</p><p>There is often a large gap between research knowledge and clinical practice. Knowledge synthesis and guideline development have been shown to be effective at translating research findings into clinical practice but are often not sufficient in themselves to lead to a change in practice. Prospective identification of barriers to change is crucial to achieve better adoption of intervention and improve implementation.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> Multi-faceted interventions including audit with feedback are helpful, but local opinion leaders have been shown to be the most effective method of implementing obstetric guidelines.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Most evidence on implementation has come from studies of implementation of guidelines for treatment of adults. However, previous cluster-randomised trials of implementation of treatments for extremely preterm babies in NICU have shown that multi-faceted active implementation strategies improve care of preterm babies.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref>
</p><p>There are few data on the most effective strategy to implement new treatments for otherwise well babies on the postnatal wards, who are usually under midwifery care. New Zealand has a unique healthcare system where lead maternity carers (LMCs), the majority of whom are midwives, provide most primary neonatal care. LMCs are responsible for ensuring that&#x000a0;neonates in their care who are at risk are screened for neonatal hypoglycaemia. In New Zealand, midwives have prescribing rights and have experience in implementing strategies to improve breast&#x000a0;feeding.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
</p><p>Dextrose gel, a new treatment not currently in routine use, offers a unique opportunity to investigate effective implementation strategies for management of babies on postnatal wards, a group of babies usually under the care of midwives. Although local opinion leaders have been shown to be important in the implementation of guidelines,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> it is not known from which discipline the opinion leader should be drawn in the implementation of cross-disciplinary guidelines. Typically, in New&#x000a0;Zealand, doctors would be approached to implement a guideline for a neonatal treatment. However, doctors usually only become involved in hypoglycaemic babies&#x02019; care once they receive a referral from a midwife/LMC because of a low blood glucose concentration. It is unclear if midwives or doctors are best placed to lead a practice change involving babies on the postnatal wards. We propose a randomised controlled trial to determine if midwives or doctors are more effective local opinion leaders for implementing a clinical practice guideline for oral dextrose gel to treat neonatal hypoglycaemia.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Hypothesis</title><p>Midwives are the most effective opinion leaders for implementing a guideline for use of oral dextrose gel to treat neonatal hypoglycaemia in babies on postnatal wards.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Aim</title><p>To determine if midwives or doctors are the most effective local opinion leaders for implementation of a national guideline for use of oral dextrose gel for the treatment of neonatal hypoglycaemia.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>Multi-centre, cluster, blinded, randomised controlled trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>Maternity hospitals in New Zealand where babies at risk of neonatal hypoglycaemia (infant of a diabetic, late preterm, small or large for gestational age) are born, including hospitals where oral dextrose gel is currently in use, will be eligible to take part in the study.

In the past, a doctor opinion leader would implement new clinical practice guidelines in their hospitals. Having a local leader to implement guidelines can lead to better uptake due to close interpersonal relations and in-person communication with the local staff, which accelerates behaviour change and knowledge uptake.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> Although identifying local opinion leaders might be difficult because they often change over time in some areas,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> this is unlikely to happen in this study as the number of specialists who work in the field of neonatal medicine in New Zealand is small.</p><p>In many countries, including New Zealand, midwives are central to the care of healthy mothers and newborn babies, while doctors care for mother and babies who are unwell. Midwives are frequently involved with the implementation of guidelines for the mothers and babies they care for.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 18 19</xref> Midwives, nurses and doctors have a&#x000a0;different approach to communication and knowledge exchange.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> For example, nurses are more likely to prefer in-person communication with colleagues and patients to share and receive knowledge rather than electronic resources than are doctors.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22</xref> Further, nurses&#x02019; information-seeking behaviours are more concentrated on policy and procedures, while doctors concentrate more on information related to diagnosis.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Therefore, having midwives or doctors as local opinion leaders of guideline implementation may lead to different outcomes as the knowledge provided by the research team is received and shared in a different manner.</p><p>Babies at risk of neonatal hypoglycaemia are often cared for by midwives on the postnatal wards with input from doctors as required. Therefore, it is unclear if midwives or doctors would be most effective at implementing a clinical practice guideline on oral dextrose gel for neonatal hypoglycaemia, a treatment that midwives can prescribe and administer under appropriate guidelines.</p><p>This study will determine if midwife or doctor opinion leaders provide the most effective pathway for implementation of guidelines to change clinical practice for babies on the postnatal wards.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e162" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-017516.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e163" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-017516.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Sonja Woodall and Nataliia Burakevych for valuable contributions to the study design and manuscript.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> JMA conceived and developed the study design, drafted the article and approved the final version of the study protocol.
