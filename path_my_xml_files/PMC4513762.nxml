However, in doing so a lot of material is getting wasted. There is no evidence of any study which compares the marginal adaptation of Biodentine by hand manipulation.

The teeth were cleaned using ultrasonics. Access cavities were made using endo access bur and working length was measured. Cleaning and shaping were done using ISO standardized 2% K file till 50 number apically and thereafter till 80 number coronally. Between each sequential filing RC Help was used as a lubricant. The irrigant solution was 20 ml of 0.5% NaOCl for each tooth. After cleaning and shaping, paper points was used to dry the root canals and then obturated with gutta-percha by lateral compaction technique. The quality of obturation was assessed by radiographs and access cavities were sealed with composite resin restorative material after 24 h. An apical resection at 90&#x000b0; to the long axis of the tooth was made at 3 mm from the end of the root. Root-end cavities of 3 mm were prepared with a straight fissure diamond bur. Then the root end restoration was done with Biodentine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) by manipulating with trituration method in Group I and by hand manipulation in Group II. Then tooth surface were coated with nail varnish except at the apex and were allowed to dry. The specimens were then immersed in 2% methylene blue for 24 h. Following this the teeth were rinsed for 15 min under distilled water. Sectioning was done in mesiodistal direction and samples were observed under stereo microscope at high magnification and microleakage was evaluated in millimeters.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Tooth sample.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JIOH-7-111-g001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Biodentine material.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JIOH-7-111-g002"/></fig><p>The scores are given according to the dye penetration as follows:</p><p>

The root-end filling material serves as a barrier for the possible irritants against reentering into the periapical region. Gartner and Dorn<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> suggested that an ideal root-end filling material should provide a three-dimensional seal to prevent leakage of microbial irritants into the periapical tissues. In addition, the material should be compatible with apical tissues, provide long-term stability and good handling properties. There are various substances which were previously tried as root-end filling materials. The selection of material depends on the physical and biological properties such as sealing ability, biocompatibility, and handling characteristics.</p><p>MTA is used as root-end filling material since inception and showed better sealing properties than amalgam, super ethoxybenzoic acid and vitremer irrespective of the type of root-end cavity preparation.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Although MTA is showing good results as retrograde filling material, but it has certain limitations also such as long setting time and high cost.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The basic constituents of Biodentine is same as compare to MTA. The manufacturers claim that it's modified xpowder composition i.e., the addition of setting accelerators and softeners, a new pre dosed capsule formulation for use in a mixing device largely improve the physical properties of the material making it more user-friendly.</p><p>As there is no literature available comparing the manipulation techniques for Biodentine as a root-end filling material, so we compared the sealing ability with different manipulation techniques. The results of this study showed that both (trituration and hand manipulation) techniques exhibited microleakage, but the extent of microleakage was significantly less in Biodentine manipulated mechanically when compared to hand manipulation. This can be attributed to the fact that mechanical trituration produces a more homogenous mix as compare to manual mixing. Furthermore, the water powder ratio will be altered in manual mixing resulting in non-homogenous mix.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Within the limits of this study, the following conclusions were drawn: More microleakage was seen when Biodentine was manually manipulated as compared to machine trituration. Further, studies should be conducted in order to suggest a proper powder to liquid ratio for proper hand manipulation of the material as in trituration lot of material is wasted.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold><italic>Conflict of Interest: None</italic></bold></p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold><italic>Source of Support:
