A total of 240 participants will be randomly divided into four groups. The control group will receive standard antiemetic only, whereas three acupuncture groups will receive four electro-acupuncture treatments once a day with the standard antiemetic. Acupuncture group I and II will receive distal-proximal point association (&#x0201c;Neiguan (PC6) and Zhongwan (CV12)&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;Zusanli (ST36) and CV12&#x0201d;, respectively); Acupuncture group III will receive local distribution point association (&#x0201c;Shangwan (CV13) and CV12&#x0201d;). The primary outcome measures are the frequency and distress of nausea and vomiting. The secondary outcome measures are the grade of constipation and diarrhea, electrogastrogram, quality of life, etc. Assessment is scheduled from the day before chemotherapy to the fifth day of chemotherapy. Follow-ups are performed from the sixth day to the twenty-first day of chemotherapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Results of this trial will help in evaluating the efficacy and safety of electro-acupuncture with different acupoint combinations in the management of CINV.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT02478047">NCT02478047</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Acupuncture</kwd><kwd>Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting</kwd><kwd>Acupoint combination</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Basic Research Program of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>2014CB543201</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guo</surname><given-names>Yi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81330088</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guo</surname><given-names>Yi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) are common side-effects of many antineoplastic regimens and can occur for several days after treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. CINV significantly impacts the patient&#x02019; quality of life and nutritional status, and may lead to dose reduction or treatment discontinuation, subsequently increasing the risk of disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Although effective guidelines for CINV prevention exist for both moderately and highly emetogenic chemotherapies, adherence to these guidelines is not widely practiced because of their expensive costs and side-effects, such as headaches, dizziness, constipation, and insomnia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Acupuncture treatment is one of the most sought-after therapeutic modalities in complementary and alternative medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It is a safe medical procedure with minimal side effects. Evidence for the therapeutic effects of acupuncture on CINV exists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Electroacupuncture for CINV management has been recommended by the American Society of Clinical Oncology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Based on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the combination of acupoints can strengthen the essential and comprehensive therapeutic effects of acupuncture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, no consensus currently exists on the optimal acupoint combination for controlling CINV. For example, Gottschling S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] found that stimulating PC6 (Neiguan), CV12 (Zhongwan), ST36 (Zusanli) and LI4 (Hegu) may effectively prevent CINV; Shen J [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] concluded that electro-acupuncture on PC6 (Neiguan) and ST36 (Zusanli) is more effective in controlling emesis than antiemetic pharmacotherapy alone. Therefore, we propose a randomized, controlled trial to determine the optimal combination of acupoints for CINV management.</p><p>In this trial, we aim to determine whether different acupoint combinations similarly manage CINV. We also aim to determine whether distal-proximal point association or local distribution point association more efficiently manages CINV.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives</title><p>This study aims to: (1) assess the clinical efficacy and safety of distal-proximal point association and local distribution point association by electro-acupuncture for CINV management; (2) assess the patients&#x02019; quality of life, anxiety, and depression, as well as other side effects of chemotherapy, such as diarrhea and constipation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Hypothesis</title><p>According to the theory of TCM, the combination of acupoints can achieve a synergistic effect. In addition, distal-proximal point association and local distribution point association are the classic methods for combinating acupoints. We hypothesize that distal-proximal point association will achieve better therapeutic effect by reducing toxicity and enhance efficacy in CINV management.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Design</title><p>This is a four-armed parallel randomized controlled trial (RCT). 240 participants will be randomly assigned to four groups (a control group and three acupuncture groups) through central randomization in a 1:1:1:1 ratio.

Previous reviews showed that acupoint stimulation has a certain effect on CINV. However, the effects of different acupoint combinations are inconsistent. We designed our trial to compare the effects of distal-proximal point association and local distribution point association.</p><p>More than 300 acupuncture points are located on the body and each point has its own therapeutic indication. The correct selection and combination of acupoints are the keys to the curative effects of acupuncture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Before developing the trial protocol, we screened a range of published articles and ancient books. Our literature search showed that PC6, ST36, and CV12 are the most commonly used acupoints for managing CINV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. We selected PC6 and ST36 as the distal acupoints, and CV12 as the local acupoint. Based on the theory of Chinese acupuncture, distal-proximal acupoint association and local distribution point association are the two classic methods for combining acupoints. Distal-proximal acupoint association is also the most commonly used method in clinical applications. In this trial, there are three different acupuncture groups: &#x0201c;PC6 and CV12&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;ST36 and CV12&#x0201d; are the two disal-proximal acupoint association groups, and &#x0201c;CV12 and CV13&#x0201d; is the local distribution point association group. Therefore, we expect that distal-proximal point association (&#x0201c;PC6 and CV12&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;ST36 and CV12&#x0201d;) will have better effect than local distribution point association (&#x0201c;CV12 and CV13&#x0201d;). Furthermore, we can screen the most effective acupoint combination for clinical application from these three groups.</p><p>Although the manipulators and participants cannot be blinded to the group allocation in this study, all outcome measures will be administered and collected by a blinded estimator, and statisticians blinded to group assignment will perform data analysis. With respect to clinical quality control, the manipulators, estimators and statisticians will work independently to reduce the adverse impacts of artificial factors on data. A third party has been invited to manage data independently and to design a central randomization system for minimizing bias and enhancing clinical research quality.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this trial are expected to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of distal-proximal point association and the local distribution point association by electro-acupuncture in the management of CINV.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Trial status</title><p>The first participant was recruited on 26 June 2015.
