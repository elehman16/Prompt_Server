Additionally anxiety disorders represent a significant cost to the health care system as well as employers through benefits coverage and days missed due to incapacity. This study sought to explore the effectiveness of naturopathic care on anxiety symptoms using a randomized trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Employees with moderate to severe anxiety of longer than 6 weeks duration were randomized based on age and gender to receive naturopathic care (NC) (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;41) or standardized psychotherapy intervention (PT) (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;40) over a period of 12 weeks. Blinding of investigators and participants during randomization and allocation was maintained. Participants in the NC group received dietary counseling, deep breathing relaxation techniques, a standard multi-vitamin, and the herbal medicine, ashwagandha (<italic>Withania somnifera</italic>) (300 mg b.i.d. standardized to 1.5&#x00025; withanolides, prepared from root). The PT intervention received psychotherapy, and matched deep breathing relaxation techniques, and placebo. The primary outcome measure was the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and secondary outcome measures included the Short Form 36 (SF-36), Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI), and Measure Yourself Medical Outcomes Profile (MY-MOP) to measure anxiety, mental health, and quality of life respectively. Participants were blinded to the placebo-controlled intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Seventy-five participants (93&#x00025;) were followed for 8 or more weeks on the trial. Final BAI scores decreased by 56.5&#x00025; (p&#x0003c;0.0001) in the NC group and 30.5&#x00025; (p&#x0003c;0.0001) in the PT group. BAI group scores were significantly decreased in the NC group compared to PT group (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.003). Significant differences between groups were also observed in mental health, concentration, fatigue, social functioning, vitality, and overall quality of life with the NC group exhibiting greater clinical benefit. No serious adverse reactions were observed in either group.</p></sec><sec><title>Relevance</title><p>Many patients seek alternatives and/or complementary care to conventional anxiety treatments. To date, no study has evaluated the potential of a naturopathic treatment protocol to effectively treat anxiety. Knowledge of the efficacy, safety or risk of natural health products, and naturopathic treatments is important for physicians and the public in order to make informed decisions.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Both NC and PT led to significant improvements in patients' anxiety. Group comparison demonstrated a significant decrease in anxiety levels in the NC group over the PT group. Significant improvements in secondary quality of life measures were also observed in the NC group as compared to PT. The whole system of naturopathic care for anxiety needs to be investigated further including a closer examination of the individual components within the context of their additive effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Controlled-Trials.com <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN78958974/78958974">ISRCTN78958974</ext-link>

These disorders are associated with considerable chronicity, morbidity, and disability <xref rid="pone.0006628-Alonso1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0006628-BrawmanMintzer1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0006628-Howell1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Anxiety has been associated with increased risk for other disease conditions and plays an important role in overall quality of life, as well as ability to function in normal daily living. In addition, anxiety disorders impose high individual and social burden, tend to be chronic, and can be as disabling as somatic disorders. Compared with those who have other psychiatric disorders, people with anxiety disorders are high care utilizers who present to general practitioners more frequently than to psychiatric professionals, placing a strain upon the health care system and/or private insurance drug benefit plans. The economic costs of anxiety disorders include psychiatric, and nonpsychiatric emergency care; hospitalization; prescription drugs; reduced productivity; absenteeism from work; and suicide <xref rid="pone.0006628-Lepine1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated the economic repercussions of widespread anxiety in the workplace<xref rid="pone.0006628-Lepine1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0006628-Alonso1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0006628-Marciniak1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. A data set from a large employer database has demonstrated both the medical and productivity costs of anxiety disorder <xref rid="pone.0006628-Marciniak1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. This study concluded that, employees diagnosed with anxiety disorders were significantly more likely to have additional diagnoses, use more services, require hospitalization, or visit the emergency room compared with the control group based on analysis of work and medical records. In the final analysis, after controlling for differences in comorbidities employees diagnosed with anxiety disorders had significantly higher medical costs, productivity costs, and total costs compared with the control group <xref rid="pone.0006628-Marciniak1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Data from the World Health Organization Collaborative Study on Psychological Problems in General Health (WHO-PPGHC) reveals the impact of psychiatric illnesses and comorbidities in terms of increased disability in a primary care population <xref rid="pone.0006628-Rafferty1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. This study reported the mean number of work loss days with marked disability (during the past 30 days) due to <bold>any</bold> anxiety disorder to be 19; higher than diabetes and heart disease.</p><p>Although complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatments are popular in the general population <xref rid="pone.0006628-Rafferty1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> as well as in those suffering from anxiety <xref rid="pone.0006628-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0006628-Krisanaprakornkit1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0006628-RoyByrne1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, there is limited or sometimes contradictory evidence to support their use in the treatment of anxiety disorders <xref rid="pone.0006628-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Previous CAM research on anxiety has generally been focused on the effectiveness of a single intervention or therapy <xref rid="pone.0006628-Pittler1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0006628-Pilkington1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, with no previous studies investigating naturopathic approaches. At the same time, recent trends in the treatment of anxiety reveal a significant superiority of combination psychotherapy and pharmacological intervention over monotherapy (either psychotherapy or pharmacological treatment) <xref rid="pone.0006628-Furukawa1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. This movement towards the use of multiple types of treatment for anxiety in clinical practice not only reflects the overall values and practice inherent to many CAM therapies <xref rid="pone.0006628-Borgerson1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0006628-Elder1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, but also presents many challenges to research using the randomized trial design <xref rid="pone.0006628-Timmermans1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0006628-Verhoef1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. To address these concerns, CAM research often employs a pragmatic randomized controlled trial design; which is most useful to investigate whether an intervention works under real-life conditions, as well as whether it is effective for outcomes that matter to the patient <xref rid="pone.0006628-Hotopf1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>Naturopathic medicine (also known as naturopathy) is a school of medical philosophy and practice that seeks to improve health and treat disease chiefly by assisting the body's innate capacity to recover from illness and injury. This alternative medical system of care employs the use of many CAM therapies including acupuncture, herbal medicine, osteopathy, nutrition, homeopathy, and lifestyle counseling<xref rid="pone.0006628-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> in a combined manner to address the underlying cause of disease. No previous studies have investigated the impact of a naturopathic approach for anxiety.</p><p>Behavioral interventions such as diaphragmatic breathing have been shown to reduce anxiety levels and improve coping capability in stressful situations <xref rid="pone.0006628-Somer1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Therapies identifying negative stress coping patterns and replacing them with positive outlets are effective means of controlling and treating anxiety <xref rid="pone.0006628-Leahy1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The results of a large meta-analysis conducted by Faragher <italic>et al</italic> indicates that stress reduction counseling is an effective primary care treatment for widespread health concerns including mental health, anxiety, self-esteem, physical health, and job satisfaction in the workplace <xref rid="pone.0006628-Faragher1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>
<italic>Withania somnifera</italic>, has been an important herb in use within the Ayurvedic and indigenous medical systems for over 3000 years. Clinical trials and animal research support the use of <italic>Withania somnifera</italic> for anxiety, inflammation, Parkinson's disease, cognitive and neurological disorders and as a useful adjunct for patients undergoing radiation and chemotherapy. <italic>Withania somnifera</italic> is also used therapeutically as an adaptogen for patients with nervous exhaustion, insomnia, debility due to stress, and as an immune stimulant in patients with low white blood cell counts <xref rid="pone.0006628-1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0006628-Mishra1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>The major biochemical constituents of <italic>Withania somnifera</italic> root are steroidal alkaloids and steroidal lactones in a class of constituents called withanolides <xref rid="pone.0006628-1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0006628-Mishra1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. At present, 12 alkaloids, 35 withanolides, and several sitoindosides from this plant have been isolated and studied. A sitoindoside is a withanolide containing a glucose molecule at carbon 27. Much of <italic>Withania</italic>'s pharmacological activity has been attributed to two main withanolides, withaferin A and withanolide D <xref rid="pone.0006628-1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0006628-Mishra1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>Theoretically, the withanolides serve as important hormone precursors which may be convertible into human physiologic hormones as needed. <italic>Withania</italic> is thought to be amphoteric <xref rid="pone.0006628-1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0006628-Mishra1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>; i.e. it can help regulate important physiologic processes. The theory is that when there is an excess of a certain hormone, the plant-based hormone precursor occupies cell membrane receptor sites so the actual hormone cannot attach and exert its effect. If the hormone level is low, the plant-based hormone exerts a small effect. <italic>Withania</italic> may also facilitate the ability to withstand stressors, and has antioxidant properties as well. Other studies have shown <italic>Withania somnifera</italic> to have an immunostimulatory effect <xref rid="pone.0006628-Archana1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>Most studies on <italic>Withania</italic>'s anxiolytic effect are based on animal studies. In one study the anxiolytic and antidepressive actions of <italic>Withania somnifera</italic> were compared to commonly prescribed pharmaceuticals. In this preclinical work, an extract of the root was administered orally to rats once daily for five days and results were compared to a group administered the anxiolytic benzodiazepine lorazepam and the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine <xref rid="pone.0006628-Bhattacharya1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Both the <italic>Withania</italic> group and the lorazepam group demonstrated reduced brain levels of a marker for clinical anxiety. Other preclinical studies confirm these results, lending support to the use of <italic>Withania</italic> as an antistress adaptogen <xref rid="pone.0006628-Archana1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0006628-Bhattacharya2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0006628-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0006628-Dhuley1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In a recently published study we demonstrated the anxiolytic potential of a compound natural health product which had <italic>Withania</italic> as the main herb in an open label human trial <xref rid="pone.0006628-Seely1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>A study showing the role of a <italic>Withania</italic> extract on central nervous system calcium antagonism, sheds some light on a potential anxiolytic mechanism of action. In this study by Grunze <italic>et al</italic>, <italic>Withania</italic> extract supplementation resulted in extracellular calcium antagonism in neurons thereby counteracting excitation <xref rid="pone.0006628-Grunze1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Calcium excitation has been shown to play a role in various psychiatric conditions including anxiety, and it is reasonable to expect an anxiolytic action when calcium excitation in inhibited.</p><p>Naturopathic treatment generally includes suggested alterations in patients' diet. Diets high in stimulants have been linked to symptoms of anxiety. Reducing stimulants such as caffeine, chocolate, nicotine, refined sugars will reduce incidence and severity of anxiety <xref rid="pone.0006628-Rainey1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.

This study was a randomized pragmatic control trial comparing naturopathic care to standard first-line treatment for anxiety (psychotherapy). The treatment interventions were planned for 12 weeks. After participants were considered eligible and baseline information collected, they were randomized using age and gender matched stratification to either naturopathic care (active group) (NC) or psychotherapy (control group)(PT) from one of the two practitioners (OS, KC) by an independent third party (DS) using a computer generated randomization sequence. Assignment to practitioner was based on chronology and by alternating back and forth between the practitioners at the time of enrollment (i.e. prior to any mutual knowledge or relationship of the patient and practitioner). Allocation concealment using central randomization was preserved up to the point of treatment. Although the analysts and participants were blinded to treatment allocation, and supplements were delivered using opaque, matched pills for all the supplements and placebo used, it was not possible to mask the interventions from the participants or the clinicians delivering care. Care was taken in the informed consent to ensure that participant blinding was preserved and thus keep expectation biases as equal as possible in both treatment groups.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Treatment Groups</title><sec id="s2b1"><title>Naturopathic care (NC)</title><p>Participants receiving naturopathic care were seen once per week for 30 minutes to receive specific treatment for anxiety over a period of 12 weeks. A licensed naturopathic doctor with more than 4 years of experience administered the treatments during these sessions. During the treatment sessions, data on patients' lifestyle and diet was obtained, and diaphragmatic deep breathing exercises were performed. Lifestyle and nutritional counseling specific to the individual patient was given with special emphasis on reducing intake of stimulants (caffeine, cigarettes, chocolate), eating small, meals at regular intervals, and increasing consumption of fruit, fish, vegetables, nuts, and whole grains. Participants were encouraged to exercise on a regular basis. Two supplements were provided for participants to take throughout the trial: 1) the herb <italic>Withania somnifera</italic> (Swiss - Ashwagandha) (standardized to 1.5&#x00025; withanolides) taken at 300 mg, two times each day, and 2) an adult multivitamin (Swiss - Senior Multi One) containing generic vitamin and mineral components approved by the Natural Health Products Directorate as a factor in the maintenance of good health. Supplements were administered to the participants, and compliance was assessed through pill count in 30-day increments for the duration of the trial. All supplements and corresponding placebo pills were manufactured and provided by Swiss Herbals using certified Good Manufacturing Practices.</p><p>Although individualized treatment of patients is a highly emphasized tenet that governs the practice of naturopathic medicine, this &#x02018;generalized&#x02019; treatment protocol was designed by a group of experienced naturopathic doctors at a naturopathic educational institution for the purposes of this trial. Consideration was given to the overall concerns and typical needs of this population of participants in drafting the naturopathic treatment protocol, including the need to address generalized anxiety, physical and mental strain, improper sleeping schedules, a holistic view of health, overuse of stimulating substances, and support optimal health within the context of the workplace. Characteristics of the Canada Post population as well as the experiences of two naturopathic doctors (OS, KC) involved in a previous trial provided the basis for the study intervention <xref rid="pone.0006628-Szczurko1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Overall, treatments for the naturopathic group contained an element of individualized counseling, therapeutic doctor-patient relationship, patient education, a mind-body exercise, patient motivation, and a &#x02018;pill&#x02019;. Treatments involving individualized recommendations were made at the discretion of the investigator providing study care.</p></sec><sec id="s2b2"><title>Psychotherapy (PT)</title><p>Participants randomized to this control group received psychotherapy consisting of patient directed counseling and cognitive behavioural therapy for 30 minutes each week for 12 weeks for anxiety as well as matched placebo pills. During these sessions, participants received cognitive restructuring exercises for the symptoms of anxiety delivered by a practitioner with 5 years of training and experience in cognitive behavioural therapy. In addition, participants were educated on the importance of maintaining a healthy diet, reducing stimulants (caffeine and tobacco), and taught a deep breathing exercise at the start of the trial. In an effort to provide effective control measures, participants in this group were asked about their dietary habits and stimulant use throughout the trial with no continued dietary or lifestyle counseling. Essentially, this meant that participants were made aware of the importance of these issues without ongoing advice. Participants were encouraged to exercise. Opaque, matched placebo pills (2 pills, taken twice daily) consisting of an inert fiber substance were administered and participant compliance was assessed identically to that of the naturopathic group. Careful consideration was given in the design of the treatments to provide an effective treatment for anxiety while creating an adequately matched &#x02018;placebo&#x02019; to the active group As such, the control group treatments contained an element of individualized counseling, therapeutic doctor-patient relationship, patient education, a mind-body exercise, patient motivation and a &#x02018;pill&#x02019;.

Higher scores correspond to a lower satisfaction (i.e. worse) level of health as it pertains to individually selected symptoms.</p></list-item></list><p>In addition, a series of 7-point visual analogue scale (VAS) questions were administered at 4, 8, and 12-week time points to measure participants subjective impressions of their own: compliance to the treatment protocol; benefit from the treatment; how well the study treatments met their expectations for treating their anxiety; interest in pursuing treatments; and ability to cope with stress since starting study treatments. Higher scores on the VAS corresponded to greater positive subjective impression in the individual parameter. Although the study was not powered to measure significance in these VAS measures, it was expected that group comparison would allow inference on the nature and variance in the non-specific effects between active and control group. We hypothesized that minimal inter-group differences in these parameters would correspond to a high correlation in non-specific effects between the two groups; essentially well-matched comparator treatments <xref rid="pone.0006628-Jonas1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All analyses were performed by a statistician (QZ) under blinded conditions using SAS/STAT (Version 9.1, Cary, NC).

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006628-g001">Figure 1</xref> describes the flow of participants through the trial. 119 people were screened, with 87 meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria. Of the 32 excluded participants, 16 had zero to mild anxiety (BAI&#x0003c;10), 4 had mild to severe conjoint depression (BDI&#x0003e;10), 2 were consuming daily doses of prescription benzodiazepine medication for treatment of their anxiety, and 10 could not commit to the time required to take part in the trial. Patients that were identified as having mild to severe depression were referred for appropriate treatment. Age and gender based central randomization occurred for the remaining 87. OS provided study care to 43 participants; KC provided study care to 44 participants. Six of the 87 participants withdrew from the study before starting treatment; three of whom had been randomized to the active treatment group and three randomized to the control group. Four of the six cited time constraints as a reason for withdrawal, and two participants had major changes in their health status and were advised not to participate in the study on the advice of their family physician. Baseline analysis was conducted with the remaining 81 participants that began treatment. During the course of the study, eight patients withdrew from the NC group, and nine withdrew from the PT group. A total of nine patients withdrew due to time constraints, six patients were lost on follow-up with no discernable reason cited for withdrawal, two patients (both from PT group) withdrew on the advice of their medical doctor and one patient was required to withdraw due to a positive pregnancy test.</p><fig id="pone-0006628-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006628.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Flowchart of participants through trial.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0006628.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Baseline characteristics</title><p>Randomization was stratified based on age and gender.

No differences were observed between groups; gastrointestinal upset and feeling of &#x02018;overstimulation&#x02019; were the most commonly reported in both groups. Gastrointestinal complaints consisted of incidence of nausea or stomach pain lasting 1&#x02013;2 hours after taking the pills. Complaints of &#x02018;overstimulation&#x02019; (participant's word) include feelings of increased mental and, or physical agitation lasting 4&#x02013;6 hours.

A sample size this small proved to be unsuitable for cost-effectiveness analysis and is a limitation of the research study. This limitation based on participation may, in part, be due to increased apprehension surrounding issues of informed consent and researcher access to this information in the study's population.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results should be of interest to patients, clinicians and workplace-related health services alike. Results of this study indicate a significant reduction in anxiety level from the use of either naturopathic care or a standardized psychotherapy intervention in this workplace setting. These results are consistent with systematic reviews on the short-term efficacy of counseling in the treatment of anxiety <xref rid="pone.0006628-Bower1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Further research studies on the effects of either of these interventions in other workplace settings are warranted, particularly with respect to impact on worker presenteeism and cost-effectiveness based on larger-scale implementation. Comparatively, naturopathic treatment showed a clinically and statistically significant improvement in anxiety and quality of life measures as compared to the control standard.</p><p>Our study demonstrates that naturopathic treatments, cognitive behavioral therapy and counseling have a significant effect on decreasing the symptoms of anxiety. In addition, naturopathic treatments including dietary changes and the herb <italic>Withania somnifera</italic> have additional secondary effects on quality of life of individuals in the workplace, including significant reduction in stress and improved vitality, motivation, general health, and patient-specific concerns. Few participants in the study were receiving treatment for anxiety despite remarkable symptoms of anxiety and dysfunctional mental health. This observation is consistent with the persisting stigma surrounding mental health disorders and reticence to explore treatments <xref rid="pone.0006628-Nutt1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. The benefits from this pragmatic study on providing access to care and ongoing treatment for all the participants were notable and highly valued by the workplace.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations</title><p>This was a pragmatic randomized controlled trial, and as such, it is difficult to ascertain the precise effect of each of the component therapies of the NC and PT treatment packages. Future research trials employing a multi-factorial design would assist in isolating and characterizing the effects of single and combination treatments.</p><p>Maintaining internal and external validity in pragmatic RCTs is a challenge <xref rid="pone.0006628-Godwin1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0006628-vanderWindt1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Our study design attempted to maximize external validity (generalizability) by having few exclusion criteria and including some flexibility or variability in study interventions based on individual needs (e.g. specific advice given in counseling or dietary advice). However, one specific herbal component was used to treat all study participants in the NC group despite the range of potential psychoactive herbs with varying degrees of supportive evidence <xref rid="pone.0006628-Sarris1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Treatment decisions made by the naturopathic doctors in the study was limited as a result, thus decreasing the external validity of our study. The overall generalizability of our results is limited, in part, due to small sample size.</p><p>Internal validity was achieved by: attempting to account for non-specific effects of treatments in both groups; absence of assessment bias; and preventing contamination <xref rid="pone.0006628-Godwin1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0006628-vanderWindt1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Both the NC and PT groups received: individualized counseling, therapeutic doctor-patient relationship, patient education, a mind-body exercise, patient motivation, and a &#x02018;pill&#x02019;. In addition, both treatment groups reported that their expectations for treatment were being effectively met on 7-point VAS throughout the course of the study (NC: 5.57, PT: 4.77). Assessment and data analysis was conducted blind to group allocation. No contamination of the PT group with respect to <italic>Withania</italic> use or visits to a naturopathic doctor occurred. No patients in either group were undergoing active counseling or psychotherapy outside this study. Lack of a &#x02018;no treatment&#x02019; control group limits the internal validity of this study; we are unable to account for spontaneous changes in anxiety levels or regression to the mean within the study design. However, the natural course and severity of anxiety is generally consistent over time when it has been present with a large degree of chronicity (&#x0003e;6 months)<xref rid="pone.0006628-Lepine1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Although a statistically significant difference in reduction of anxiety symptoms was observed between NC and PT treatment, we observed some methodological challenges based on our study population and study design. Sample size calculation was based on detecting a clinically and statistically significant effect size (&#x000b1;20&#x00025;) on BAI scores from baseline, however both the NC and PT groups demonstrated significant reductions in BAI scores (NC 56.5&#x00025;, PT 30.5&#x00025;) thus minimizing the ability to detect the differential effect size <xref rid="pone.0006628-Le1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. In addition, the heterogeneity of the study participants, as reflected by the large variability in BAI scores, impacts negatively on predictability and the ability to detect between group differences <xref rid="pone.0006628-Le1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>.</p><p>Additionally, it should be highlighted that this study investigated changes in patient-reported symptoms of anxiety. Future studies would need to employ the use of blinded independent assessment of this disorder using a structured diagnostic interview based on DMS-IV criteria (SCID) throughout the study to gather non-patient rated information relating to anxiety.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Naturopathic treatment including <italic>Withania somnifera</italic>, a multi vitamin, dietary counseling and cognitive-behavioral therapy appears to be a safe and effective, with benefit over standardized psychotherapy in the treatment of mild to severe generalized anxiety in the Canada Post worker population. Future research is required to examine effects of the individual components of treatments as well as the nature of the therapeutic relationship in mental health disorders like anxiety.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0006628.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT checklist</p><p>(0.05 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0006628.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0006628.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol</p><p>(0.45 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0006628.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank the corporate members and the Union members of the planning committee at the Canada Post Corporation and the Canadian Union of Postal Workers, Swiss Herbals Inc. for supplying study product free of charge, as well as the Scientific Review Board of the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine for assistance in the design of this study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding: </bold>This study was funded by National Joint Benefits Project of the Canada Post Corporation and Canadian Union of Postal Workers.
