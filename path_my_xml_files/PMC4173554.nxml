Patients suffering from severe cardiac or respiratory disease, liver or renal disease, any allergy or contraindication to any study drug, previous surgery of inguinal region, deranged coagulation profile or refusal to technique, were excluded from the study.</p><p>All patients were randomized by computer generated number into two equal groups of 20 patients each, based on intraoperative sedation monitoring technique. The rate of propofol infusion for sedation in patients of group I (non-BIS) was managed clinically while sedation in patients of group II (BIS) was managed with BIS values of 65-75.</p><p>After arrival to operation theatre, the routine monitoring for pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure and electrocardiography was carried out and intravenous infusion of lactated ringer was started.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Ultrasound guided block technique</title><p>A SonoSite MicroMaxx portable ultrasound unit with high frequency (8-13 MHz) 38 mm linear transducer probe was used to identify the ILHN and ILIN, which supply the inguinal region. The ILHN and ILIN nerves run between internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles, medial to the anterior superior iliac spine, and pierce the internal oblique muscle to lie deep to aponeurosis.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Patient was laid supine and the linear probe was placed in the axial plane, cephalad of the anterior superior iliac spine oriented in a slightly caudal direction, at the level of a triangle of petit or where the three muscle layers are most distinct on ultrasound. These nerves were identified as hypo echoic structures between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Using an in-plane approach, the needle was advanced from anterior to posterior obliquely to transversus abdominis plane and after a negative aspiration test 20 mL of 0.75% ropivacaine was injected. The appropriate spread of local anesthetic was monitored by ultrasound between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles space. The total time taken for the procedure was 10-15 min.</p><p>Skin incision was performed after infiltration of the incision site with 10 mL of lidocaine 1% in all patients, because the cutaneous innervation of the ILIN is variable, and there are no accurate clinical tests of its assessment.</p><p>Sedation was induced with midazolam 0.04 mg/kg as bolus, followed by propofol infusion. The propofol infusion rate was adjusted according to randomization schedule. The level of sedation was monitored in patients of group I (non-BIS) clinically with a 4-point rating scale (0: Fully alert, 1: Sleepy, but easily arousable with the verbal command, 2: Sleepy but hardly arousable, and 3: Unconscious patient) and was maintained at scale 2. In patients of group II (BIS), the sedation was monitored with BIS and was maintained between BIS values of 65 to 75. During sedation, spontaneous breathing was maintained and patients were given oxygen at a rate of 3 L/min via Hudson facemask.</p><p>They were monitored for hemodynamic stability, respiratory depression or any other surgical and anesthetic complication.</p><p>The need for additional intraoperative local anesthesia or deepening of sedation level with large doses of propofol was defined as a failed block. After completion of surgery, the total consumption of propofol was noted.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Study population size was based to ensure power 0.80 for clinically significance.

All patients were discharged from the hospital next day.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The ultrasound guidance for ILHN and ILIN blocks for inguinal herniorraphy has gave us an opportunity to readily identify the anatomical variation in the inguinal region for effective surgical anesthesia. Although, there was no significant difference between the two groups in the mean dose of propofol consumption, BIS monitoring has ensured amnesia and faster emergence from propofol sedation. All patients remained hemodynamically stable and were able to breath spontaneously without any respiratory depression of propofol sedation technique. No addition analgesia or deep sedation of propofol was needed to complete the inguinal herniorraphy.</p><p>The use of ultrasonography in regional anesthesia has caused more success, shorter onset time as compared to conventional &#x0201c;fascial click&#x0201d; technique. It allows direct visualization of the nerves, detection of anatomical variations, and prevents damage to the structures adjacent to nerves. The selective ILHN and ILIN block provided good quality surgical anesthesia and early discharge of the patient.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>The large volume of local anesthetic could be injected in a fan shape manner to encounter the technical difficulties of conventional fascial click technique for inguinal nerves block. The use of ultrasound as an aid to regional anesthesia promotes higher precision of local anesthetic deposition and has increased the safety of patients from drug toxicity as reduced volume of local anesthetic drug is required for successful block.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Studies using ultrasound guidance have suggested that more accurate placement of smaller amount of local anesthetic does not reduce the efficacy, but potentially reduces the unwanted side-effects of femoral nerve palsy. The femoral nerve palsy is thought to be volume related and occurs as a result of an unnecessary spread of local anesthetic between the muscle layers.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Ala-Kokko <italic>et al</italic>. have demonstrated large plasma concentrations of bupivacaine after ILHN and ILIN block that were performed with the fascial click method using 0.39 mL/kg of 0.5% bupivacaine.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, successful block was achieved using 0.3 mL/kg of 0.75% ropivacaine without affecting the quality of surgical analgesia for inguinal herniorraphy with early ambulation and hospital discharge.</p><p>Bispectral analysis may reduce patient awareness during anesthesia, facilitated a faster wake-up time and perhaps a shorter stay in the recovery room. Bispectral values of 65-75 have been advocated as a measure of sedation. In order to achieve the desired level of propofol sedation, a target concentration of the propofol in the blood must be delivered. Significant correlations between plasma propofol concentration and BIS values have been reported by many investigators. BIS monitoring may be used to monitor sedation levels to reflect the propofol concentration. Gan <italic>et al</italic>. also observed the faster emergence when BIS monitoring was used during general anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Ultrasonography has enabled the accurate placement of the needle for clinically effective ILHN and ILIN block for inguinal herniorraphy. BIS monitoring has ensured amnesia and faster emergence after surgery. The technique proved to be effectual for day care surgery.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kehlet</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>PF</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Optimizing anesthesia for inguinal herniorrhaphy: General, regional, or local anesthesia?</article-title><source>Anesth Analg</source><year>2001</year><volume>93</volume><fpage>1367</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11726407</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Marhofer</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Schr&#x000f6;gendorfer</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Wallner</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Koinig</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Mayer</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Kapral</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Ultrasonographic guidance reduces the amount of local anesthetic for 3-in-1 blocks</article-title><source>Reg Anesth Pain Med</source><year>1998</year><volume>23</volume><fpage>584</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9840855</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Vaisman</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Pelvic hematoma after an ilioinguinal nerve block for orchialgia</article-title><source>Anesth Analg</source><year>2001</year><volume>92</volume><fpage>1048</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11273948</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Frigon</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Mai</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Valois-Gomez</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Desparmet</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Bowel hematoma following an iliohypogastric-ilioinguinal nerve block</article-title><source>Paediatr Anaesth</source><year>2006</year><volume>16</volume><fpage>993</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16918666</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Drummond</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Monitoring depth of anesthesia: With emphasis on the application of the bispectral index and the middle latency auditory evoked response to the prevention of recall</article-title><source>Anesthesiology</source><year>2000</year><volume>93</volume><fpage>876</fpage><lpage>82</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10969323</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Avidan</surname><given-names>MS</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Burnside</surname><given-names>BA</given-names></name><name><surname>Finkel</surname><given-names>KJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Searleman</surname><given-names>AC</given-names></name><name><surname>Selvidge</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Anesthesia awareness and the bispectral index</article-title><source>N Engl J Med</source><year>2008</year><volume>358</volume><fpage>1097</fpage><lpage>108</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18337600</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref7"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Denny</surname><given-names>NM</given-names></name><name><surname>Harrop-Griffiths</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Location, location, location!
