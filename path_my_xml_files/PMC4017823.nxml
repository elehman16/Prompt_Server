Patients with BPD struggle with a profound fear of abandonment, identity disturbances, and paranoid ideations. They are at risk for suicide and repetitive self-destructive behaviors. BPD patients show a completed suicide rate that is 50 times greater than that in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The short- to medium-term outcome of BPD is poor. There is some evidence that the long-term follow-up course is more favorable, with remission rates of about 88% within ten years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, &#x02018;remission&#x02019; means that diagnostic criteria are not fulfilled. Affective symptoms reflecting areas of dysphoria, such as chronic feelings of emptiness, intense anger or profound abandonment, largely remain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>In the general population, the prevalence of BPD varies from 0.4 to 1.8%, with a pooled rate of 1.1% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The lifetime prevalence of BPD was found to be 5.9% among a representative sample of the adult population of the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In the Netherlands, the number of borderline patients is estimated at 100,000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In clinical samples, BPD is usually the most common personality disorder. In outpatient samples, rates of 9.3 to 18% have been reported, with a pooled rate of 11.9% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Studies of psychiatric inpatient populations have reported rates of BPD at about 40% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>DBT is the BPD treatment model for BPD with the largest number of evidence-based published research articles on effectiveness (13 Random Controled Trials (RCT) versus 2 RCTs of next evidence treatment model off the rank). The American Psychological Association, Society of Clinical Psychology (APA) has cited DBT as one of the well-established, empirically supported, treatments for BPD that has strong research support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The UK NICE guidelines recognize that, more than any other therapy, there is some evidence that DBT is effective in reducing suicide attempts and self-harm, anger, aggression and depression in patients with BPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This is also postulated in the Dutch guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Yet, standard DBT is lengthy and thus expensive. Moreover, some BPD patients are not sufficiently engaged in outpatient treatment and/or experience periodic exacerbations of severe self-injurious behavior making hospitalization necessary. A recent meta-analysis showed that psychotherapy for BPD yielded an overall drop-out rate of 25% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Previous research also demonstrated that BPD patients are hospitalized and readmitted more than those with other disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This is troublesome, since dropping out of treatment, as well as a pattern of inpatient treatments, adds to the suicide risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. These figures frequently pose a dilemma for mental health care professionals treating highly suicidal patients in an outpatient setting. Hospitalization seems inevitable under some circumstances, yet has proven harmful in its own right. It is concluded that there is an urgent need to develop and test short-term inpatient treatment programs that (i) rapidly reduce core borderline symptoms like suicidal behavior, (ii) minimize the negative effects of an inpatient setting, and (iii) enhance compliance with outpatient treatment.</p><p>Following the publication of the SCEPTRE research results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and a growing number of inpatient DBT programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], the concept of inpatient treatment seems to be gaining interest. There is sufficient evidence that inpatient DBT leads to symptom reduction and that treatment gains are maintained after discharge for adult and adolescent BPD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, firm conclusions about the efficacy of inpatient DBT cannot be drawn. The effect of inpatient DBT has not been investigated in RCTs or compared to the effect of outpatient DBT. Moreover, no data on the cost-effectiveness of inpatient DBT are available.</p><p>The Center of Personality Disorders Jelgersma (GGZ Rivierduinen Leiden, Netherlands) developed an intensive 12-week inpatient DBT program that (i) rapidly reduces core borderline symptoms like suicidal behavior, (ii) minimizes negative effects of an inpatient setting, and (iii) enhances compliance with outpatient treatment. We evaluated the (cost-) effectiveness of this experimental program.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This is a prospective randomized controlled trial.

It was decided that Jelgersma Center for Personality Disorders in Oegstgeest, Regional Psychiatric Center GGZ Rijnstreek, Regional Psychiatric Center GGZ Leiden and Regional Psychiatric Center GGZ Midden-Holland, constituting all participating centers of GGZ Rivierduinen, would implement a central recruiting and diagnostic facility in order to recruit patients efficiently and uniformly. All referrals for initial assessment in this facility were considered, given that patients contact the researcher themselves and of their own free will. No restriction is made in terms of the referral source. Only hard drug abuse that requires inpatient detoxification and a forced treatment framework were refused.

This treatment unit provides accommodation for nine patients. Patients are admitted five days a week. Staff is only present in the daytime. During the weekends the patients stay at home. The therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] consists of DBT skills training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], individual psychotherapy (45&#x000a0;minutes a week during the inpatient and the outpatient program), crisis consultation if needed, and weekly meetings of the consultation team for all trainers and therapists for one hour. Staff also receives supervision twice-weekly.</p><p>Individual psychotherapy takes place on a weekly basis. The order of the topics of each session is based on Linehan&#x02019;s protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and is pre-determined: suicidal and self-destructive behavior, therapy-interfering behavior, quality of life-interfering behavior and generalization of the skills taught in the training. Each therapy session starts by filling out diary cards that hold all the information concerning the problematic behaviors, which are the primary goal of the treatment, but also behaviors that influence the primary goals (such as alcohol and drug use, the urge to self-harm, substance abuse, dissociation, level of applied skills). Skills&#x02019; training takes place during the inpatient program on a weekly basis, but discussion of theory and homework classes are separated in time throughout the week (in total two and a half hours). The skills taught are standard DBT skills and combine self-regulation and change skills, and skills for self-acceptance and acceptance of others: Core mindfulness skills, Interpersonal effectiveness skills, Emotion regulation skills, Crises skills and Radical acceptance. Missed meetings need to be caught up by watching the video recordings that are made of all the trainings sessions.</p><p>Patients also receive daily mindfulness classes, two hours of drama therapy, psycho-educational classes about sexuality, substance abuse and medication, and the possibility of getting help in applying principles of validation and behavioral analysis skills. Other program parts are mainly based on living in a group, such as house-keeping meetings. In order to facilitate skills generalization, patients and staff developed psycho-educational evening sessions (two) in which information on BPD and DBT is given, followed by a training program (six sessions) in which patients together with family and friends can get help in applying skills. Each session lasts two hours. The first two sessions are spent on psycho-education about BPD, DBT and the content of the treatment program. In the next four sessions, all participants are asked to commit to practice the skills that are taught in the program with each other.</p><p>During evening and night hours, no staff is present. The results from the data gathered during the developmental phase of the program (October 2009 to September 2011), show that this does not lead to an increase in difficulties in handling relationships.</p><p>B) Standard outpatient DBT for 12&#x000a0;months</p><p>Patients assigned to standard dialectical behavior therapy receive 12&#x000a0;months of treatment as specified in the DBT manual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] in one of the three participating regional psychiatric centers of Rivierduinen. The treatment is according to protocol and combines weekly individual cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy sessions with the primary therapist (45&#x000a0;minutes a week, weekly skills-training groups lasting two and a half hours per session (135&#x000a0;minutes), and if needed, consultation and weekly consultation meetings for trainers and therapists (one hour). Individual therapy, in both in- and outpatient programs, focuses primarily on motivational issues, including the motivation to stay alive and to stay in treatment. Group skills training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] teaches Core Mindfulness skills, Interpersonal effectiveness skills, Emotion regulation skills, Crises skills and Radical acceptance.</p></sec><sec><title>Selection of the therapists</title><p>Extensive attention was given to the selection of the therapists. Therapists and skills trainers per condition need to meet the highest quality requirements of good training, experience and supervision. All therapists/trainers are psychologists/psychiatrists, or registered nurses/social workers (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;30). All have received at least a three-day introductory training in DBT principles administered by Dialexis, the training institute of the Dutch DBT association. Supervision will be given by the main researcher (LMCB), who is head of the Dutch DBT association and has received extensive training from Dr. Linehan in Seattle, USA. The treatment integrity in DBT is protected by systematic evaluation of video recorded individual and skill training sessions, by trained adherence coders.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective is to investigate whether this program is more effective in declining the proportion of patients that show parasuicidal behavior in the first three months of treatment, compared to standard outpatient DBT. We expect that after 12&#x000a0;weeks of inpatient DBT treatment, 20% of the patients will still show suicidal/self-harming behavior (measured by Life Time Parasuicide Count and items of the Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index) compared to 60% of the patients in standard outpatient DBT. We expect this difference to be sustained after 24&#x000a0;weeks, though it may be reduced between 24 and 52&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>The secondary objectives are: (i) to investigate whether short-term inpatient DBT is more effective in reducing other general (borderline) symptoms, (ii) to investigate whether short-term inpatient DBT is more effective in increasing quality of life, and (iii) to assess the cost-effectiveness of short-term inpatient DBT compared to outpatient DBT in terms of costs per reduced suicide attempts/self-destructive acts and cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) from a societal perspective. We expect (i) a stronger decline in Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index- and Brief Symptomatology Inventory scores and (ii) a stronger increase in quality of life (SF-36 and EQ-5D)-scores in the first three months of inpatient DBT as compared to the control group. We anticipate this difference to be sustained after 24&#x000a0;weeks, though it may reduce between 24 and 52&#x000a0;weeks. We also expect (iii) the initial higher cost of the intensive intervention will lead to better effects and possibly even lower cost than the control condition. Cost savings may be generated in the long run (after one year).</p></sec><sec><title>Measurements</title><sec><title>Screening</title><p>Vragenlijst voor Kenmerken van de Persoonlijkheid (VKP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], a paper-and-pencil self-report questionnaire that measures personality disorders as defined in the DSM-III-R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and the <italic>International Classification of Diseases, version 10</italic> (, ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], was used as a screening test.

In case of imbalance, the allocation probability is modified from 50/50 to 80/20. Minimization variables are: level of severity of borderline symptomatology (BPDSI score&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;40), level of suicidality/self-harming behavior (LPC score&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;14), and age.</p></sec><sec><title>Allocation concealment</title><p>The sequence was concealed until interventions were assigned.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Implementation</title><p>When patients register in the participating psychiatric centers, crisis team members or staff members working at the front office decide whether or not this patient is a candidate for DBT, based on a rapid assessment of BPD symptomatology. Patients are informed about the central recruitment and diagnostic facility and are given the phone numbers of the project leader and coordinator. After a short, standardized telephone interview with the project leader or the coordinator, in which general information on the interventions and study is given, patients need to fill out a screening instrument (Vragenlijst Kenmerken Persoonlijkheid, VKP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and send it back to the central diagnostic facility. Subsequently, a psychologist contacts the patient for a briefing of the results. If the screening instrument indicates that presence of BPD is probable, then psychologist and patient make an appointment for a thorough examination within three weeks. During this thorough examination, with use of the MINI-PLUS and SCID-II, presence of DSM axis I and axis II disorders are verified. Frequency of borderline complaints and parasuicidal gestures are assessed using respectively BPDSI and LPC. All assessment tools employed have demonstrated reliability and validity (described in detail below). Informed consent is discussed and signed. After signing the informed consent, patients are randomized and the diagnostician reports the allocation of the treatment back to the patients. The allocated treatment center then contacts the patient and starts treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Blinding</title><p>No blinding took place.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All participants who are randomised will be included in the comparison and analyzed according to their randomized allocation (intent-to-treat analysis). Wherever possible, we will continue to collect follow-up data from participants after they drop out of treatment, so that the dataset will be as complete as possible. All analyses will be carried out using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) 19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. The effect of the intervention in terms of proportion of respondents still showing suicidal and/or self-destructive behavior after 12&#x000a0;weeks, and the retention of this effect between 24, 36 and 52&#x000a0;weeks, will be computed with the help of longitudinal logistic regression, with time, experimental condition and their interaction as independent variables. The effect of the intervention in terms of reduction in mean BPDSI, LPC, SF-36, and the BSI ratings over time, will be computed with the help of a mixed model linear regression analysis with time, experimental condition and their interaction as independent variables. Missing values will be taken into account by using full information maximum likelihood method estimation. Since there may be some heterogeneity in the implementation of standard DBT across the three different regional centers, between-center heterogeneity will be explored in subgroup analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Cost-effectiveness analysis</title><p>The economic evaluation will be undertaken from a societal perspective. Hence, all relevant effects and costs due to resource utilization within healthcare (direct medical costs) and productivity costs will be included. To examine the cost-effectiveness of the inpatient program compared to the outpatient program the EQ-5D, the SF-6D, and the TiC-P, will be used. We will assess the cost-effectiveness of short-term inpatient DBT compared to outpatient DBT in terms of costs per reduced suicide attempts/self-destructive acts and cost per QALY, the so-called cost utility analysis. The cost utility will be evaluated by relating the difference in direct medical costs per patient receiving inpatient treatment and outpatient care to the difference in terms of QALYs, which yields a cost per QALY estimate. We will estimate the cost per QALY including productivity costs.</p><p>The uncertainty will be assessed using bootstrapping, and the results will be presented in acceptability curves.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical precautions and crisis management</title><p>The study will be executed in accordance with the guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO) and other guidelines, regulations and Acts as currently used in GGZ Rivierduinen. Ethical approval is obtained from the ethical review board of the Leiden University Medical center. The board of Rivierduinen agreed to support the execution of the study. All the boards of the psychiatric regional centers that take part in the study also gave agreement. All participants will be extensively informed about the study, addressing confidentiality, the right to abort their participation at any time and without clarification. Patients can leave the research program any time they want, and this will not affect the course of their treatment. Written information is given. When the patient is willing to continue, written consent is asked. A computer program, developed by the Amsterdam Medical Center, carries out treatment allocation. This program rules out determination of group assignment, which guarantees impartiality of the researchers. The diagnostics and follow-up measurements take place in the Jelgersma Center. An independent physician is appointed, to whom subjects can address questions about the research before, during and after a study. The independent physician does not work at the institution where the study is being carried out, and is not involved in the study itself. Patients will receive a voucher of 10 euros for each repeated measurement, and restitution of their travel expenses.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Mental health care professionals are frequently confronted by a dilemma when treating highly suicidal patients in an outpatient setting. Hospitalization seems inevitable under some circumstances, yet has proven harmful in its own right. This paper outlines the background and methods of a randomized trial evaluating the possible surplus value of a short-term inpatient DBT program.</p><p>Although previous quasi-experimental studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] have shown positive effects of inpatient DBT, the setting could add to the risk of regressive processes during treatment. Therefore we evaluated outcomes of the experimental short-term inpatient DBT program of the Jelgersma Center in a quasi-experimental study, comparing pre- and post-intervention data for 39 female patients with a diagnosis of BPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. It was found that the severity of borderline problems, particularly in the field of interpersonal problems, was significantly reduced. In general, suicidality and parasuicidal behavior were not reduced significantly, though positive effects for patients reporting high levels of suicide attempts and self-harming behavior at baseline were found. It was concluded that the experimental program showed promise for patients who show high levels of parasuicidal behavior and that further development and research was justified. Improvements were suggested and implemented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. One of the most important changes made was restricting the program to patients with recent suicide attempts and severe self-harming behavior.</p><p>Four centers of GGZ Rivierduinen (Center of Personality Disorders Jelgersma, GGZ Rijnstreek, GGZ Leiden en GGZ Midden-Holland) agreed to participate in the trial. In order to rule out differences in the admittance process, an independent, central diagnostic facility was established. This resulted in an efficient, standardized intake procedure that bypasses the waiting lists in the centers. This adaption was considered to be beneficial for participants, since they know their diagnosis and the treatment program they will be part of within a few weeks.</p><p>However, problems can be expected as a result of the randomization. The fact that allocation of setting is random (outpatient versus inpatient) will create an important toll for participants, because they may be randomized to a treatment condition that was not their primary choice. This involves acceptance of uncertainty. Furthermore, allocation to the experimental program involves an inpatient setting for 12&#x000a0;weeks, which may be difficult to organize for patients with families and work.</p><p>Another important problem results from the fact that although an independent, central diagnostic facility was created, the study has no influence on the speed with which patients enter the treatment conditions. The outpatient DBT teams that are part of the trial have a limited capacity and as a result usually have waiting lists.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruiting</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BPD: Borderline Personality Disorder; BPDSI: Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index; BSI: Brief Symptomatology Inventory; DBT: Dialectical Behavior Therapy; DSM-IV: <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>, <italic>version IV</italic>; EQ-5D: EuroQol 5 Dimensions; HLQ: Health and Labor questionnaire; ICD-10: <italic>International Classification of Diseases, version 10</italic>; LPC: Lifetime Parasuicide Count; MINI-PLUS: A web-based Dutch version of the <italic>Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview</italic>; QALY: Quality Adjusted Life Year; SF-36: Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey; SF-6D: Six dimensions of health derived from the SF-36; TiC-P: Trimbos and iMTA Questionnaire on Costs associated with Psychiatric illness.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>LvdB: conception and design, drafting the work or revising it critically, data collection and analysis, manuscript writing and final approval of the manuscript.
