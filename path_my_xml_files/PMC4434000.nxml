exercises on flexed posture and chest function in older women with age-related
hyperkyphosis. [Subjects and Methods] The study participants included 41 elderly women who
were divided into a thorax correction exercise group (n = 20) and a control group (n =
21). Participants in the exercise group completed a specific exercise program that
included breathing correction, thorax mobility, thorax stability, and thorax alignment
training performed twice per week, 1 hour each session, for 8 weeks. Outcome measures
included the flexed posture (thoracic kyphosis angle, forward head posture) and chest
function (vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in a second, and chest expansion
length). [Results] Participants in the thorax correction exercise group demonstrated
significantly greater improvements in thoracic kyphosis angle, forward head, and chest
expansion than those in the control group. [Conclusion] This study provides a promising
exercise intervention that may improve flexed posture and chest function in older women
with age-related hyperkyphosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Chest function</kwd><kwd>Flexed posture</kwd><kwd>Hyperkyphosis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Age-related hyperkyphosis (ARH) is an exaggerated anterior curvature of the thoracic spine
that is associated with aging and frequently observed in older women<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. ARH occurs commonly in women older than 55&#x02005;years,
regardless of vertebral fractures, with the incidence increasing 6&#x02013;11% for every 10&#x02005;years of
increasing age<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. ARH is multifactorial,
and although the precise etiology is not fully understood, poor posture, dehydration of the
intervertebral disks, and reduced back extensor muscle strength have been reported as
general causes of ARH<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Elderly women with ARH often report difficulties with physical performance because of
changes in vertebral column alignment, which affects the quality of life of patients in
relation to their health<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition,
ARH limits the movement of the rib cage, which is connected to the thoracic spine, resulting
in difficulties with pulmonary function<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Horie et al.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the thoracic
vertebrae forms costotransverse joints with the head of the rib. That are directly connected
to the rib cage, suggesting there is a close relationship with the expansion capabilities of
the rib cage during inhalation. Although changes in vertebral column alignment in elderly
women are clinically important to health and quality of life, ARH is considered important to
only a small number of clinicians, and a basic protocol for the treatment of ARH has only
recently been released<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Therapeutic exercises for ARH include back extensor strengthening and flexibility exercises
as well as postural training to improve postural awareness<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, most currently available exercise strategies apply only a
single exercise or combine exercises that target the whole body but do not focus on the
thorax (i.e., the main structure that is deformed because of kyphosis). In addition, most
studies have concentrated on measurement of the thoracic kyphosis angle, muscle strength,
range of motion, and physical performance after an intervention<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, and few studies
have been conducted on measurement of chest functions.</p><p>Thus, this study applied a thorax correction exercise program for 8 weeks in elderly women
with ARH aged more than 65&#x02005;years old and verified the effect of the exercises on flexed
posture and chest function with the purpose of providing a therapeutic intervention that can
manage and prevent the health risks of women with ARH.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted on 41 elderly women with ARH aged over 65&#x02005;years living in D
Metropolitan City (experimental group, 20 women; control group, 21 women). The selection
criteria were as follows: thoracic kyphosis angle of more than 45&#x000b0;, reduced respiratory
function (forced vital capacity [FVC] &#x0003c;80% predicted value) with &#x0003c;3&#x02005;cm of chest
expansion, ability to decrease kyphosis by 5&#x000b0; or more in the standing posture, and ability
to walk independently both on flat surfaces and ascending stairs. Individuals were excluded
if they were diagnosed with vertebral compression fractures within 6 months of the study,
they had a cardiac or respiratory disease, or they were unable to perform the exercise
program because of mental problems (e.g., dementia) or reduced cognitive ability
(Mini-Mental State Examination score &#x02264;24). All included patients understood the purpose of
this study and provided written informed consent prior to participation in accordance with
the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>Each measurement was conducted twice in 2 postures: usual and best straight postures. The
usual posture was defined as a relaxed posture, and the measurements were taken at the time
of full exhalation. On the other hand, the best straight posture was the optimal posture
during full inhalation, in which the participants exhibited their tallest height and the
spine was as straight as possible. Thoracic kyphosis was measured using 2 gravity-dependent
inclinometers (Isomed Inc., Portland, OR, USA) placed over the spinal processes of T1 and
T2, and over the T12 and L1 vertebrae. The thoracic kyphosis angle was measured and recorded
by checking the angles displayed on the inclinometers<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Forward head posture was measured as the distance between the wall
and the tip of the tragus. To prevent the participants&#x02019; trunks from leaning forward, their
heels were attached to a 5-cm block while their knees were extended as much as possible and
their heads were maintained at the neutral position during measurement.</p><p>Chest functions were assessed using the flow volume and chest expansion length, with the
flow volume measured as the vital capacity (VC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second
(FEV1) using an electronic spirometer (Jaeger MaterScope, CareFusion, Wurzburg, Germany). To
increase the measurement accuracy, a nasal clip and mouthpiece were applied to avoid air
leaking during the measurements. To measure VC and FEV1, the participants started by
breathing at rest after the completion of zero adjustment. Participants then inhaled slowly
to within their maximal range and exhaled with their full force until they were instructed
to stop by the sound of a beeper. Participants repeated several trials of this measurement,
and all measurements were conducted while the participants were comfortably seated in a
chair with arm and back rests. In addition, to evaluate the chest expansion length, the
difference between the circumference of the thorax between inhalation and exhalation in the
maximal range was measured at the level of the tenth rib using a flat measuring tape<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. All measurements were conducted 3 times,
and the average was used as the final value.</p><p>The experimental group was required to participate in the thorax correction exercises for
60 minutes in total, consisting of a 5-minute warm-up and 5-minute cool-down period and 50
minutes of primary exercises. The exercises were conducted twice a week for 8 weeks in a
group exercise setting. With respect to the control group, the participants were required to
participate in a daily exercise training program consisting of the same exercises as the
experiment group. The exercises were provided to the participants in a booklet that
contained all of the exercise-related information. The thorax correction exercise aimed to
correct the thorax, which is the structure most affected by thoracic kyphosis, in contrast
to existing thorax improvement exercise. The program consisted of 4 sub-exercises including
5 minutes of breathing correction, 15 minutes of thorax mobility, 20 minutes of thorax
stability, and 10 minutes of thorax alignment reorganization exercise.</p><p>The 8-week exercise program was structured to include an adjustment phase for 1&#x02013;2 weeks, an
improvement phase for 3&#x02013;5 weeks, and a maintenance phase for 6&#x02013;7 weeks with the aim of
gradually improving posture and strength. Exercises to strengthen the back utilized elastic
bands that were applied according to the principle of high-intensity progressive resistance
exercise. The elastic band (Thera-Band, Hygenic Corporation, Akron, OH, USA) used in this
study was a yellow band (15&#x02005;cm wide, 70&#x02005;cm long) with 1.8&#x02005;kg of resistance. When
participants were able to perform the exercise using the band for 3 sets of 8 repetitions
without any pain and discomfort, the yellow band was replaced with a red band with 2.7&#x02005;kg of
resistance<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The collected data were statistically processed using SPSS version 18.0; general
participant characteristics are presented as means and standard deviations using descriptive
statistics analyses. The Shapiro-Wilk test was conducted to verify normality. To compare the
flexed posture and chest function variables between the experimental and control groups
before and after the exercise program, a paired-sample t-test was conducted, whereas an
independent sample t-test was conducted to compare differences between groups. The
statistical significance level for hypothesis testing was set at &#x003b1; =0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The mean age, height, and weight of the experimental group (n=20) were 73.8&#x02005;years,

45&#x000b0; to determine the effect of an 8-week thorax correction exercise program on flexed
postures and chest functions. The results illustrated that the thorax correction exercises
were effective in improving the flexed postures and chest expansion ability.</p><p>Thoracic kyphosis was improved by 3.45&#x000b0; in the usual posture and 3.50&#x000b0; in the best posture
after the intervention. A study by Katzman et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, who aimed to improve multiple musculoskeletal impairments in
elderly women with hyperkyphosis, reported that a 12-week complex exercise program including
flexibility and strength exercises of the joints and muscles in the upper and lower
extremities decreased thoracic kyphosis by 6&#x000b0; in the usual posture and 5&#x000b0; in the best
posture. Greendale et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> also aimed to
improve hyperkyphosis and reported improvements of thoracic kyphosis when Hatha yoga was
applied 3 times a week for 24 months. This suggests that exercise methods designed to
improve the symptoms of thoracic kyphosis are conducive to improving the structural
alignment and stiffness of the thorax as well as to correcting thorax position. In the
forward head posture, the experimental group experienced improvements in thoracic kyphosis
of 11.63% in the usual posture and 12.28% in the best posture after the intervention.
Balzini et al.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> explained that increased
hyperkyphosis and forward head postures were the characteristics of flexed postures of
elderly women, and the improvement of forward head posture improved the flexed
positions.</p><p>In addition, a 24.27% improvement in chest expansion, which refers to the mobility of the
rib cage in chest functions, was found. However, VC and FEV1 were not significantly
different between and within groups before and after the intervention. Horie et al.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> measured respiratory function using FVC and
% FVC and reported that the lumbar lordosis angle was more related to vertebral column
alignment than thoracic kyphosis. In the present study, although the thorax improvement
exercise program was not sufficient for improving flow volume, it was deemed effective in
improving mobility of the rib cage.</p><p>The exercise program described in this study was developed to improve the mobility and
stability of the ribs and thorax, focusing on anatomical and kinematic improvements in the
rib cage, where the structural deformity of hyperkyphosis was most prominent. Itoi and
Sinaki<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted a back extensor
muscle strengthening exercise intervention with hyperkyphotic elderly women in which
participants wore a backpack in the prone position, however, this exercise only focused on
strengthening the back extensor muscles. Furthermore, a study by Greendale et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> applied Hatha yoga, consisting of 4
postures, which aimed to strengthen the core and extensor muscles, improve the flexibility
of the muscles around the shoulder and hips, and teach the participants postures. However,
these exercises were not able to elicit a specific effect on thorax correction because they
were not specific to the affected part of the body. In response to this, the present study
implemented a thorax correction exercise program that considered the structural
characteristics of the participants, with a focus on the rib cage.</p><p>There were several limitations associated with the present study. First, it is difficult to
generalize the results because they focus exclusively on women over the age of 65&#x02005;years
living in a single region. In addition, the physical activities of the participants other
than the prescribed 8-week exercise program were not controlled. Therefore, our future work
will focus on expanding this project to males and other regions as well as on incorporating
elderly participants with different types of hyperkyphosis. Furthermore, the application of
a variety of intervention programs should also be studied in future research. Moreover,
dynamic postural analysis and functional performance evaluation, aside from static postures,
need to be included so that the effect of thorax correction exercises can be verified from a
variety of perspectives.</p><p>In summary, the exercise methods developed in the present study can be recommended for
improving the mobility of the rib cage and postures through specialized exercises focused on
thorax posture correction in elderly women with hyperkyphosis.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Kado</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></name><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>MH</given-names></name><name><surname>Karlamangla</surname><given-names>AS</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Hyperkyphotic posture predicts mortality in older
