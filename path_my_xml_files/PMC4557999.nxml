This notion is supported by growing empirical evidence that neuroplasticity&#x02013;the tendency for the nervous system to adapt to environmental challenges presented to it&#x02013;is a fundamental principle of brain organization [<xref rid="pone.0134467.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0134467.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>New appreciation of the importance of neuroplasticity has led to the development of a variety of cognitive training programs&#x02013;activities designed to elicit enhancements in cognitive abilities through intensive, targeted mental exercise. Several such programs have been used in research, with promising results for improving cognitive functioning following training reported in most cases [<xref rid="pone.0134467.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134467.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134467.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0134467.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]; however, other studies have failed to demonstrate such gains [<xref rid="pone.0134467.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134467.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Because cognitive abilities are critical for success at work [<xref rid="pone.0134467.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], school [<xref rid="pone.0134467.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0134467.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and activities of daily living [<xref rid="pone.0134467.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], there is considerable interest in using large-scale approaches to rigorously investigate the efficacy of cognitive intervention strategies.</p><p>The present study enrolled participants via the Internet into either a cognitive training treatment condition or an active control condition. The treatment was the off-the-shelf version of Lumosity, an online cognitive training program, where participants trained on up to 49 tasks that were presented in game-like formats. Specific tasks within the program were designed to target particular cognitive abilities, such as speed of processing, working memory, divided attention, response inhibition, and fluid reasoning. Training tasks challenged users to operate close to their performance thresholds. A wide variety of tasks were used in training, reducing the opportunity for use of task-specific strategies. This variety increased the opportunity for &#x0201c;learning to learn,&#x0201d; which may enhance transfer to untrained tasks [<xref rid="pone.0134467.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Previous studies using this program have demonstrated improvements in cognition in children with Turner&#x02019;s Syndrome [<xref rid="pone.0134467.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]; pediatric cancer survivors [<xref rid="pone.0134467.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]; healthy middle-aged adults [<xref rid="pone.0134467.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]; healthy older adults [<xref rid="pone.0134467.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]; older adults with mild cognitive impairment [<xref rid="pone.0134467.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]; and adult survivors of breast cancer [<xref rid="pone.0134467.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>The active control group in this study engaged in solving crossword puzzles. This activity was chosen because crossword puzzles constitute a challenging mental activity that is popularly believed to be beneficial for cognition [<xref rid="pone.0134467.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Some health professionals specifically advocate the use of crossword puzzles for sharpening mental skills [<xref rid="pone.0134467.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. While there is relatively little experimental evidence supporting the efficacy of crossword puzzles, one observational study has linked regular engagement with crossword puzzles to a delay in the onset of memory decline in older adults [<xref rid="pone.0134467.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>The goal of this study was to measure the efficacy of a targeted, progressively challenging, comprehensive cognitive training program against a plausibly beneficial active control condition in a large, randomized trial. We hypothesized that this type of cognitive training would show greater transfer to a range of underlying cognitive abilities than the active control, as measured by a broad battery of neuropsychological assessments and participant-reported outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Participants provided informed consent by clicking a dialogue box on a digital consent form prior to participation in the study.

Based on the ongoing study completion rate, recruitment ended when it was estimated that the number of participants enrolled in the study would be sufficient to obtain 5,000 fully evaluable participants.</p><p>In total, 11,470 individuals consented to take part in the study and completed a baseline (pre-test) assessment battery. The first participant was randomized on April 27, 2013, and the final participant completed the post-test on April 28, 2014. Participants were assigned a treatment condition using a random number generator with equal probabilities of assignment to cognitive training and crosswords control conditions. Random assignment occurred after the pre-test. Participants with age falling outside the target range of 18&#x02013;80 were excluded prior to randomization (N = 1,272). An additional 279 participants were excluded because a computer error delayed their randomization into a treatment condition by more than 24 hours, allowing these participants to continue with the Lumosity program in the free user state. Of the remaining 9,919 participants randomized into a treatment condition, 5,045 (50.9%) completed the post-study assessment battery (post-test). The training platform was designed to direct each participant, upon logging in each day, to either cognitive training or crossword puzzles based on his or her group assignment. However, in some cases participants in the crossword control group were able to access cognitive training. As a result, 330 control participants were removed from the primary analysis because they accessed the cognitive training program during the study period (<xref rid="pone.0134467.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).

The crossword puzzles were produced by professional crossword constructors and presented in a web-based crosswords platform. Constructors were asked to create crosswords that were of medium difficulty, approximately equivalent to a Thursday New York Times crossword puzzle (note: the New York Times puzzles increase in difficulty throughout the week, culminating with the most difficult puzzle on Saturday). Participants filled out the puzzles by typing the answers in the appropriate boxes. Feedback about correct and incorrect responses was given immediately following submission of a completed crossword.

Participants were directed to take the post-test 70 days later, one day following the end of the treatment or control.</p><sec id="sec016"><title>Neuropsychological assessment battery</title><p>Seven neuropsychological assessments were used in this study. (1) Forward and (2) Reverse Memory Span assessed visual short-term and working memory, respectively, and are based on the Corsi Blocks tasks [<xref rid="pone.0134467.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. These assessments required participants to recall a sequence of randomized spatial locations in either forward or reverse order. (3) Grammatical Reasoning was based on Baddeley&#x02019;s Grammatical Reasoning Test [<xref rid="pone.0134467.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], designed to assess cognitive flexibility and reasoning, and required participants to rapidly and accurately evaluate potentially confusing grammatical statements. (4) Progressive Matrices was based on established matrix reasoning assessments [<xref rid="pone.0134467.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and was designed to assess problem solving and fluid reasoning. (5) Go/No-Go was designed to assess response inhibition and processing speed, and required participants to respond as quickly as possible to a target stimulus while avoiding responding to distractors. (6) Arithmetic Reasoning was designed to assess numerical problem solving ability and required the participant to respond as quickly and accurately as possible to arithmetic problems written in words (e.g., &#x0201c;Four plus two =&#x0201d;) [<xref rid="pone.0134467.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. (7) Two-Target Search was created for the purposes of this study. This task was designed to measure divided visual attention and required participants to recall the locations of briefly presented target letters while ignoring distractors. See the Supporting Information (<xref rid="pone.0134467.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Appendix</xref>) for more detailed information about the design of these assessments. Importantly, none of the tasks used in the outcome assessment battery were presented during training. Rather, outcome assessments were implemented as measures of transfer to underlying cognitive abilities.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Assessment scaling procedure</title><p>Our assessment scaling procedure follows standard rank-based normalization approaches used in well-established IQ tests [<xref rid="pone.0134467.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134467.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Normalization tables were created based on the pre-test data from participants who completed both the pre- and post-tests, including control participants who completed some amount of cognitive training during the study period. Norms were generated in 5-year age bins and tables were created within each age bin for each assessment. These normalization tables were created by taking the empirically observed percentile rank for each raw score and finding the value corresponding to that percentile from a normal distribution with a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15 (i.e., percentile rank normalization). For the Two-Target Search and Go/No-Go assessments, where the relevant raw score was presentation time or reaction time, raw scores were reverse coded before being subjected to the normalization procedure. The resulting normalized scores compared a participant&#x02019;s score to all other participants within his or her age bin, with higher scores corresponding to better performance on that assessment. The Grand Index score was calculated based on the sum of a participant&#x02019;s normalized scores on all assessments. This sum was then transformed using the same percentile rank normalization procedure described above.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Participant-reported outcomes</title><p>Participants also completed a survey including nine questions related to specific cognitive failures [<xref rid="pone.0134467.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and successes as well as emotional status. Participants took the survey immediately after completing the neuropsychological test battery, once before beginning the study period (pre-test) and once upon completion of the study (post-test).</p><p>The survey included four questions related to a participant&#x02019;s self-reported cognitive performance over the past month and an additional five questions related to a participant&#x02019;s cognitive performance and emotional status over the past week. Responses to the first group of four questions rated frequency of cognitive ability or impairment, whereas the second group of five questions rated agreement or disagreement with statements about participants&#x02019; cognition or emotion. (Note: some participants were also given an additional question regarding whether they &#x0201c;felt benefits from cognitive training&#x0201d;. Because this question did not apply equally to the treatment and control groups, and was not included in the original protocol, it was removed from the analysis. For completeness, responses to this question are included along with the rest of the study data in the attached <xref rid="pone.0134467.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Dataset</xref>).

The results presented here extend previous findings by demonstrating that a cognitive training program targeting a variety of cognitive capacities with different exercises can be more effective than crossword puzzles at improving a broad range of cognitive abilities.</p><p>After 10 weeks of training, participants receiving the cognitive training treatment improved more than those receiving crossword puzzles on Forward and Reverse Memory Span (measures of visual short term and working memory, respectively), Progressive Matrices (a measure of fluid reasoning), Go/No-Go (a measure of response inhibition and speed of processing), and Arithmetic Reasoning (a measure of problem solving). In addition, improvement on the overall measure of cognitive function used as the primary outcome measure in this study&#x02013;the Grand Index for the assessment battery&#x02013;was more than twice as large in the cognitive training group as it was in the crossword puzzles control group. Thus, for improving a variety of core cognitive abilities, the treatment used in this trial was more effective than crossword puzzles.</p><p>The Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic> effect size for the between-group differences in the primary outcome measure (the Grand Index) was 0.255. Another approach to appreciating the magnitude of these results is to contextualize them in the distribution of scores on the outcome measures. We observe that participants in the training group improve by 2.77 points more than those in the crosswords group, after correcting for the pre-test score in our ANCOVA model. Given that the scores are scaled on a 100 mean &#x000b1; 15 sd scale, we can evaluate how far an average participant would move within the population distribution (for their age) based on moving a given number of points. In this case, 2.77 points is the equivalent of moving from the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile of the distribution to the 57<sup>th</sup> percentile. This is a potentially meaningful move within the distribution.</p><p>A significant group-by-active-days interaction was observed in this study, such that an additional active day engaging with the cognitive training intervention was related to larger gains on the cognitive battery composite score compared to an additional active day engaging with crossword puzzles (<xref rid="pone.0134467.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). This suggests that additional training could lead to larger gains. While it is unlikely that the linear relation holds indefinitely (i.e., the function likely decelerates at some point), future work will be necessary to ascertain how much total improvement is possible over longer training periods.</p><p>In addition to the enhanced performance observed in the cognitive training group on the neuropsychological measures of cognitive function, participants in this group also self-reported experiencing benefits that were significantly greater than those reported by participants in the active control. These participant-reported improvements were particularly strong on questions related to the ability to concentrate. These results suggest that participants in the treatment group experienced benefits from the training in their everyday lives.</p><p>Crossword puzzles were chosen as the active control because they are commonly believed to be a cognitively stimulating activity that is good for brain health [<xref rid="pone.0134467.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134467.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This is important because it has been suggested that belief in the efficacy of a training intervention could affect effort and performance on testing outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0134467.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>While not as large as the gains seen in the treatment group, participants in the crosswords control group also showed improvements in cognitive performance. Without a no-contact control group in this study, it is not possible to conclusively determine whether these improvements in the active control condition were due to practice effects, placebo effects, real treatment effects, or some combination of these. Further study will be needed to better understand the benefits of crossword puzzles for maintenance and enhancement of cognition. It is worth noting that participants in the crosswords group improved slightly more than the cognitive training group on a measure of grammatical reasoning. It would not be unreasonable to imagine that intense, concerted word finding training might enhance one&#x02019;s performance on a linguistic task.</p><p>There are several reasons why the treatment program might have outperformed crossword puzzles in enhancing cognitive function. First, the cognitive training program is specifically <italic>targeted</italic> to core cognitive functions. This distinguishes the treatment from crossword puzzles, which are not designed with the goal of cognitive enhancement. Another central feature of the cognitive training program studied here is that it is <italic>progressively challenging</italic>&#x02013;that is, many of the tasks explicitly increase in difficulty as the individual improves, while others encourage the individual to perform at threshold by rewarding increasingly faster and more accurate performance (see <xref rid="pone.0134467.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref>). This follows a long-established tenet in the psychological literature, that learning conditions are optimized when the task is challenging, but not prohibitively difficult [<xref rid="pone.0134467.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0134467.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Task variety and novelty are also potentially important. In the case of crossword puzzles, participants are primarily involved in vocabulary retrieval, challenging a more limited set of neural pathways. In the cognitive training program studied here, participants are challenged to engage with a variety of cognitive tasks that challenge different neural processing systems and do so in different ways. This variety limits the opportunity to solve the tasks with a single task-specific strategy, thus encouraging the learning of new strategies and the development of new neural connections.</p><p>We noted that there have been several studies that have reported not finding benefits from cognitive training. The only other similarly powered study that did not find positive results is a 2010 study that recruited 11,430 participants through a BBC television show and collected data online [<xref rid="pone.0134467.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The authors concluded that brain training had no measureable benefits. Several key aspects of that study differ from the one presented here. First, neither of the two treatment conditions they used had been studied empirically prior to that experiment. As we demonstrate in this study, not all cognitively stimulating activities are equally effective for enhancing cognition, and it is possible that other programs not examined in their study are more effective. Also, the average amount of training exposure in the BBC study was less than half of that in this study. This is an important distinction as results of this study indicate that amount of training is related to the magnitude of gains in cognitive performance (<xref rid="pone.0134467.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>).</p><p>Our results represent statistically significant improvements in cognitive processes through training. This study included a sufficiently large number of participants and enough training to reliably detect these effects. As has been noted previously [<xref rid="pone.0134467.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], most cognitive training studies that have shown null results have not been powered in such a way that either a positive or a null outcome would be informative, and often include quite short training periods. In the broader context of factors influencing cognitive processes (i.e., a lifetime of experiences), even the 10 weeks of training in this study is a fairly modest amount. Further research will be needed to understand how the current effects extrapolate over much longer training periods.</p><p>In this study, 49.1% of participants randomized into one of the two conditions were lost to follow-up (i.e., did not take the post-test). There was little difference in dropout rates between the two groups, and supplemental analyses (<xref rid="pone.0134467.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>) that equated the engagement characteristics of completers from both groups demonstrated that these differences in dropout between the two groups could not explain the results.</p><p>This study utilized an entirely online design. The online methodology is ecologically valid, since most users in the real world experience the program at home or in some other personal environment outside a laboratory or clinic. In traditional laboratory-based training studies, participants experience considerable contact with study personnel. Contact with study personnel may lead to lower rates of loss to follow up. However, this personal interaction introduces a variable that could affect the results and is not reflective of how most normal, healthy adults use these programs.</p><p>A possible limitation of the current study is that it does not isolate specific mechanisms. For example, adaptive difficulty may play an important role in driving the transfer of training [<xref rid="pone.0134467.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Many of the tasks in the cognitive training program were explicitly adaptive (i.e., difficulty was increased as performance improved), whereas the crossword puzzles were not. The two conditions differed on other dimensions as well. The cognitive training program incorporated a variety of tasks that targeted specific cognitive functions, while the crosswords condition did not. Future research is needed to more fully elucidate the relative contributions of particular components of activities that lead to improvements in cognitive performance.</p><p>Future studies could also extend the cognitive domains tested. Our neuropsychological assessment battery was relatively comprehensive across a variety of domains, but not every possible dimension of cognition was addressed. For example, this battery did not include any assessment explicitly targeting learning (e.g., Hopkins Verbal Learning Test) or complex working memory (e.g., Counting Span).</p><p>Research on training to improve cognitive skills is not complete, and there remain many open questions. The ability to efficiently collect large data sets in controlled experiments over the Internet may prove crucial to answering the open questions related to cognitive training in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec025"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0134467.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>Completed CONSORT 2010 checklist of information to include when reporting a randomized trial.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0134467.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0134467.s002"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>Descriptions of each of the cognitive training tasks used in this study.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0134467.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0134467.s003"><label>S2 Appendix</label><caption><title>A more thorough description of the seven neuropsychological assessments used to measure cognitive performance at pre-test and post-test.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0134467.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0134467.s004"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><title>The study data for the statistical comparisons of outcomes for cognitive training relative to crosswords.</title><p>(CSV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0134467.s004.csv"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0134467.s005"><label>S2 Dataset</label><caption><title>A description of the data columns in <xref rid="pone.0134467.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Dataset</xref>.</title><p>(CSV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0134467.s005.csv"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0134467.s006"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Additional Analyses.</title><p>The first supplementary analysis is an ANCOVA analysis that includes participants assigned to the control group who engaged in some cognitive training during the study period.
