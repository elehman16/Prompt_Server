High levels of the gaseous pollutant ozone are associated with elevated temperatures. Ozone has been associated with respiratory diseases as well as cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and can reduce lung function and alter systemic markers of fibrinolysis. The interaction between ozone and temperature is unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Sixteen healthy volunteers were exposed in a randomized crossover study to 0.3 ppm ozone and clean air for 2 hr at moderate (22&#x000b0;C) temperature and again at an elevated temperature (32.5&#x000b0;C). In each case lung function was performed and blood taken before and immediately after exposure and the next morning.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Ozone exposure at 22&#x000b0;C resulted in a decrease in markers of fibrinolysis the next day. There was a 51.8% net decrease in PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1), a 12.1% net decrease in plasminogen, and a 17.8% net increase in <sc>D</sc>-dimer. These significantly differed from the response at 32.5&#x000b0;C, where there was a 44.9% (<italic>p</italic> = 0.002) and a 27.9% (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001) increase in PAI-1 and plasminogen, respectively, and a 12.5% (<italic>p</italic> = 0.042) decrease in <sc>D</sc>-dimer. In contrast, decrements in lung function following ozone exposure were comparable at both moderate and elevated temperatures (forced expiratory volume in 1 sec, &#x02013;12.4% vs. &#x02013;7.5%, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). No changes in systemic markers of inflammation were observed for either temperature.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Ozone-induced systemic but not respiratory effects varied according to temperature. Our study suggests that at moderate temperature ozone may activate the fibrinolytic pathway, while at elevated temperature ozone may impair it. These findings provide a biological basis for the interaction between temperature and ozone on mortality observed in some epidemiologic studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Citation:</title><p>Kahle JJ, Neas LM, Devlin RB, Case MW, Schmitt MT, Madden MC, Diaz-Sanchez D. 2015.

Even so, millions of people in the United States still live in counties that do not meet air quality standards for one or more pollutants (<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">American Lung Association 2013</xref>). Ground-level ozone, one of the main culprits, has been shown to be associated with adverse pulmonary effects such as worsening or promoting asthma [<xref rid="r58" ref-type="bibr">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 2013</xref>]. More recently, associations between long-term ozone exposure and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality have been reported (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">Forbes et al. 2009</xref>).</p><p>Ozone is more likely to reach unhealthy levels in urban environments when the weather is dry and hot (<xref rid="r58" ref-type="bibr">U.S. EPA 2013</xref>). Over the last century, global temperatures have risen and are projected to continue to rise and cause changes in weather and climate. As a consequence, more frequent and severe heat waves have been forecast. However, despite almost 30 years of research into the effects of ozone, until recently there have been very few studies of the interaction between ozone and temperature on human health. These recent epidemiologic studies have suggested that ozone may modify the associations between temperature and cardiovascular mortality (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">Dear et al. 2005</xref>; <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">Filleul et al. 2006</xref>; <xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">Pattenden et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">Ren et al. 2008</xref>, <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). To understand the public health impact of climate change, we need to understand how physiological responses to elevated temperature are affected by the additional stressor of air pollution.</p><p>Controlled human exposure studies of healthy and asthmatic individuals have been critical in demonstrating that ozone can cause decrements in lung function (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">Adams 2003</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">Folinsbee et al. 1988</xref>; <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">Hazucha 1987</xref>; <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">Horstman et al. 1990</xref>; <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">McDonnell et al. 1991</xref>; <xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr">Silverman et al. 1976</xref>) and lung inflammation (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">Devlin et al. 1991</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; <xref rid="r53" ref-type="bibr">Schelegle et al. 1991</xref>). However, nearly all of these studies have been conducted at moderate temperatures (21&#x02013;23&#x000b0;C). Those studies performed at higher temperatures have centered mainly on impairment of exercise performance in athletes and have shown inconsistent effects on lung function (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">Folinsbee et al. 1977</xref>; <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">Foster et al. 2000</xref>; <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">Gibbons and Adams 1984</xref>; <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">Gong et al. 1986</xref>). None of these studies examined nonrespiratory outcomes. Yet it is becoming clear that both ozone and temperature may have systemic and cardiac effects. The biological mechanisms by which ozone affects cardiovascular risk are not clear because ozone reacts rapidly with respiratory tissues and is not thought to be absorbed or transported to extrapulmonary sites. One commonly proposed mechanism is the promotion of systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and alteration of coagulation pathways (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">Brook et al. 2004</xref>). In support of this, in a recent study we demonstrated that controlled exposure to ozone can cause an increase in vascular markers of inflammation and alter markers of fibrinolysis (the physiological breakdown of blood clots) (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">Devlin et al. 2012</xref>). Although other mechanisms such as neurogenic modulation may be involved, here we chose to focus on these systemic pathways because high heat has also been shown to be associated with coagulation activation (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">Bouchama et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">Meyer et al. 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here we report on the first, to our knowledge, controlled human exposure study to test vascular and systemic responses to ozone at an elevated temperature. We show that although changes in lung function following ozone exposure are similar at both moderate and high temperatures, there are significant differences in markers of vascular responses to exposure according to temperature, demonstrating an interaction between heat and ozone on key agents of fibrinolysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p><italic>Study population</italic>. Sixteen (14 males, 2 females) healthy volunteers 21&#x02013;36 years of age participated in the study.

Each individual underwent two identical randomized crossover studies, one at moderate temperature (22&#x000b0;C) and one at elevated temperature (32.5&#x000b0;C). In each pair of exposures the participant was blinded to the exposure (clean air or ozone), but we could not blind participants to the temperature. In each case the participant was exposed to 0.3 ppm ozone or clean air for 2 hr; the exposures were separated by at least 1 week (range, 7&#x02013;441 days) within each temperature exposure; and the elevated temperature exposure began a minimum of 8 weeks (range, 57&#x02013;484 days) after completion of the moderate temperature exposure pair.</p><p>Thus each participant received a total of two clean air and two ozone exposures. At each temperature, the order of the clean air and ozone exposures was randomized and counterbalanced so that half of the test participants first received ozone and the rest first received clean air. To improve safety monitoring, the temperature at which they received exposures was not randomized. Participants had to complete both exposures at moderate temperature with no adverse effects before they were permitted to continue the study and repeat the procedures at the higher temperature. All participants completed the entire study, and no adverse events were reported. All exposures began at the same time in the morning to avoid having circadian fluctuations as a confounding effect.</p><p>Exposures were performed as previously described (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">Devlin et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">Hernandez et al. 2010</xref>). Briefly, all exposures were conducted at the U.S. EPA Human Studies Facility on the campus of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. The chamber was maintained at 40% relative humidity for all exposures. Ozone was generated by a silent electric discharge method (model 502; Meckenheim, Bonn, Germany) and did not deviate beyond 0.001 ppm of the target concentration (0.3 ppm). Clean air was filtered conditioned air that had no detectable levels of ozone, particles, or other pollutants. Temperature was maintained within 0.3&#x000b0;C of the target temperature. Because the aim of the study was to represent pollutant exposure during a heat wave, we performed exposures only when the previous day&#x02019;s mean ambient temperature was &#x0003c; 24&#x000b0;C in Chapel Hill.</p><p><italic>Study protocol and measurements</italic>. Each participant underwent an exposure to either clean air or ozone (0.3 ppm) for 2 hr while performing alternating periods of 15-min intermittent exercise and 15 min of rest. During the exercise, minute ventilation was measured, and bike wattage was adjusted to maintain a constant rate of VE<sub>min</sub> = 25 L/min/body surface area (BSA). Spirometry as well as safety end points (symptom questionnaire, breath sounds, and vital signs) were assessed before and immediately after each exposure, and again the next morning, 24 hr after the exposure started; there were no significant changes in safety end points between the different exposures. Spirometry (FVC, FEV<sub>1</sub>) was performed according to American Thoracic Society guidelines (<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">Miller et al. 2005</xref>) using a Sensormedics Vmax 220 instrument and software (Sensormedics Corp., Yorba Linda, CA) as previously reported (<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al. 2011</xref>).</p><p>Venous blood was drawn before the exposure and again 1 hr after the exposure ended (post). The participant returned the following day for the final blood draw 24 hr after the exposure started (follow-up). Cytokines and coagulation and fibrinolytic blood markers were measured using the MesoScale Discovery, multiplex platform (Gaithersburg, MD). The cytokines interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) &#x003b1; were measured using the Human Proinflammatory Panel II kit. C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured using the Human CRP kit and all other assays [<sc>D</sc>-dimer, tPA (tissue plasminogen activator), vWF (Von Willebrand factor), and plasminogen] were measured using established Multiarray plates per manufacturers&#x02019; instructions. A differential blood count and blood lipid panel were performed by LabCorp (Burlington, NC).</p><p><italic>Statistical analysis</italic>. To account for intra- and interindividual heterogeneity and thereby minimize confounder effects, end points measured at 1 hr (post) and 24 hr (follow-up) following exposure were divided by preexposure values and expressed as percent of the baseline (preexposure) (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">Devlin et al. 2012</xref>). A <italic>p</italic>-value of &#x02264; 0.05 was considered significant. Random mixed-effects models with random participant intercepts for each of the 16 participants were parameterized to estimate directly the contrasts between clean air and ozone within temperature strata. A &#x0201c;day of study&#x0201d; (DOS) factor was added to disentangle temperature and period because the temperature was not randomized. The DOS was calculated for each participant for each exposure with clean air at 22&#x000b0;C set as day 0. Because the order within each exposure pair was randomized, the range of DOS for ozone at 22&#x000b0;C was from 63 days before clean air to 441 days after clean air (&#x02013;63, 441). The shortest time to complete all four exposures was 93 days and the longest was 526 days. The principal outcome variable was the percent change in outcome of interest between the sample obtained before exposure and the sample obtained 1 or 24 hr later. The random mixed-effects models were fit using R i386 version 3.0.1 with the lme4 package version 0.999999&#x02013;2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org/foundation/">http://www.r-project.org/foundation/</ext-link>). The CHALLENGE.R code and data used to generate the tables and figures are available on request.

The effect of ozone on vascular markers of fibrinolysis varied according to the temperature. <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref> shows the 24-hr/preexposure changes in coagulation and fibrinolysis markers for clean air and ozone exposure under the two temperature conditions.

Consistent with our previous report (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">Devlin et al. 2012</xref>), ozone at moderate (22&#x000b0;C) temperature caused a significant decrease in values of both PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) (&#x02013;51.8%; 95% CI: &#x02013;90.8, &#x02013;12.7) and plasminogen (&#x02013;12.1%; 95% CI: &#x02013;22.3, &#x02013;1.8) 24 hr after exposure compared with preexposure. In contrast, at the elevated (32.5&#x000b0;C) temperature, there was a statistically significant rise in both of these markers (PAI-1, 44.9% increase; 95% CI: 5.9, 83.9, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002; plasminogen, 27.9% increase; 95% CI: 17.1, 38.2, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001). Correspondingly there was a highly significant interaction between temperature and ozone for both PAI-1 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.002) and plasminogen (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001) in our model.

Here, we chose to perform a controlled human exposure study because it can safely provide direct evidence of mechanistically relevant biological changes without the confounders inherent in epidemiologic studies (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">Buckley et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">Rom et al. 2013</xref>). By exposing the same person to both clean air and ozone at a moderate and a high temperature we provide the first direct evidence of an interaction between ozone and temperature that results in changes in the fibrinolysis pathway. We show the ability of ozone at an elevated temperature to affect factors that are involved in preventing blood clots growing and causing thrombosis.</p><p>A sudden increase in ambient temperatures has been associated with increased mortality in multiple epidemiology studies (reviewed by <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">Basu 2009</xref>), particularly in cardiovascular disease and respiratory mortality. For example <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">Basu and Malig (2011)</xref> found a 4% (95% CI: 3.4%, 5.2%) increase in cardiovascular mortality associated with a 5.6% increase in mean daily apparent temperature in California. This mortality can occur even at moderate temperatures; it appears it is not the absolute temperature but the degree of change that is important (<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">N&#x000e4;yh&#x000e4; 2007</xref>). Similarly, multiple studies have shown associations between ozone and daily mortality (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">Bell et al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">Ito et al. 2005</xref>), and several have used multicity comparisons and established positive associations between short-term ozone exposure and cardiovascular mortality (<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">Katsouyanni et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="r55" ref-type="bibr">Stafoggia et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="r60" ref-type="bibr">Zanobetti and Schwartz 2008</xref>). Furthermore, several studies of population-based data have also demonstrated a correlation between ozone and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, including ischemic stroke and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">Henrotin et al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">Raza et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">Rosenthal et al. 2013</xref>).</p><p>Epidemiology studies assessing the ozone&#x02013;temperature&#x02013;cardiac relationship have generally proven problematic because high-ozone days normally occur during hot weather. In addition, the strength of the correlation of ozone with other pollutants such as particulate matter is seasonal and may be temperature dependent. Traditional methods have not proven suitable to discriminate between the effects of ozone and temperature, let alone their interaction. Those that have studied the relationship have produced conflicting results, often because they have treated ozone as a confounder (<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">Reid et al. 2012</xref>). When ozone and temperature were treated as co-exposures, researchers have sometimes shown a negative association between temperature and ozone&#x02013;mortality (<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">Katsouyanni et al. 2009</xref>) that may be ascribed to the increased use of air conditioning during hot weather. Recent studies, however, have used novel approaches to determine whether there are joint or interactive effects of ozone and temperature. <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">Ren et al. (2009)</xref> examined whether ozone modified the associations between temperature and cardiovascular mortality in 95 large communities in the United States during the summers between 1987 and 2000. They found that a 10&#x000b0;C increase in temperature on the same day was associated with an increase in mortality by 1.17% and 8.31% for the lowest and highest levels of ozone concentrations in all communities, respectively (<xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">Ren et al. 2009</xref>). <xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">Reid et al. (2012)</xref> have applied directed acyclic graphs and concluded that ozone is a causal intermediate that is affected by temperature and that can also affect mortality, rather than a confounder. <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">Burkart et al. (2013)</xref>, using various Posisson regression models, showed interactive effects between air pollution and temperature in Berlin, Germany, and Lisbon, Portugal, that were positively associated with increased excess mortality.</p><p>The physiological mechanisms by which either heat or ozone affect cardiovascular events are still not well elucidated. Although multiple mechanisms may be involved, including localized lung inflammation without systemic inflammation or neurogenic modulation, in this study we focused on the role of systemic inflammation and a subsequent disruption of fibrinolysis pathways because both heat and ozone can alter coagulation (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">Bouchama et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">Meyer et al. 2013</xref>). Endothelium disruption and increased risk of thrombosis has been suggested as a mechanism by which high temperature increases cardiovascular mortality (<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">N&#x000e4;yh&#x000e4; 2005</xref>). Heat stress highly activates fibrinolysis and increases levels of <sc>D</sc>-dimer and decreases levels of plasminogen (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">Bouchama and Knochel 2002</xref>). In this study, although participants were closely monitored so that heat stress did not occur, we believe a similar process is occurring. Consistent with this, our previous complementary time-series panel study looked at the effect of temperature decreases on these markers (<xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr">Sch&#x000e4;uble et al. 2012</xref>). We observed that a drop in temperature of 5&#x000b0;C was associated with a significant increase in fibrinogen and PAI-1. Ozone has also been suggested to cause systemic inflammation secondary to lung injury. Multiple epidemiologic studies have examined associations between ozone concentrations and markers of coagulation and inflammation (<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">Chuang et al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">Liao et al. 2005</xref>; <xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">Rudez et al. 2009</xref>). The results from these studies have been inconsistent and have depended on the health of the study population, their ages, and the approach of the authors in disentangling ozone effects from that of other pollutants. Using a controlled human study design to minimize these confounders, we have previously reported that ozone exposure can cause an increase in systemic inflammation, as evidenced by IL-1&#x003b2; and CRP (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">Devlin et al. 2012</xref>). Here, although both markers were also elevated, the very large heterogeneity in responses in this study did not permit us to detect any significant changes with our smaller number; however, an increase in the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 postexposure was observed.</p><p>Although we cannot rule out the possibility that our observations are a result of chance given our multiple comparisions, in both the previous study and here we observed changes consistent with modulation of the fibrinolytic pathway 24 hr after ozone exposure. Plasminogen is the substrate for plasmin, which breaks down fibrin clots. Plasminogen is converted to plasmin by tPA, which is in turn inhibited by PAI-1. A consequence of this process is the formation of fibrin degradation products, of which <sc>D</sc>-dimer is the most studied. At moderate temperature, the decrease in PAI-1, the parallel decrease in plasminogen and the increase in <sc>D</sc>-dimer observed are all consistent with activation of fibrinolysis. However, at elevated temperature exactly the opposite response was observed: an increase in PAI-1 and a concomitant increase in plasminogen and decrease in <sc>D</sc>-dimer. Although we did not observe significant changes in tPA, it is normally released into the blood very slowly by damaged endothelium over several days, so 24 hr may be too early to detect differences. In normal conditions, excessive fibrinolysis is prevented by PAI-1 which is an acute phase reactant protein. We hypothesize that the effect of the combined stimulation of the fibrinolytic pathway by both ozone and heat results in the triggering of this compensatory mechanism and the overproduction of PAI-1. The fibrinolytic pathway is complex and the clinical consequence of the disruption is hard to predict. While this may have no symptomatic importance in healthy individuals, in susceptible populations this reduction in the ability to dissolve clots may result in clinically significant outcomes.</p><p>The ability of ozone to impair lung function has been noted in numerous studies. Here we confirmed those findings but saw no difference in lung function changes between moderate and high temperatures. Earlier studies have reported different results depending on the concentration of ozone, level of exercise, the humidity and the population studied. Our study is in agreement with <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">Foster et al. (2000)</xref>, who found no difference in FEV<sub>1</sub> responses to 0.5 ppm ozone between 25 and 31&#x000b0;C. <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">Folinsbee et al. (1977)</xref>, also at 0.5 ppm ozone, examined pulmonary function at different temperatures and found that the greatest decrease in FVC occurred at the highest temperature (33&#x000b0;C). However, in that study the participants were exercising vigorously under high humidity. <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">Gibbons and Adams (1984)</xref>, at the same concentration of ozone (0.3 ppm) used in this study, reported a non-statistically significant trend towards an ozone&#x02013;temperature interaction in regards to FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC. Epidemiology studies have equally been nondefinitive with few studies showing an interaction of temperature and ozone for lung function; those that have appear to indicate that elevated temperature may result in improved children&#x02019;s respiratory health perhaps because of behavioral modifications (<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. 2012</xref>).</p><p>This study has several limitations. Although the order in which participants received ozone or air was randomized, as a safety precaution exposures at lower temperatures always preceded those at higher temperatures. It is possible that there is an order effect although this has not been noted in previous studies and ozone effects do not persist after 48 hr (<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">McDonnell et al. 1997</xref>). We adjusted for the period within the constraints of the experimental design by using a DOS factor, which was possible because of variation between participants for the length of time between exposures; although this DOS factor does not eliminate the period effect, we believe that it improves the model. However, now that we have completed this study without adverse events, future studies should randomize temperature. Again, for safety reasons, young healthy participants were chosen as the study population. However, epidemiologic studies suggest that the vulnerable subpopulations to heat-related mortality are those with specific cardiovascular diseases, children, and the elderly (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">Basu 2009</xref>). Similarly, studies suggest that our population is at little or no risk to the cardiovascular effects of air pollutants (<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">Pope 2000</xref>). The level of ozone used here (0.3 ppm) is comparable with that used in many previous controlled human exposure studies. Nevertheless, improvements in air quality over the last decades means that this level is no longer reached in cities in the United States, although peak hourly concentrations in heavily polluted cities such as Beijing can approximate them (<xref rid="r59" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al. 2008</xref>). The amount of ozone that our participants received in 2 hr is equivalent to 8 hr at the current U.S. EPA NAAQS (National Ambient Air Quality Standards) 8-hr ozone standard of 0.076 ppm (<xref rid="r57" ref-type="bibr">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2008</xref>). Future studies will be performed at lower levels to confirm there is no high-dose effect.</p><p>Exposures at elevated temperatures were not performed when the previous day&#x02019;s mean ambient temperature was &#x0003e; 24&#x000b0;C. No acclimatization was therefore allowed, to approximate the conditions during a heat wave. Several studies have shown that morbidity and mortality are maximal when the temperature is 5&#x000b0;C above the mean for 3 consecutive days (<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">Gasparrini and Armstrong 2011</xref>). Our study design does not mimic this scenario, and the responses we found are likely more muted that those in the real world. The aim of these studies however, is not to induce clinical effects but rather to observe physiological effects that are benign and transient in our study individuals, but when extrapolated to the population level could have clinical consequences in susceptible groups such as those with cardiac or respiratory diseases.</p><p>In conclusion, our results suggest that ozone at moderate temperatures activates fibrinolysis, whereas at elevated temperature it may impair this pathway. Extrapolated to the population level, this reduction in the efficiency of preventing clot formation and clearance may represent a risk in certain susceptible individuals such as those at risk for thrombosis. These results provide biological plausibility for increased risk from ozone-induced mortality at high temperatures.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the nurses, physicians, and technical staff of the Human Studies Facility at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for their invaluable medical and technical assistance.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>The research described in this article has been reviewed by the National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, U.S. EPA, and approved for publication.
