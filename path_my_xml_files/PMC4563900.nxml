The objective of this study was to inform the decision whether to proceed to a definitive randomised trial of IUT compared to clinical assessment with non-invasive tests, prior to surgery in women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI) or stress-predominant mixed urinary incontinence (MUI).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A mixed methods study comprising a pragmatic multicentre randomised pilot trial, a qualitative face-to face interview study with patients eligible for the trial, an exploratory economic evaluation including value of information study, a survey of clinicians&#x02019; views about IUT, and qualitative telephone interviews with purposively sampled survey respondents. Only the first and second of these elements are reported here.</p><p>Trial participants were randomised to either clinical assessment with non-invasive tests (control arm) or clinical assessment with non-invasive tests plus IUT (intervention arm).</p><p>The main outcome measures of these feasibility studies were confirmation that units can identify and recruit eligible women, acceptability of investigation strategies and data collection tools, and acquisition of outcome data to determine the sample size for a definitive trial. The primary outcome proposed for a definitive trial was ICIQ-FLUTS (total score) 6 months after surgery or the start of nonsurgical treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 284 eligible women, 222 (78 %) were recruited, 165/219 (75 %) returned questionnaires at baseline, and 125/200 returned them (63 %) at follow-up. Most women underwent surgery; management plans were changed in 19 (19 %) participants following IUT.</p><p>Participants interviewed were positive about the trial and the associated documentation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>All elements of a definitive trial were rehearsed. Such a trial would require between 232 and 922 participants, depending on the target difference in the primary outcome. We identified possible modifications to our protocol for application in a definitive trial including clarity over inclusion/exclusions, screening processes, reduction in secondary outcomes, and modification to patient questionnaire booklets and bladder diaries. A definitive trial of IUT <italic>versus</italic> clinical assessment prior to surgery for SUI or stress predominant MUI is feasible and remains relevant.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN71327395">ISRCTN 71327395</ext-link>, registered 7 June 2010.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>feasibility studies</kwd><kwd>pilot studies</kwd><kwd>interview studies</kwd><kwd>randomised controlled trial</kwd><kwd>stress urinary incontinence</kwd><kwd>urodynamics</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Urinary incontinence (UI), whilst rarely life-threatening, may seriously influence the physical, psychological and social wellbeing of affected individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The impact on families and carers may be profound and the resource implications for health services considerable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Prevalence figures for UI range from 5 % to 69 % in women 15 years and older, with most studies showing prevalence in the range 25 to 45 % [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]; stress (SUI) or mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) account for 65&#x02013;85 % of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Several methods are used in the assessment of UI to guide management decisions; some of these are non-invasive (for example, urine culture, bladder diaries or frequency volume charts, urine flow rate and post-void residual volume measurement), and some are invasive (that is, require catheterisation). Cystometry, the most commonly used invasive urodynamic test (IUT), looks at the pressure/volume relations during bladder filling, storage and emptying, with a view to defining a functional diagnosis as distinct from a purely symptomatic one.</p><p>The current position of IUT in the diagnostic pathway is not agreed upon, and practices vary considerably; in a UK survey in 2002, only half of the units surveyed had a guideline on indications for the tests, and 85 % carried out cystometry in all women with incontinence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Current guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), however, suggests that cystometry is not required prior to conservative treatments for UI, nor prior to surgery where the diagnosis of SUI is clear on clinical grounds (that is, where there are no symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB) or voiding dysfunction, no anterior compartment prolapse, and no previous surgery for SUI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Changes in available operative techniques, and in particular the introduction of less invasive approaches such as mid-urethral tapes, have resulted in dramatic alterations to surgical practice in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) demonstrated a 50 % increase in surgery for SUI in the 10 years following the introduction of mid-urethral tapes in 1997, with numbers apparently plateauing at 11,000 to 13,000 procedures annually in England between 2006 and 2007 and between 2012 and 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Were the NICE guidance to be applied, the annual savings from more rational use of IUT prior to surgery for SUI, based on 2012/13 national tariff costs (&#x000a3;403 per procedure for Healthcare Resource Group LB42Z) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and HES activity data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], would be approximately &#x000a3;3.3 million. There would also be an additional &#x02018;opportunity cost&#x02019; savings from the alternative use of staff and equipment currently devoted to IUT. On the other hand, it must be recognised that there are increasing concerns about the long-term safety of vaginal mesh implants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], which might argue more in favour of increasing use of investigation to ensure the most rational use of surgery.</p><p>Two trials looking at the clinical utility of urodynamics in women with SUI have been published recently, both using a non-inferiority design. The VUSIS-1 trial from the Netherlands was terminated prematurely due to slow recruitment after achieving only 23 % (59/260) of its planned accrual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In view of the recruitment difficulties with VUSIS-1, the group proceeded to a further study of alternative design, (VUSIS-2) in which all women underwent IUT, and only those with discordant clinical and urodynamic findings were randomised between surgical treatment (as dictated by their clinical assessment) and individualized treatment (dictated by the combination of clinical and urodynamic results); neither participants nor healthcare professionals involved were blinded to the urodynamic results in either group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>The ValUE trial from the USA defined a non-inferiority margin of 11 % [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]; this is equivalent to a standardised difference of &#x0003c;0.8, which may be considered high in statistical terms. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] A difference in outcome between groups of 11 % may also be considered important in clinical terms, potentially influencing the decisions of both clinicians and patients. Notwithstanding these limitations, both studies reported that, in women with uncomplicated SUI, treatment (usually an immediate mid-urethral sling operation) based on basic clinical evaluation is not inferior to individually tailored treatment based on urodynamic findings.</p><p>Each of these studies was published during the period of recruitment and follow-up in INVESTIGATE-I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. How much they have already influenced clinical opinion and practice, or will do so in the future, is unclear, although a &#x02018;point-counterpoint&#x02019; debate published after these studies makes it clear that there is still a question to be answered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The most recent update of the Cochrane review of urodynamics for the management of urinary incontinence in children and adults included the data from these two trials, yet continued to emphasise the need for larger definitive trials, in which people are randomly allocated to management according to urodynamic findings or to standard management based on history and clinical examination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In addition to NICE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and the Cochrane Collaboration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], the National Institute for Health Research - Health Technology Assessment programme (NIHR-HTA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and the International Consultations on Incontinence (ICI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] have also reviewed research literature on urodynamics, and, along with the James Lind Alliance Urinary Incontinence Priority Setting Partnership [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], have called for high quality primary research assessing their clinical utility.</p><p>But several considerations indicated the need for a pilot trial and feasibility assessment before undertaking a definitive trial. The first consideration is the calculation of an informed sample size. Calculations based on estimates and assumptions from previously published modelling exercises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and a previous surgical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] are sensitive to parameter values such as the proportion of recruits with SUI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], the proportions of poor outcomes in the two arms, and the effect size (target difference) of interest. Calculations based on data in the most recent Cochrane review of urodynamics indicates that a sample size of over 1,600 per arm would be required to address this question [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Therefore, given the possible size and cost of a definitive trial, a pilot trial was considered crucial to test the assumptions made, give relevant estimates of key parameters, and ensure that a definitive trial would represent value for money from public funds. Secondly, a feasibility assessment could establish whether sufficient clinicians are willing to randomise patients within a definitive trial. IUTs have been widely used in clinical practice over the last 30 years, and despite the lack of evidence of clinical utility, many clinicians look on cystometry as a mandatory part of the investigation of patients with UI, particularly prior to surgical treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. A survey of members of the British Society of Urogynaecology (BSUG) has shown a high level of disagreement with the NICE guidance in this respect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and others have questioned the safety of the recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Finally, a key feasibility objective was to assess patient willingness to participate and identify barriers to and facilitators of participation. Patients may not so easily see the importance of &#x02018;testing a test&#x02019; in the same way as they might view testing a treatment. Women may be willing to undergo even invasive investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] in the belief that this will inevitably guide them and their clinicians towards appropriate treatment, and away from inappropriate and possibly harmful interventions. In a pilot patient preference study, only 32 % of the women were prepared to be randomised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p>Recognising that a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) alone was probably inadequate to address the complexities of feasibility for a definitive trial in this aspect of healthcare, the INVESTIGATE-I study comprised an external pilot RCT, an exploratory health economic analysis and value of information study, a national survey of relevant clinicians, and separate qualitative interview studies with patients eligible for the trial and clinicians responding to the survey. Only the first and second of these elements are reported here.</p><p>The original study protocol was published in this journal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]; two later amendments were approved by the Research Ethics Committee, and the final version of the protocol (v1.2) is available on the NIHR website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nets.nihr.ac.uk/projects/hta/0922136">http://www.nets.nihr.ac.uk/projects/hta/0922136</ext-link>.

This report therefore, whilst drawing conclusions from the whole collection of studies, focuses on the pilot trial itself, and the qualitative interview study with trial participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The conduct of this study was in accordance with the ethical principles set out in the Declaration of Helsinki (2008) and the Research Governance Framework for Health and Social Care (second edition, 2005) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].

The study information was discussed at the first hospital visit; women declining to take part underwent further investigation and or treatment as clinically appropriate at the same visit. Written consent was obtained from those agreeing to take part, before randomisation. To ensure concealment of allocation, randomisation was undertaken by an internet-accessed computer randomisation system held by the Newcastle Clinical Trials Unit (NCTU); randomisation between intervention and control was 1:1, and was stratified by centre using random block length.

It was also intended that women who declined randomisation would be interviewed.</p><p>Women were approached at the end of the trial so as to capture both their reasons for agreeing to participate and their overall experience of taking part in the study.

The interviewer prompted as appropriate to ensure that all views were fully explained and the meaning of participants&#x02019; responses clear. The prompt guide was developed from a literature review and discussions within the project team and was modified as the interviews progressed to incorporate issues raised by earlier interviewees.</p><p>Analysis took place alongside data collection, which continued until saturation of themes was reached and interviews no longer generated new concepts.

In terms of the ADePT approach, the problems identified related to aspects of trial process and were therefore classified as Type A - issues likely to be a problem only for a trial, but not in the real world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p>Overall, the logistics and study procedures were seen to be adequate and functional in most areas, and important insights were gained to inform the design and efficient conduct of any future definitive trial. These include the following: allowing a realistic time frame for regulatory approval and site start-up, clarity over inclusion/exclusions, modifying screening processes, reduction in secondary outcomes, modification to patient questionnaire booklets and bladder diaries, and employing a range of strategies to retain trial centre engagement (for example, website, newsletters, recruitment updates).</p><sec id="Sec35"><title>Eligibility, recruitment, consent and randomisation</title><p>We found that 37 % of the women screened were deemed eligible for the trial. This figure varied between centres, as did the declared reasons for ineligibility. More than half of all the women screened were from one centre. It is likely that the assiduousness of recruiters and interpretation of eligibility criteria differed between centres. Running screening training exercises might be considered for a future definitive trial to ensure similar screening standards and practices and an &#x02018;assumed eligibility&#x02019; approach in all centres. This should be feasible, for example, by &#x02018;clustering&#x02019; centres geographically and carrying out training exercises alongside site setup visits; we do not, however, have evidence of the effectiveness of this proposed solution.</p><p>Recruitment was initially slow and was more successful in some centres than others. Recruitment was initially delayed by the fact that ethical and regulatory requirements for a multi-centre study took longer than expected, and any definitive trial should determine and allow a realistic timeframe for this.</p><p>Once approvals were in place, it was necessary to expand the number of planned centres and clinicians within centres to meet recruitment targets; this highlights the need for rigorous and realistic site feasibility assessments prior to site selection and setting and on-going monitoring of individual site targets.</p><p>Whilst there is little high-quality evidence to support their use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], a range of strategies was used to retain trial centre engagement such as regular recruitment updates and newsletters. However we were eventually able to recruit patients from all our study centres in sufficient numbers to confirm that recruitment was feasible.</p><p>Of those women who screened positive, 78 % consented to enter the trial. Data from the patient interviews suggested that most women reacted positively to the invitation to take part, and found the information provided about the study to be clear. There was no clear preference for either the shorter or longer version of the patient information sheet. The principle of random allocation to one of two trial arms was generally well understood by participants. The randomisation procedure led to similar sized groups that were well balanced on baseline variables.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Compliance with and acceptability of intervention</title><p>Most patients received the &#x02018;IUT&#x02019; (91 %) or &#x02018;no IUT&#x02019; group tests (99 %) to which they were allocated. However, two patients withdrew from the trial because they were unhappy to be randomised to the &#x02018;IUT&#x02019; arm, one failed to attend the appointment for IUT, and four other patients in the IUT arm did not undergo invasive tests for unspecified reasons.</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Outcome assessment, selection of most appropriate outcomes and participant retention</title><p>Completion rates were relatively high for all questionnaires, and they had a similar rate and spread of missing items. Rates of loss to follow-up after treatment were significant, however, and whilst 75 % of women had either face-to-face or telephone follow-up (typically at two to three months) after surgical treatment, only 56 % (63 % of those circulated) returned follow-up questionnaires at 6 months.</p><p>It is recognised that the completion of questionnaires can be burdensome for participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>], and this may be particularly the case for those with few or no symptoms. We found some evidence in the patient interview study to suggest that women were less likely to return questionnaires if they were satisfied with the results of their treatment, which may account for the number of blank questionnaires returned at six months.</p><p>In any future definitive trial it would be necessary to ensure a higher questionnaire response rate. The UDI was the fourth instrument in a booklet of six questionnaires in total, and had a slightly lower completion rate at both baseline and 6 months. The questions in ICIQ-UI SF overlap considerably with those in the longer ICIQ-FLUTS and so we recommend omitting both UDI and ICIQ-UI SF from any definitive trial to reduce respondent burden. We anticipate that this may improve completion of the remaining items. Greater emphasis needs to be placed on the importance of returning a completed questionnaire even in the absence of any remaining symptoms. Alternative modes of completion for follow-up questionnaires (for example, telephone or web based) and providing incentives to return questionnaires are further evidence-based strategies that might enhance retention rates for data collection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>].</p><p>Bladder diary data and pad test use were poorly completed in our pilot. This may be because many of the women would have completed similar diaries or frequency/volume charts earlier in their continence assessment, because it may be seen as rather more intrusive than simple questionnaire responses, or because it is possible that the diary design resulted in inconsistent completion of pad-use data. The trial recruitment process enrolled only women with SUI or stress-predominant MUI, the diary data did not show any evidence of abnormal urinary frequency or nocturia, and there appeared to be no change at 6 months in either arm (other than in pad-use). In order to increase the completion rate of incontinence episode data, diary data and pad use might be omitted or modified in any definitive trial.</p><p>Alternative modes of completion for follow-up questionnaires, such as by telephone or online, and the provision of modest incentives to return the questionnaires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] are further evidence-based strategies that might enhance retention rates for data collection. A further possibility is to link questionnaire completion at follow-up to the face-to-face clinic review, thereby allowing a check by a research nurse or trial coordinator of item completion before patients leave the clinic area; however, this would have required a change to the current practice of some units, and risked the pragmatic nature of the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Sample size calculation for a definitive trial</title><p>Sample size estimates were calculated for target differences of 2, 3, and 4 units in ICIQ-FLUTS, using the standard deviation of the primary outcome data from the pilot trial. However, a monograph on ways of specifying a target difference for a trial recommended that estimates of sample size should be determined by more than one approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. In any definitive trial, the following data sources might be amongst those considered:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Clinician opinion</p></list-item><list-item><p>Data from the external pilot trial</p></list-item><list-item><p>A value of information study (not included here, but forming part of a separate report) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p></list-item></list></p><p>A survey update in June 2013 of consultant members of BSUG and BAUS-SFNUU sought their views on what constitutes a minimum clinically significant target difference in ICIQ-FLUTS combined score. However, the ICIQ-FLUTS scale has not been used in many published studies to date, and, perhaps because it is therefore not familiar, only 50 % of consultants responding expressed an opinion. There was no evidence of a common opinion: given a choice of seven ranges of the scale to define a clinically important difference (from 1&#x02013;4 to &#x0003e;24), all these ranges were chosen by at least one clinician, with the modal range being 9 to 12. In separate discussions, members of the study team did not find it easy to choose a target difference based on the limited use of the scale so far. The current lack of data from published trials using ICIQ-FLUTS, and therefore evidence on which to base expert judgement, casts some doubt of the usefulness of a survey of experts in this situation.</p><p>When the pilot trial results became available, it was apparent that the distribution of the ICIQ-FLUTS total score at 6 months and the difference between the scores at baseline and 6 months typically had low values. The mean score (SD) at 6 months in the &#x02018;no-IUT&#x02019; arm was 6.9 (5.0) and the mean change between baseline and 6 months was 9.3 (7.3). It was apparent, therefore, that it is not realistic to expect differences in mean outcomes between trial arms in the order of 9 to 12 units, as proposed in clinician survey responses. Based upon the trial results, the study team decided that differences of 2, 3 or 4 units would be realistic differences that might be achieved in any comparison of an intervention for women eligible for a future trial.</p><p>Given the observed standard deviations, these target differences of 2, 3 or 4 units are equivalent to standardised effect sizes of 0.29, 0.43 and 0.57 when comparing mean changes in score over 6 months. In contrast, a difference of 9 to 12 units would equate to a standardised effect size of 1.5 to 2, which is a very large difference; many trials are planned on a standardised effect size of around 0.5. Cohen has suggested that standardised differences of 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 correspond to &#x02018;small&#x02019;, &#x02019;medium&#x02019; and &#x02018;large&#x02019; effect sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>If a study is planned on the basis of a &#x02018;realistic&#x02019; value for the target difference, then consideration has to be made of whether this is also a &#x02018;clinically important&#x02019; difference. If it is clear that this is not a &#x02018;clinically important&#x02019; difference, then there are real doubts as to whether the trial should take place. It was felt that a difference of around three units would also be of clinical interest since a decrease of this level would equate to complete recovery for one of the symptoms assessed in the ICIQ-FLUTS score.</p><p>In this pilot trial, we identified 771 women for screening from seven centres over the course of 114 centre screening months (approximately 6.8 women/centre/screening month). Extrapolation of these figures would require 120 to 480 centre screening months to achieve the recruitment of 200 to 900 women. This would mean four to 20 centres recruiting for approximately 30 months or six to 30 centres recruiting over 18 months.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec39" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Overall, the pilot trial can be considered a success, and a definitive trial is feasible and remains necessary. The study procedures were seen to be adequate and functional in most areas, and important insights were gained to inform the design and efficient conduct of a future definitive trial.</p><p>Lessons were learned in how to manage the time needed to bring multiple centres online through the UK regulatory process; likely variation in recruitment from the multiple centres has been observed and the importance of standardised and assiduous screening recognised; and effective methods of communication to keep staff engaged through the lifetime of a long study have been rehearsed and refined. Refinements in the data collection process that will improve the quantity and quality of the data for a definitive trial have been identified.</p><p>Although recruitment was initially slow, patients were recruited from all study centres in sufficient numbers to confirm that recruitment is feasible and that women are happy to engage with the study objectives and be randomised. Participants were very positive about the study, and in particular allayed fears over whether research to &#x02018;test a test&#x02019; would be seen as important. The interviews also offered suggestions as to how the experience of participation could be improved and data collection maximised.</p><p>Based upon a range of target differences derived from the observed clinical outcomes in this pilot RCT, any definitive trial may need to recruit between 200 and 900 women. With recruitment rates also based upon the pilot RCT, this would mean four to 20 centres recruiting for approximately 30 months or six to 30 centres recruiting over 18 months.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BAUS-SFNUU</term><def><p>British Association of Urological Surgeons, Section of Female, Neurological, and Urodynamic Urology</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BSUG</term><def><p>British Society of Urogynaecology</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CLRN</term><def><p>Comprehensive Local Research Network</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRF</term><def><p>case report form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DO</term><def><p>Detrusor overactivity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HES</term><def><p>Hospital Episode Statistics</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICER</term><def><p>incremental cost-effectiveness ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICIQ-FLUTS</term><def><p>International Consultation on Incontinence Modular Questionnaires: Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICIQ-LUTSqol</term><def><p>ICIQ Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Quality of Life Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICIQ-UI SF</term><def><p>ICIQ Urinary Incontinence Short Form Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IUT</term><def><p>Invasive Urodynamic Testing</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MUI</term><def><p>mixed urinary incontinence</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NIHR</term><def><p>National Institute for Health Research</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OAB</term><def><p>overactive bladder</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCQ</term><def><p>participant costs questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PFMT</term><def><p>pelvic floor muscle training</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PIL</term><def><p>Patient Information Leaflet</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QALY</term><def><p>quality of life year</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SUI</term><def><p>stress urinary incontinence</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UDI</term><def><p>Urogenital Distress Inventory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UI</term><def><p>urinary incontinence</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors have no current personal financial interests; the following non-financial interests are declared:</p><p>PH: Previous chair of NICE Guideline Development Group (GDG) on urinary incontinence (UI) in women (2004-&#x02019;07); member of faculty of International Consultations on Incontinence - Urodynamics committee (1997&#x02013;&#x02019;99 &#x00026; 2000&#x02013;&#x02019;02); Clinical assessment committee (2003-&#x02019;05); Surgery in women committee (2007&#x02013;&#x02019;09); James Lind Alliance working partnership on research priorities in urinary incontinence (2007-&#x02019;09); previous commercial research funding for trials of surgery for stress incontinence from <italic>Gynecare</italic> (1998&#x02013;2003) and <italic>Gyne Ideas</italic> (now <italic>Mpathy Medical</italic>; 2001&#x02013;&#x02019;03).</p><p>DGT: Has received grant income for investigator-initiated research from <italic>Ethicon</italic>; paid consultancies from <italic>Ethicon</italic> and <italic>Allergan</italic> for teaching and advisory boards; financial support to attend conferences in 2012/13 from <italic>Ethicon</italic> and <italic>Astellas</italic>.
