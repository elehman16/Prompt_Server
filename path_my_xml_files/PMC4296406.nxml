Proton pump inhibitor therapy has been documented to produce more potent inhibition of gastric acid secretion than histamine 2 receptor antagonists. This study aimed to compare extemporaneous preparations of omeprazole, pantoprazole oral suspension and intravenous (IV) pantoprazole on the gastric pH in intensive care unit patients.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>This was a randomized single-blind-study. Patients of &#x02265; 16 years of age with a nasogastric tube, who required mechanical ventilation for &#x02265; 48 h, were eligible for inclusion. The excluded patients were those with active gastrointestinal bleeding, known allergy to omeprazole and pantoprazole and those intolerant to the nasogastric tube. Fifty-six patients were randomized to treatment with omeprazole suspension 2 mg/ml (40 mg every day), pantoprazole suspension 2 mg/ml (40 mg every day) and IV pantoprazole (40 mg every day) for up to 14 days. Gastric aspirates were sampled before and 1-2.5 h after the drug administration for the pH measurement using an external pH meter. Data were analyzed using SPSS (version 21.0).</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>In this study, 56 critically ill-patients (39 male, 17 female, mean age: 61.5 &#x000b1; 15.65 years) were followed for the control of the gastric pH. On each of the 14 trial days the mean of the gastric pH alteration was significantly higher in omeprazole and pantoprazole suspension-treated patients than in IV pantoprazole-treated patients (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Omeprazole and pantoprazole oral suspension are more effective than IV pantoprazole in increasing the gastric pH.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Gastrointestinal bleeding</kwd><kwd>omeprazole</kwd><kwd>pantoprazole</kwd><kwd>stress-related mucosal disease</kwd><kwd>suspension</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stress-related mucosal damage can be turned up in almost 100% of the patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) and may be developed within 24 h after admission.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The incidence of clinically important gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, indicated as overt bleeding complicated by hemodynamic instability, low hemoglobin, and/or need for blood transfusion from stress-related mucosal disease (SRMD) is 3.5% in the ICU patients who are mechanically ventilated for &#x02265; 48 h.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In addition, this type of ulceration is accompanied by increasing the risk of mortality. Moreover, it prolongs the length of stay in the ICU.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Although ischemia of the gastric mucosa leads to SRMD, the significant role of gastric acid in the development of mucosal damage and bleeding could not be ignored.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Thus, early preventive prophylaxis of the probable GI bleeding, by means of acid-reducing agents, in these patients is rational.</p><p>Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the most potent and long-lasting medications used for this purpose. It is now generally believed that the aim of acid suppression as the prophylaxis of SRMD is to maintain gastric pH above 4.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Omeprazole, which is the first member of the PPI class, is commercially available as a delayed-release capsule and is formulated as enteric-coated granules to be protected against acid degradation. This formulation of oral PPIs put constraints on their usage in critically ill-patients who are NPO and unable to swallow the solid forms of drugs and those who experience an alteration in GI function after major surgery.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] An alternative method of delivery that allows an aqueous administration, while protecting the intact drug from acid degradation, is omeprazole suspension. Omeprazole suspension, which is administered to critically ill-patients on mechanical ventilation, has been shown to prevent upper GI bleeding as well as maintaining gastric pH above 5.5.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The anti-secretory effect of intravenous (IV) pantoprazole, another drug of this family, has been shown in several studies.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Pantoprazole is chemically more stable than other PPIs in higher pH conditions. It also provides earlier healing and superior pain relief in peptic ulcer and gastroesophageal reflux disease compared with omeprazole or histamine 2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs).[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of an extemporaneously formulated pantoprazole suspension, omeprazole suspension and commercially available IV pantoprazole on the gastric pH of critically ill-patients. The secondary objective was to assess the incidence of upper GI bleeding and ventilator-associated pneumonia in the ICU patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>The inclusion criteria were as follow: Patients older than 16 years old who were admitted to medical and surgical ICUs of National Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases (NRITLD) with an anticipated stay of longer than 72 h.

A 40 mg pantoprazole enteric-coated tablet triturated into a homogeny powder.

They observed that the omeprazole suspension increased gastric pH more than 7.1, maintained gastric pH &#x0003e; 5.5 and prevented clinically significant upper GI bleeding without increasing the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] These findings are completely in line with Lasky <italic>et al</italic>. study on 60 participants who assessed the effect of omeprazole suspension in preventing clinically significant upper GI bleeding and in preventing stress ulcers in mechanically ventilated trauma patients.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>In a randomized, double-blind trial, Conrad <italic>et al</italic>. found that immediate-release omeprazole oral suspension is more effective than a continuous infusion of cimetidine in increasing gastric pH and in preventing upper GI bleeding of critically ill patients.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In a smaller, un-blinded, randomized trial Levy <italic>et al</italic>. compared omeprazole with ranitidine in 67 patients who had risk factors for stress ulcer-related bleeding. Results showed significantly more clinically important upper GI bleeding in the ranitidine group than in the omeprazole group due to the inadequate pH control in the ranitidine-treated patients.</p><p>This satisfying control of gastric pH by omeprazole and pantoprazole oral suspension, without facing increased rate of pneumonia; which was previously reported by other studies,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] could be due to the presence of sodium bicarbonate in the extemporaneous formulation. Although enteric-coating is dissolved by bicarbonate, the alkaline properties of omeprazole suspension appear to protect omeprazole by passing through the stomach and actually aid in the initial control of gastric pH by acting as an antacid. The sodium bicarbonate with pH of 8.4 may stimulate the activation of parietal cells. Such stimulation may improve the pharmacodynamics of the drug by synchronizing the contact time of omeprazole with parietal cells activation.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>We used nonsterile hospital pharmacy manufacturing service at Pharmaceutical Care Department, NRITLD in order to prepare a prescribed medication (omeprazole or pantoprazole as their commercially available dosage form) for individualized patients who are NPO. Thus, they are unable to swallow the solid forms of the drugs.</p><p>An interesting finding of the current study is the control of gastric pH after the first dose of the administered drug in the majority (83.6%) of patients. Average time to achieve mean pH alteration bigger than 1 was 1.24 &#x000b1; 0.61 days for the total population. It can be concluded from the recent data that there might be no need to pH monitoring after the day 1.</p><p>The current study used an expanded definition for upper GI bleeding. Despite broadening the range of the definition application, which includes even minor self-limited bleeding and bleeding-related to a nasogastric tube trauma, only three patients (5.36%) experienced protocol-defined upper GI bleeding. Two of those who met our secondary end point of upper GI bleeding were among IV pantoprazole-treated patients, and the other one was among the omeprazole suspension group. No significant difference in preventive upper GI bleeding has been indicated between three groups.</p><p>It has been noted that raising gastric pH &#x02265; 4 could be a risk factor for the development of nosocomial pneumonia. Increasing intragastric pH may allow bacterial (especially Gram-negative bacilli) proliferation in the duodenum and subsequently endotracheal colonization.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] However, the clinical trials do not seem to support this hypothesis. A double-blind multi-center study that assessed the effect of sucralfate and ranitidine in 1200 critically ill-patients revealed no significant increase in nosocomial pneumonia with ranitidine although it showed a significant decrease in upper GI bleeding with the H2RA.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Despite higher mean gastric pH values in omeprazole and pantoprazole suspension group in comparison with IV pantoprazole-treated patients, we found no significant difference in the rate of nosocomial pneumonia among three treatment groups. Our results are in accord with the finding: As yet, no relation between the type of acid-reducing agent and the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia has been found.</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title/><sec id="sec3-9"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>(1) Due to several inclusion criteria to meet, we were not able to expand the sample size.
