Whilst there are many positive aspects of improved survival, breast cancer survival is associated with many long-term health and psychosocial sequelae. Engaging in regular physical activity post-diagnosis can reduce this burden. Despite this evidence, the majority of breast cancer survivors do not engage in regular physical activity. The challenge is to provide breast cancer survivors with appealing and effective physical activity support in a sustainable and cost-effective way. This article describes the protocol for the <italic>Move More for Life</italic> Study, which aims to assess the relative efficacy of two promising theory-based, print interventions designed to promote regular physical activity amongst breast cancer survivors.</p></sec><sec><title>Method and design</title><p>Breast cancer survivors were recruited from across Australia. Participants will be randomised into one of three groups: (1) A tailored-print intervention group, (2) a targeted-print intervention group, or (3) a standard recommendation control group. Participants in the tailored-print intervention group will receive 3 tailored newsletters in the mail over a three month period. Participants in the targeted-print group will receive a previously developed physical activity guidebook designed specifically for breast cancer survivors immediately after baseline. Participants in the standard recommendation control will receive a brochure detailing the physical activity guidelines for Australian adults. All participants will be assessed at baseline, and at 4 and 10 months post-baseline. Intervention efficacy for changing the primary outcomes (mins/wk aerobic physical activity; sessions/exercises per week resistance physical activity) and secondary outcomes (steps per day, health-related quality life, compliance with physical activity guidelines, fatigue) will be assessed. Mediation and moderation analyses will also be conducted.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Given the growing number of cancer survivors, distance-based behaviour change programs addressing physical activity have the potential to make a significant public health impact.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) identifier: ACTRN12611001061921</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Due to earlier detection and advances in treatment, more and more women are surviving breast cancer each year
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Whilst improved survival is duly welcomed, breast cancer survivors are faced with both short and long-term health and psychosocial sequelae
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], including fatigue, reductions in physical and cognitive functioning, reductions in bone health, lymphedema, weight gain and mood disturbances
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Compared to the general (non-cancer) population, breast cancer survivors are at an increased risk of co-morbid chronic conditions and death from both cancer and non-cancer causes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. As such, there is a growing need for effective cancer recovery services that can help to improve the quality of life of breast cancer survivors and negate the associated health burdens and risks
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>One promising cancer recovery strategy is the promotion of regular physical activity (PA)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Evidence from health outcome trials suggests that regular PA can address both the psychological and physiological burdens presented after breast cancer diagnosis and treatment
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, observational research suggests that regular PA may also have an impact on survival, with breast cancer survivors who are active after treatment having a lower risk of cancer recurrence, co-morbidities and death from all causes compared to those who are less active, regardless of cancer stage
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In recognition of these benefits, detailed exercise prescription guidelines for cancer survivors have been published by professional bodies in both Australia and North America
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>There is also new evidence that addressing the pattern of activity is important, with unique metabolic consequences associated with prolonged sedentary behaviour, regardless of total activity time
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Despite this evidence, the majority of breast cancer survivors are not sufficiently active for health
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and efforts to encourage regular PA and reductions in sitting time are not a routine part of the cancer treatment or rehabilitation process
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Whilst over 70 PA intervention studies have been conducted with cancer survivors, the majority have been atheoretical face-to-face programs conducted during the treatment phase
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Whilst these interventions have been efficacious in improving important outcomes for cancer survivors, there is a need for more sustainable, less resource intensive approaches that can support survivors beyond the initial treatment phase
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Such programs should be grounded in behaviour change theory, and address the unique determinants of PA adoption and maintenance in the post-treatment breast cancer population
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relative efficacy of two promising distance-based approaches (targeted and tailored print interventions) for promoting PA among post-treatment breast cancer survivors compared to a standard recommendation control group. In targeted-print interventions, irrelevant information is reduced by providing individuals with materials targeted to a particular subgroup they belong to (e.g., breast cancer survivors)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In tailored-print interventions, computer technology is utilised to provide individuals with personalised advice based on information specific to them (derived from individual assessment)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Both approaches have been put forth as low-cost, evidence-based alternatives to resource intensive face-to-face programs
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], but little information exists about the relative efficacy and the cost/benefit of these approaches in the physical activity domain.</p><p>Some theories of information processing, such as The Elaboration Likelihood Model
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], suggest that people are more likely to process information in a way that is conducive to behaviour change, if it is personally relevant to them. Based on this model, we hypothesise that individuals randomised into either the targeted or tailored print groups will experience significantly greater improvements at each timepoint on all primary and secondary outcomes compared to the standard recommendation control group. Furthermore, given the greater level of personalisation of materials in the tailored-print condition, we expect participants in the tailored-print group to experience greater improvements across PA outcomes compared to participants in the targeted-print group. This hypothesis relies on the assumption that breast cancer survivors are a somewhat heterogeneous group in terms of determinants (i.e., demographics, social-cognitive and ecological factors) of PA behaviour change.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>This study is a nationally-based, three-arm randomised controlled trial (RCT), testing the relative efficacy of two distance-based PA interventions (tailored and targeted print) compared to a standard recommendation control group.

All potential participants were required to complete a physical activity readiness questionnaire (PAR-Q;
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]), to screen participants and identify those requiring review from their doctor prior to study enrolment.</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment</title><p>Participants were recruited using convenience sampling methods from a range of sources across Australia. Specifically, this involved (1) asking organisations (e.g., The Breast Cancer Network Australia, The Cancer Council, YWCA Encore) and health professionals (e.g., breast care nurses) with direct contact with breast cancer survivors to disseminate information about the study on behalf of the research team; (2) promoting the study at events potentially relevant to eligible participants (e.g. breast cancer forums); and (3) snowballing recruitment (inviting participants to pass on study information to potentially eligible friends and acquaintances).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Randomisation</title><p>The randomisation sequence will be generated by a statistician (PM) using SAS 9.2 statistical software. An equal number of participants will be randomised to each group (1:1:1) using a randomised block design, with a block size of six, to ensure the study groups are balanced
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>Participants, identified only by their ID number, will be randomised by an administrative staff member into groups upon receipt of their baseline survey.

Participant blinding is not possible due to the difference in delivery schedule of the two interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical power and sample size</title><p>The study&#x02019;s primary analysis will be the comparison of self-reported PA behaviour (i.e. mins/week of aerobic exercise and sessions/week of resistance training) between the three groups, from baseline to the 4 month time-point. Assuming a small-moderate correlation (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.4) between baseline and post-intervention, to detect a mean difference of 0.5 standard deviation between study groups (small-medium effect size) for the main dependent outcome (i.e., PA behaviour) at post-intervention
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] the required sample size is 100 participants per group, allowing for a 20% loss to follow-up (power&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.80; alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01). An alpha of 0.01 was used to adjust for multiple comparisons.</p><p>As a secondary consideration, we also ensured that this sample size would be adequate to detect a clinically significant change in step counts per day (2000 steps per day
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], standard deviation of 3500
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]) and found that we would be adequately powered to detect meaningful changes in both self-report and objective PA outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>A pen-and-paper questionnaire is completed at baseline, 4 months post baseline (immediate post- tailored intervention follow-up), and 10 months post-baseline (7 month post tailored-intervention follow-up).

An example item includes: &#x0201c;how personally relevant was the health information you received&#x0201d; (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;not at all relevant to 5&#x02009;=&#x02009;very relevant). The open ended question provides participants with a chance to make comments about the intervention materials.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedure</title><p>Potential participants were asked to contact the project co-ordinator to express their interest in participating in the study. Potential participants were then provided with an information statement and a consent form and asked to return it to the project team within two weeks. Information was resent at two weeks if no response was received.</p><p>Participants will be asked to complete a pen-and-paper questionnaire, wear a pedometer for seven days and complete a pen-and-paper step count diary at baseline, four and ten months from baseline (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Participants will be instructed to return the pedometer with the written materials using a reply paid envelope as soon as possible after each assessment period is complete. Participants who do not return the baseline questionnaire, and step count diary and pedometer within two weeks will receive one reminder call from the project co-ordinator. Participants who do not return the assessment materials within three weeks after this reminder call will be excluded from the trial.</p><p>Upon receipt of the baseline questionnaire, an administrative assistant will allocate participants using the ID number written on the questionnaire into one of three groups using the randomly generated allocation sequence provided by the statistician. Participants will be sent intervention or standard recommendation materials within three weeks of allocation.</p><p>Participants in the tailored-print intervention group will be sent additional intervention materials at 6 weeks and 12 weeks post baseline and update cards (3-item update card), 4 weeks and 8 weeks post base-line and asked to return them to the research team using a reply paid envelope within 7 days. Participants in the standard recommendation group will receive one tailored newsletter and a pdf version of the targeted guidebook after completion of the10 month follow-up survey (Figure

This guidebook was developed for use and evaluated in a previous study
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>] and has been described in detail elsewhere
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]<italic>.</italic> We made minor changes to the guidebook to adapt it to an Australian audience (e.g. substituting photos and text relating to snow).</p></sec><sec><title>Tailored-print intervention</title><p>Participants randomised into this group will be mailed three Social Cognitive Theory-based
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>] computer-tailored newsletters over a 12 week period (6 weeks apart). Each newsletter will be four A4 pages in length and will provide advice and feedback unique to the individual that relates to key determinants of PA adoption and maintenance among breast cancer survivors (as stipulated by previous research in the field
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>] and Social Cognitive Theory
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>]). The advice participants receive will be tailored using information derived from individual assessments at baseline, and &#x02018;update cards&#x02019; (assessing PA and goal setting behaviour over the last month) sent to participants (in this group only) at 4 weeks and 8 weeks post-baseline. In each case, participants will be mailed the tailored-newsletters within two weeks after the completed assessment is received (see Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><p><italic>Newsletter 1 (N1)</italic> will include information on the Australian PA guidelines for cancer survivors (non-tailored), tailored feedback on PA behaviour (aerobic, resistance and sitting time) relative to the guidelines, information about the beneficial outcomes of PA, safety advice and an action planning activity. An activity planner and exercise illustrations (stretches and resistance training exercises) will also be included.</p><p><italic>Newsletter 2 (N2)</italic> will include expert advice from a behaviour change expert (non-tailored), feedback on PA performance (aerobic, resistance and sitting time) relative to N1, a testimonial illustrating success, advice on eliciting social support and an action planning activity.</p><p><italic>Newsletter 3 (N3)</italic> will include expert advice from an exercise physiologist (non-tailored), tailored feedback on PA performance (aerobic, resistance and sitting time) relative to N2 and N1, advice on restructuring the physical environment, information about available support services and an action planning activity.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>]. The guidelines stipulate that Australian adults should: (1) think of movement as an opportunity; (2) be active every day in as many ways as you can; (3) do 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity on most, preferably all days; and (4) if manageable, do vigorous activity for extra health benefit.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>]. Namely, the primary analysis will be conducted using all observed data (i.e., a completers analysis) and sensitivity analyses (accounting for all randomised participants) will be conducted to explore the impact of missing data
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>]. Differences between treatment groups in the primary outcome measures (i.e. the two PA scores) 4 months after randomisation will be tested using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA). The outcome in the model will be the subjects physical activity score at 4 months and the predictors will be treatment group and baseline value of the physical activity score. In the analysis of each of the two PA measures, if the p-value for the treatment group is less than 0.025 (adjusted to account for the two primary PA analyses) then post hoc tests of the 3 pair wise comparisons will be undertaken to determine which treatment groups are different. Socio-cognitive and QOL measures will also be analysed using ANCOVA models. The study&#x02019;s primary analysis will be the comparison of PA behaviour between the three groups, from baseline to the 4 month time-point. Secondary analyses will examine the PA behaviour change between the study groups across the other study time-point (i.e., 10 months). A mediation analysis on the employed social-cognitive variables will also be conducted to explore the causal mechanism of any intervention effects. Planned subgroup analyses include age, PA status at baseline, time since treatment, BMI, built environment, and co-morbidity status.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will test the relative efficacy of two theory-based PA behaviour change interventions. In doing so, this study will address a seminal research question in distance-based patient-centred care &#x02013; is tailoring or targeting health education messages a more efficacious approach to health behaviour change in the PA domain? Furthermore, this study will be one of the first to promote a pattern of PA that addresses the metabolic consequences of unbroken sedentary behaviours and the advantages of completing both aerobic and resistance-training exercises. The limitations reported in previous research will be addressed by examining adherence after the intervention period and by utilising an objective measure of PA behaviour (i.e., pedometers). Finally, this study will add to the behaviour change literature by addressing the paucity of knowledge surrounding determinants of PA behaviour change among cancer survivors and potential mediators of intervention effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>ELJ and CES conceived the study.
